1987.86-1753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.996,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 86-1753, John Doe against the United States."
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,12.519,20.016,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,72.621,72.811,Excuse me.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,75.793,76.364,The--
1987.86-1753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,76.364,79.078,The foreign bank secrecy laws?
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,79.078,91.748,"--No, Your Honor, it's not binding, and, in fact, it may not even be pertinent, but the Government feels that it would be helpful in obtaining the records in a show cause proceeding against the banks in the United States."
1987.86-1753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,91.748,103.846,But you could seek to compel the banks to do it despite those foreign laws and take some action against the domestic subsidiaries of the bank?
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,103.846,104.567,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-1753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,221.689,224.13,But what's the testimonial about that?
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,224.13,261.192,"Mr. Chief Justice, our contention is that the Fifth Amendment test is not whether the statement is testimonial in the narrow sense that the Government argues; that is, that it gives the Government information that is directly relevant to the case or could be used as leads; but the test that this Court has used in every case and that is the rational in every case is whether the compelled statement is testimonial or communicative as opposed to a non-communicative act or, in the case of a handwriting exemplar or voice print, a statement that isn't intended to be used for its content in any way."
1987.86-1753,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,261.192,271.581,"Mr. Timbie, if the scene were changed, say, to the State of Colorado, would these records be available?"
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,271.581,272.633,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1987.86-1753,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,272.633,280.827,"Suppose Colorado passed a law saying they passed a bank secrecy act, would it be constitutional?"
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,280.827,286.721,I would assume not.
1987.86-1753,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,290.214,294.706,"So, it's foreign venue that really is the sticker here."
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,301.541,307.656,The record discloses that Doe was involved in international oil trading business.
1987.86-1753,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,307.656,327.267,"If one walks down the streets of Nassau, which is foreign bank after foreign bank, and I haven't been in the Cayman Islands, but I suppose it's the same reason, is... are they there because they are refugees for what, tainted money?"
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,327.267,344.108,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, they are there for all sorts of reasons, of course, but we feel that the problem... there is obviously a concern that the Government has in this case that it is unable under certain circumstances to obtain records of those foreign accounts."
1987.86-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,399.05,411.567,"Mr. Timbie, taking Justice Blackmun's question about a Colorado bank one step further, supposing your client had a safe deposit box in the Colorado bank and the Government wanted the key, could they get it from him?"
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,411.567,414.739,That's an interesting question.
1987.86-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,420.285,421.054,Very similar to this case.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,421.054,425.738,"--in John Doe, but setting that aside, yes, they could, and they could because they were using a means--"
1987.86-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,425.738,425.969,But would you set that aside?
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,429.472,432.404,"--Oh, no, I certainly wouldn't, but I thought you were asking a more general question as to--"
1987.86-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,432.404,435.276,Whether they could require him to deliver the key.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,435.276,438.638,--They could certainly give him acts of production immunity and require delivery.
1987.86-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,438.638,438.818,"No, no."
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,438.818,439.689,Or if they knew--
1987.86-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,439.689,441.241,Without giving any kind of immunity.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,441.241,450.048,"--If they knew to a certainty that the key existed and they had it, they could make him give it and that's because he would not be required to communicate in any way in order to fulfill the order of the court."
1987.86-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,450.048,453.381,They could just subpoena the key and he'd have to respond to the subpoena by delivering it?
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,453.381,464.029,Unless he could establish in a Huffman hearing that the Government would be learning of the existence of the key or of his possession of it and that fact would be incriminating under the Fisher rational.
1987.86-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,465.048,467.462,"Well, don't we assume here the Government already knows about the accounts?"
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,467.462,467.632,Yes.
1987.86-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,467.632,468.06,Yeah.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,468.411,469.372,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1987.86-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,470.614,470.885,Yes.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,470.885,473.098,The Government knows about eleven accounts.
1987.86-1753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,499.077,519.77,"What if the Government... let's say nothing is as esoteric as this situation, it's a murder investigation, the Government issues a subpoena to a prospective indictee, subpoena all the guns in your possession, now can he defend against that on the grounds that producing guns might incriminate him?"
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,519.77,548.859,"The answer to your question lies not in... I don't think lies in the issue before the Court today, but in the extent to which the Court would extend Fisher and how the court views the act of production rational, I could argue that if the Government didn't know to a certainty that he possessed any guns, and the fact that he possessed any gun would be incriminating under the circumstances, that Fisher should be extended to that."
1987.86-1753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,548.859,553.731,But Fisher didn't hold that there was any significance to the act of production.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,557.364,557.594,Excuse me.
1987.86-1753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,559.737,562.749,And Doe devoted about one paragraph to it.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,562.749,569.902,--My reading of Doe... I'm not sure I understand the point that you're making.
1987.86-1753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,569.902,575.097,"Well, my question is that the idea you're pumping for may not be as well established as you think it is."
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,575.097,578.019,We don't feel that it's established by Fisher and Doe.
1987.86-1753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,580.593,585.816,"Prior to Fisher, where did it exist?"
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,585.816,634.74,"--It existed in the so-called physical evidence cases in which, beginning with the Holt case back in 1910, Justice Holmes announced a boundary to the Fifth Amendment in terms of a requirement that the Government not compel a witness or an accused to provide any form of testimony or conduct that would be testimonial or communicative, and, in fact, Justice Holmes' word was ""communicative conduct"" as opposed to a demonstration of physical characteristics, and subsequent cases, like Schmerber and Dionisio, Gilbert and Wade, have all applied that line and, in fact, have described protected conduct as conduct that is testimonial or communicative in any way."
1987.86-1753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,634.74,641.785,Don't you think they mean communicative to the fact-finder at the trial and not communicative to anyone in the world?
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,660.959,661.408,Right.
1987.86-1753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.408,676.698,"But you would say that even if they gave immunity, they could not require him to tell the guard it's all right to let these investigators in to get into my safe deposit box."
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,686.899,688.388,The line I'm drawing--
1987.86-1753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,688.388,689.27,Because that's communicative.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,689.27,700.208,"--is that he cannot be made to speak such that the Government would use the content of his speech to obtain incriminating evidence unless that compelled speech is, in fact, immunized."
1987.86-1753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.538,705.822,"You think that's a reasonable line between giving the key and telling the guard, let these people in?"
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,705.822,708.122,--The key hypothetical is an extraordinary one.
1987.86-1753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.747,729.688,"No, not to use at trial."
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,732.088,739.214,"--Well, no, not to use at a trial, but if there's a potential for using it at trial, obviously that's an independent basis for finding Fifth Amendment violations."
1987.86-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,779.791,781.373,"Well, may I ask another question then?"
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,798.955,800.114,"--Oh, absolutely."
1987.86-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,815.836,819.278,Not only... they could use it to gather evidence that might incriminate him.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,821.912,825.175,"That's what Gilbert... that's what Schmerber says, certainly."
1987.86-1753,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,875.768,883.956,"--Mr. Timbie, what actual potential use of the form do you say is testimonial here?"
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,883.956,890.221,"There are two uses and, in fact, there are principal and alternative arguments in the case."
1987.86-1753,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,903.19,909.164,"Well, why isn't that much like taking blood or getting the handwriting sample?"
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,909.164,931.15,"In the words of Schmerber, blood and handwriting samples are sought for their physical characteristics, not for any compelled communication they might entail, whereas that is sought for a compelled communication, and I recognize that there's no direct authority that can be cited that would cause the Court to choose between the Government's line and our line, but I would--"
1987.86-1753,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,931.15,934.315,Direct authority meaning physical evidence in a sense?
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,934.315,934.683,--Surely.
1987.86-1753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.683,941.709,"Mr. Timbie, in the absence of any direct authority, maybe we're compelled to fall back upon the language of the Fifth Amendment."
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,968.678,980.568,"Justice Scalia, I would submit, respectfully, that if this Court were to fall back on the language of the Fifth Amendment, it would have to overrule a great deal of precedent in addition to not following--"
1987.86-1753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,980.568,981.548,Why is that?
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,981.548,996.878,"--Because the language of the Fifth Amendment suggests that what we're concerned about here is compelled confessions, and the reason... the initial reason that compelled-confessions were considered inappropriate was that they're untrustworthy and unseemingly."
1987.86-1753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,996.878,1005.293,But it's easy to extend it to any testimonial utterance by the defendant that can be used against him at trial.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1009.256,1022.777,"Well, and then the Court has then gone on to say that under Kastigar, the Fifth Amendment would require that in addition, any leads that came out of the testimony would have to be protected and any evidence derived directly or indirectly from it."
1987.86-1753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1025.09,1028.99,"Once you establish the violation, there are all sorts of fruits of the tree that also fall out."
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1040.28,1046.923,I can't argue that there is a compelling logical reason why the line has to be drawn where we suggest.
1987.86-1753,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1149.094,1159.318,"Well, Mr. Timbie, don't you suppose the due process clause addresses some of your concerns about other potential uses to which the Government's logic might lead?"
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1159.318,1162.16,--There may well be an overlap between due process--
1987.86-1753,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1162.16,1162.31,Yeah.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1167.353,1168.004,"--Pardon me, ma'am."
1987.86-1753,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1168.505,1175.55,I wanted to know what testimonial use of the consent form you're relying on here.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1175.55,1176.682,I am very sorry.
1987.86-1753,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1176.682,1177.472,"Well, you were interrupted."
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1181.095,1188.631,"I said, in our view, the mere presentation of the document to the bank is a testimonial use because it's a use of content."
1987.86-1753,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1244.689,1250.273,"--Well, I assume the Government could take care of that by simply redrafting the order."
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1250.273,1254.304,I am not sure how that would be possible.
1987.86-1753,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1254.304,1266.122,"Well, we could play around with the words, I suppose, but it would say without acknowledging that I have control, you are authorized to release any accounts over which I do have control."
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1266.122,1266.443,No.
1987.86-1753,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1340.595,1341.166,"Well, we can argue about that."
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1341.166,1342.205,--says it wouldn't have probative value.
1987.86-1753,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1342.205,1344.148,It seems to me that that's the act of the bank.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1363.709,1364.97,That is--
1987.86-1753,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1364.97,1375.577,That's another way of asking whether or not the Fifth Amendment has another ingredient and that is that the accused simply can't be asked to do too much to make the case against him.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1375.577,1399.002,"--I would have to say that in our view, the traditional Fifth Amendment rule is that too much and communication are the same thing, that the Court has said too much in terms of production of physical evidence, giving blood samples, being forced to speak in your own voice in a line-up and repeat what was said, that's a lot."
1987.86-1753,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1537.367,1541.16,I'm not sure the Government... that it would be all right to do that.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1545.214,1552.64,"That's correct, and then they would order that the defendants in the ultimate indictment would have to come up with some trickery rational to preclude it."
1987.86-1753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.827,1567.28,"It seems to me that, too, Mr. Timbie, but are you sure it's the Fifth Amendment that makes it bad?"
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1572.141,1575.023,You're suggesting there's a jurisdiction problem?
1987.86-1753,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1575.023,1582.209,I am saying there's some limit to what the Government can do to enlist anybody in its investigations.
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1594.808,1613.62,"If you're suggesting that there would be a jurisdiction problem in a District Court issuing such an order, I would agree and we made that argument below and the Fifth Circuit ruled there was jurisdiction for this prosecutor or John Doe to assist the Government in its investigation in that way, even though the controversy was between the banks and the Government."
1987.86-1753,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1629.853,1635.168,"Mr. Timbie, do you have any comment on the amicus brief that was filed by Rex Lee?"
1987.86-1753,0,40607,richard_e_timbie,,1635.168,1650.637,"My only comment is, as I said earlier in the argument, the issue... there's a sham quality to what's going on here, and I think that that is pointed out in the amicus brief."
1987.86-1753,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.437,1695.926,"Thank you, Mr. Timbie."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1697.788,1701.011,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1761.823,1765.906,It really doesn't waive the protection as was just pointed out.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1792.824,1795.816,"Well, let me say several things in response to that, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-1753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1906.594,1915.979,"Mr. Rothfeld, do you take the position that the Government can introduce into evidence for any purpose whatever the consent form?"
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1915.979,1919.362,"Let me answer that question in two parts, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-1753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1923.485,1925.567,Against the person signing it?
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1925.567,1933.763,"--We think that if the Government were to do so, it would not present any Fifth Amendment problem, and I'll explain that later on."
1987.86-1753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1939.439,1941.179,You take the position that it could not--
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1941.179,1942.639,--Not for Fifth Amendment reasons.
1987.86-1753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1946.412,1949.844,--But the Fifth Amendment doesn't prohibit introduction--
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1949.844,1949.994,That's right.
1987.86-1753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1949.994,1950.645,--in your view?
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1950.645,1951.156,That's correct.
1987.86-1753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1951.156,1953.537,Even for authentication?
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1953.537,1974.07,"Well, as I suggest, we don't think it would happen, but, no, we do not think the Fifth Amendment would prohibit if someone could possibly imagine a situation in which the bank consent form were introduced, and I think that that comes clear from the nature of the Fifth Amendment guarantee that the Petitioner is trying to call upon here."
1987.86-1753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2043.366,2058.166,"But if the consent form were to be offered to establish that these are the records, the bank records, belonging to the Defendant, I find it hard to understand why that wouldn't be testimonial."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2058.166,2073.525,"Well, if a bank produces records in response to a subpoena accompanied by a consent form, the bank may be making an implicit statement that it thinks the records, as Justice Kennedy suggested, that it thinks the records belong to the suspect."
1987.86-1753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2082.242,2088.937,"But if the Government introduces the consent form, then perhaps it is the suspect who is making the statement."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2088.937,2089.958,"--Well, I don't think so, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-1753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2120.029,2125.703,Do you have to resort then to saying this is a verbal act to say it isn't testimonial?
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2125.703,2127.554,We don't think we have to resort to it.
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2149.519,2164.118,"Supposing that instead of getting a court order, you'd lock him up for long enough to persuade... the police had locked him up long enough to persuade him to sign this document, didn't beat him up, but used a course of tactics to get him to sign it, would that violate the Fifth Amendment?"
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2164.118,2167.861,"Well, I don't think it would violate the Fifth Amendment, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2167.861,2168.302,Could they do it?
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2168.302,2169.373,Probably not.
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2169.373,2170.063,Why not?
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2170.063,2172.436,I think that one of the problems--
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.436,2173.425,Why couldn't they do it?
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2173.425,2177.639,"--Well, I would thank that there would be potentially due process problems."
1987.86-1753,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2179.121,2180.611,I didn't hear your answer.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2181.322,2184.844,I think there may be due process problems in locking someone up until they--
1987.86-1753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2184.844,2188.355,"Well, it's done all the time."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2188.355,2196.822,--If the Government were to take someone without any court process whatsoever and simply throw them in jail for months on end until they did sign it.
1987.86-1753,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2196.822,2197.511,No.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2204.717,2204.907,That's--
1987.86-1753,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2204.907,2207.418,"You're saying it's valid, So, we can enforce it."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2207.418,2208.189,--That's quite right.
1987.86-1753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2229.965,2234.028,"Well, what would prevent the Government from doing the parade of horribles suggested?"
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2234.028,2234.837,"Well, there are a variety of things."
1987.86-1753,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2285.551,2315.071,"Let me ask you this question, counsel, and then I hesitate to introduce a new hypothetical, but suppose in the routine criminal misdemeanor case involving a traffic offense, where the ownership of the vehicle is clearly established and admitted, and the defendant's custody of the key is admitted, the court says that tomorrow, on the second day of the trial, you drive your car down here so we can inspect it, is that permissible?"
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2315.071,2315.732,I would think so.
1987.86-1753,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2316.233,2318.767,Have you ever heard of an order such as that?
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2318.767,2341.152,"--Well, I think this is harking back to the Justice Stevens safe deposit box hypothetical, and I think that if the possession of the material, the evidence, whatever, in the suspect's hands is a foregone conclusion in the words of Fisher, requiring the suspect to perform the act of it is not incriminating."
1987.86-1753,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2345.296,2348.767,Just stick with so far as the one I gave you.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2357.184,2360.698,--It may be that I'm not understanding.
1987.86-1753,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2360.698,2367.001,"And we're assuming that there's no issue of his ownership, there's no issue of his possession of the key."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2367.001,2378.62,Our position is compelling someone to produce something when there is leaving aside of the testimonial aspects attendant upon the act of production.
1987.86-1753,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2429.944,2442.002,"Would you acknowledge that orders such as the one I have hypothesized are not routine and, in fact, are almost unknown in our jurisprudence in the United States?"
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2442.002,2446.337,--Orders requiring the accused to produce--
1987.86-1753,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2446.337,2453.459,Orders requiring the accused to produce evidence over which he has control where his control and ownership is not disputed.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2453.459,2468.709,"--Well, I think typically there are disputes as to whether or not the act of production will lead to courts drawing... will have any testimonial component that is incriminating."
1987.86-1753,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2511.927,2530.169,"Well, Mr. Rothfeld, if there is no testimonial component and you're satisfied that the Government would not offer it for any testimonial purpose, why not give limited use immunity to protect against any testimonial component that might be thought to be present?"
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2530.169,2538.775,"Well, I am not sure that I can give you a compelling answer to that, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2569.719,2572.439,"On that point, let me be sure I understand your position."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2600.459,2605.284,"--Well, we have to... in any investigation of this sort, we have to have some idea of where those records are."
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.556,2610.79,"Well, what about my hypothetical?"
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2610.79,2615.121,"Well, if we just simply had a general idea--"
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2615.121,2624.197,"You know he has a bank account in the Cayman Islands and there are fourteen banks there, so you ask him to sign a general consent that would be given authority to go in any one of the fourteen."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2624.197,2626.841,"--Well, I don't think that would be a Fifth Amendment problem in that."
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2630.302,2635.496,"Well, his execution of that document would certainly lead to the discovery of evidence he couldn't otherwise get."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2635.496,2640.429,"--That's true, but I don't think... t court has made quite clear that is not the problem under the Fifth Amendment."
1987.86-1753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2641.461,2646.485,"Tell us what it's a problem with because I'm troubled with some of these hypotheticals, too."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2666.497,2671.18,"--Well, I'm not sure why you feel bad about it, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2689.633,2700.392,"Yes, but the objection that the man would make in Justice Kennedy's example, you go get the car yourself, I don't have to make... you cannot compel me to help try your lawsuit."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2700.392,2701.0,"Well,--"
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2701.0,2703.232,"That's basically what he's saying, I don't want to drive it down for you."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2704.612,2705.113,"--Well, again,--"
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2705.113,2707.156,That's a Fifth Amendment kind of argument.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2707.156,2709.137,"--Well, I don't think so, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2742.715,2747.697,Could a court compel his aunt to drive his car down?
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2749.39,2749.87,Well--
1987.86-1753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2749.87,2751.903,Issue an order compelling his aunt to drive the car.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2754.634,2755.335,"--Well, all--"
1987.86-1753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2755.335,2757.537,--You don't have to admit it's bad.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2763.701,2773.148,"--Whether or not I would feel funny about it, Justice Scalia, I don't think provides the answer to the Fifth Amendment question in this case."
1987.86-1753,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2776.731,2786.739,"The real testimony, all you want is for the bank to testify that the Petitioner has blank dollars on deposit."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2786.739,2790.882,"--All we want is for the bank to give us something, Justice."
1987.86-1753,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2790.882,2791.891,Is that testimony?
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2791.891,2792.381,If--
1987.86-1753,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2792.381,2793.881,That is testimony.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2793.881,2796.224,"--That is testimony, but that is the bank's testimony."
1987.86-1753,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2796.224,2797.123,Sir?
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2797.123,2799.416,"It is the bank's testimony, if anyone's."
1987.86-1753,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2799.416,2799.936,But it is testimony.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2801.037,2805.621,"Well, whether or not the bank records--"
1987.86-1753,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2805.621,2812.935,Tell me the difference in effectiveness before a jury as to whether the bank says it or he says it.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2812.935,2817.219,"--Well, there is a profound difference in the Fifth Amendment."
1987.86-1753,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2817.7,2822.384,Would the jury have any trouble if it was the bank's statement and not his?
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2822.384,2822.885,"--Well,--"
1987.86-1753,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2822.885,2826.228,Would you have any trouble as the prosecutor?
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2826.228,2836.316,"--The Court has made clear, Justice Marshall, that the crucial point is whether or not the witness is compelled to do something that is testimonial in nature."
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2940.345,2942.368,"On the aunt question, I'm not sure it would offend."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2953.627,2960.08,"Well, I think that involves a meeting of the All Writs Act or other jurisdictional provisions that I don't want to get into."
1987.86-1753,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2988.041,3002.062,"We have also said that the Fifth Amendment stands for the fact that we have an accusatorial system and not an inquisitorial system, but you think that's all dictum and there must be a testimonial component to the Act."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3002.062,3004.173,"Well, I don't think... I wouldn't characterize it as dictum."
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3021.385,3024.107,"Yes, but you know, it's a very interesting question."
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3040.369,3044.793,"Well, offhand, I'm not aware of any authority directly addressing that question, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3064.385,3079.356,"Mr. Rothfeld, are you asserting on behalf of the Government the power to get this individual to do because he's a defendant anything that you couldn't get the private individual to do who is not a defendant?"
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3098.039,3107.405,"Well, once again, I have to fall back on the proposition that that is not a question that's presented in this case because we think that in that situation, there would not be a Fifth Amendment problem."
1987.86-1753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3107.405,3110.427,I want some limitation upon what you can do to this defendant.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3110.427,3112.808,"Excuse me, Justice Marshall."
1987.86-1753,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3112.808,3117.212,Isn't one of these accounts in this case in another party's name?
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3117.212,3122.765,"They may be in the names of other parties, but we believe that they are controlled by the Petitioner and that's an important point."
1987.86-1753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3124.217,3125.938,You don't understand the point of my question.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3152.647,3152.887,--It is the first.
1987.86-1753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3190.917,3196.179,"You have gotten this order issued to someone who is not a defendant, yes or no, do you think?"
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3196.179,3208.558,"I'm not sure that I can answer that question, Justice Scalia, because that involves the meaning, I think, of the All Writs Act, which grants the Court jurisdiction to enter orders of this sort, which simply has not been addressed by the parties to this point."
1987.86-1753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3213.513,3231.705,"Can't you get an order for a landlady to open the door that has property belonging to the defendant, and if this much different from that, getting someone who controls the bank account to issue, if you think that there are illegal funds in the account?"
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3231.705,3264.997,"--In Fifth Amendment terms, I don't think that there is any distinction between... I understand the problem you are having, Justice Scalia, is that we concede there are all sorts of limitations on what the Government can do that are found elsewhere in the Constitution, elsewhere in the statutes and by negative implications, the lack of authority granted to the District Courts to compel people to do things, and it may be that in all of the hypotheticals that are presented by the Court, the Government won't be able to do it because it has no authority to do it or because some other constitutional provision keeps us from doing it."
1987.86-1753,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.997,3271.702,I am not inclined to say that you can do more to this defendant than you can do to an innocent third party by reason of the fact that he's a defendant.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3283.299,3283.86,That was--
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3283.86,3286.343,And that's really a little different than it might be if it were a state case.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3295.779,3296.55,--That was the foundation.
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3296.55,3298.64,And that's not before us.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3298.64,3300.032,That is not presented in this case.
1987.86-1753,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3300.032,3304.745,It may mean that the federal court has less authority in this area than the state court of general jurisdiction.
1987.86-1753,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3304.745,3306.197,"That may well be the case, Justice Stevens."
1987.86-1753,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3511.507,3512.757,"Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld."
1987.86-1753,2,40607,richard_e_timbie,,3515.03,3518.993,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1987.86-1753,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3568.388,3578.663,"Immunity wouldn't be any... you wouldn't say if the Government were to compel him to consent to a waiver of his attorney-client privilege, that would be all right if he were immunized?"
1987.86-1753,2,40607,richard_e_timbie,,3583.307,3593.322,"--I wholeheartedly agree, but what the Government is saying in this case is that you shouldn't look at this through a Fifth Amendment lens because it will be policed elsewhere."
1987.86-1753,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3644.988,3646.939,"Thank you, Mr. Timbie."
