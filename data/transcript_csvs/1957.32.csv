1957.32,0,17645,benjamin_gim,,290.433,298.837,"Well, Dr. Sussman who was a recognized expert and who was used by the Immigration Service said that there were enough errors in the report themselves."

1957.32,2,17645,benjamin_gim,,2924.489,2943.091,If I may be permitted to make a reply to the question I believe this Court has addressed to Mr. Davis on whether or not the -- what the Government doctor's position was on the accuracy of his blood test and I believe that it's found on page 216.
1957.32,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3004.8,3005.95,Now what doctor is that?

1957.32,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3239.8,3243.251,I should have taken out of Mr. Davis' time.
1957.32,2,17645,benjamin_gim,,3258.547,3260.008,Well I -- I (Voice Overlap) --
1957.32,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3260.008,3265.144,"I mean, it wasn't unclassified for purposes of this argument, was it?"
1957.32,2,17645,benjamin_gim,,3265.144,3266.973,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1957.32,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3331.437,3340.363,"Mr. Davis, would you answer Justice Frankfurter's question as to whether this was once classified and then declassified?"
1957.32,3,30073,john_f_davis,,3340.363,3362.88,"I have no specific information that it was ever -- whether it was ever classified or not but the distribution which appears, the last paragraph on the facing page provides for a general distribution, not a general distribution but for a distribution to places outside of the State Department and to many offices."
1957.32,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3365.979,3373.812,But you can answer if I take it explicitly that it was not unclassified for purposes abused by the Government (Voice Overlap) argued.
1957.32,3,30073,john_f_davis,,3373.812,3374.744,That is quite right.
1957.32,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3376.845,3378.533,"Declassified, I mean declassified."
