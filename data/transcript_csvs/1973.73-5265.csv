1973.73-5265,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.552,"We’ll hear arguments next in 73-5265, Kokoszka against Belford."
1973.73-5265,0,42335,thomas_r_adams,,67.62,71.181,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-5265,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,255.84,262.666,"(Inaudible) number of exemptions as a Voluntary Act, is it not?"
1973.73-5265,0,42335,thomas_r_adams,,262.666,277.402,"Yes, the designation of it, but he claimed the proper number of exemptions as he should do under the law, in order to approximately end up with either no tax refund check or no tax is due at the end of the year."
1973.73-5265,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,277.402,287.696,"Would the case be different in your estimation had he claimed, as he has a privilege of doing a number of exemptions that do not coincide with the facts?"
1973.73-5265,0,42335,thomas_r_adams,,287.696,305.766,"Yes, I do think the case would be different, because in that case, for example, if he had not claimed as many exemptions as we he was entitled to, the funding question would be similar to a savings account, he would have created a greater tax refund check."
1973.73-5265,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,866.813,874.99,"Connecticut, Connecticut, as I understand it doesn’t have any exemptions relevant to this case, is that right?"
1973.73-5265,0,42335,thomas_r_adams,,874.99,876.991,"Essentially, that’s right Mr. Justice."
1973.73-5265,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,884.942,906.411,"Well, let’s assume the Federal -- let’s assume that the Court decides against you, on both on your points i.e. that (a) the plaintiff have just completed arguing that the whole businesses is exempted or (b) that 75% is exempt under the federal statute."
1973.73-5265,0,42335,thomas_r_adams,,914.645,916.724,"To be honest, I am not sure."
1973.73-5265,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,928.523,928.856,So probably not.
1973.73-5265,0,42335,thomas_r_adams,,928.856,934.414,"I don’t think it would apply, but that would be a question interpretation of Connecticut law, which doesn’t presently exist."
1973.73-5265,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,938.811,945.644,And then of course it would be subject to construction as to whether or not a tax refund is the equivalent of wages too?
1973.73-5265,0,42335,thomas_r_adams,,945.644,949.515,There would a number of problems interpreting the Connecticut statute to get it to apply.
1973.73-5265,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,949.515,961.779,"But in any event, unlike many States, there isn’t as you submitted a state exemption statute that cuts much significance here at all, is it?"
1973.73-5265,0,42335,thomas_r_adams,,961.779,963.565,"That’s correct Your Honor, that’s correct."
1973.73-5265,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,978.928,980.733,"We dealt with that in Lines, you mentioned it."
1973.73-5265,0,42335,thomas_r_adams,,980.733,983.2,"Yes, you referred to it specifically."
1973.73-5265,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,983.2,992.253,"Mr. Adams you have cited the Eighth Circuit’s Gehrig case on the CCPA issue the Court was unanimously against you, was it not?"
1973.73-5265,0,42335,thomas_r_adams,,992.253,993.256,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-5265,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,993.256,998.733,"And, on the other, the main issue it was two to one in your favor?"
1973.73-5265,0,42335,thomas_r_adams,,998.733,999.926,Was it two to one?
1973.73-5265,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1187.225,1192.013,"Very well, Mr. Adams."
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,1194.721,1198.277,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-5265,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1997.468,2006.136,"Of course, if one were to follow that argument, I suppose you might just as well give up the idea of having any kind of a bankrupt turnover any property?"
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2006.136,2007.557,If you would follow the argument of the petition --
1973.73-5265,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2007.557,2008.251,Yes.
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2008.251,2025.039,"I think that is correct, especially in a wage earner’s case, because it seems to me that in one route or another, one either direct or indirect all of the property or all assets are derived from his only source, which is wages."
1973.73-5265,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2025.039,2030.89,And there’s very seldom anything left for distribution to creditors in a large majority in those cases?
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2030.89,2032.739,That’s true.
1973.73-5265,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2106.393,2110.721,"This varies from district to district, as a matter of sensibly of practice or policy?"
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2110.721,2116.72,"Yes, indeed it does, at least that is my understanding from review of the cases and the record."
1973.73-5265,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2116.72,2122.027,Does the law purport to give the trustee that kind of discretion?
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2122.027,2124.625,"It purports to, yes."
1973.73-5265,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2144.253,2149.242,"The statute does give the trustee what, the discretion to abandon?"
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2149.242,2156.546,The trustee has the discretion to abandon if authorized by the referee.
1973.73-5265,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2164.364,2168.681,"But, the trustee didn’t abandon the $660.00 in Cedor case, did he?"
1973.73-5265,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2168.681,2169.161,No.
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2169.161,2170.704,No.
1973.73-5265,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2170.704,2176.255,Does the new proposed code alter that in any way?
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2176.255,2178.586,The abandonment provision?
1973.73-5265,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.328,2185.578,"Well, I thought in good many no assets cases no trustees were appointed at all?"
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2185.578,2186.429,That’s true.
1973.73-5265,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.429,2195.034,"And, the referee himself determines the no asset case and trustees were not applied."
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2203.829,2206.225,"Well, there is a decision."
1973.73-5265,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2257.526,2262.082,"So, what did the Court of Appeals suggest to the District Courts here?"
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2262.082,2305.158,"In the Second Circuit case in our case, suggested that if the needs of the bankrupt were great enough that a deprivation of the amount of the tax refund claim, $150.00, $200.00, $300.00 would amount to a substantial inequity, a severe hardship or harshness, then it could reasonably conclude that abandonment was proper."
1973.73-5265,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2305.158,2316.978,"But, how about for situations, where administrative expenses would eat up any asset, including a tax refund?"
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2320.812,2341.522,"Yes, that was another reason, I believe, stated or expressed in a few sentences why the Court suggested that either the appointment of a trustee was unnecessary or if one had been appointed then, a very quick determination that then it was proper."
1973.73-5265,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.522,2356.306,"So, in the Second Circuit, I take it this question about tax refund will never arise unless there’s a possibility of a distribution of creditors after administrative expenses would be paid?"
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2356.306,2362.194,"I am not certain of that, of agreement with that statement."
1973.73-5265,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2362.194,2378.28,We’ll resume there after lunch.[Luncheon]
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2381.431,2384.52,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-5265,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2429.043,2439.03,"Anytime predicted administrative expenses would eat up for the assets, including the tax refund, there won’t be any trustee appointed at all."
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2439.03,2443.69,I would think that is a fair conclusion.
1973.73-5265,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2637.408,2647.572,I suppose petitioner’s argument is that most of the things you mentioned are voluntarily undertaken by the wage earner was the income tax withholding is not voluntary?
1973.73-5265,1,17522,benjamin_r_civiletti,,2647.572,2652.96,"Well, the term voluntary, I think that is true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1973.73-5265,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2821.179,2822.534,"Thank you, Mr. Civiletti."
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,2834.577,2836.721,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2897.382,2908.008,"But, what if the bankrupt has owning to him six months of unpaid wages, say his employer is in financial trouble and he just hasn’t pay them."
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,2923.819,2934.24,"Well, that’s a similar example as was dealt with by the Sixth Circuit in the Vinnie case."
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2934.24,2940.323,"But, the Federal law doesn’t particularly make that an exempt, that the wages are an the exempt item?"
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,2940.323,2950.555,"I think the Federal law, as far as the exemption statute is concerned, the Federal law protects wages whether they’re paid or yet payable."
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2965.266,2969.431,"They are not excluded for not -- but, because they are not property?"
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,2969.431,2976.061,"Well, I was -- excuse me I was getting to that point, I thought you’d move on to the exemption statute (Voice Overlap)"
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2976.061,2980.704,"They are deemed to be property, they wouldn’t be exempt, wouldn’t have to exempt them, I suppose?"
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,2980.704,2983.79,"Well, conceptually that’s true."
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.014,2992.458,I know you do.
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,2992.458,2996.492,"And, I think that the same reasons would apply."
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3007.076,3022.178,"Now, you’re proposition is and my example I gave you that if a bankrupt has six months of back wages due him from his employer, he may collect them from his employer and not turn them over to the trustee?"
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3022.178,3023.857,"I would like to point, you mean (Voice Overlap)"
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3023.857,3028.22,Is that really your proposition?
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3028.22,3036.048,"I’d like to say it wasn’t my proposition, [Laughter Attempt] because it’s a very hard example, but I would say that --"
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.048,3044.486,You really can't cite anything under the Bankruptcy Act that would let him keep six months worth of back wages?
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3044.486,3054.778,"What I would say to that point is that the bankrupt in that situation, I mean, I wouldn’t be interested in the examination of additional facts."
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3059.587,3060.511,I don’t know.
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3060.511,3062.536,Under the straight analysis --
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3062.536,3066.778,Wouldn’t that be so uncommon?
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3066.778,3072.935,"I think in my experience, as a bankruptcy attorney, I’ve never seen that (Voice Overlap)"
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3072.935,3087.164,"As my example is not the situation of Lines, at least in Lines the amount that was involved there, on its face was to sustain a person for a future period."
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3087.164,3088.628,That’s correct.
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3088.628,3104.473,"Not so in my example, when the wages were payable at the time and not so apparently in the case we have before it because the withheld wages weren’t to sustain him at all if they were to be taken away from him and pay to the Government?"
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3104.473,3124.486,"I think the only real difference your case, Mr. Justice White, and the case of Bar is that you’ve just given me an example, where there’s potentially a very large amount of money involved, whereas typically we have a very small amount of money involved in a tax refund case. Now, I don’t think that’s a distinction."
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3124.486,3141.542,"I think the State law might exempt wages up to that certain amount and so the exemption section might think that, it might think some of those wages (Inaudible)."
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3141.542,3162.583,"Well, let me get to my point, Mr. Justice White and that is I think that the situation in the example that you have given is one where we have -- you’re talking about a fund of wages, which would have never been available in a practical sense for the creditors if they didn’t paid out --"
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3162.583,3164.868,(Inaudible)
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3164.868,3165.276,Well --
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.276,3170.035,This is what distributing in the bankruptcy (Inaudible) wages?
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3170.035,3190.346,"The wages, I want to speak in terms of a practical matter here, wages are 75% exempt at least, according to the Federal Stature, in order for the creditors to obtain those wages, there are number of state law, procedural safeguards, as well as federal constitutional safeguards."
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.177,3216.758,That drove him in the bankruptcy?
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3216.758,3218.368,Threw him in a bankruptcy.
1973.73-5265,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3218.368,3230.439,"But, surely the administration of a nationwide Bankruptcy Act can't depend on whether or not a particular asset that’s claimed to be property, is or is not “substantial?”"
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3239.535,3243.071,"No, I -- Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I agree entirely on that point."
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3370.54,3376.074,How about in no asset cases just a matter of pointing trustees?
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3376.074,3382.502,"Well, although that’s an alternative that is recognized by the -- it’s never done, it’s never done."
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3382.502,3386.941,"You mean appointment -- in every case, trustees are appointed?"
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3386.941,3389.838,In very rare cases.
1973.73-5265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.857,3401.649,"You mean the referees don’t know whether to believe it, so they appointed trustees?"
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3401.649,3408.203,"Right, to look into this situation and once they do, then you’re caught up in a circle again. (Voice Overlap)"
1973.73-5265,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3408.203,3418.437,"In the District of Arizona, where you have all sorts of no asset, wage earner cases, where there really wasn’t any doubt about the fact that there were no assets, the same was true in Colorado?"
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3418.437,3419.971,[Laughter]
1973.73-5265,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3419.971,3426.279,"And this, according to the materials in the brief is done right quite routinely in California apparently?"
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3426.279,3431.985,"No, it’s a trustee is appointed in California in virtually every case."
1973.73-5265,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3431.985,3433.049,"But, then --"
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3433.049,3435.586,"Similarly, in Connecticut, where Mr. Kokoszka come --"
1973.73-5265,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3435.586,3444.321,"But, then in California, when -- how’s the abandonment is utilized apparently on tax refund claims below a certain dollar figure?"
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3444.321,3451.434,"There are court rules, as to a $115.00 tax refund check was established in some districts in Southern California."
1973.73-5265,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3451.434,3452.716,Right.
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3456.251,3487.428,"Well, I don’t know Mr. Justice Stewart as to whether or not fees and so on had to come from some other area in the application of that rule, but I know that as a practical matter, that referees feel that they don’t -- they can't believe the bankrupt necessarily may want to appoint a trustee to see if there were other assets, savings account, that sort of thing."
1973.73-5265,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3504.458,3511.308,"Mr. Adams, I doubt that the supplemental material that you suggested would be helpful to us."
1973.73-5265,2,42335,thomas_r_adams,,3516.587,3517.967,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
