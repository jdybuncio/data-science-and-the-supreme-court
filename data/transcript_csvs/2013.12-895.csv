2013.12-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.17,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-895, Rosemond v. United States."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,7.17,11.389,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,25.298,34.337,Do you agree that the jury could find the defendant guilty of the firearms charge under a proper instruction?
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,40.075,56.253,"Even if the -- I think in this particular case, even if the jury had been given a proper instruction, it would have been a difficult charge to make out because the government never really argued facilitation after getting knowledge of the firearm."
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,59.972,74.231,"Well, I guess we can get into later to whether or not if you know a firearm is being carried and if you then facilitate the commission of the underlying felony by driving the car, participating in the transaction, whether that's sufficient."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,112.423,115.625,"Well, I think at least that would have required foreknowledge."
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.116,162.02,"You do not agree, then, that if you know that there's -- that there's a bank robbery afoot and you're cooperating in that, you're -- you're the wheelman, and you also know that the -- you know that the people who are conducting the bank robbery are carrying firearms, you say that there's no criminal liability for the firearms unless you intended them to use the firearms; is that your position?"
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,162.02,168.507,It's our position that you could infer from the fact that you're assisting the transaction involving--
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,168.507,169.007,"No, no."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,169.007,170.64,--Knowledge is not itself intent.
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,170.64,172.156,Justice Scalia can -- his own question.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,189.518,192.886,I -- I think that that would be -- that would support a verdict.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,195.22,195.47,"Now, wait."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,200.788,201.807,--That's correct.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.092,214.632,"Let's assume there's a lot of evidence that he didn't really want them to use firearms, that there's no way you can say he intended them to use, but he knew that they had firearms."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,214.632,219.001,--And I think that you can conclude from that that his purpose in assuming that he's driving--
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,219.001,219.335,No.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,233.792,246.266,"--You know, I hate to be accused of resisting the hypothetical, because in that -- in that case, I don't think it matters whether you have the subjective desire, like you think, boy, I sure wish those firearms weren't involved."
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.187,252.737,Facilitate the crime.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,252.737,254.705,--with the gun succeeds.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.705,259.007,So you don't have to -- you don't have to--
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,259.007,263.644,But that is your -- we would say that that is the purpose in facilitating.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,265.827,266.327,--Okay.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,273.181,277.819,--I don't think that that -- I think that you have to have the fore -- the foreknowledge.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,279.671,279.954,Beforehand.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,290.143,301.184,"--I think that you -- the question is whether -- you can't even conceive of the circumstance where knowing -- that is, participation -- knowing that a firearm would be used or carried."
2013.12-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,301.184,302.25,"Well, give me an example of that."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,303.184,311.89,"For example, if you agree to drive your neighbor to pick up drugs at some place in Philadelphia or -- let's make it Pittsburgh."
2013.12-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,334.506,335.923,--And I don't -- I don't understand the example.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,342.911,350.517,"--Yes, but he's still facilitating the drug distribution offense at a time he knows that a gun is, you know, being carried in relation to it."
2013.12-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,350.517,356.421,"Well, let me change -- let me -- maybe this is the same as Justice Scalia's hypothetical, but let me try it."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,418.924,431.315,"And at that point, it's his purpose to facilitate a transaction and to, you know, help it succeed and it's at a time when he knows that a gun will be used and that -- I think you can conclude that that is his purpose."
2013.12-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,431.315,445.924,"See -- so I don't really see -- I can't -- I can't think of a situation where a person facilitates the crime, knows what the crime is going to be, knows that a gun is going to be used but doesn't intend for the gun to be used."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,445.924,446.69,The question is--
2013.12-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,446.69,451.828,"In those two situations, knowledge and intent, seem to me to be -- to be the same thing."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,451.828,459.682,--The question is whether there are -- because there are just no instances that are more like my hypothetical than like your hypothetical.
2013.12-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,463.3,465.152,"Well, I don't understand your hypotheticals."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,466.67,477.476,"Well, the point of it is that at a time when you are -- when you are still participating in the underlying offense, the drug trafficking offense, you know that a gun is being carried in relation to it."
2013.12-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,486.832,487.417,But you facilitate--
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,487.417,489.317,"Well, that's -- that's a conclusion."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,495.688,497.107,--But the thing is--
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,497.107,499.392,--with knowledge that the gun might be used.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,499.392,502.677,"--No, but the gun is not going to be used in your act of facilitation."
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,505.377,508.747,"Well, the submission is the jury can find otherwise."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,508.747,509.981,--And the question--
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,509.981,513.816,The -- the gun would never have been used if you didn't drive the -- or carried if you didn't drive the car.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,513.816,519.987,--But I think the jury could equally well conclude that you did not intend to facilitate the use of the gun and you did not facilitate the use of the gun.
2013.12-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,537.181,541.385,"--Or in my -- in my hypothetical, could a rational jury say he knew about it, but he didn't intend it?"
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,541.385,552.108,"I think that in your case with the foreknowledge and where he, you know, facilitates, he carries the gun and he carries the person to the offense, I think that that would be a tough slog."
2013.12-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,560.78,561.296,"Well, in my case -- and I'll finish."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,571.035,575.872,I think it would be error because you're instructing them on the wrong elements.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.911,596.051,I don't think it's ever harmless error to not instruct the jury -- or to instruct the jury not to find one of the elements of the crime.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,609.276,612.895,"I think -- you know what, I'm fine with it being a harmful error, too."
2013.12-895,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,617.716,617.999,Excuse me.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,619.066,619.916,--even if it winds up not making a difference.
2013.12-895,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,619.916,644.964,"--I think what we're driving at here, and I think this is the moment you're resisting, but to me, and as you can tell from my colleague's questions, if you know that someone's carrying a gun, and whether you want them to use it or not is irrelevant, if they take it out and use it and you have gone along with them in the crime, you're guilty."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,722.649,725.066,"No, I don't think -- I don't think that there has to be pre-knowledge."
2013.12-895,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,739.509,740.511,I'm hard to imagine that.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,741.478,746.415,"--For example, if you -- your job, you're the lowest level guy in a drug organization."
2013.12-895,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,777.968,779.236,What would the instruction look like?
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,779.236,780.136,--It would just--
2013.12-895,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,780.136,786.39,To -- to -- what would it look like to capture the difference you're trying to convey?
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,786.39,796.348,--It would just say that the -- that the jury has to find that the defendant facilitated the use or carriage of a gun during and in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking offense--
2013.12-895,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,796.348,797.298,"Well, then you come--"
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,797.298,798.298,--and that they intended to do so.
2013.12-895,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,798.298,802.116,--you come up against the government's argument that you don't have to facilitate every element.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,802.116,802.7,Right.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.372,813.491,I'm surprised to hear you say that you don't need prior knowledge.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,816.026,818.461,I think you have to have prior knowledge before you facilitate it.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,819.244,819.911,Yes.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,819.911,820.161,--Right.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,820.661,823.196,So what did you mean by -- by you don't need prior knowledge?
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,823.196,825.629,You don't need prior knowledge before the whole transaction happens.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.117,830.433,After you know.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,830.433,830.933,--Right.
2013.12-895,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,836.721,838.854,"Mr. Elwood, you're dealing with all kinds of hypotheticals."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,864.288,866.406,"Two things, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-895,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,913.371,920.558,What was the evidence that the jury had on whether he possessed the ammunition?
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,920.558,926.111,I think the only evidence of possession was that it was inside the gun that was fired.
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,937.836,942.221,I just didn't -- you said the only evidence was that it was inside the gun?
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,942.221,943.573,The ammunition was inside the gun.
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,946.342,947.692,And what was the evidence?
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,951.094,952.029,--No.
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,957.4,961.618,And was there any evidence that he had the gun?
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,961.618,967.788,The evidence that he had the gun was the -- the guy who was the other shooter--
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,967.788,970.407,"I mean, was the evidence that he had the gun and the evidence of the cartridges are exactly the same?"
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,970.407,971.457,--They are exactly the same.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1007.063,1011.467,Did -- did he facilitate the crime after the shots were fired?
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1011.467,1020.156,"The government did not ever argue facilitation after the shots were fired, I suspect because -- they only argued that he -- that what happened afterwards was evidence he was the shooter."
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1038.202,1044.621,But do we have cases that say that assisting flight immediately after the crime is not aiding and abetting the crime?
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1049.342,1052.894,I -- I am not aware and the government hasn't cited any.
2013.12-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1071.022,1071.772,Is it -- is it just flight?
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1077.342,1082.744,There was no evidence that that intent to chase them was ever communicated to Mr. Rosemond.
2013.12-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1082.744,1085.413,"Well, he jumps in the car and, you know, they're going after them."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1085.413,1086.614,That itself was disputed.
2013.12-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1098.689,1109.98,"Well, it might be -- it might be an effort to continue the crime of -- in other words, it might make a difference whether the people who are being chased look and see two guys in the car or three guys in the car."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1123.655,1124.257,I agree.
2013.12-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1140.2,1149.055,"I understand your argument about intent, but are you also arguing that the -- that the actus reus instruction was insufficient?"
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1151.24,1152.307,Yes.
2013.12-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1152.307,1158.428,Do you think it's necessary for an aider and abetter to facilitate every element of a criminal offense?
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1158.428,1159.378,We're not saying that.
2013.12-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1200.838,1216.533,"So if there were not -- if the -- the drug offense were not illegal, there -- there wasn't a drug offense and then the -- the additional firearm element, it wouldn't be necessary for him -- for the defendant to facilitate every element of that offense."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1218.985,1225.905,"We're just saying that they have to be -- the jury just has to be instructed to ask, did he facilitate the crime of conviction?"
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.181,1246.835,"Well, but the crime of conviction was -- was a drug offense with the use of a firearm, right?"
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1246.835,1251.22,"It was 924(c), a crime with the long name."
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.22,1266.799,"And so I thought -- I thought that the law is pretty clear that if you -- if you facilitate an offense, you do not have to facilitate each element of that offense, so long as you have knowledge that that element existed."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1266.799,1273.052,"And our submission is just that the jury still has to be asked, did he facilitate the crime."
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1277.521,1288.729,"But -- but more precisely, they could be asked did he facilitate the drug deal knowing that a firearm was going to be used in the drug deal."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1291.514,1292.697,No.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1298.201,1300.203,I don't understand what your position is.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1303.322,1303.838,--No.
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1309.14,1309.306,No.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1328.651,1340.092,And it's our submission that you have to both facilitate the 924(c) offense and that you have to have the intent that the gun be used or carried during and in relation to the crime.
2013.12-895,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1340.092,1346.246,Does that -- does that have to do with the additional 120 months?
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1356.371,1356.621,That's right.
2013.12-895,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1374.165,1380.236,Isn't criminal law -- isn't criminal law replete with crimes which have lesser included offenses as part of them?
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1394.327,1399.564,"There are some courts that apply this, our rationale to lesser included's as well."
2013.12-895,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1418.711,1421.996,"Well, let me go back to my earlier hypothetical about the taped conversation."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1440.041,1446.362,"Well, he may say that he is not going to facilitate it, but, depending on what his actions are, he may -- very well may facilitate it."
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1456.899,1460.185,"I just want to make clear, and we'll get back to the bank robbery hypothetical."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1476.478,1480.848,"I think that that would be enough, because you are carrying the gun as well as the person."
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1481.598,1482.533,But you are not carrying.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1485.183,1486.002,--Oh.
2013.12-895,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1489.704,1492.489,"You are driving the car, the cohort has the gun, the cohort is going to rob the bank."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1499.41,1511.568,"We would say that, yes, that is certainly enough to go to the jury and that -- I think that that would be enough to show that, because you're carrying both the gun on your cohort and you're carrying the cohort, that that would be enough to facilitate that."
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1513.07,1519.639,"But only -- you say it's enough to go to the jury and what you would ask the jury to find is intent, right?"
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1519.639,1520.273,--That's correct.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1520.908,1524.043,Not just to find those facts that were stated by Justice Kennedy.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1524.043,1524.427,--That's correct.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.26,1527.277,"In addition, the jury would have to find intent."
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1527.277,1528.129,That is correct.
2013.12-895,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1528.129,1528.712,Okay.
2013.12-895,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1528.712,1532.114,I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
2013.12-895,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1532.114,1532.864,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1534.983,1536.918,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1609.813,1620.786,"That's a very fanciful hypothetical, because the one thing the guard is going to know, that if the robber gets caught, he's in great jeopardy of -- of being caught himself and convicted."
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1638.982,1642.284,"--Well, if your payment is not coming from the loot, I don't think that's really true."
2013.12-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1653.24,1653.507,He has a stake in it.
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1662.346,1666.817,I don't -- I don't think that's the sort of intent requirement that Mr. Elwood is talking about.
2013.12-895,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1676.172,1696.086,"Well, why don't we just take it that we have a crime, the underlying crime, it's a 48-month crime, and then if you have a gun in connection with that crime, it becomes 120 months consecutive."
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1717.082,1719.951,It's not proving no more than the 48-month charge.
2013.12-895,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1736.577,1746.017,But this instruction at J196 says that the defendant
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1754.456,1755.875,"Justice Kennedy, two points."
2013.12-895,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1755.875,1776.971,"Because as I -- when I read this, I thought, well, given these confusing facts, a jury might think that there's liability if he knew that a firearm was used, which is a very odd interpretation, but that's -- the instruction lends itself to that interpretation."
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1776.971,1784.225,"Justice Kennedy, that is an odd interpretation and it's wrong and we do not contend that liability could be imposed if you learned of the gun only after your participation ended."
2013.12-895,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1785.494,1790.798,"But do you agree that, taken by itself, that one could be read that way?"
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1790.798,1793.064,"Well, I don't think read in the context of the full instruction."
2013.12-895,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1793.683,1794.8,I said taken by itself.
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1794.8,1799.903,"--Oh, so not the instruction taken by itself, but one phrase in the instruction taken by itself?"
2013.12-895,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1799.903,1799.986,Yes.
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1799.986,1812.144,"I think it's possible, but I think if you read it in the context of the full charge and what reasonable jurors would think, you have the formulation right above that on page 196 that mirrors exactly the Peoni standard."
2013.12-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1833.074,1838.278,"Well, he proposed -- he proposed a different instruction that departed from the instruction that was given on that point."
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1838.278,1845.865,"--Mr. Chief Justice, first of all, under Rule 30 it is not enough to propose an alternative instruction that does not contain the defect."
2013.12-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1861.625,1863.843,Two -- two wrongs don't make a right.
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1863.843,1872.532,"--Two wrongs don't make a right, but he certainly did not comply with the Rule 30 standard for raising the objection with respect to foreknowledge that he -- that he's proposing now."
2013.12-895,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1890.844,1896.981,Look at his -- look at his instruction and think about the bank robbery hypothetical with the driver of the car.
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1911.657,1912.592,--It would be--
2013.12-895,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1912.592,1913.826,He drove the car.
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1922.882,1935.106,"--I think the only way Petitioner fits that instruction into his view of the law is because the driver started out driving the people to the bank, so he says, oh, well, you are satisfying my actus reus requirement because you actually transported the guns to the bank."
2013.12-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1982.918,1988.988,Could you talk practically about what the difficulties are for the government in this scenario?
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2023.926,2028.311,"--If he continued participating after he learned of the gun, yes."
2013.12-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2028.311,2028.944,"That's your point, right?"
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2028.944,2029.428,Yes.
2013.12-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2029.428,2030.18,That's your--
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2030.18,2032.496,"If he learned of the gun and said, hey, I'm out of this, he's not guilty."
2013.12-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2032.496,2037.084,--So isn't this really an argument about how you define facilitation?
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2055.129,2055.712,"Well, I--"
2013.12-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2055.712,2060.531,Because your adversary keeps saying mere knowledge of the gun's being used is not enough.
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2060.531,2064.334,--I think it's more qualitative than that and the question suggests it's purely quantitative.
2013.12-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2124.805,2136.863,"What is so hard about saying, did you have knowledge that the gun would be used, either -- and you facilitate -- but you continue to facilitate the crime?"
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2136.863,2137.98,--We--
2013.12-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2137.98,2139.049,--the underlying crime.
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2139.049,2139.849,--We agree that that is law.
2013.12-895,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2139.849,2141.699,"Well, Mr. Bash, what about this case?"
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2206.174,2211.745,"If the gun is drawn and the person continues to facilitate the drug crime or the violent crime, that is enough."
2013.12-895,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2211.745,2218.582,"Well, what exactly would you want him to do at that point to not be convicted of this, of this offense?"
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2223.936,2224.82,Yeah.
2013.12-895,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2246.601,2247.001,Right.
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2263.946,2265.096,Two points on that.
2013.12-895,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2334.657,2345.181,"Mr. Bash, would you explain why in this situation the guy abetted a drug deal when there was no drug deal?"
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2369.98,2375.55,"Well, of course, the prosecution's principal theory was that he was the gunman; he brought it along to facilitate his drug deal."
2013.12-895,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2435.004,2444.277,"And -- and you agree that for aiding and abetting, you must -- the gun offense, you must have knowledge that the gun is being carried by the cohort."
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2444.277,2444.727,Yes.
2013.12-895,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2444.727,2445.344,You agree with that.
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2445.344,2446.312,"Carried or used, yes."
2013.12-895,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2446.312,2464.94,Could the defendant here have -- could the defendant here have been convicted of possession of the ammunition on the theory that -- under the instructions -- would the instructions have allowed that conviction on the theory that the defendant aided and abetted somebody else's possession of the ammunition?
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2464.94,2472.279,"I don't think so, because the judge never instructed that if you aid and abet, that's is the equivalent of constructive possession of -- of the bullets."
2013.12-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2504.164,2509.302,What -- what's the point of charging him with possession of the gun and possession of the bullets in the gun?
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2513.454,2516.641,--The proof -- the proof was the same in this case.
2013.12-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2527.947,2533.601,"Well, I guess, then, the question is: What's the point of charging him with possession of the bullets if you're not charging him with possession of the gun?"
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2533.601,2536.302,It -- we could have charged him with possession as a felon.
2013.12-895,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2541.523,2556.199,"Mr. Bash, you know, what sticks in my craw a little bit about your position is this: Usually, we want punishments to -- two people and they do very different things and they have very different intents, we want them actually to be punished differently."
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2604.947,2607.232,We are saying that.
2013.12-895,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2617.872,2628.761,"But I just add, what I would have thought was that the actus reus can be very small, but almost to compensate for that, you have to have full-fledged intent."
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2642.253,2648.824,"--Justice Kagan, I don't think that can be right for the examples I gave, paid accomplices that don't have a stake or the person who lends the gun to be a good guy."
2013.12-895,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2681.379,2689.484,"Would you agree that in order to show aiding and abetting -- and I'll just quote from a California case here -- that,"
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2698.34,2698.924,Yes.
2013.12-895,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2736.799,2742.453,"Would you -- would you agree that the statement -- that the first part of the instruction that the district court gave,"
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2748.74,2749.89,Not--
2013.12-895,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2749.89,2750.792,Potentially misleading?
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2750.792,2753.225,"--In isolation, potentially misleading."
2013.12-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2763.032,2763.649,You would--
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2763.649,2764.165,--of your participation in the offense.
2013.12-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2764.165,2770.069,"--You would never -- if you got a call from the U.S. -- assistant U.S. attorney in the field said, this is the instruction I'm going to use, you would tell him, no, don't do that."
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2770.069,2770.953,We -- we wouldn't.
2013.12-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2783.744,2786.778,"No, I know you have arguments about failure to object and harmless error."
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2791.482,2797.47,"Well, I think as we said in the brief, it would have been clearer to say “ would use ” or something that -- that makes absolutely clear that you required foreknowledge."
2013.12-895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2830.874,2834.493,"Why -- why do you say -- you say in context, it was okay."
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2836.678,2842.765,"The -- Justice Scalia, the instruction -- or part of the same instruction, the paragraph immediately before just mirrored--"
2013.12-895,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2842.765,2843.232,That's it?
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2855.84,2859.811,"--Well, to help make the crime succeed."
2013.12-895,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2883.592,2884.792,Knowing that a gun would be used.
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2889.146,2892.698,"--Basically a slight tweak, which is knowing that the principal bore the intent to use a gun."
2013.12-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2898.336,2910.743,"I -- I don't see how “ make the crime succeed ” helps you because you would say the crime that he has to help make succeed is the underlying drug offense, not the use of the firearm."
2013.12-895,1,29118,john_f_bash,,2910.743,2912.595,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, we wouldn't say that."
2013.12-895,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2975.519,2977.704,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-895,2,30165,john_p_elwood,,2979.971,2981.923,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-895,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3024.431,3026.466,What cases should I look up for that?
2013.12-895,2,30165,john_p_elwood,,3026.466,3027.416,I think--
2013.12-895,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3027.416,3037.171,"That is to say, I thought generally in the criminal law a person who commits an illegal act is liable for the known consequences of that act."
2013.12-895,2,30165,john_p_elwood,,3045.361,3049.498,--The standard for accomplice liability requires purposeful intent.
2013.12-895,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3049.998,3056.918,"When you say “ purposeful intent ”, He didn't want it, but he knew it would happen."
2013.12-895,2,30165,john_p_elwood,,3056.918,3057.268,--It was his purpose--
2013.12-895,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3057.268,3061.386,"And moreover, he helped to produce the occasion on which it would happen."
2013.12-895,2,30165,john_p_elwood,,3061.386,3062.353,--It was his purpose for doing it.
2013.12-895,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3066.29,3069.826,"Would you just tell me where in the brief they are, or whatever's easier."

2013.12-895,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3098.176,3099.094,You use the word “ intent ”.
2013.12-895,2,30165,john_p_elwood,,3102.63,3102.83,Right.
2013.12-895,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3102.83,3104.832,--of the known but undesired consequence.
2013.12-895,2,30165,john_p_elwood,,3104.832,3104.915,Right.
2013.12-895,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3111.919,3112.252,It's language.
2013.12-895,2,30165,john_p_elwood,,3129.463,3130.413,--I would--
