2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.575,"We'll hear argument first today in Case 06-7949, Gall v. United States."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,7.638,46.123,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Judge Robert W. Pratt of the Southern District of Iowa sentenced Brian Michael Gall on May 27, 2005, he found Mr. Gall to be an individual who had fully rehabilitated himself by having voluntarily withdrawn from a conspiracy five years earlier, by remaining crime-free throughout that period, by having rid himself of his addictions, by having graduated from college, by having learned a trade, by having built a successful and thriving business."
2007.06-7949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,103.272,110.033,"If it had been the other way around and the district court had said what appellate court said and the appellate court had said what the district court said, what would you be arguing?"
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,110.033,116.281,"Certainly, Justice Kennedy, I would probably be arguing something of the reverse."
2007.06-7949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,119.42,122.233,"Well, you can see the systemic concern."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,130.666,139.944,"--Yes, that's certainly true, but in this instance an abuse of discretion standard applies."
2007.06-7949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,139.944,147.519,"I thought it was your argument that if any rational judge could impose the sentence that's imposed, then that sentence has to be sustained."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,151.97,153.687,No.
2007.06-7949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,157.702,158.03,No.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,171.213,171.447,Yes.
2007.06-7949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,171.447,172.337,--that that approach is irrational?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,172.337,173.181,It would have to be.
2007.06-7949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,206.838,226.924,"What about the Eighth Circuit, laying aside the extraordinary circumstances test, saying the judge, the sentencing judge gave credit for his leaving the conspiracy, but he didn't blow the whistle, so the conspiracy continued."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,268.376,276.576,"Justice Ginsburg, when someone leaves the conspiracy and blows the whistle, typically, that individual is not charged."
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,289.774,291.508,"Well, I'm sure that's not always true."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,298.411,300.505,"That's true, Your Honor."
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.472,304.049,Lex Luthor might.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,306.299,328.695,"--Yes, but the point is that blowing the whistle is... is not only a voluntary withdrawal, but also something so far beyond the bounds of what prosecutors typically see that that individual, typically or generally is the individual that receives immunity or amnesty in the case."
2007.06-7949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,341.144,346.25,"There is no indication that he gave it back, or there was no fine attached to it."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,346.25,357.824,"No, there was not, and in part because, as the sealed volume of the appendix demonstrates, Mr. Gall did not at that point have money to pay a fine."
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.756,377.067,"Well, you don't... you don't have to answer all of these things for your case, do you?"
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,377.067,377.457,No.
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.457,381.877,You're not saying that a reasonable person couldn't have found the opposite.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,386.764,388.983,"That's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.983,393.293,"So why don't you just swallow all these things and say, yeah, I suppose the court of appeals could say that, but--"
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,393.293,394.527,I... I--
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,394.527,395.808,--but my point stands?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,395.808,398.76,"--Yeah, well, I'm happy to swallow in that sense."
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,400.995,402.493,"Well then, what's left of the appellate review?"
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,413.895,420.674,--There is... there isn't much left besides the fact that it is abuse of discretion review.
2007.06-7949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,433.293,434.589,And that's the problem.
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,434.589,455.816,"--In a typical abuse of discretion review, you still have... for example, if you have a judge in... well, let's say you have a judge; in one case he says because this is a... a young defendant, I'm going to give him a lighter sentence; and in the next case says, you know, I don't think age is a factor that I should consider in the case; in the next case he says it is and then not."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,459.283,460.19,Not necessarily.
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,462.407,465.594,So there can be substantive review for consideration of age?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,465.594,476.184,"--Not necessarily for consideration of age, but a court of appeals could say to... to such a judge... and I am sure that one of the parties would point this out, would say you considered it last time; you didn't consider it."
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,478.996,479.855,"Okay, so at the same time--"
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,479.855,480.09,--explain why--
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,480.09,492.333,"--But if you have two district judges in the same courthouse and the one says, when I have a young defendant I always... I forget whether the term is ""vary"" or ""depart""... but I always go down, and the next judge says, I never consider age."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,495.409,498.688,"--Yes, both... both would be upheld."
2007.06-7949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,498.688,499.406,"Now, why...--"
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,499.406,500.034,If somebody said--
2007.06-7949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,500.034,517.745,"--Why wouldn't the judge in, as it were, the second case give some consideration, be required under abuse review to give some consideration, to what is sort of the norm in that circuit so that he doesn't stand out as either a ""let-them-loose"" judge or a hanging judge?"
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,526.039,530.598,"Well, it does require a broader view, and certainly a judge could--"
2007.06-7949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,530.598,542.375,"And wouldn't there be at least under the Chief Justices's hypothetical, wouldn't there be a possibility of looking to those other cases rather than just automatically affirming on... on abuse review?"
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,542.375,543.063,--There would be.
2007.06-7949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,543.063,543.547,Okay.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,543.547,544.875,And I was about to add--
2007.06-7949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,544.875,551.325,Would the judge have to consider the cases from the judge's district or from the circuit or from the whole country?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,551.325,557.011,--I would... I would imagine a judge would want to look at... at cases from the whole country.
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,557.011,557.775,Isn't that exactly--
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,557.775,558.244,Certainly they have--
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,558.244,561.916,--Isn't that exactly what the Sentencing Commission did in establishing the Guidelines?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,561.916,564.368,--It did in establishing the Guidelines.
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,571.427,571.863,It looked at them.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,573.785,574.317,Exactly.
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,574.317,578.408,"With white collar crime, for example, it went vastly higher than what had been the practice."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,578.408,582.172,"That's... that's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-7949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,592.512,611.238,"Going back to the Chief Justice's hypothetical and the colloquy you had with him with the hypothetical, the two different judges in the statement district or the same circuit that treat age differently, if the Congress saw that would the Congress be able to say anything about that, do anything about that to stop the disparity?"
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,611.238,611.785,--Certainly.
2007.06-7949,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,611.785,613.3,Consistently with the Sixth Amendment?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,613.3,613.987,Certainly.
2007.06-7949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,626.373,627.248,How?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,627.248,628.216,If the unwarranted--
2007.06-7949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.216,629.778,How can it fix the--
2007.06-7949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,629.778,630.278,One question.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,647.693,651.24,"--A court of appeals could, yes, I think it could that."
2007.06-7949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,652.753,657.299,There could be a common... sort of a common law of reasonableness developed through the public process?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,657.299,658.703,I think that's correct.
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.407,661.406,And another circuit would develop the opposite.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,669.59,670.777,--That's... that's correct Your Honor.
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,670.777,671.965,In kind of a sentencing review court?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,671.965,673.308,Yes.
2007.06-7949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,679.149,686.131,Could Congress pass a statute that says age is not relevant in sentencing except in extraordinary circumstances?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,688.161,695.064,"--I believe that Congress could pass such a statute, yes."
2007.06-7949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,708.871,723.881,"--But you said... you said before that, and very definitely, that Congress could fix the case of where one judge said, I'm always lenient on 17-year-olds and the other said, I throw the book at him."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,733.065,759.617,"--Well, in response to that question and your earlier question, Justice Ginsburg, certainly Congress could, to fix the entire problem here, could adopt the solution that we proposed in Booker and in Fanfan that to say that... that in order to enhance a sentence at all, that has... it has to be a fact found by the jury, what's so-called Blakelyizing of the Guidelines."
2007.06-7949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,772.891,788.589,"If Congress can pass a statute without violating the Sixth Amendment saying age is ordinarily not relevant, then could Congress delegate to an expert agency the authority to make that decision without violating the Sixth Amendment?"
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,788.589,790.681,"--No, I don't think that it could."
2007.06-7949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,792.072,792.337,Based on what?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,796.961,799.586,"--Well, it could delegate the authority."
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,850.298,861.591,"Mr. Green, I understood you to respond to Justice Souter's question that courts of appeals could consider a broader range of cases in deciding whether it's an abuse of discretion in a particular case."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,861.591,862.012,--Certainly.
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,862.012,890.627,"Now, if they can consider a broader range of cases, what's so bad about suggesting that if a particular case is way out of what their broad review shows, if the broad review shows that in most cases this type of defendant gets 5 years and in this particular case, the judge gave him 30 years or gave him zero, what's wrong with suggesting that that is a factor they should at least start with in saying something's unusual about this case, we ought to take closer look?"
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,890.627,902.168,"In that instance, though, we run into the problem that Justice Scalia identified and that problem is we start to get limitations based upon certain factors, and the courts of appeals--"
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,902.168,906.478,"Well then, what's the point of looking at the broad range of cases if they can't do anything about it?"
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,906.478,914.663,"--To see whether... the point is to see whether or not the reasons that are offered in those cases turn out to be valid, cogent--"
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,914.663,930.345,"So is it right to say if the broad range shows that most of these defendants get a sentence of 10 years in jail and in this case the person got probation, that the court should look for some reasons to explain what the difference, to justify the difference?"
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,930.345,938.262,--Certainly the court should look at the reasons and should look to see whether or not the reasons are rationally grounded in Section 3553(a).
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,942.558,969.984,"Of course, all these questions only... only apply to departures downward from the Guidelines, and if you ask the same question with regard to departures upward you do run into constitutional problems when the... when courts of appeals begin to establish certain facts that have to be found in order to move upward or... yes, certain facts that justify moving upward."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,985.166,990.179,"That... that's correct, and that's essentially the kind of system that we've got now."
2007.06-7949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1006.985,1013.857,What in your view would be... would fail the abuse of discretion test?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1018.917,1021.197,"30 to 37 months, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-7949,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1021.197,1027.117,"And the judge gives no prison time, three years probation."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1033.958,1036.785,"Well, there are a couple of examples out there."
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1082.548,1083.157,You think that's unreasonable?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1083.157,1085.47,"I do think that's unreasonable, Your Honor."
2007.06-7949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1097.681,1100.977,"May I ask, we've been talking about a lot of hypotheticals."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1108.365,1108.896,No.
2007.06-7949,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1108.896,1111.88,--that they were out of harmony with what's done throughout the country?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1111.88,1113.739,"No, none whatsoever, Your Honor."
2007.06-7949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1143.882,1160.954,"What in your opinion is supposed to happen if we have Guidelines, a part of 3553(a), a part of it... voluntary or not, they're referred to, so... and I understand how you would deal with this."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1170.95,1171.512,--That's right.
2007.06-7949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1171.512,1180.603,"I can understand if it's a question of judgment, a matter of judgment about this case the court of appeals is supposed to say: District judge, it's your view that matters here."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1222.102,1228.74,"I would find such an absolute policy disagreement difficult as well, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-7949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1249.184,1250.684,"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1257.43,1257.821,--Exactly.
2007.06-7949,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1257.821,1260.086,--But I want to know your view of it.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1291.464,1317.828,"The words should be these with respect to policy judgments: The district court may consider policy disagreements with the Sentencing Guidelines or may disagree with the policies stated in the Sentencing Guidelines or underlying those Guidelines, as long as that disagreement is rationally or reasonably grounded in the facts of the case, that it fits the circumstances of the case."
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1319.733,1319.92,Excuse me.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1337.492,1341.444,--Yes and no.
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1342.974,1344.458,Which yes and which no?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1344.458,1344.927,--Okay.
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.226,1380.538,"It has to be relevant to the case, Of course."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1380.538,1380.725,--Certainly.
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1380.725,1381.116,Of course.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1381.116,1382.317,Relevance and rational--
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1382.317,1385.083,I don't know what you mean by rationally grounded in the case before them.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1413.601,1425.16,"--If the district court applied that as a policy across all cases that come before it involving crack or powder cocaine, Justice Scalia, that is an abdication of the district court's duty under Section 3553(a)."
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1426.581,1426.925,I see.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1428.564,1430.533,"--No, no, I'm not, I'm not saying that."
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1430.533,1431.517,--It just has to consider them.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1434.327,1440.59,"Yes, it has to... it does not have to follow the Guidelines and it can disagree, but it has to tie that disagreement to the facts of the case."
2007.06-7949,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.59,1442.168,This case involves cocaine.
2007.06-7949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1442.168,1444.323,You're saying... you're saying two things.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1477.64,1481.544,"No, because I don't think a district judge would have to find that the case was somehow an outlier."
2007.06-7949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1481.544,1488.01,Then what is it in the facts of this case that is crucial to the appropriate determination?
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1488.01,1498.881,"Well, the facts of a case where there's a disagreement with a policy might be, for example, the policy might be... let's take embezzlement because I don't want to tread on my colleague's argument."
2007.06-7949,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1499.975,1501.225,Maybe you could take age.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1519.434,1521.137,--Age is a good example.
2007.06-7949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1564.198,1564.416,Sure.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1597.919,1609.195,"But not necessarily, because a district judge who is looking the defendant in the eye, and is the best placed judicial actor to make that decision, may say I see a 21-year-old in front of me who is uniquely mature."
2007.06-7949,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1617.989,1624.284,"You're saying that if a judge disagrees as a general matter of policy, once in a while he could make an exception to his disagreement."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1632.468,1640.308,"Well, he... he may have rejected it... if... I wouldn't even... dare say that in a multiplicity of cases."
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1650.929,1653.741,"We'll give you rebuttal time, Mr. Green, but I just have one question."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1671.734,1672.577,I--
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1672.577,1674.201,That's the only question presented in this case.
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1674.201,1682.4,--Because it... because it sets a presumptive sentence and that presumptive sentence is exactly like... is the Guideline sentence.
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1725.696,1726.569,"Thank you, Mr. Green."
2007.06-7949,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,1726.569,1727.022,Thank you.
2007.06-7949,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1727.022,1728.132,Mr. Dreeben.
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1728.132,1747.843,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Appellate courts confronted with the task of conducting reasonableness review need some benchmarks for how to distinguish between sentences that are outside the Guidelines and reasonable and sentences that are outside the Guidelines and are not."
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1763.728,1774.083,"Excuse me, may I ask this question because it comes up throughout your brief, and you've used percentages to decide when a case is sufficiently outside the Guidelines to justify a special hard look."
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1781.782,1785.484,"--Justice Stevens, we don't have a fixed percentage."
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1814.411,1818.908,So you do not rely on a percentage as kind of the magic basic test?
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1818.908,1819.72,--I don't.
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1821.032,1823.032,I think some of the courts of appeals seem to.
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1823.032,1828.733,--The courts of appeals have generally relied on a
2007.06-7949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.34,1876.417,What if... what if the sentencing judge simply disagrees with the Guidelines?
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1883.007,1884.695,"He is, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-7949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1884.695,1918.119,"And so long as that disagreement is reasonable, so long as another sentencing commission might indeed have imposed a lower sentence... for antitrust violations, if indeed all the Federal Courts before... before the Guidelines came into effect were rarely imposing any prison sentences, how could you say it would be unreasonable for a district judge to say, I simply agrees with what the Guidelines... with what the Sentencing Commission did, and I agree with all of those sentencing courts before then, which thought... which thought only in a rare case should there be jail time?"
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1920.837,1932.612,"Because, Justice Scalia, I start with a fundamentally different concept of reasonableness review than merely is it possible to articulate a reasoned basis for sentencing the defendant that way."
2007.06-7949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.59,1960.679,"But we also made it very clear that the Guidelines are advisory, and there is... there is no way to a maintain that with the... with the kind of approach that you're offering."
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1968.784,1988.558,"--I think there's a difference, Justice Scalia, from saying that the Guidelines are advisory and therefore a court can give a different sentence than what the Guidelines call for, and saying that basically advisory guidelines means the judge can do whatever policy judgment the judge wants, without regard to what degree of variance you achieve."
2007.06-7949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.871,1993.291,"You cannot disagree on policy with the Guidelines, then, at least not fundamentally?"
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1993.291,2002.725,"--No, you can disagree fundamentally, and I think at one level every variance is a disagreement with the sentence that the Guidelines would produce."
2007.06-7949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2002.725,2006.115,I don't know how that... that fits in with your prior statement.
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2006.115,2028.277,"It fits in with my prior statement because what'S at issue in a case like this is not whether the judge can disagree with the judgment of the Guidelines and say youth matters, but whether the judge can do so to such an extent that the result is unwarranted disparity beyond what needs to be tolerated in order to achieve a system that complies with the Sixth Amendment."
2007.06-7949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2028.277,2033.338,You're saying that there's a fairness component to the Guidelines in reasonableness review.
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2033.338,2034.837,I'm saying that--
2007.06-7949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2034.837,2044.349,"When you start talking about disparity, you're talking about a fairness across a range of sentencing that is actually imposed."
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2050.722,2057.373,"--There has to be a substantive fairness component, Justice Souter, and I think that there has to be a substantive excessiveness component."
2007.06-7949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2058.467,2060.949,"Well, that's kind after subset, isn't it?"
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2060.949,2066.683,--I actually view it as the broader category but I think the two of them work together.
2007.06-7949,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2066.683,2067.355,Okay.
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2067.355,2073.087,This is the fundamental difference that I think exists between what Petitioner is offering and what the government is offering.
2007.06-7949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2107.978,2113.492,"Well, then... then you're just blowing smoke when you say that the Guidelines are advisory."
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2129.861,2146.806,"Unless, Justice Scalia, the judge offers sufficiently cogent, persuasive reasons so that the court of appeals concludes that this is indeed a reasonable sentence, given the reasons that the judge has articulated as a matter of policy and the facts before him."
2007.06-7949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2146.806,2147.775,"Well, he did that here."
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2161.863,2163.769,He... he did say that Justice Scalia.
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2226.009,2232.163,"Mr. Dreeben, do you think there are any facts that would have justified probation for this particular crime?"
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2232.163,2233.632,--Yes.
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2243.861,2247.782,What is the difference between the facts in this case and the ones which you would find acceptable?
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2247.782,2257.653,"--Well, the ones that, I think, have been the most appealing for probation sentences are cases in which the defendant's culpability is very low."
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.541,2274.818,"I'm asking about whether in cases exactly involving the crime we have here, whether any such cases would justify probation, where the culpability was exactly the same as there was here."
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2274.818,2303.759,"--The only cases that I can think of... and I was trying to get to this point, Justice Stevens... are ones in which courts conclude there are compelling family circumstances where individuals will be very badly hurt in the defendant's family if no one is available to take care of them, and the defendant has really devoted his activities to doing that, and there's no replacement; and the costs to society would be too high in those circumstances, courts have concluded, to justify a sentence of imprisonment."
2007.06-7949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2310.757,2317.878,"This is exactly the kind of case, though, that I think would give tremendous discretion to the district judge."
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2423.1,2431.161,--Let me try to draw one distinction and make a point about proportionality that I think is not encompassed within what you said.
2007.06-7949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.342,2485.106,We should probably make them mandatory.
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2485.106,2494.197,"--As I said to Justice Scalia, they're not mandatory, and the judge does have the freedom to challenge the judgment that the Sentencing Commission has drawn."
2007.06-7949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2519.703,2533.01,"So, on that ground I understand perfectly, and were we to write that into a paragraph in the opinion, this case still, would it not, be the strongest case imaginable for discretion to the district judge?"
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2533.01,2534.931,"--I hope not, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-7949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2536.008,2538.18,"You did, but I wanted to know what you were going to say."
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2538.18,2543.974,"--As I said, the Section 3553(a) process is a holistic one."
2007.06-7949,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2573.354,2587.05,"I'm sure that the prosecutor argued that, and the judge heard it, and he listed what thought were the key factors."
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2614.899,2623.722,Reasonableness requires more of a balance of the policies and a consideration of the overall goal of the system of achieving uniformity.
2007.06-7949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.654,2691.462,We're trying to development a rule here that can be applied sensibly by all the courts of appeals when they are reviewing the innumerable sentences of federal district judges.
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2721.059,2730.914,"Justice Scalia, the competing rule of mere rationality or the judge did something that's reasonable is pretty much a one-way ticket to disparity."
2007.06-7949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2745.798,2747.61,I wouldn't say... I wouldn't say that.
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2779.363,2806.29,"--Well, the question I think here is how advisory do they have to be in order to comply with this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence and the remedial opinion in Booker, as I understand it, answered that question by saying they're not mandatory, but the features of the appellate review and continued existence of the sentencing commission are going to work significantly to achieving Congress's objectives of increased uniformity."
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2864.126,2878.152,"Mr. Dreeben, you are saying that you admit there's no presumption of unreasonable merely because it is outside but there is a presumption of reasonable if it dramatically or significantly is outside and you don't define dramatically or significantly?"
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2878.152,2883.07,--I am not able to give the Court a rigid definition of it.
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2883.07,2885.285,You are not able to give any definition.
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2894.957,2910.811,"I don't treat what I'm arguing for as a presumption, but if the Court wants to conclude that it does function like a presumption, I would still submit it is a perfectly valid presumption under these circumstances."
2007.06-7949,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2913.013,2914.107,"Well, you should... I'm sorry."
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2920.135,2920.542,--Correct.
2007.06-7949,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2920.542,2927.928,"Under 3553(a), district courts have to provide reasons anyway, right."
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2927.928,2928.693,They do.
2007.06-7949,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2928.693,2935.91,"So if there is no explanation of the reasons it is going to be invalid under the statute, quite apart from any presumption of unreasonableness."
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2935.91,2950.715,"Well, the presumption of unreasonableness goes a little bit farther than that, Mr. Chief Justice, because it allows the court of appeals to take notice that this is a sentence that if upheld holds the potential for unwarranted disparity."
2007.06-7949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2978.064,2979.58,Why isn't that always true?
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3008.489,3014.08,"What you'd be doing I think, Justice Breyer, is sweeping aside the approach that nine circuits have taken."
2007.06-7949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3014.08,3014.627,That's correct.
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3014.627,3019.454,Which have usefully facilitated their appellate review.
2007.06-7949,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3084.271,3085.442,We were making progress?
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3106.231,3107.324,No.
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3172.079,3173.954,"--Mr. Dreeben, can I ask another question?"
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3208.486,3214.765,"--It is more of a wholistic and judgmental process than a mathematical one, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3240.333,3244.004,Does that call for a 40 to 50 percent justification?
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3244.004,3249.313,--It calls for one that makes sense given the degree of the various--
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3249.313,3255.342,But don't you read the court of appeals opinions as in effect saying we've got to get a percentage that matches the percentage of departure?
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3255.342,3266.198,"--Linguistically, the words used are, you need a compelling reason for an extraordinary departure... an extraordinary reason for an extraordinary departure or variance."
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3317.535,3327.814,"Can I ask you... if it wipes it out entirely, does that make this case different or like a case in which the maximum was say... was 30 years instead of 30 months?"
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3331.544,3340.494,"--Well, in this case, because the government believes that the guidelines provide a reference point for proportionality review, a sentence--"
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3340.494,3343.307,Supposing the guidelines provided 30 years?
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3348.304,3351.241,"--Stronger, I would say, because if the guidelines--"
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3351.241,3352.256,Because the percentage is really irrelevant--
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3352.256,3353.365,--Excuse me.
2007.06-7949,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3353.365,3357.629,"--It would... then the percentage is irrelevant, if you said it has to be stronger in that case."
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3357.629,3361.58,"Yes, I think that... that's why I don't think you can confine it to percentage."
2007.06-7949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3384.447,3396.13,"Mr. Dreeben, you're... you're arguing hereby in a case where the departure was downward, but you're... the principle you apply, you would apply for upward departures as well?"
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3396.13,3397.113,Yes.
2007.06-7949,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3397.113,3417.963,"Doesn't there get to be a constitutional problem where... where the court which is establishing these... these ranges that you want has held, after a series of decisions, that basically you cannot get 30 percent over... over the guideline range unless particular facts exist?"
2007.06-7949,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3435.832,3436.769,"No, Justice Scalia."
