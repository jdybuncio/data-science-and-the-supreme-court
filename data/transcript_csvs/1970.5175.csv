1970.5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,63.622,We’ll hear arguments next in Perez against Campbell for the State of Arizona.
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,66.105,69.404,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1970.5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,165.955,170.007,"The judgment was -- the judgment ran against both the man and the wife, did it or did not?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,170.007,171.945,Yes.
1970.5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,180.592,191.356,"When you speak of it is being a confession of judgment, do you mean the conventional default judgment where they did not respond or did they affirmatively confess?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,191.356,196.894,The confession judgment was entered by their attorney.
1970.5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,224.477,236.658,"And the theory on which the lawsuit was brought against her i.e. the wife was what, because the husband was driving the car alone in the car, was he not, at the time of the collision?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,236.658,238.509,"Yes, the husband was alone."
1970.5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,240.686,247.143,"And the complaint joined her as a defendant on what theory, on the community property theory or --"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,247.143,247.652,Exactly.
1970.5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,286.756,290.998,"And the confession of judgment was filed on behalf of both defendants, man and wife?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,290.998,291.833,That’s right.
1970.5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,299.246,302.503,Could the judgment have been entered against the driver only?
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,306.429,316.817,"In Arizona, the -- a suit can be brought either against the husband or against husband and wife."
1970.5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,319.513,327.785,"But once having been brought against both of them, could a lawful judgment have been entered against the driver only, the husband?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,327.785,334.585,This is not shown by any of the case law in Arizona regarding community property.
1970.5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,334.585,340.353,"But if the plaintiff and the defendants had agreed upon that, it probably could’ve been done, isn’t that correct?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,340.353,358.889,Most plaintiffs are not willing to do that because most plaintiffs feel that wife may have a job and it will be easier to garnish or execute on the wife if the complaint and the judgment reads the wife’s name.
1970.5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,371.415,380.966,"The complaint, the original complaint was based, I suppose upon the husband’s negligent conduct in driving the automobile, is that correct?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,380.966,382.298,Exactly.
1970.5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,382.298,393.253,Was it based at all on the -- against the wife under -- on the basis that she had been negligent in lending the car for him to drive?
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,393.253,393.505,No.
1970.5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,393.505,394.417,Or anything such as that?
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,396.777,400.982,"No, there’s no allegation in the complaint as to that at all."
1970.5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,400.982,411.309,"The (Inaudible) on the complaint that is the wrong, the wrongful injuries were wrongful injuries because of the husband’s negligence, is that right?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,411.309,411.905,Exactly.
1970.5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,411.905,416.034,"Nothing as to -- nothing in the complaint about the wife’s negligence, no allegations as to --"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,416.034,417.55,No.
1970.5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,417.55,422.935,"She was joined merely as a member of the community that owned the automobile, I suppose?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,422.935,424.029,That is correct.
1970.5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,424.029,428.419,"Well now, where was title to the automobile?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,428.419,435.516,The title to the automobile is in the name of Adolfo Perez only.
1970.5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,435.516,444.813,"But as a matter of Arizona law, if the automobile was acquired after their marriage, regardless to the title it nonetheless belonged half to his wife, is that right?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,444.813,446.352,Exactly.
1970.5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,448.255,448.56,Right.
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,448.56,451.871,"And the wife has an interest in it, although the husband is the manager."
1970.5175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.871,452.958,Right.
1970.5175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,452.958,459.869,"Mr. Ching, do you know whether Arizona permits the holding of personal property in joint tenancy?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,459.869,464.049,"Yes, Arizona permits the holding of a personal property in joint tenancy."
1970.5175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,464.049,471.49,Would your case be any different if this automobile were registered in the names of Adolfo and Emma as joint tenants?
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,471.49,483.43,"The case will not be any different other than not only the community property of the husband and wife, but also Emma Perez’s separate property will then become liable."
1970.5175,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,488.496,491.244,"As long as I’ve interrupted you, one more question."
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,500.123,522.02,"Certainly, Your Honor and this has been done in three states: New York, Massachusetts and North Carolina."
1970.5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,721.515,732.106,"Well, when you use the word responsible, referring to it, I assume in the statute, in what sense do you think that word is used?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,742.096,756.542,The Arizona statute has for the purpose the financially irresponsible drivers that it’s trying to reach and not the drivers who are irresponsible in their conduct.
1970.5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,818.552,841.653,"Well, don’t you suppose that Arizona legislature had in mind that if there was a criminal conviction, manslaughter for example, that their invariably or if not then almost invariably, there would be a judgment or a claim that would be satisfied or else would come under the civil provisions of the statute?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,841.653,842.263,Exactly.
1970.5175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,857.46,871.941,"Well, I thought you had just agreed in response to a question of Justice Blackmun that the state had a lawful power under its police power to require insurance, did I misunderstand you on that?"
1970.5175,0,15746,anthony_b_ching,,871.941,872.92,No.
1970.5175,1,40416,robert_h_schlosser,,1849.486,1850.157,Mr. Chief Justice --
1970.5175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1850.157,1855.18,"By the way, Mr. Ching I think you have probably five minutes?"
1970.5175,2,15746,anthony_b_ching,,3677.195,3679.456,Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.5175,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3721.899,3724.146,How can you categorize that Mr. Ching?
1970.5175,2,15746,anthony_b_ching,,3728.339,3728.757,Exactly.
1970.5175,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3728.757,3734.52,"You really can’t generalize about people who get hit by automobiles, can you?"
1970.5175,2,15746,anthony_b_ching,,3734.52,3757.54,"No, but I’m saying that Arizona has by statutory scheme providing for the uninsured motorist provision for example, and the insurance company pay off to the victims and that in the Schecter case, the court took about 76% of the motorists being insured, and therefore at least one -- three out of four victims are most likely have insurance."
1970.5175,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3764.845,3765.741,Thank you Mr. Ching.
