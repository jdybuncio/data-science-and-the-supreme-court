1987.87-339,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.26,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-339, the City of New York, City of Miami, City of Wheaton and National League of Cities versus the Federal Communications Commission."
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,18.462,20.763,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.87-339,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,226.096,232.183,Which category does the City want to--
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,232.183,233.517,All categories.
1987.87-339,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,233.517,236.969,--Have they proposed standards for all categories?
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,236.969,240.754,We have standards that were included in the contracts back in 1983.
1987.87-339,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,240.754,241.254,For all of them?
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,241.254,241.954,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-339,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,267.904,272.689,Do you think the issue is different with respect to the first category where the--
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,272.689,284.414,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because the Commission has taken a broader approach than the Court of Appeals has approved, but we think the issue is not merely with these other three categories, it's not merely--"
1987.87-339,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,284.414,289.751,"--Well, the Commission has some standards for Category I, right?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,289.751,291.834,"--Category I and none for II, III and IV."
1987.87-339,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,291.834,293.953,None for the others but how about Category I?
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,300.107,312.831,"Not really, Justice White, because under the Court of Appeals approach, they can merely through the issuance of the most minimal standard fulfill their entire regulatory responsibility."
1987.87-339,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,312.831,320.152,--And your argument is the same with respect to all of them as long as they're's not any real conflict?
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,320.152,321.436,"Yes, Justice White."
1987.87-339,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,321.436,328.09,"And if you can prove that in question in the first category, why, it goes without saying to the other categories."
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,328.09,328.84,"Yes, Justice White--"
1987.87-339,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,328.84,333.178,"We're only talking about Category I in this case, aren't we?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,333.178,334.994,"--I disagree, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,334.994,337.094,"Are you appealing II, III and IV?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,338.946,340.279,"No, we don't--"
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,340.279,343.081,"For the time being, anyway, until the FCC decides what it's going to do?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,343.081,344.997,"--No, the Court of Appeals remanded for them to consider."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.997,345.614,Right.
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,352.603,355.555,"Yes, Your Honor, because we think it's an issue of law."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.27,380.686,I didn't understand that.
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,380.686,383.722,"Where none are, there's no conflict."
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,450.415,452.181,"Mr. McGrath, will you help me with one thing?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,453.431,453.664,"Yes, sir."
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,453.664,460.518,What is the statutory provision on which the Commission relies for its authority to adopt the regulations.
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,460.518,462.368,"Okay, it's in 624(e)."
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,463.97,467.772,"And that's the sole authority that they rely on, 624(e)?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,467.772,476.444,"--Well, they've made some oblique comments indicating they may be relying upon the old Communications Act, but it's our position that that's at an end."
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,476.444,482.598,But you think they rely exclusively on 624(e)?
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,482.598,483.914,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,483.914,489.601,May I get back to what we have in front of us here?
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,520.473,532.78,"With respect, Justice Scalia, I don't think Judge Mikva agreed that there should be a remand as to how the renewal provision worked with the power under 624(e)."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.624,552.528,"But you bring before us dispositions, not legal theories, and the disposition on II, III and IV was 3 to nothing."
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,560.098,569.303,"--With respect, Justice Scalia, I believe Judge Mikva would have voted to annul the rule rather than merely to send it back for reconsideration."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.303,574.774,"Well, it's a very confusing question presented if you're seeking to bring that here too."
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,574.774,586.515,"Turning to the statutory, to the Cable Act, itself, the Commission has pointed to one of the stated purposes of the Act, that is to limit needless regulation."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.166,692.184,Where are they?
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,692.184,694.6,--In the original Act at Section 624.
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.6,695.219,I understand.
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,696.336,702.64,They're in the Appendix.
1987.87-339,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,751.037,759.976,Will you tell us where do you think 625 is and what exact sentence it is you're quoting from so we can follow it?
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,759.976,761.528,I'm sorry.
1987.87-339,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,764.713,771.2,625(a)(1) appears to be on page 120 of the Appendix.
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,771.2,777.873,Yes.
1987.87-339,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,785.027,788.996,Are we talking about the Joint Appendix?
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,788.996,791.614,"No, the appendix to the Petition, Justice O'Connor."
1987.87-339,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.614,792.098,Oh.
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,799.286,801.488,"Modification, Justice Rehnquist."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,891.629,898.117,"Mr. McGrath, what do you do about 624(e), which is on beginning at the bottom of page 118."
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,898.117,900.152,"My point is this, Justice Scalia."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.152,903.354,"Which says, let me tell you my problem with it."
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,929.588,933.973,"Justice Scalia, do you mean that the ""which"" refers back to the technical standards?"
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.973,935.973,--Right.
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,944.329,946.947,That would make their role essentially advisory.
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.319,955.802,That's right.
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,961.873,967.11,"Oh, you're reading it as limiting what can be done by the franchisers."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.11,968.51,"Well, what does it mean if it doesn't meant that?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,974.681,975.383,"Oh, no."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1000.915,1002.282,"I'm not saying, binding."
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1016.257,1019.626,"--With respect, Your Honor, only by--"
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1019.626,1026.03,"If it only means what I think you're saying, if it only means that they can issue advisory standards, you wouldn't need which a franchising--"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1026.03,1028.565,"--No, that's not our position, it's never been."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1049.229,1052.264,"--It doesn't say, which a franchising authority must require."
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1078.915,1083.569,"Well, first the actual wording of the Statute, I don't think that is a reasonable reading."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1083.569,1086.771,"Well, it says, may and not must."
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1086.771,1093.007,"With respect, Justice Scalia, it refer back to the facilities and equipment."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1100.411,1103.03,"Oh, you think the ""which"" goes with facilities and equipment?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1121.242,1128.515,--With respect... if you go back to Section 624(a)--
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1128.515,1133.684,"Well, but why do we need to go back to 624(a) when we're talking about 624(e)?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1133.684,1140.738,--All I'm trying to indicate is they frequently refer to facilities and equipment that may be required.
1987.87-339,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1152.463,1168.056,That's just a very strange... here's how the sentence reads: The FCC may establish technical standards relating to the facilities and equipment of cable systems which a franchising authority may require in the franchise.
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1180.482,1184.101,"With respect, Judge, that's our reading of the Statute."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.101,1197.742,"You mean the FCC cannot require any standards for unrequired facilities and equipment, if the people put in some facilities and equipment that haven't been specifically required by the municipality, the FCC cannot establish standards for them?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1199.527,1202.329,"Justice Scalia, the whole structure--"
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1202.329,1209.567,"It can only establish standards for required facilities and equipment and if the municipality chooses not to require any, no FCC standards apply?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1209.567,1221.726,"--Well, if no jurisdiction require particular facilities and equipment, I don't see what the purpose of them issuing the guidelines would be."
1987.87-339,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1221.726,1227.63,"It seems to me the, which, has to relate to standards and not to facilities and equipment."
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1227.63,1243.556,"Well, getting back to the... this is the only provision on which they rely, and if they're reading is given full force, they in essence read out substantial provisions of 625 and 626."
1987.87-339,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1313.486,1317.438,"We'll continue there at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. McGrath."
1987.87-339,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1317.438,1326.56,"Mr. McGrath, you may continue."
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1326.56,1328.912,"Thank you, Justice Rehnquist."
1987.87-339,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.983,1441.502,"Well, that just gives you more authority."
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1441.502,1463.098,"But if one reads 624(e) the way I believe the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia read it, we would not have the power to issue any standards unless the Commission first took the affirmative step of allowing us, in essence, passing their own regulation and then we'd be allowed to adopt that."
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.031,1488.066,"Mr. McGrath, why is that so?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1519.019,1525.173,"Justice Stevens, the main thrust of the renewal procedure is to set up a due process kind of procedure."
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.173,1525.873,I understand.
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1525.873,1542.215,"Whether or not it's absolutely impossible to make this finding, it would seem quite reasonable, and we submit compelling to be able to base the determination upon whether or not they satisfied certain kinds of standards."
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1542.215,1551.404,Do you think that this means by the same argument that the FCC must promulgate regulations dealing with billing practices and how to respond to consumer complaints?
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1551.404,1566.414,"No, Justice Stevens, my argument is just as Justice Scalia read 624(e), that the only entity that's empowered to allow technical standards to be placed into franchise agreements is the FCC."
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.459,1586.661,You mean the local.
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1599.052,1600.421,"No, our position--"
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1600.421,1608.527,"And if there's a regulation out there that says, there shall be no regulation in this area because we want the free market to set the standards, then it's inconsistent with the regulation."
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1608.527,1609.077,--No.
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1622.418,1625.286,"Well, but if they have the power... where do they get the power to issue."
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1629.238,1630.154,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1630.154,1637.844,"Why is it then that their order reads, as an amendment of the preexisting '72 rules rather than as a brand new--"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1644.831,1656.472,"Well, as I mentioned earlier in my argument, they do make references to the earlier Communications Act, but do not clearly state in their briefs that they are relying upon that Statute."
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1656.472,1658.406,--But if that Statute--
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1658.406,1661.023,"We believe to some extent that they are relying on it, and that that's improper."
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.023,1662.625,"--Now, why is that improper?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1665.411,1669.279,"Well, in essence there was no prior statute."
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.815,1676.802,"Well, do you contend that the '72 regulations were invalid, also?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1676.802,1692.729,"--Not at that time, but there's a long case load going back to Southwest Cable through the two Midwest Video cases and finally the Capital Cities case where this Court recognized that the Commission under the Communications Act had broad regulatory powers."
1987.87-339,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1732.472,1741.411,"You take the position that unless affirmative authority for an FCC regulation can be found in the Cable Act of '84, it has no such authority to regulate in this area?"
1987.87-339,0,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,1741.411,1744.446,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's our position."
1987.87-339,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1751.183,1753.302,"Thank you, Mr. McGrath."
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1755.035,1761.908,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.87-339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.082,1905.433,Do you understand them to be before us?
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1905.433,1913.789,--I had not understood them to be before the Court except in the spillover effect that would necessarily occur from the decision here.
1987.87-339,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2073.341,2080.447,You also would not agree with the reading of 624(e) that I was suggesting earlier?
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2080.447,2095.124,"I would agree with it entirely, Mr. Justice, with the possible exception that it starts off saying the Commission may establish technical standards."
1987.87-339,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.011,2133.665,"You don't think anything about Classes II, III and IV is here?"
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2133.665,2136.049,"Not directly, no, sir."
1987.87-339,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.049,2136.617,Directly?
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2144.688,2147.723,"I agree with that, Mr. Justice White."
1987.87-339,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2147.723,2160.899,"Yes, Mr. Wallace, but is it not true that your theory might make a difference, does it depend on the existence of some Federal standard, there's some minimal Federal standard under Title I for Title I but not under Titles II, III and IV, isn't that the point?"
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2160.899,2162.199,That is correct.
1987.87-339,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2162.199,2171.355,"And the question I have in my mind is whether we agree with you on Title I, do we just leave open the question on Title II, III and IV, or will we necessarily have decided that?"
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2171.355,2176.409,"Well, I think you do leave it open because we did not petition from the remand."
1987.87-339,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2176.409,2197.339,"I'm not questioning about the remand but the question I have is whether without promulgating any technical standards at all, could the FCC under the statute say we think the best way to achieve quality signals and all the rest of it is by letting the free market have full play, and simply say, we will promulgate none, and we forbid the states and franchises."
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2197.339,2210.415,"That's what the Commission did with respect to II, III and IV, and we argued in the Court of Appeals that we could do that, and they said not without explaining how that relates to the franchising process."
1987.87-339,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2214.284,2220.521,"But my question is whether you would still make the same legal... because if you're right on that, this is an awfully easy case."
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2224.057,2230.294,We're not arguing it that way because that question is back before the Commission and the Commission has not spoken yet.
1987.87-339,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.294,2238.399,"Yes, but now can you win on Class I on the ground that you are urging without winning on II, III and IV?"
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2238.399,2256.278,"Well, on Class I, the Commission has prescribed technical standards within the meaning of 624(e) on page 118 of the Appendix, which says, the Commission may establish technical standards."
1987.87-339,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2268.052,2276.707,"Well, but I thought you were trying to defend, and I think you do, the power of the Commission to preempt."
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2289.165,2294.086,But we have not argued that in this Court.
1987.87-339,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.294,2311.364,"Well, doesn't that go to the power of the Commission to preempt?"
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2320.32,2343.484,"Well, the forum of the regulation that is before the Court here is a form that includes an explicit preemption provision but that form is encountered in a situation where a Federal Agency has concluded that certain options should be preserved for the regulated industry."
1987.87-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2377.923,2398.57,"Well, I guess, Mr. Wallace, you're also taking the position that even apart from the regulation adopted by the FCC preempting that any promulgation of standards by the FCC would effectively preclude the franchising authority from having stricter standards?"
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2398.57,2403.057,"If, it would depend on--"
1987.87-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2403.057,2404.424,You are arguing both things?
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2405.207,2423.202,"--It would depend on if the Commission told cable casters, these are the standards that you must use, and you can't deviate from them up or down, then that would preclude a requirement that would require them--"
1987.87-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2423.202,2429.173,"Well, what if all the FCC did was adopt some standards without telling anybody anything else?"
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2429.173,2443.949,"--Then that would leave an ambiguity which is not present in this case, and might lead to the conclusion that the FCC did not mean to preempt local authority from applying a more stringent standard."
1987.87-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2444.551,2456.859,"Now, as I understand it, you take the position that the reason the FCC wants to promulgate standards of this type is to encourage competition?"
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2458.759,2468.0,"--Well, to encourage the development of the cable industry including in the competitive environment, yes."
1987.87-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2471.535,2485.878,"At the renewal stage, I gather it makes no difference if there's another cable company that can put out a stronger better signal and meet high standards?"
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2485.878,2496.317,"But what the Commission's reports and orders, both in '74 and in '85 said is that we're dealing with a national market for this equipment."
1987.87-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2503.138,2514.446,"Well, I gather the competition only occurs in the first instance of granting a franchise, not at the renewal stage."
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2515.397,2531.24,"Well, there can be competitive applicants for renewal, but one of the things that the '84 Act did was to limit the discretion of local authorities to deny renewals."
1987.87-339,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2537.311,2554.523,"And today under that amendment now a franchising authority could not deny renewal because it had a better offer from some other company offering stronger and better facilities, equipment, and signals?"
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2554.523,2558.49,It could not.
1987.87-339,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2685.823,2689.394,"Mr. Wallace, what about the renewal procedure?"
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2715.01,2737.458,"If the local system concluded that notwithstanding these 200,000 complaints the cable system is in fact complying with the FCC standards, then its only option would be to go to the Agency and say these standards are inadequate."
1987.87-339,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2754.337,2757.104,"Well, what if the standards prove to produce snow in every locality?"
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2757.104,2778.535,"--But the standards are defined in terms of what the subscriber will receive, the poorest located subscriber, and because the signal is coming through cable, it isn't affected by terrain or configuration of buildings, so that if complaints were to be received in one place, comparable complaints presumably would be received elsewhere."
1987.87-339,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2778.535,2782.737,You say the standards are described in terms of what the person sees on their set?
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2782.737,2783.454,That is correct.
1987.87-339,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2823.148,2829.568,"Mr. Wallace, may I ask you a question about the statutory authority which I think is the bottom line here for the regulation."
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2869.277,2870.527,"Not necessarily, because the Commission, you might adopt standards, but--"
1987.87-339,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2870.527,2874.562,"I still would like an answer to the question, if there is one."
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2874.562,2898.01,"--Well, one answer is 624(e) itself could be interpreted to say that the Commission could decide that zero is the technical standard that may be required in the franchise."
1987.87-339,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2968.107,2970.623,302 is a Section of the '84 Act?
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2970.623,2973.225,"No, it is a section of the '34 Act."
1987.87-339,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2973.225,2980.664,"Okay, so that you do contend that we need not look entirely to the '84 Act in order to find the statutory--"
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2980.664,2981.28,No.
1987.87-339,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2984.232,2984.948,--I understand that.
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2992.402,2997.79,We think the authority is there as it was there for the '74 report and order.
1987.87-339,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3009.097,3016.584,And therefore the '84 Act did not withdraw any authority that previously existed under your view?
1987.87-339,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3016.584,3018.303,No.
1987.87-339,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3039.383,3041.752,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1987.87-339,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3043.436,3058.863,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.87-339,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3176.107,3181.575,That made a lot of sense to me until I realized these standards you're talking about are performance standards.
1987.87-339,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3199.121,3203.925,"Well, they are performance standards that involve obviously a technical component."
1987.87-339,3,41771,stephen_j_mcgrath,,3595.278,3596.678,"Thank you, Chief Justice."
1987.87-339,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3741.54,3744.13,"Thank you, Mr. McGrath."
