1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.943,-- is submitted.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,28.69,31.919,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,152.275,157.466,The conspiracies here are conspiracy to import and conspiracy to distribute.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,157.466,158.22,Yes (Voice Overlap)
1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,158.22,160.873,Nothing about simple possession?
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,160.873,166.677,"No, they were charged as simply a conspiracy to import and a separate count of conspiracy to distribute."
1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,169.943,170.269,Right.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,170.394,173.622,-- and the Court would have found a single conspiracy.
1980.79-1709,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,254.085,258.741,What do you have going for you here besides the rule of lenity?
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,258.741,286.249,"As -- the legislative history provides an affirmative explanation for the existence of the two separate conspiracy provisions that has nothing to do with any intent to impose multiple punishments for a single conspiracy that has two objectives that happened to fall on each side of the subchapter line, an artificially divided subchapter line."
1980.79-1709,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,286.249,292.082,But that would not be an argument that relies on the Braverman case.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,292.082,310.857,"No, this is a question of congressional intent of using the legislative history to support -- to show that there is no affirmative congressional intent to impose multiple punishments or that at best, it is so ambiguous that the rule of lenity must be applied to --"
1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,310.857,316.359,Is the inquiry pretty much the same as in Simpson and Busic?
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,316.359,318.078,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,318.078,325.131,Isn't the rule of lenity a discretionary concept or how would you describe that?
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,325.131,351.401,"Well, I suggest that it has constitutional overtones in terms of being based on a desire not to impose punishment -- additional punishment unless Congress has spoken clearly and unambiguously, unless Congress has provided fair and clear adequate warning, which an adequate warning in clarity is an integral part of due process of law."
1980.79-1709,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,351.401,355.415,But of course you don't impose punishment initially.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,355.415,356.032,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1980.79-1709,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,356.032,362.931,You don't impose punishment initially unless Congress has spoken clearly and ambiguously.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,392.868,406.139,But this goes beyond that to go beyond the situation where a statute is facially void for vagueness to a situation where it's the application of two statutes to a particular factual situation rather than --
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,406.139,422.243,"Ms. Mizner, the hypothesis for the application of the rule of lenity has to be that it's ambiguous whether a course of conduct constitutes one offense or two."
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,426.777,427.144,Well -- I --
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,427.144,437.514,"And -- and if -- and if there is uncertainty, then the rule of lenity requires that a court find that the intent was to -- impose only one punishment, isn't that it?"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,437.514,462.203,"Well, it goes beyond that because Congress may well have not intended to impose multiple punishments where two statutes that under a strict application may not be technically the same offense when those two offenses occur in the same criminal episode or the same criminal transaction, Congress might not have intended multiple punishment."
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,462.203,463.103,"Well, exactly."
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,467.243,467.365,No.
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,467.365,482.987,"-- which is an absolute prohibition and the rule of lenity simply says that when it's not clear that two offenses were intended, then it shall be presumed that there is only one, isn't that it?"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,482.987,498.134,"Well, I think it's -- it's more than that --- than a strict application of two offenses or one offense under -- it depends how you're defining that equation."
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,502.155,503.808,"Well, maybe they're not that --"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,503.808,503.964,But then it --
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,503.964,513.64,-- unless Congress -- if it's not clear that Congress intended that two separate punishments be imposed then regardless of any Blockburger test --
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,513.64,513.789,That's right.
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.789,515.365,-- then the rule of lenity says only one --
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,515.365,515.424,Only one.
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,515.424,516.299,-- should be imposed.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,517.006,518.279,That -- that is our position.
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,518.975,521.514,"Well, that -- that is the rule of lenity, isn't it?"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,521.514,521.793,Yes.
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,521.793,528.957,And its hypothesis is that there be an ambiguity as to whether one or two punishments are to be imposed.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,528.957,532.09,Yes.
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,532.307,538.74,And you say there's an obvious ambiguity here because the -- the court said or construed it'll come out in different ways.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,538.74,540.376,That's one indicia of ambiguity.
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,540.376,544.31,And that's one -- one clear indicium of -- of ambiguity.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,544.31,552.364,And another indicium is the way that the Government has treated prosecutions that involve this -- this type of conspiracy --
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.364,552.749,Yes.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,552.749,553.922,-- charging them both in one count --
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,553.922,554.748,Right.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,554.748,556.018,-- and in two counts.
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,556.018,556.347,Right.
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,556.347,570.532,Would you say that we begin to think about turning our minds to the rule of lenity and about the same situation that we turned to the legislative history if we find ambiguity in the statute but not otherwise?
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,570.532,579.261,"Well, I believe that you can look at the legislative history even if the language is -- is clear on its face but I believe that here --"
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,579.261,581.698,"Well, we can but do we?"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,585.574,585.875,"No, it's -- it's a discretion, Your Honor."
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,585.875,587.792,-- the statute is clear.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,592.824,607.439,"Well, but this is the -- the kind of case we are talking about the -- not the plain meaning, not the facial clarity of the words themselves, but their joint and simultaneous application to a particular fact context."
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,607.439,621.336,"Well, If the language of the statue, to go back to Justice Stewart's discussion with you, if the plain meaning of the statute is apparent, do we look either to the legislative history or have you given any thought about the rule of lenity?"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,621.336,623.847,We don't have that situation here because the --
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,623.847,626.108,"Well, I didn't ask you whether we had it."
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,632.136,638.629,"Well, in that case I'll suggest that if it's plain to some and not to others then there's an ambiguity that must be resolved by looking at --"
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,638.629,638.969,But the ones who do --
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,638.969,640.23,-- the legislative history.
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,640.23,647.263,-- the people who think it's plain would -- are not likely to agree that there's an ambiguity.
1980.79-1709,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,647.263,668.806,"Are you contending then that out of the 93 judicial districts in the United States, if you can find one district judge to say that it's ambiguous, the rule of lenity applies because we have one judge saying it's ambiguous even though 92 others say it's not ambiguous?"
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,668.806,675.313,"I'm saying that might be one indicia of ambiguity, but here -- but here we have more than that."
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,713.343,724.774,"When you say that -- you say there's a single criminal episode, a person may be convicted, therefore a conspiracy without norm, is that not so?"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,724.774,725.485,That's true.
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,725.485,732.386,"And then if the conspiracy is executed that's a separate crime, isn't it?"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,732.386,733.199,Yes.
1980.79-1709,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,837.287,850.37,But doesn't that in itself suggest that the House perceived that importation and distribution pose distinct social evils?
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,850.37,850.809,No.
1980.79-1709,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,905.027,911.03,"Well, you would explain it in a way than purely on a committee structure of the House of Representatives?"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,911.03,925.183,I would suggest that that is -- that is an affirmative explanation as to why there are two separate provisions as opposed to the one that is proposed by the administration and it went through the Senate.
1980.79-1709,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,937.308,939.384,"Well, could I -- I interrupt you at that point?"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,942.46,943.785,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1709,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,943.785,948.014,Would you turn to page 19.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,948.014,948.232,Right I notice the --
1980.79-1709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,948.232,948.756,We're going to make --

1980.79-1709,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,950.334,952.105,And indeed it is and I'd like you to give it to me.

1980.79-1709,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,960.516,962.069,You can do it afterward but I'd like you to if you would --

1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,964.82,964.89,Certainly.
1980.79-1709,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,964.89,966.64,-- to give us that specific citation.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,966.64,967.282,I shall.
1980.79-1709,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,967.282,975.586,I'll confess -- I tried to find it in the cursory examination and I would like it.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,975.586,989.255,I will provide that tomorrow.
1980.79-1709,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1042.887,1047.365,"Ms. Mizner, let -- let me pose a hypothetical."
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1069.076,1093.602,"Well, I suggest that because of the interplay of two factors, one of which is the unique -- somewhat unique aspect of conspiracy law and the other is the fact that importation and distribution are basically two integrally-related and almost inseparable offenses in most circumstances --"
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1093.602,1096.374,"Well, what if the person was importing for his own use?"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1096.374,1099.391,I suggest that that's a very rare --

1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1100.369,1102.021,What difference does it make whether it's rare or --
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1102.021,1102.336,-- And --
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1102.336,1105.708,-- uncommon?
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1108.78,1109.437,"Yes, it is a crime --"
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1109.437,1110.159,And --
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1110.159,1110.414,-- to import for your own use.
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1110.414,1114.865,-- to sell some to some other people.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1116.289,1120.215,"Yes, but we're talking about conspiracy which is simply the agreement."
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1120.215,1130.683,"Well, I was addressing myself to your thought that -- that there is no difference between importing for your own personal use and importing for a distribution to --"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1130.683,1132.685,I'm -- I'm not suggesting that there's no difference.
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1139.19,1140.451,"Well, of course they're related."
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1145.166,1145.943,"Well, it's -- it would be --"
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1145.943,1149.278,But you're not suggesting they can't be made two separate crimes.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1149.278,1149.874,"Oh no, no."
1980.79-1709,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1200.035,1215.513,"Well then you would really require a metaphysical approach to the thing as it -- that there is only a certain atom or that you can't split atoms of crime, something to that effect."
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1215.513,1227.338,"Well, I'm saying that -- that conspiracy is kind of a -- a different animal, particularly this kind of conspiracy where you don't need, under the drug statute, you don't even need an overt act."
1980.79-1709,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1243.203,1247.253,And you don't claim that -- that there's anything wrong with that statute?
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1247.253,1248.188,No.
1980.79-1709,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1426.603,1429.759,"Well, I -- I don't entirely follow that."
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1461.391,1472.098,"Well, I'm -- you can -- I'm saying that the presumption as it stands is in accord with a number of those other protections afforded to a defendant such as --"
1980.79-1709,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1472.098,1476.016,Has this Court ever said so?
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1476.016,1477.907,Specifically?
1980.79-1709,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1477.907,1478.342,Yes.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1482.991,1495.764,I cannot recall any -- any specific language but I suggest that it does work out to be that way.
1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1508.002,1511.407,I must confess I'm not sure I follow your one-way argument.

1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1524.609,1525.718,And it's up to the prosecutor.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1525.718,1528.325,-- may have the power to prosecute under each.
1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1528.325,1533.353,You don't need affirmative evidence of an intent to allow him to do it other than the fact that the Congress passed two statutes.
1980.79-1709,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1533.353,1535.901,That's right.
1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1535.901,1541.359,"So, why is it different from say speeding and throwing a bomb out the window but he does it in one transaction?"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1550.483,1569.618,"Well, I suggest that where you're talking about two offenses that are violated in one criminal episode, you may very well have to look at whether Congress intended -- if the crimes are related in some sense that they be punished consecutively."
1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1583.469,1588.814,"Well, what difference would it make if they -- if they punish them for both but they've imposed concurrent sentences?"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1597.694,1597.74,Well --
1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1597.74,1597.938,-- can see --
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1597.938,1600.102,-- consecutive sentences have a very different impact.
1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1600.102,1600.352,"Oh, yes, but -- but --"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1600.352,1601.276,-- on the occurrence for instance.

1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1619.507,1619.739,"Well, I --"
1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1619.739,1621.583,You should just pick one or the other.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1621.583,1627.378,"Well, you have to give the trier of fact the opportunity to determine which of those two offenses if they're not the same --"
1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1627.378,1633.376,"Well, I know but you can -- seem to concede that he could impose punishments for both as long as he made them concurrent."
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1633.376,1633.647,No.
1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1634.507,1635.317,Oh --
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1635.317,1640.583,I'm saying that you may be punished only once for that offense.
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1640.583,1649.947,"And I thought your further argument was, going back a little further, you can be convicted of only one or am I might mistaken about that?"
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1649.947,1651.915,I would -- the jury may come back --
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1651.915,1653.17,You could be tried on --
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1653.17,1653.603,Judgment --
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1653.603,1653.655,-- both.

1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1654.995,1655.331,Both.
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1663.101,1663.84,"Right, in the Court --"
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1663.84,1666.232,Is -- isn't that your argument?
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1666.232,1669.97,I don't believe that we had to go that far.
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1678.938,1683.134,Even though the jury finds a violation of two separate criminal statutes?
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1683.134,1688.593,Even though the jury finds two separate statutory violations that are in fact one --
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1688.593,1688.9,And brings out --
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1688.9,1689.079,-- offense.
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1689.079,1690.613,"-- a verdict of convictions, two convictions."
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1690.613,1693.982,And bring us a verdict back of guilty on both counts.
1980.79-1709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1694.335,1695.371,On each of two counts?
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1695.371,1700.453,"Right, the Court can only impose sentence on one."
1980.79-1709,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1700.453,1701.911,"Well, that -- that will be in effect then."
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1708.979,1710.966,"Well, it doesn't go as far."
1980.79-1709,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1710.966,1716.67,"So you're just -- so far, I just heard you argue statutory construction."
1980.79-1709,0,31679,judith_h_mizner,,1716.67,1730.972,We've got -- I did respond to double jeopardy in one question there and I would like to reserve the rest of my time and hopefully respond to that.
1980.79-1709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1730.972,1734.727,Mr. Levy?
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1734.727,1737.991,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1901.791,1904.104,"Well, what if -- what if it were not the case?"
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1913.603,1915.462,I think one would assume or presume that.
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1915.462,1916.653,That's been the rule.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1922.211,1923.753,"I think that's correct, but I think Blockburger --"
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1923.753,1924.909,"And other cases, but --"
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1924.909,1925.212,I think they look --
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1925.212,1927.322,"-- it looks the other way, if they're different punishments."
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1927.322,1929.203,I think it looks in both directions.
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1929.203,1929.649,Yes.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1929.649,1930.218,I agree.
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1930.395,1937.311,"And so -- so, a part of this case is whether these are the same or different offenses."
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1937.311,1946.422,"Well, the question on the first part of the case is whether the statutes authorize consecutive sentences which we submit is resolved in the first instance by application of the Blockburger rule."
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1946.422,1948.976,Well that's -- that's on the assumption that if they're separate offenses.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1948.976,1953.311,We think the Blockburger rule in that terminology is the means to determine whether they are separate --
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1953.311,1953.412,Yes.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1953.412,1954.548,-- offenses or the same offense.
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1954.739,1956.894,Do you think your colleague agrees with that or not?
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1956.894,1957.864,"No, I believe not."
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1958.406,1964.277,"So a part of this case, is I suggest, again, is whether -- whether these are separate or the same offenses."
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1964.277,1967.777,I will only take issue with the characterization of whether they are separate or the same offenses.
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1981.459,1982.93,"Well, I'll put it the other way then."
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,1990.186,1990.562,That's right.
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2021.342,2042.807,"But I'd suppose you'd -- I -- I suppose that even if it were decided that these were the same offenses, if they -- if they were tried together and the sentences -- consecutive sentences imposed in the same proceeding, the Government would suggest that there's no double jeopardy problem."
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2042.807,2043.844,Certainly.
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2045.141,2045.242,Okay.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2045.242,2054.123,-- by the end of my argument but we think we agree with petitioners in the sense that the first issue in the case for the Court to resolve is whether the statutes authorize the consecutive sentences.
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2079.507,2090.989,"I -- I think my question was, wasn't it, whether or not the same inquiries that were made in Simpson and Busic and Whalen had to be made to resolve a question here."
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2090.989,2093.446,"Well, the question in the end was the same, whether the statutes authorize --"

1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2094.888,2096.527,I think that's all I said.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2096.527,2102.793,"In that sense, we agree with you but we think the analysis of the particular case here is much different than the one the Court employed in those cases."

1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2156.64,2156.757,Exactly.

1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.501,2171.511,Yes.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2171.511,2174.265,-- based on a specific legislative history and statute involved in the case.
1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.265,2182.275,"What sort -- what -- what would rebut such a presumption, something that is expressed in the Congress and even though it's a lesser included offense we want to be p -- multiple punishment to be permitted?"
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2182.275,2183.156,"That would be one illustration, for example."
1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.156,2185.415,It'd be a very clear evidence of legislative intent.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2185.415,2185.664,Right.
1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.441,2199.483,Was that Simpson?
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2199.483,2203.608,We think it's not because Simpson involved only a discrete class of felony as to contain their own enhancement of provisions.

1980.79-1709,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2363.663,2372.682,That was under your argument that these people could have been prosecuted for three crimes under one conspiracy because I suppose they also violated the general conspiracy statute.

1980.79-1709,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2399.601,2402.797,Do these statutes require proof on an overt act?
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2402.797,2406.969,"The lower courts consistently, as far as I know, had held that they do not."

1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2416.061,2416.244,Well --
1980.79-1709,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2416.244,2417.95,This would not have to prove under this.

1980.79-1709,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2476.995,2478.242,Yes.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2478.242,2481.441,And the Court would look among other things to the specific history and provisions --
1980.79-1709,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2481.441,2481.67,Right.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2481.67,2488.35,"-- at issue and determine the question of congressional intent, but that problem is not here today."
1980.79-1709,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2502.933,2503.098,Yes.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2503.62,2524.168,"Importation of a controlled substance not only poses a societal harm relating to drug trafficking and the increased availability of the illegal drugs, but it also involves a breach of the sovereign borders of the United States and an interference with the Government's authority to regulate commerce across those borders."
1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2640.51,2650.228,"Mr. Levy, do you have any comment on the opposition's reliance on Senator Dodd's statement?"
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2650.228,2662.983,"Well, we have a citation on our brief to a similar statement by a -- by a representative saying that the bill that was enacted was essentially the House version rather than a Senate version and I think that's supported by the conference report."
1980.79-1709,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2692.205,2700.052,"Mr. Levy, do you see anything to the petition's position that this was argued as a one conspiracy case?"
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2700.052,2701.026,"No, I don't believe so."
1980.79-1709,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2734.508,2745.702,So that if Congress passed the bill that if you -- he brought a gun for the purpose of shooting somebody and then shot somebody.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2754.427,2766.61,"I believe it could, because there are two separate evils and Congress has the right particularly in an area like gun control to an absent of sentences, stiff provisions."
1980.79-1709,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2778.327,2778.733,I see.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2778.733,2789.215,"However, the history they emphasize is not inconsistent with and does not foreclose consecutive sentences pursuant to sections 846 and 963."
1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.609,2844.294,"On the other hand, the -- the bill that came over from the administration of the Congress had merely one of conspiracy provision that it didn't deal."
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2844.294,2845.483,That is correct.
1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2845.483,2853.333,And that isn't it surprising that therefore to end up were two penalties that there isn't something positive in the legislative history?
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,2853.333,2855.588,"Well, one would hope that Congress would address the question."
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3059.216,3066.962,"Mr. Levy, do I correctly understanding that it -- if this statute in Section 1 it said, “Importing is bad” and Section 2 said, “Distribution is bad.”"
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3080.017,3090.175,"Now, I think one would have to follow a different analysis and I -- I believe that -- that Braverman likely would -- would certainly be highly illuminating if not controlling in those circumstances."
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3098.013,3100.459,"So, you didn't have anything beside the face of the statute (Voice overlap)"
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3100.459,3100.884,That is right.
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3115.538,3123.814,"Now, my question is whether you could punish the conspiracy twice because it had two separate objects in that situation I gave you."
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3124.595,3126.152,My assumption is that one could not.
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3126.152,3128.304,Yes because there's only one prohibition against the conspiracy.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3128.304,3132.85,"That is correct, and that was essentially the analysis that was followed in Braverman, but that is not a constitutional requirement."
1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3132.85,3137.419,You mean unless Congress -- unless Congress said so.
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3137.419,3138.057,That's right.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3138.057,3149.672,"Exactly, but absent and some specific indication I think the -- the strong inference would be that the single conspiracy provision could only give rise to one sentence."
1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3253.47,3258.632,And I suppose you'd say -- say that satisfies the Blockburger test.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3262.576,3263.131,I'm not sure.
1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3264.898,3265.21,Yes.
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3265.21,3267.975,I think that raises an entirely distinct question.
1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3267.975,3280.772,"Well, it may be but I -- but I say if they if -- if each requires proof of a -- of a fact that the other one doesn't, they can be tried separately, can't they?"
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3280.772,3283.184,The statute would allow them to be tried separately.
1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3283.184,3284.501,How about the double jeopardy?
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3284.501,3288.822,"That would be an additional question, one that isn't present here, where there are successive prosecutions."
1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.822,3290.68,What question would it be?
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3290.68,3291.049,Excuse me?
1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3291.049,3292.657,What question would it be?
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3292.657,3294.739,Whether successive prosecutions rather than --
1980.79-1709,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3294.739,3296.602,For different offenses?
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3296.602,3306.632,"Yes, that would be the question whether the offenses are the same or different offenses, and even if they were different offenses as the court held, for example, in Harris versus Oklahoma and In re Nielsen."
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3323.669,3332.463,"Although I recognize your stressing the use of Blockburger as a statutory construction aid, you don't deny that it has some relevance to the constitutional inquiry, do you?"
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3332.463,3336.034,"Well, the court has on occasion indicated that Blockburger has some --"
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3336.034,3339.343,"I mean a lot of the stuff for many years, that was the constitutional standard."
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3340.78,3341.83,I don't deny that for many years (Voice overlap)
1980.79-1709,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3341.83,3345.354,"And so, it might still be -- have some relevance to the constitutional question."
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3345.354,3359.244,"It might still have some relevance although, as the Court well knows from our brief in Whalen, we believe that the double jeopardy issue in that context is no different from the question of whether the legislature has authorized multiple punishments."
1980.79-1709,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3359.244,3363.808,"Blockburger anyway, did not originate as a constitutional doctrine."
1980.79-1709,1,36246,mark_i_levy,,3363.808,3364.191,It did not.
1980.79-1709,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3580.858,3585.569,"Very well, you have just one moment remaining, one minute remaining counsel."
1980.79-1709,2,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3585.569,3592.996,"In that one minute, I would just simply like to say that we do contest the applicability of Blockburger."
1980.79-1709,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3665.346,3674.055,Do you think that anti-criminal -- anti-drug statutes are to be construed much more strictly than drug statutes?
1980.79-1709,2,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3674.055,3674.228,No.
1980.79-1709,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3704.564,3705.858,I am not sure I follow you.
1980.79-1709,2,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3722.611,3723.669,"No, I'm suggesting --"
1980.79-1709,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3723.669,3726.986,Which was -- which is the more offensive to society?
1980.79-1709,2,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3726.986,3728.506,"What on -- no, it's not a --"
1980.79-1709,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3728.506,3729.053,Why is there is no difference?
1980.79-1709,2,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3729.053,3733.215,-- question of which is more offensive to society.
1980.79-1709,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3760.719,3761.64,Thank you.
1980.79-1709,2,31679,judith_h_mizner,,3761.64,3762.454,Thank you.
