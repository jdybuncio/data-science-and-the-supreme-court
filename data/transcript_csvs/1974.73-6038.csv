1974.73-6038,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,24.599,"We'll hear argument next in Drope against Missouri, the state of Missouri."
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,28.418,31.318,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-6038,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,103.122,111.411,"Did the Missouri Court of Appeals from which you have certiorari now, regard both of those issues as open for it's consideration?"
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,111.411,115.658,"Yes it did Mr. Justice, absolutely."
1974.73-6038,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,157.873,171.701,"Well, you acknowledge I suppose that a person could be mentally ill, seriously insane, whatever that term means, can still be competent to stand trial?"
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,171.701,177.59,"Well, the question here Your Honor is whether there was a reasonable doubt about the competency to stand trial in a court."
1974.73-6038,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,177.59,180.332,But I am just talking about the distinction between the two?
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,180.332,183.326,I think there is ground for claim that there is a distinction.
1974.73-6038,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,183.326,200.646,"If that was not so, you would some problem about every verdict that was not guilty by reason of insanity because the -- if you reason that way then the critic would demonstrate that the person shouldn't have been tried in the first place."
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,200.646,209.743,"Tired in the first place, yes Your Honor, but the only question here on the first point is whether there is a reasonable doubt under Pate against Robinson."
1974.73-6038,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,286.301,289.829,And what was the date of that examination in relation to the trial of Mr. Drope?
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,289.829,295.638,"That examination was on February 20, the trial was in June."
1974.73-6038,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,367.096,369.606,Mr. Walsh who was the state judge?
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,369.606,386.172,"The state judge was David McMillan of circuit court of the city of St Louis Mr. Justice and at that point, a specific record was made by the counsel against proceeding, but the trial commenced at that point."
1974.73-6038,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,453.001,458.046,Now what they -- how long -- had the trial had been going out a bit at this time?
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,458.046,463.087,This was -- the trial began in the afternoon of the 23 with the swearing of the jury.
1974.73-6038,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,469.494,475.021,"And this was when, he apprehended that he might have to appear, that day was it or --"
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,475.021,478.423,The state still had four witnesses to go.
1974.73-6038,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,488.457,491.08,How long was he in the hospital after that?
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,491.08,492.43,"Twenty one days, Mr. Justice."
1974.73-6038,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,598.522,601.288,Now their examination was how long after the actual trial?
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,601.288,603.196,They never actually examined him.
1974.73-6038,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,604.71,606.86,I see.
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,606.86,610.769,"They didn't examine them before, in this we have to proceed hypothetically."
1974.73-6038,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,708.339,719.065,"But there is again counsel, let's try to keep these thing separated, a person could be very much in need of psychiatric help and still be competent to stand trial, don't you concede that?"
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,719.065,721.823,I don't think so Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-6038,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,738.951,751.138,"There are countless cases, hundreds of them, where psychiatrists have reported in pre-trial, that the defendant is mentally sick, he is in need of psychiatric care, but he is competent to stand trial."
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,751.138,756.366,"That may well be, Your Honor, but we should have had that opportunity here to have a psychiatrist tell us that."
1974.73-6038,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,756.366,759.576,I am only going to the standard now.
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,769.612,770.161,One of many --
1974.73-6038,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,770.161,771.704,-- and order the examination.
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,771.704,774.383,"Absolutely, one of many Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-6038,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.535,784.585,Do you contend that if anyone is said to be in need of psychiatric help the trial can't proceed until a psychiatrist gives his okay?
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,784.585,790.728,"Well, as a general rule, I don't know that, that is -- I think that is the practice in the federal courts."
1974.73-6038,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,850.132,859.547,"There are cases where psychiatric testimony is on one side, and lay testimony on the other, and the court has decided to favor the lay testimony and on appeal it has been upheld."
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,863.338,869.864,"That's right, yes Mr. Justice, but again, he is entitled constitutionally to that psychiatric exam and then --"
1974.73-6038,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,869.864,880.42,Your emphasis is only on whether the said circumstances were such as to require that hearing and the examination by a psychiatrist to determine his competency to stand trial?
1974.73-6038,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,881.276,887.178,You don't suggest that every time some one needs a psychiatrist that means automatically there has to be such a determination there?
1974.73-6038,0,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,887.178,889.004,"No, well I don't think we have to get to that in facts to this case."
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,1583.901,1587.359,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-6038,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1623.482,1629.943,"Well, wasn't the Court in Pate when using the word bona fide doubt simply referring to a provision in the Illinois statute?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,1635.543,1636.877,I believe that's right Your Honor.
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1783.24,1786.016,I don't find that on Page 11 now.
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,1786.016,1792.947,"The psychosis statement Your Honor is on page 12, approximately three-fourth of the way down the page."
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1892.497,1913.106,It was the this reading of psychiatrist report that it is not a typical report on examination directly to determine the competency to stand trial it seems to be -- seems almost to avoid that issue.
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,1913.106,1916.505,"Right, Mr. Chief Justice it does not address itself to that problem."
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1916.505,1918.506,Where is the request?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,1924.534,1924.883,No sir.
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1932.161,1936.513,And he have no specific directions so far as this record shows from the counsel?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,1936.513,1952.152,"No Your Honor, he did not and it's quite obvious from the report that he did not proceed under the Missouri Statute which sets out certain requirements and certain findings there must be made in a psychiatric report."
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2302.991,2308.924,"What about the defense counsel, I don't recall whether I saw any thing in the record of about his views on the matter?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2310.817,2324.172,"Mr. Chief Justice he is testimony is conspicuous by his absence, but I think petitioner's counsel at this stage attempted to get in touch with Mr. Watson and was unable to do so."
1974.73-6038,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2385.089,2398.425,Mr MacFarlane I suppose that the easiest thing to do would have been to give him the examination promptly at the course of the trial as Mr. Justice White suggests than we wouldn't have the case here.
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2398.425,2409.807,"Your Honor, he was given a hearing at the motion for new trial, on his motion for a new trial which went only to absence from the trial, it did not going to his mental competency at all."
1974.73-6038,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2420.542,2433.083,Did the state oppose at that time or statement was made that the state was willing to have the examination pre trial and is this always been in state's position?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2433.083,2445.121,"This is the position of the circuit attorney's office in the city of St. Louis, either prosecuting attorney's office could not follow this policy, but there is nothing in the record that indicate they would oppose it."
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2445.121,2449.528,They have a staff psychiatrist on this court?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2449.528,2456.772,The court does not have staff psychiatric that I know but there are several State Hospitals where persons are sent.
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2456.772,2459.164,It could have been done very easily.
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2459.164,2462.254,Without too much trouble Your Honor.
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2462.254,2467.918,It ducted a Lum testify at the post trial hearing or did he?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2467.918,2472.05,Yes he did Your Honor.
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2476.631,2478.31,150 I think it is.
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2482.109,2497.465,"Right, it was at the hearing on the collateral tact of 27.26 motion and it appears in that he did examine the petitioner some four-five years previously, for some."
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2497.465,2524.954,"And history repeats three or four times a man who is conducted himself the way, this defendant or this petitioner had conducted himself is in serious psychiatric condition and needs psychiatric help, but does he any where in that testimony express an opinion that his competence to stand trial."
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2526.936,2549.68,"Your Honor, I think he does and the reason for this maybe that the Dr. Lum is or was it that time an employee of the state, working at Malcom Bliss Hospital and he would test people, test defendants for their competency so he will be much more aware of the standard to be applied."
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2557.326,2561.621,Neither of those goes to directly to the competence to stand trial?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2561.621,2578.484,"No, no of course it does not Your Honor, and that is a point of the State of Missouri that there is really nothing in the record that points to the lack of ability of the petitioner to assist his counsel and to proceed in a rational manner."
1974.73-6038,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2621.571,2624.116,How do you know that?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2629.216,2649.607,"On page 63 and this was during the trial, there was very little on page 63, it just said that the court has already decided that matter with proceed to trial, but then only motion for new trial it came out that the court had called the police and police had checked out the story of petitioner's trial counsel and they found that he had indeed shot himself and that he is in the hospital."
1974.73-6038,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2657.647,2659.543,Are the proceedings of the motion for new trial here?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2659.543,2660.908,"Yes, they are here, Your Honor."
1974.73-6038,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2660.908,2665.571,Were is that contained --
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2665.571,2669.385,"It begins on page 67, I'm not sure exactly on which page."
1974.73-6038,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2669.385,2676.734,"Oh, that's all right."
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2676.734,2684.885,At any rate the court was aware of the reason why the petitioner was absent from trial before proceeding.
1974.73-6038,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2692.862,2696.37,How do you define a capital case?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2696.37,2701.201,"In this case, Your Honor, because he could have been sentenced the death sentence I think this would be a capital offense."
1974.73-6038,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2701.201,2704.285,One where a death penalty might be imposed under this statute?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2704.285,2707.383,"Right, right."
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2853.023,2861.968,Do you have any case in which life imprisonment was given in absentia?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2861.968,2866.271,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2872.68,2875.878,"Allen was the man in the courtroom, wrecking the courtroom."
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2875.878,2882.689,"Yes, I realize that Your Honor, and Allen was charged with armed robbery which carried up to and including a life sentence."
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2884.146,2886.543,But he didn’t absent himself?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2886.543,2887.133,No.
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2887.56,2889.59,He was absented by the judge?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2889.59,2899.915,"Yes, I realize that Your Honor, but I think the holding of this Court would be that a man can be absent from the courtroom in a case where he could be sentenced to life imprisonment."
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2899.915,2905.288,All this man did was to try to commit suicide and he didn’t do it?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2905.288,2906.337,I think that’s an --
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2906.337,2914.272,Voluntarily giving up his right to be tried in his presence?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2914.272,2918.955,"Your Honor, I think it would be a voluntary waiver of that right."
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2932.502,2935.388,There is nothing in this record to show that at all?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2935.388,2936.669,"No, there is not Your Honor."
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2938.021,2942.292,Johnson against Zerbest --
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2942.292,2943.411,"Well, I think Your Honor, this would turn --"
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2943.411,2945.42,Where is the intelligent waiver?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2945.42,2946.179,Where is it?
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2946.179,2946.516,Yeah.
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2946.516,2954.028,"I think, Your Honor, we -- this would turn on point number one if he was content to proceed with trial, if he was aware of his surroundings --"
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2954.028,2957.933,"I am talking about his waiver, or his right to be present."
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2962.14,2962.822,Simply by --
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2962.822,2965.92,At his own trial waiting to get life imprisonment.
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2965.92,2971.299,"Your Honor, simply by shooting himself, the act of shooting himself he voluntarily was -- it was a self --"
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2971.299,2976.514,He voluntarily shot himself for what reason?
1974.73-6038,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2991.966,2998.5,Does Missouri ever apply the rule that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,2998.5,3000.869,"Yes, the Missouri does, Your Honor."
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3000.869,3010.867,"Was there not something in this record, statement that you may find him at the hospital and he preferred to be dead than to be tried for this offense?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3010.867,3011.664,"Yes, there is Your Honor."
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3015.997,3033.353,Would it have been feasible -- does -- can we tell from this record about his medical condition? Would it have been feasible to conduct this competency examination a day or two or three after he had shot himself?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3033.353,3042.582,"The record is not clear on that, but he was unconscious during much of the first day when he was taken and had surgery and I think he had surgery again perhaps four or five days later."
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3061.618,3072.144,"I am talking about what basis the judge had at the time that he decided to go without him, what did the judge have then?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3072.144,3072.332,The judge --
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3072.332,3076.448,And the answer is nothing but the statement that the man had tried to commit suicide?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3076.448,3078.907,That is all he had Your Honor and I am sure he continued to --
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3078.907,3093.805,"And except for this that the judge says, he says I am a judge in the court, I would decided -- the court has already decided that the matter would proceed to trial."
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3093.805,3094.537,Yes --
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3094.537,3098.637,"Is that the way to hold a hearing, where the judge has already made up his mind?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3098.637,3104.059,"I think, Your Honor, if I can go to the facts that the petitioner’s counsel has --"
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3104.059,3108.79,I am stuck with the facts on page 63.
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3112.027,3113.314,Not on that date Your Honor but --
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3113.314,3114.978,"Well, that’s what we are dealing with."
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3114.978,3115.542,"Well, the record --"
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3115.542,3126.677,"The judge had before him to show that this man had voluntarily waived his rights, is there anything as of that moment that told the judge that?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3126.677,3129.27,"Yes, but it is not in the record on page 63."
1974.73-6038,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3129.27,3131.789,Was there conference in chambers at that time?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3131.789,3146.953,"Yes, I believe, there was Your Honor and during the motion for new trial, there was testimony that I believe petitioner's counsel came in and explained that petitioner had shot himself and the court enlisted the help of the police to find out if this were true and where the man was and what his condition was."
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3202.363,3205.511,We could grant a mistrial and try him when he got out?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3205.511,3207.66,"Yes, he certainly could have, Your Honor."
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3207.66,3211.718,And the only thing Missouri would have lost was money?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3211.718,3215.635,"That is true Your Honor, as long as the witnesses were still available."
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3215.635,3218.95,Were they available 21 days later?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3218.95,3220.059,The record doesn't indicate.
1974.73-6038,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3229.016,3230.907,It could be state's burden --
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3230.907,3234.839,"Yes, Your Honor, it would be."
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3234.839,3237.439,He didn't even delay one day?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3237.439,3239.389,"No, Your Honor, he went directly ahead with the trial."
1974.73-6038,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3248.181,3256.58,"Well, I would presume at that point there would have been utterly no point of delaying it for one day since the advice was that he wouldn't be out of the hospital for 21 days?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3256.58,3258.593,That is definitely right Your Honor.
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3258.593,3262.279,Where is the record that said he wouldn't be out for 21 days?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3262.279,3263.397,There is no -- nothing in the --
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3263.397,3265.566,There is nothing in the record that says that?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3265.566,3265.709,No.
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3272.045,3272.746,Right.
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3272.746,3276.943,So it was -- in effect the matter of time with the jury could not be sent home and brought back.
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3280.559,3282.703,"And he asked for a mistrial, that's what he had asked for?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3282.703,3283.723,"Yes, he did Your Honor."
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3283.723,3285.641,And that was denied?
1974.73-6038,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3285.641,3294.356,What would you think -- the motion for a new trial to prove that absence of the trial whether voluntary or involuntary?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3294.356,3307.774,"If you would say that the state had the initial burden Your Honor, I think that shifted as soon as he was proven that the man shot himself. I think then it is a presumption of voluntary waiver."
1974.73-6038,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3312.682,3321.421,"Well, now I take it if the trial judge said the burden was on the defendant to prove involuntariness?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3321.421,3326.826,"I don't if he expressly stated that, but that would be effect of his ruling."
1974.73-6038,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3326.826,3328.35,He did state that at that time.
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3328.35,3331.046,"He didn't, he said, I have already made up my mind."
1974.73-6038,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3331.046,3342.879,"And what -- do you recall whether at the motion for new trial, the defendant offered any evidence with respect to his mental history?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3342.879,3344.676,"Not so much as to his history, Your Honor."
1974.73-6038,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3348.543,3361.265,"Well, was he referred to a psychiatrist or any doctors or anything to go into the question of whether he was competent to have involuntary -- to make a voluntary choice?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3361.265,3363.094,"No, this was involved somewhat --"
1974.73-6038,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3363.094,3364.879,"He had the opportunity to do so, I take it?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3364.879,3368.956,"Right, this was involved somewhat in the 27.26 mode in the hearing."
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3368.956,3369.683,But there was --
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3369.683,3370.274,Where did he have it --
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3370.274,3374.038,"-- psychiatrist testimony, was there not, at the motion for a new trial?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3374.038,3375.46,"No, I don't believe so Your Honor."
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3375.46,3382.013,"When did doctor Lum, I thought your – made that Dr. Lum testified that the motion for a new trail?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3382.013,3388.406,"No, there were two -- there was motion of new trail hearing and a 27.26 hearing which is a state habeas corpus."
1974.73-6038,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3393.582,3395.825,This was several years later after affirmance of --
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3395.825,3399.002,"Two years later, Your Honor."
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3399.002,3403.879,"Well, none of them testified at the motion for a new trial, no testimony at all?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3403.879,3406.467,Just from the hospital where he went --
1974.73-6038,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.467,3408.325,But there was an opportunity I suppose?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3408.325,3409.489,"Yes, there was an opportunity I suppose."
1974.73-6038,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3409.489,3413.001,The defender if he wanted to put on that kind of a case that at that time he could have?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3413.001,3414.701,"He certainly could have, Your Honor."
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3414.701,3417.089,Could he do it in phase of this?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3426.538,3429.035,That was the statement by the court at the time.
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3429.035,3434.33,Well could you then put on a testimony after that statement by the judge?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3434.33,3437.881,As a practical matter there was no testimony put on at that time of course.
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3437.881,3441.221,"Well, could it have been that the judge said that I have already made up my mind?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3441.221,3442.985,"Do you mean, later Your Honor or after the trail?"
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3442.985,3445.244,Right then?
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3445.244,3448.068,"I think the court would have allowed it, if there was testimony to be --"
1974.73-6038,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3448.068,3452.593,"After he said, I have already made up my mind?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3453.823,3456.471,He said that after having a discussion in chambers.
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3461.315,3478.505,"Of course, the traditional way, even after the judge had spoken would be to make an offer of prove to say that, if the court will permit, I will call two psychiatrists whose testimony will be substantially as follows, that's the traditional way of deserving the point is it not?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3478.505,3479.593,"Yes, it certainly is Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3479.593,3494.851,"But then at the close of the trial, when the motion was made for a new trial, did I understand you and responding to Mr. Justice White, to say that there was no proffer of any testimony on the subject of his competency?"
1974.73-6038,1,37208,neil_macfarlane,,3494.851,3495.268,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-6038,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3507.945,3512.23,"Mr. Walsh, you have few minutes left."
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3512.23,3514.335,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-6038,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3564.158,3570.921,"Very often, the prosecutor initiates such a motion just as a protected measure, does he not?"
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3570.921,3571.604,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-6038,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3611.277,3629.321,Do you think the defendant either during the trial or during the motion -- motion for new trial ever said that the fact that he shot himself plus all the other evidence with respect to his mental condition indicates that he wasn't competent?
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3629.321,3633.189,The issue of competency was not presented at the motion for new trial --
1974.73-6038,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3633.189,3647.176,So during -- either during the trial or the motion for new trial was there did the defendant attempt to say that his shooting himself changes the whole picture with respect to his competency?
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3647.176,3651.412,"Well, the defendant's testimony was that he didn't remember shooting himself, he had blacked out."
1974.73-6038,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3651.412,3654.217,His attorney was there and he made no such contentions.
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3654.217,3675.767,"That's correct Mr. Justice, and I might add that, that failure of his counsel was one of the grounds on which we asserted that the incompetency of counsel on that matter and in the Missouri Supreme Court on direct appeal that point has been abandoned in this court, but we do feel that he seriously overlooked that point at that stage."
1974.73-6038,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3675.767,3687.09,"Mr. Walsh, if the motion for mistrial had been made and granted by the court, would jeopardy have attached?"
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3687.09,3690.358,Not under any rule that I am aware of Mr. Justice Powell.
1974.73-6038,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3714.381,3720.594,"Actually, the motion here was upon acquittal rather than a mistrial as I read the read the record?"
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3720.594,3724.399,At the time the trial proceeded in his absence?
1974.73-6038,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3727.595,3739.906,[Inaudible] motion for a mistrial.
1974.73-6038,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3739.906,3743.061,Middle of page 64 --
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3743.061,3752.358,"Page 63, Mr. Justice, at the top, Your Honor at this time I am going to move for a mistrial in view of the fact that defendant I am informed shot himself this morning."
1974.73-6038,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3752.358,3754.282,Page 63 at the top --
1974.73-6038,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3754.282,3764.988,"Right, but if you look over the next page, middle of page, “the defendant requests the court for verdict of acquittal.”"
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3764.988,3772.741,That is a motion for a directed verdict following the receipt of all the evidence.
1974.73-6038,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3772.741,3775.115,You don't think that's different from motion on 63?
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3775.115,3775.753,Yes sir.
1974.73-6038,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3808.687,3813.061,What about defense counsel's view of the matter?
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3813.061,3817.938,"At the time when the 27.26 hearing was being held, the defense counsel --"
1974.73-6038,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3817.938,3820.155,"This confuses me a little, I don't know those numbers --"
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3820.155,3822.23,That's the post conviction matter.
1974.73-6038,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3822.23,3823.679,The 22.55 --
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3823.679,3825.121,"Right, it's habeas corpus."
1974.73-6038,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3825.121,3837.205,"But I am putting back at the earlier stage, at the motions for new trial, did defense counsel file an affidavit or give a testimony on the subject?"
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3837.205,3837.926,No sir.
1974.73-6038,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3842.985,3851.054,"He would certainly have been one of the most competent witnesses on the subject, would he not?"
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3851.054,3858.147,"Well, presumably and why he abandoned the competency issue --"
1974.73-6038,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3858.147,3870.562,"Put him on the stand himself at the motion for new trial, presented him as a witness and you say there wasn't any evidence of cooperation but apparently there was at the motion for a new trial?"
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3870.562,3874.373,Not of inability to communicate or to --
1974.73-6038,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3874.373,3879.465,You see any ability to communicate in that -- on the face of the record?
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3879.465,3885.425,"At -- several months after the trial and after the shooting, is that what you are referring to?"
1974.73-6038,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3885.425,3886.683,No at the motion for new trial?
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3886.683,3887.676,"Yes, which was --"
1974.73-6038,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3887.676,3890.873,How long was that after?
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3890.873,3896.448,It was about three or four months after he had healed and was out of the hospital.
1974.73-6038,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3896.448,3920.316,"But if the defense counsel had found difficulty in communicating with them in the first three days of trial or in weeks preceding the trial, preparing for trial, isn't it reasonable to assume that he would have filed an affidavit or taking the stand and testify to that effect?"
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3920.316,3926.312,"Well, I think it is but -- and I don't understand why he didn't do that frankly."
1974.73-6038,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3926.312,3940.102,One explanation would be the one that you have abandoned that he was ineffective but another equally rational explanation would be that he could not give any such testimony?
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3940.102,3941.596,That's correct.
1974.73-6038,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3964.346,3973.768,Mr. Walsh appeared in this case in the courts previously as a volunteer and you have come here in that capacity.
1974.73-6038,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3979.177,3982.152,"My pleasure, Mr. Chief Justice."
