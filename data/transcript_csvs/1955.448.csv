1955.448,1,32062,john_p_mcgrath,,2980.575,2981.359,"Yes, sir."
1955.448,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3180.902,3187.437,Is it -- is it a written contract that McKesson has of the independent wholesalers?
1955.448,1,32062,john_p_mcgrath,,3187.437,3188.886,"Yes, sir."
1955.448,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3188.886,3196.489,And do they have the same contract with -- with their own wholesale divisions?
1955.448,1,32062,john_p_mcgrath,,3196.489,3201.193,I -- I would -- I would believe so but I can't answer that question categorically.
1955.448,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3228.052,3230.109,14.5% is off the list.
1955.448,1,32062,john_p_mcgrath,,3230.109,3230.794,Sir?
1955.448,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,3230.794,3232.45,14.5% is off the list of price.
1955.448,1,32062,john_p_mcgrath,,3232.45,3232.794,Yes.
1955.448,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3516.234,3523.697,"Mr. McGrath, may I ask you as I hope that (Inaudible)"
1955.448,1,32062,john_p_mcgrath,,3538.424,3559.022,"Well, I would -- I would like to say that I think the economic justification from my point of view is the fact that fair trading as a philosophy won the argument in Congress over the outlawing of price fixing whatever its purpose."
1955.448,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3574.407,3577.65,"Put (Voice Overlap) upon the statute of this doctrine, did it not?"

1955.448,1,32062,john_p_mcgrath,,3674.864,3686.095,I don't see how a manufacturer could discriminate in fixing prices between two different dealers at -- at the same level of distribution.
1955.448,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4225.545,4226.602,"Well, what make it disappear?"
1955.448,1,32062,john_p_mcgrath,,4228.661,4234.847,I think the bill that created the exemption killed the doctrine.
1955.448,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4234.847,4236.059,You mean the exemption (Voice Overlap) --
1955.448,1,32062,john_p_mcgrath,,4236.059,4246.872,The Miller-Tydings Act put an end to the per se doctrine because it said it's -- it's no longer wrong if the State -- they delegated to the States the right to say it was right.
1955.448,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,4802.952,4837.71,I like to address myself brief to the question which Mr. Justice Frankfurter raised as to the possible economic objections which Congress might have which reasonable men might have to price fixing between competitors which would perhaps not be applicable in equal degree to other types of resale price maintenance agreements.

1955.448,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4993.611,5005.335,"Well, there's a -- if -- if one should accept Senator Humphrey's interpretation as being correct, what would be your position?"
1955.448,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,5005.335,5023.775,"Well, I think it best, one could take Senator Humphrey's statement as an understanding by an individual legislator as to what effect he thought the Act would have."
1955.448,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5042.747,5042.93,Would you accept --
1955.448,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,5042.93,5043.751,-- explicit.
