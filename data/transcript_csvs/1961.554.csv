1961.554,1,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,31.443,35.307,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.554,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,283.215,284.207,Is that the driver or the petitioner?
1961.554,1,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,284.207,284.982,It was the driver.
1961.554,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,284.982,285.388,"The driver, not the petitioner."
1961.554,1,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,285.388,286.784,Not the petitioner.
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2278.524,2283.607,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.554,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2581.506,2582.094,Mr. Doran.
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2582.094,2582.597,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2582.597,2595.125,Could this -- could this statute be a fact on vagueness in light manner because there's no distinction made between whether this was voluntarily done or involuntarily done?
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2627.833,2629.308,"I would say not, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2642.056,2671.443,"Yes, but sometimes, I -- I'm taking the position where a doctor has treated him for a disease or -- or some great pain of some kind and as administered narcotics and then when -- when that condition is cured, he -- he turns him loose and -- and he is an addict and -- and he can't get anymore -- anymore narcotics from a doctor but he's an addict just the same."
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2671.443,2674.607,"Well, Your Honor, it would be difficult to conceive."
1961.554,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2687.168,2694.675,If the only help he'd need would be to keep him in narcotics then maybe he's other condition has been -- has been cured up.
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2694.675,2702.708,"Well, I -- I think under those circumstances, he would be -- he would fall under the exception on -- of the statute that the narcotics would be administered by a --"
1961.554,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2702.708,2702.833,I see.
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2702.833,2703.684,-- competent doctor.
1961.554,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2703.799,2707.909,Yes.
1961.554,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2707.909,2720.871,"If in terms of state power, would you think a State would have authority, constitutional authority to punish other things that to which people were addicted?"
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2732.567,2746.507,"Well, I think there Your Honor we're getting to what would be a reasonable exercise of police power and they would appear to be a vast difference between narcotics such as heroin being injected in the veins and smoke being taken into the lungs."
1961.554,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2767.357,2768.085,"Before you go on, your own --"
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2768.085,2768.547,"Yes, sir."
1961.554,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2768.547,2783.089,"-- your own Supreme Court of your status, following up Mr. Justice Douglas' question that is held that the -- the State does not have the power to make it criminal offense to be common graphic, isn't that correct in the Newbern case?"
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2783.089,2789.882,In the Newbern case Your Honor that was not based as I recall upon police power.
1961.554,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2790.12,2791.482,That was based on vagueness?
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2791.482,2792.352,"Right, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2802.332,2804.664,"Had to be an uncommon graphic, is that it?"
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2804.664,2810.305,"Well, we have those two, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2929.191,2935.587,"Well, are you telling us then that in fact the persecution withdrawn the -- or using the --"
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2935.587,2937.223,"No, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2938.941,2951.852,"Well, doesn't it come down to that -- if -- if I understood you, if there's been one conviction under this, you'll not prosecute again unless there's evidence of a substance use?"
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2951.852,2953.861,"That would be necessary, yes, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2955.294,2960.699,"Well then that's -- isn't that second prosecution, a prosecution from user -- for user rather than addiction?"
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2960.699,2961.882,It could be either Your Honor.
1961.554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2961.882,2968.497,But what -- what does -- what does using a word addiction added to the -- to the user turn?
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2976.774,2980.333,"In this case Your Honor, I would say no, it didn't because we --"
1961.554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2980.333,2981.504,Would that be in many cases?
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2981.504,2982.463,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.644,2983.291,(Inaudible)
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,2983.291,2993.796,"-- in many cases, it's indispensable for this reason under a case of People against Garcia which is cited in -- in I think Mr. McMorris' brief."
1961.554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.366,3038.658,To establish the right venue for it?
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3038.658,3039.443,"That's right, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3039.443,3041.418,Is this (Inaudible) real problem?
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3041.418,3042.612,That is the big problem.
1961.554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3042.612,3050.792,"-- (Voice Overlap) -- truth-wise in the courtroom, there is no difference between proving user or addiction?"
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3050.792,3056.24,"No, not -- not -- if we have the proof of both as we maintain -- we have in this case."
1961.554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.858,3069.084,"But in this case, it wouldn't make any -- the -- the addiction did have anything to it?"
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3069.084,3070.022,"No, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3070.022,3088.106,"Well but if -- as I understand you though, if he were apprehended again after serving his term, if this conviction has sustained, you would not prosecute him unless you had some evidence which proved both venue and another user."
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3088.106,3089.248,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3089.762,3096.933,Then I -- I simply don't understand what -- what you get out of prosecuting him for addiction on the second (Voice Overlap) --
1961.554,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3096.933,3125.998,"Well, let's point this that under your statute as construed by your courts, you can get a conviction if you get an expert to let him see the defendant's arm and say, ""As an expert, I can tell the jury that he is an addict, whereas under the use part of statute again as construed by your court, you have to show an act of use in a particular place otherwise you have a problem of venue."
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3125.998,3129.294,"Correct, Your Honor, exactly."
1961.554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3138.771,3140.58,It's still because of the venue --
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3140.58,3140.92,Exactly.
1961.554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3140.92,3146.999,-- because the -- the addiction assumes that -- that there's going to be an active use so called.
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3146.999,3153.52,The addiction takes place in the county or in the jurisdiction where the person is apprehended.
1961.554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3156.659,3157.163,I understand.
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3157.163,3159.593,So the problem of venue is their met.
1961.554,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.593,3160.767,"Yes, I understand that."
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3165.992,3167.902,In use.
1961.554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3172.455,3179.838,"Well, what you're saying and I gather is that you're expert under the prosecution for addiction."
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3201.253,3202.462,"Substantially, Your Honor, yes."
1961.554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3206.478,3208.384,"Well, what -- what I'm getting at is this."
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3229.741,3230.425,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3230.425,3235.401,"But there has to be proof that since he served his last term, he's again used it."
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3235.401,3235.811,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3235.811,3237.727,Even though you don't have to prove where he used.
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3237.727,3239.696,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3239.696,3256.576,"Mr. Doran, if he's prosecuted as the -- as a user under this statute, would it be sufficient to show that he had taken this narcotic once?"
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3256.576,3258.43,"As a user, yes, I would say."
1961.554,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3258.43,3259.259,Alright.
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3267.694,3268.237,"No, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3269.255,3275.567,"You have a -- you have a certain standard for addiction, do you not in the State?"
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3275.567,3283.578,"Well, for getting to a point that approaches the Newbern decision that has been discussed --"
1961.554,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3283.578,3307.188,"Well, I -- the reason I asked is I thought -- I thought you had a -- a section of the Welfare Code 5350 which says ""a narcotic drug addict, within the meaning of this article, ""is any person who habitually takes or otherwise uses to the extent of having lost the power of self-control."
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3320.445,3325.153,"Only for purposes of -- of the Welfare and Institutions Code, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3325.153,3326.23,"Well, prosecute him."
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3328.914,3331.468,"No, Your Honor, under the Health and Safety Code."
1961.554,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3331.468,3332.256,"Well, the Health and Safety --"
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3332.256,3332.987,That's right.
1961.554,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3338.519,3340.161,What code are we under here in this case?
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3340.161,3341.467,"Health and Safety, Your Honor."
1961.554,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3341.467,3352.981,"Well, this says as defined in Article 1 of Chapter 1 of Division 10 of the Health and Safety Code, that's what the -- that Section I just read."
1961.554,2,44565,william_e_doran,,3352.981,3355.587,Maybe I'm --

1961.554,5,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4044.58,4047.557,"He may but I've never known of the case, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1961.554,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4052.572,4055.593,"Well, what about -- what -- you say this is a new statute which provides (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.554,5,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4055.593,4059.128,I think there's new one which come out in 1961.
1961.554,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4075.142,4081.593,Are you telling us that you could make some kind of application to have this fellow transferred from the prison to a hospital for treatment?
1961.554,5,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4081.593,4082.773,I've never known it to be done.
1961.554,6,44565,william_e_doran,,4468.787,4475.057,"And also on page -- page 102, they combined the two, did they not?"
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4494.941,4502.993,They are combined without the explanation that they could -- that they could had to go in one way at that point.
1961.554,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4510.583,4519.367,"Why does the charge on 105 not covered at this point, but you did not ask for a different charge that was refused?"
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4519.367,4520.352,"I beg your pardon, Mr. Justice Black?"
1961.554,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4520.352,4535.116,Why does this charge on 105 doesn't cover the point that you suggested here unless you can show us that you asked for a different kind of charge explaining?
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4538.117,4539.007,Yes.
1961.554,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4539.239,4540.292,-- all unanimous.
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4540.292,4541.517,"Yes, Mr. Justice Black."
1961.554,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4575.271,4578.773,I think -- unless you have already filed -- what's you're looking for is on page 105 of the record.
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4578.773,4580.809,"Yes, first paragraph on page 105."
1961.554,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4580.809,4582.688,Right.
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4582.688,4616.268,"I'd like to answer too a question earlier of Mr. Justice Brennan as to whether or not a person could be presented up to -- the appellee could be immediately arrested in another county or even in the same county under the part of the instruction which is scratched out here is California law that this status is presumed to exist and the burden of proof is upon the defendant to disprove this presumption which means that if I do three months and get out tomorrow, I presume to continue to be an addict and I could be arrested when I hit the streets even though they may not as a fact permitted to do it."
1961.554,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4626.992,4637.239,But do they in fact prosecute a second time prediction except as they can have evidence of the subsequent user?
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4637.239,4638.623,"No, it comes pretty close to this."
1961.554,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4641.871,4642.463,Yes.
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4642.463,4649.924,"When the person used it -- the substance for years, these tracks last for lifetime and at same track and convict him a thousand times."
1961.554,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4650.89,4660.883,"But I thought -- I thought what you told was that this would not be done that actually if they're going to prosecute him the second time, there must be a new hole in the track."
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4660.883,4663.613,This is not at all be acquired under the law.
1961.554,7,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4677.486,4677.567,But --
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4677.567,4677.665,And --
1961.554,7,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4677.665,4683.309,-- they (Inaudible) according to the experts for 20 days that --
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4683.309,4683.733,In this particular case --
1961.554,7,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4683.733,4685.71,-- according to your -- according to your proof here.
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4685.71,4688.636,Up to 20 days Mr. Justice Clark.
1961.554,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4695.266,4695.986,We don't have that --
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4695.986,4697.477,-- court as in other situation.
1961.554,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4697.477,4699.264,We don't have that case here.
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4699.264,4702.197,"No, but it's on the face of law."
1961.554,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4728.537,4733.018,"Well, could they prosecute him (Inaudible) for the same thing if you pleaded formal jeopardy?"
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4736.362,4746.571,"Well, the -- as the state of appellee here, they may not show and -- and all they may not show that the condition continued over the same period."
1961.554,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4761.035,4763.402,"That's not this case, isn't it?"
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4763.402,4771.819,"Not squarely so because this one, I thought the judge did not give these instructions and scratched it out but my point is on the face of the law in California interpretation."
1961.554,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4775.647,4785.767,"Well, that's true with reference to any law, isn't it, if a man doesn't plea formal jeopardy?"
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4785.767,4787.513,"(Inaudible) so much, Mr. Justice Black."
1961.554,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4787.513,4788.047,What did you say?
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4788.047,4797.199,"Well, it seems to me that we have adherent things and -- and that a condition if a man robbed a bank, he has to rob a bank again or if he robbed a person, he has to rob a person again."
1961.554,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4797.68,4801.855,"Suppose, he had to rob it again, they could start to prosecute him the second time."
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4806.919,4818.964,"That is true except that it's not adherent in the manner in which is adherent here because he said -- we have a presumptions and present in the law that this man's condition last a lifetime, and this is implicit in the law."
1961.554,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4823.129,4826.449,They said that it last a lifetime?
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4826.449,4826.685,That is true on --
1961.554,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4826.685,4830.606,You mean it's implicit that a man can never recover from this thing?
1961.554,7,41715,samuel_carter_mcmorris,,4830.606,4838.447,Under our decision and I think under -- under medical evidence that -- that -- which is presented here that -- and there -- there's no cure for narcotic.
1961.554,8,44565,william_e_doran,,4952.262,4956.383,"That's Your Honor -- of course, it wasn't in effect at the time of this case."
1961.554,8,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4979.904,4985.642,What happens to the habeas corpus proceeding in this case?
1961.554,8,44565,william_e_doran,,4985.642,4986.393,In this case?
1961.554,8,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4986.393,4986.856,In this case.
1961.554,8,44565,william_e_doran,,4986.856,4988.863,They were both denied Your Honor on application.
1961.554,8,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4988.863,4990.137,"Well, how far did it go I mean?"
1961.554,8,44565,william_e_doran,,4991.779,4995.648,One was filed as I understand in the District Court of Appeal of California --
1961.554,8,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4995.648,4995.824,Yes.
1961.554,8,44565,william_e_doran,,4995.824,5000.806,-- and another in the Supreme Court of California.
1961.554,8,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5022.363,5023.733,I see.
1961.554,8,44565,william_e_doran,,5023.733,5027.682,It makes difficult sometimes with the petitioner.
1961.554,8,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5027.682,5030.944,We'll recess now.
