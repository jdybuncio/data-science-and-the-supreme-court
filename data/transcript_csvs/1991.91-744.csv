1991.91-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,19.194,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-744, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Robert P. Casey; 91-902, Robert P. Casey v. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania."
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,22.545,28.011,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1991.91-744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.1,504.62,"Ms. Kolbert, you're arguing the case as though all we have before us is whether to apply stare decisis and preserve Roe against Wade in all its aspects."
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,514.086,515.112,"Your Honor, I do."
1991.91-744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,527.212,537.255,"Well, the standard may affect the outcome or it may not, but at bottom we still have to deal with specific issues, and I wondered if you were going to address them."
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,537.255,551.876,"--Yes, I am, Your Honor, and I would like in particular to address the husband notification provisions, but the standard that this Court applies will well establish the outcome in this case for a variety of reasons."
1991.91-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.258,702.574,"Ms. Kolbert, on this last point, I am not sure what you suggest we look to."
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,717.901,733.162,"--Your Honor, I believe that you have to look very generally at whether the Nation's history and tradition has respected interests of bodily integrity and autonomy and whether there has been a tradition of respect for equality of women."
1991.91-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,734.828,736.79,But not to abortion in particular?
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,736.79,757.054,"--Well, this Court is... if the Court was only to look at whether abortion was illegal in 1868, that is at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it would be placed in a very difficult situation because at the time of the founding of the Nation, at the time that the Constitution was adopted, abortion was legal."
1991.91-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.054,761.952,"Pick 1968, I gather you wouldn't accept 1968 either though."
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,761.952,768.336,"Well, we think that the Court ought to look generally at the principles that this decision protects."
1991.91-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,832.01,836.076,This is not an antiquarian argument you are making.
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,853.406,865.53,"I would, and that is the argument that this Court has made in many instances in rejecting exactly the state of the law prior to the granting of fundamental status."
1991.91-744,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.211,896.839,Some of those are mentioned in the Constitution like racial segregation.
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,896.839,910.756,"Your Honor, this Court has recognized that the rights at issue here, that is, the rights of privacy, the rights of autonomy flow from the liberty clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which is also mentioned in the Constitution."
1991.91-744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,938.18,956.408,"I don't question the importance of your arguing that there is a fundamental right, as you have done; however, there is a fundamental right to speech and we hear any number of arguments in this case on time, place and manner."
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,979.336,998.651,"The critical factor is whether, as a result of its fundamental status, this Court will accord the standard of Roe, that is, strict scrutiny because under that standard there is no dispute among the parties."
1991.91-744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1020.015,1029.468,I am suggesting that our sustaining these statutory provisions does not necessarily undercut all of the holding of Roe v. Wade.
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1029.468,1049.969,"--It is our position, Your Honor, that if this Court were to change the standard of strict scrutiny, which has been the central core of that holding, that in fact, that will undercut the holdings of this Court and effectively overrule Roe v. Wade."
1991.91-744,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1087.849,1095.479,"Well, if you are going to argue that Roe can survive only in its most rigid formulation, that is an election you can make as counsel."
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1100.293,1123.307,"Our position is that Roe, in establishing a trimester framework, in establishing strict scrutiny, and in also establishing that the rights of women and the health interests of women always take precedent over the State's interest in potential life."
1991.91-744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1135.325,1143.165,"But did the Court hold that, even after viability of the fetus in Roe?"
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1143.165,1144.073,--What the Court--
1991.91-744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1144.073,1156.176,"Do you think that was a correct characterization of Roe's holding that you just gave, that the woman's interest always takes precedence?"
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1161.865,1178.16,"--Your Honor, under Roe, after the point of viability, that is the point when the fetus is capable of survival, the State is free to prohibit abortion but only so long as it is necessary, only so long as the woman's health interests and life interests are not at stake."
1991.91-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1374.205,1380.916,Was the husband notification provision the one that the court of appeals held unconstitutional?
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1380.916,1381.824,"It was, your honor."
1991.91-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1381.824,1384.79,"And it upheld the balance of the act, is that correct?"
1991.91-744,0,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,1384.79,1385.036,That's right.
1991.91-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1667.803,1670.014,"Very well, Ms. Kolbert."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1672.502,1681.444,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1991.91-744,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1720.743,1723.136,"Mr. Attorney General, I'm not so sure that's so important."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1725.208,1727.319,--That's correct.
1991.91-744,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1727.319,1730.233,--That this does not provide for abortion on demand.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1731.172,1732.358,"Yes, I have."
1991.91-744,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1732.358,1732.71,Thank you.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1732.71,1746.945,"In our view the accommodations of the woman's right and the State's legitimate interest in the unborn child is best served, short of overruling Roe, by employing the undue burden standard for reviewing State abortion regulations."
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1810.331,1821.014,"Now, the provision does not require notification to a father who is not the husband, I take it--"
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1821.014,1822.241,That's correct Justice O'Connor.
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1822.241,1825.443,--or notice if the woman is unmarried.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1825.443,1827.28,It only applies to married women.
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1827.28,1831.77,"So what's the interest, to try to preserve the marriage?"
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1831.77,1833.105,There are several interests.
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1836.947,1840.564,"Well then, why not require notice to all fathers?"
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1843.744,1853.392,"It is that, but the legislature has made the judgment that it wanted its statute to apply in this specific instance because it wanted to further the integrity of marriages."
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1853.392,1872.364,"Would you say that the State could similarly require a woman to notify anyone with whom she had intercourse that she planned to use some means of birth control after the intercourse that operates, let's say, as an abortifacient?"
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1878.555,1882.504,"The State interest would be the same, but I think that would be problematic."
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1882.696,1885.194,"And why would it be problematic, do you think?"
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1885.194,1902.887,"--I think that with regard to applying a statute to all women, that it might create severe obstacle, an absolute obstacle to their obtaining an abortion."
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1902.887,1906.014,I don't understand.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1906.014,1921.796,"The undue burden standard, as I understand it, is that whether or not the regulation would impose such an absolute obstacle, not whether it would deter or inhibit some women from obtaining an abortion."
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1921.796,1940.737,"Well, we're talking about the provision for notification in this case under the statute to the husband, and I'm just asking whether a different type of State regulation would have to be upheld under your standard."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,1940.737,1960.777,"Well, if the State had posited its interest as protecting the life of the unborn then utilizing the rational basis standard, then I would submit that it could legitimately require that kind of notification to all people."
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2027.136,2034.478,"What's our standard on a facial challenge, whether there's a substantial likelihood of the harm?"
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2034.478,2062.501,"No, I think you have to ignore what the petitioners have posited, which is a worst-case analysis scenario, and you have to look and see if it could be constitutionally applied and value-tied to anyone, and we submit that in this particular instance the record reflects that right now, in Pennsylvania, 50,000 abortions, 20 percent of those women are married and 95 percent of those women notify their husbands."
1991.91-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2112.381,2113.46,"No, but General, may I ask you a question."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2121.934,2124.465,"I'm not sure I got all of that question, Justice Stevens."
1991.91-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2124.465,2133.994,"Well, you've demonstrated that the public interest is in a very limited group of people, the few women who would not otherwise notify their husbands, and those are the only people affected by the statute."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2133.994,2134.933,That is correct.
1991.91-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2134.933,2141.059,"Everyone in that class, should we not assume, would not notify her husband but for the statute."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2141.059,2141.711,That is correct.
1991.91-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2146.354,2148.062,They would not without the statute.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2148.062,2152.352,"They would not without the statute, but there are exceptions, several of them... four."
1991.91-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2152.352,2159.448,"No, they'd only... you've already taken the exceptions into account in narrowing the group very... to, you know, 1 percent, or whatever it is."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2159.448,2161.082,Justice--
1991.91-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2161.082,2165.155,You aren't suggesting there's no one whose decision will be affected by the statute.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2165.155,2166.235,"--Well, that's the point."
1991.91-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2173.138,2177.204,"Well, if there's no one affected by the statute, what is the State interest in upholding the statute?"
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2177.204,2185.894,"The State interest in upholding the statute is the protection of the life of the unborn and the protection of the marital integrity, and to ensuring of communication, the possibility... we not asking--"
1991.91-744,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2185.894,2189.467,But not if the statute has no effect.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2208.1,2210.031,--And... and--
1991.91-744,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2210.031,2216.305,It's a very strange argument to say that the law doesn't affect 90 percent of the people so we're not concerned with the law.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2217.17,2222.507,"--We're not in any way advocating that, because we think that the law is rational."
1991.91-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2250.99,2257.36,"General Preate, I thought we were talking, not rational basis but undue burden."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2258.31,2260.18,"--No, they are not, Justice Scalia."
1991.91-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2260.18,2265.909,How do I go about determining whether it's an undue burden or not?
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2269.068,2274.854,"This is a quantitative analysis, Justice Scalia."
1991.91-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2289.123,2302.514,"I suppose it depends on how important I would think it is, that a husband of a wife know before a fetus that he co-generated be destroyed."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2304.382,2319.035,"That would be part of the analysis that is done on the weighing side, after you establish whether or not there is in fact... in the first instance, the threshold question is what is the broad practical impact?"
1991.91-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2327.401,2329.172,"Well, it depends."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2343.365,2360.671,"As I understand it, Justice Scalia, what you are talking about is if there is no undue burden, that is, there is no broad practical impact in the initial analysis, then you determine whether or not the statute rationally furthers the State's interest."
1991.91-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2381.065,2384.865,May I ask you a question about your understanding of the undue burden test.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2396.583,2407.928,"I think Justice Stevens, in the initial application, it's a quantitative analysis, whether there is a broad practical impact here."
1991.91-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2409.505,2412.621,"In other words, it is the number of persons affected is your answer--"
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2412.621,2413.892,--The number of persons affected--
1991.91-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2413.892,2416.143,--Regardless of how severe the burden on a particular individual?
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2416.143,2422.131,"--As the test has been posited, the question of whether or not--"
1991.91-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2422.131,2428.088,I am just asking you to explain to me what your conception of the test that you are asking us to adopt is.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2428.088,2434.672,"--It may be that some women would be deterred to some degree, but that is not sufficient to create an undue burden."
1991.91-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2434.672,2436.732,It is the number of women affected?
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2436.732,2441.568,"Initially, it is the number of women affected, the broad practical impact of it--"
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2441.568,2445.174,How about as applied to a specific woman?
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2445.174,2447.339,--As applied to a specific woman?
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2456.09,2457.487,"Right, let's suppose that."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2457.487,2458.032,Let's posit that.
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2471.363,2478.182,"And you would apply an undue burden test there on the as-applied challenge, do you suppose?"
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2478.182,2479.239,"--No, I would think that--"
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2479.239,2479.388,No?
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2479.388,2479.602,--No.
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2498.779,2503.252,I would have thought you would look at the burden of the law as applied to the woman.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2503.252,2512.217,"--And I think that you would look to that, but you are asking the court, in an as-applied mechanism to give full effect to your right, the statute given."
1991.91-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2542.226,2547.168,"But in the facial context, I don't understand what you... so there are two undue burden tests."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2572.758,2576.185,"In the second instance, as applied it--"
1991.91-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2576.185,2578.214,"I am worried about the first one, not the second one."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2578.896,2589.353,"--In a facial challenge, Justice Scalia, you are looking at not the worst scenario hypothesis, but whether this act could be applied constitutionally to anyone, and that is--"
1991.91-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2589.353,2592.47,"--Any single case, not engross, to any single case."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2599.557,2599.91,--That's correct.
1991.91-744,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.91,2601.958,That is not looking at it engross.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2606.772,2625.201,"In this particular instance, we find that there is no undue burden in our statute, anywhere in our statute, and if the undue burden test is, as applied or understood by this Court causes our statute to fall, then we ask this Court to adopt rational basis as the appropriate analysis."
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2625.201,2631.027,Do you think that compelling speech requires any kind of First Amendment analysis?
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2631.027,2632.648,Compelling--
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2632.648,2633.416,Speech.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2639.125,2641.474,--We are asking that she--
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2641.474,2645.186,Does that invoke any First Amendment concerns?
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2645.186,2648.825,"--Not in our view, this statute--"
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2648.825,2654.853,I would have thought perhaps compelling speech would get us right into a First Amendment area.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2654.853,2664.648,"--In this particular instance, this statute, we feel causes notification, but there is a legitimate State interest involved in furthering that interest."
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2664.648,2673.474,"In other words, the doctor, to say certain things to the patient, do you think that is really commercial speech there?"
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2673.474,2674.572,"Yes, I do, Justice O'Connor--"
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2674.572,2674.689,Why is that?
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2682.876,2684.486,--That is commercial.
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2694.819,2696.058,I wouldn't have thought that was commercial speech.
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2697.125,2698.61,In Zauderer.
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2698.61,2702.558,"But that is advertising, that is different."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2702.558,2722.235,"In Pennsylvania's general informed consent law, applying to every single contact between the doctor and a patient, there is the same information that must be presented and that is, the doctor must tell the patient about the medical risks of the procedure and the alternatives to it."
1991.91-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2722.235,2730.997,"Well, it might meet a First Amendment test, but I am wondering how you get to commercial speech on that kind of advice?"
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2730.997,2746.118,"We think that with the... with the interests involved, the statute furthers those interests and that it can legitimately require the husband to be notified because of the interests involved."
1991.91-744,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2795.806,2806.252,"Mr. Preate, because you have a little time left, there is one point on which I guess I never fully followed your argument, and I wonder if you would go back to it."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2859.563,2865.488,"That is not correct, Justice... you start with the 1 percent because 95 percent of 20 percent is 1 percent."
1991.91-744,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2867.09,2872.704,"You are talking about all women, but the spousal notification applies only to married women."
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2872.704,2873.205,--That is correct.
1991.91-744,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2873.205,2875.362,What is the percentage of married women?
1991.91-744,1,22936,ernest_d_preate_jr,,2876.335,2877.775,Sorry.
1991.91-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2878.107,2880.795,"Thank you, Mr. Preate."
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2883.327,2890.979,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1991.91-744,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3000.939,3002.957,May I ask you one rather basic question?
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3002.957,3003.17,--Certainly.
1991.91-744,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3003.17,3005.859,It effects the standard of review and everything else.
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3013.64,3022.231,"We do not have a position on that question and this Court has not addressed, or at least there is no Justice at this Court--"
1991.91-744,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3022.231,3023.138,It's addressed in Roe.
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3023.138,3025.027,"--That, that, that is correct."
1991.91-744,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3033.01,3033.779,What is that we need not address it.
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3035.029,3035.413,We do not have a position.
1991.91-744,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3035.413,3038.178,--Does the United States have a position on that question?
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3038.178,3048.335,"We do not, because we think it would be an extraordinarily difficult and sensitive issue by virtue of a number of questions that would flow from that, including equal protections and so forth."
1991.91-744,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3048.335,3049.969,"Well, the Court decided that in Roe, did it not?"
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3049.969,3061.174,"The Court did, in fact, decide that there is a very keen interest on the part of the State in what the Roe Court called potential life, and that's my--"
1991.91-744,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3061.174,3067.439,"Yes, but said the fetus is not a person under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3067.439,3072.84,--Well I think that that is the necessary consequence of Roe v. Wade.
1991.91-744,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.237,3102.259,"We did not say in Roe that a State could not have a position on whether a fetus is a person, did we?"
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3102.259,3104.043,Certainly the Court--
1991.91-744,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3104.043,3112.269,"We said that the Constitution takes no position on whether a fetus is a person, and/or that it does take a position that a fetus is not protected by the Constitution."
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3112.269,3118.971,--The Court seemed to admit of the possibility of State regulation to protect the unborn at all stages.
1991.91-744,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3118.971,3124.734,Including State regulation on the basis of the people's determination within that State that a fetus is a person.
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3129.196,3136.719,"That it says, that the State may, if it sees fit, that the State does have... I think Roe goes this far."
1991.91-744,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3168.381,3174.05,"Is that also not the position of the Government of the United States, that it is a compelling interest throughout pregnancy?"
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3174.05,3177.785,"That is our position, that there is a compelling interest."
1991.91-744,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3177.785,3177.977,And what is context.
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3181.306,3191.454,"Well I think that, if I may, Justice Stevens, it seems to me that it goes to the recognition that we all do, that there is in fact an organism."
1991.91-744,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3193.023,3195.041,I'm asking what is the textual basis in the Constitution?
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3206.823,3207.25,The State has--
1991.91-744,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3207.25,3209.759,What is the textual basis for it?
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3209.759,3215.458,"--The State has an interest in its potential citizen, it does not have to be granted, have the basis in the Constitution."
1991.91-744,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3236.769,3238.115,That's not responsive to my question.
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3244.125,3246.175,I think it's in the nature of our system.
1991.91-744,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3259.438,3259.993,General Starr.
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3259.993,3262.457,There's a determination to... I'm sorry.
1991.91-744,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3262.457,3265.285,Why does there have to be something in the Constitution?
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3271.199,3272.029,Of course not.
1991.91-744,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3272.029,3274.326,"And yet that can be a compelling State interest, may it not?"
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3274.326,3274.953,Yes.
1991.91-744,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3283.203,3287.736,All that Roe says is that the Constitution does not protect the fetus under the Fourteenth Amendment.
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3290.98,3293.222,"--It doesn't even go so far, it seems to me."
1991.91-744,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3293.222,3295.227,"Or that if a State chooses to do so, it is not a compelling State interest."
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3296.937,3297.128,I think it calibrates it.
1991.91-744,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3347.318,3348.908,What is the standard?
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3350.915,3355.281,"We believe it was articulated, Justice White, by the Webster plurality."
1991.91-744,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3355.281,3355.598,Well what is it?
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3355.598,3357.745,It is the rational basis standard.
1991.91-744,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.02,3374.988,"And under that standard, you would think all of the provisions that are at issue here should be sustained."
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3374.988,3375.885,Exactly.
1991.91-744,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3375.885,3378.18,"And so would complete prohibition, wouldn't it?"
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3378.18,3386.686,"Complete prohibition that had no exception for the life of mother, I think could raise very serious questions under--"
1991.91-744,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3386.686,3387.529,"But subject, subject to that--"
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3387.529,3388.38,--The protection of life.
1991.91-744,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3388.38,3393.043,"--Subject to that exception, it would cover complete pro... it would justify complete prohibition."
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3393.043,3395.617,I think it best not to answer these in the abstract.
1991.91-744,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3401.606,3407.923,"Well I'll grant you that, but you're asking the Court to adopt a standard and I think we ought to know where the standard would take us."
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3407.923,3414.721,"--I think the rational basis standard would, in fact, allow considerable leeway to the States, if it saw fit."
1991.91-744,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3414.721,3415.586,"Well, General Starr--"
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3415.586,3415.991,Through the democratic--
1991.91-744,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3415.991,3417.507,--That's not really a fair answer.
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3432.663,3433.539,--I don't think so.
1991.91-744,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3435.119,3435.279,Well why not?
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3438.321,3441.479,--Ours is the traditional one.
1991.91-744,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3477.382,3490.272,"No, but what you're saying is the rational basis standard, which normally just requires a reason that is legitimate to support it, can be overcome in some cases by countervailing interest, which is not the normal rational basis standard."
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3490.272,3492.152,"Well, may I respond."
1991.91-744,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3492.152,3492.354,"Yes, you may."
1991.91-744,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3492.354,3498.14,"I think that the traditional rational basis test does, in fact, analyze the ends."
1991.91-744,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3511.032,3512.806,"Thank you, General Starr."
1991.91-744,3,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,3515.548,3525.259,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to address two points very quickly."
1991.91-744,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3669.254,3673.171,"Are there First Amendment values at stake there, do you think?"
1991.91-744,3,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,3673.171,3678.187,"Your Honor, I do believe there are, not only in this section, but in the bias counseling provisions as well."
1991.91-744,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3695.675,3697.415,"Thank you, Ms. Kolbert."
1991.91-744,3,33884,kathryn_kolbert,,3697.415,3697.607,Thank you.
1991.91-744,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3697.607,3717.025,The case is submitted.
