1980.79-870,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.45,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 79-870, United States Railroad Retirement Board against Gerhard Fritz."
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,64.787,70.144,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,268.111,269.828,"You said ""perhaps""."
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,272.124,273.28,But... yes; yes.
1980.79-870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,284.306,285.744,He's splitting his career in a different way.
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,285.744,286.213,--Right.
1980.79-870,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,335.756,344.471,"What's the... Mr. Kneedler, under the Social Security Act standing alone, is there a vested interest in the particular pattern of payments?"
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,344.471,357.091,"--No, this Court held in Flemming v. Nestor that social security benefits are noncontractual and that Congress may alter or even eliminate them at any time."
1980.79-870,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,357.091,359.152,They can be given and they can be taken away.
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,359.152,368.773,"Exactly, and two terms ago, in this Court's decision in Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, the Court applied this same understanding to the Railroad Retirement Act."
1980.79-870,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,392.966,407.211,But isn't this also true of people who might spend 20 years with General Electric under social security and then go into government service and have... be part of civil service retirement?
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,407.211,424.095,"Yes, it is, and the reports on the 1974 legislation do call attention to the fact that this problem of overlapping benefits does arise in several different situations and there is no deduction in the manner of this case in those other situations."
1980.79-870,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,843.721,852.295,Are there bills pending in the Congress to remedy this situation on a generous basis?
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,853.639,864.963,"There have been bills introduced in each of the three... I guess, the last two Congresses, and those bills have not been enacted."
1980.79-870,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,864.963,867.414,Have they made any progress at all as far as you know?
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,867.414,869.008,They have not been reported out of committee.
1980.79-870,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,869.008,879.612,"It is true that if an employee works only under one act, that for the same number of years... as Mr. Fritz, for instance, that he would receive much less."
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,879.612,884.158,If he worked only under one act in--
1980.79-870,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,884.158,885.094,Under one act.
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,887.968,889.249,"--Right, right."
1980.79-870,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,899.698,905.103,Is there any evidence in the record about labor-management connivance in reaching this result?
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,905.103,935.277,"I don't think there's any evidence of labor-management connivance in... I think a reading of the minutes of the negotiating sessions, for example, demonstrate that the parties, as is typical in negotiating something such as this... there's a certain amount of give and take, but there is no suggestion that I have found that this is motivated by some animus toward persons who had left the railroad industry."
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,935.277,946.929,Does the class include people who had already retired and were eligible for the so-called double-dipping benefits?
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,946.929,956.831,"No, it doesn't, because they may receive the equivalent of the full benefits they expected to receive under prior law, so it's not increased over time."
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,956.831,961.719,"But, as the result of the judgment that that exception is unconstitutional also, or not?"
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,961.719,965.781,That is unclear from the judgment.
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,974.589,986.569,"So are you... well, I'll put it to you this way, are you attempting to justify a difference between that group and the other groups, or do you think that group is just out of the case?"
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,986.569,993.458,"No, I think... I think there are degrees... Congress was drafting a grandfather clause here, and there are degrees or--"
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.458,998.236,"Must you defend that particular group, though, that particular exception?"
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,998.236,1000.126,"--Well, I think perhaps that exception is--"
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1000.126,1001.282,People who have already retired and are--
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1001.282,1002.298,--I think that's perhaps the strongest--
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.298,1005.203,"--But is the issue here or not, that issue?"
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1005.203,1017.026,"--I don't believe that issue is here, no, because the District Court perceived the inequity to be only the difference between those who qualified who were not retired but were in the railroad industry in '74."
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1017.026,1032.425,"Mr. Kneedler, you described as the people who were not entitled to participate in the windfall benefit, you gave an example of the person who had ten years of railroad service and less than 40 quarters of social security."
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1043.078,1051.371,He would receive it if he had completed those 40 quarters and the ten years of railroad service in the year that he left the railroad industry.
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1081.702,1083.358,I see.
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1099.476,1111.363,"Well, I... it doesn't matter who gets it first, if the person who was qualified under both in 1966, he would get this windfall--"
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1111.363,1120.515,"And if 1966 marked his tenth year of non-railroad work, he would not get it, but if it marked his tenth year of railroad work he would get it?"
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1120.515,1126.403,--Only if... this is only true if 1966 is his last year of railroad work.
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.949,1127.699,"I mean... well, no."
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1127.699,1128.527,So that's what--
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.527,1131.869,"In one example, the last year was 1965, say, and then--"
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1131.869,1132.088,--Okay.
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.088,1132.838,--he did his tenth year of--
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1132.838,1134.619,In 1966?
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1134.619,1134.994,--Yes.
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1134.994,1137.212,"No, he would not be eligible, because he'd--"
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.212,1143.818,"If he did it just the converse, railroad work, last year 1965, social security work, last year 1966, he does not get it?"
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1143.818,1144.193,--Right.
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1144.193,1147.926,"But if the other... if the '65 and '66 are transposed, he does get it?"
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1147.926,1149.972,That's right.
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1149.972,1155.001,Then you... and you do purport to defend that distinction?
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1155.001,1156.188,That's right.
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.758,1227.346,"If a person who had ten years of... would qualify the way I described a moment ago, in addition had a current connection in 1974, would that increase his benefit?"
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1231.876,1232.361,He would be--
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1232.361,1236.14,"He wouldn't have... I see, he couldn't have retired from the railroad industry under that hypothesis because--"
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1236.14,1236.42,--Right; that's right.
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1358.669,1364.259,"--Well, does it encourage anybody to return to the railroad industry?"
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1364.259,1377.988,"Well, the act does provide that if a person returns to the industry after 1974 and had a current connection with the industry when he retired, then he is also eligible to receive a windfall benefit."
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1377.988,1384.079,So this is sort of... has a counter influence as far as opening up positions in the railroad industry?
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1388.235,1402.509,"Well, if they came back in the industry they would be eligible for the windfall benefit which would then create an incentive for them to retire, so even if they did come back, it creates an incentive for them to retire and therefore actually furthers the purpose of the act."
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1402.509,1403.103,But while they're there there's no vacancy?
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1403.103,1404.664,That's right.
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.351,1410.319,Or a vacancy was filled?
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1410.319,1412.319,That's correct.
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1437.136,1440.572,What standard do you think we have... judging this case by?
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1448.944,1449.913,"Yes, I do."
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1463.095,1469.966,None of them included dissolvency or did all of them?
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1474.09,1480.759,"--Yes, by all means, and to exclude certain people, to narrow the class of people who were going to continue to receive dual benefits."
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1480.759,1482.649,Would that have been a... would that always be enough?
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1482.649,1484.914,"Yes, I believe that would--"
1980.79-870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.914,1486.289,"Like, every other name in the phone book?"
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1486.289,1494.19,"--Well, as long as Congress did it with some rational approach."
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1565.272,1567.491,"I have one further question, counsel."
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1594.807,1600.679,"--Well, on the basis of your hypothetical, you said, for two weeks before?"
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1600.679,1601.086,Right.
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1601.086,1603.429,If the person who was the two weeks--
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1603.429,1607.725,"They both retired in 1970, at their 65th birthday."
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1607.725,1609.475,--In 1970?
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1609.475,1609.74,Yes.
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1609.74,1618.3,"Well, in... if they retired before the effective date of the act, if they retired before 1974, they retain their full--"
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1618.3,1618.846,I see.
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1618.846,1620.064,--They retain the windfall element.
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.498,1627.076,I see.
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1634.417,1638.9,"Well, no; it depends on which industry he was in in 1974."
1980.79-870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1653.019,1654.019,Yes.
1980.79-870,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1676.431,1677.166,That's right.
1980.79-870,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1703.811,1707.933,Mr. Byron.
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,1707.933,1716.414,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-870,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1811.438,1827.432,"Well, Mr. Byron, how can you say that when in fact it's conceded that the legislation if read according to its meaning has the effect that you claim is unconstitutional?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,1827.432,1833.164,I say that because the Railroad Board itself assured Congress that our class was included.
1980.79-870,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1833.164,1839.24,"But the Railroad Board isn't vested with the legislative power of the United States, it's Congress."
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,1839.24,1850.376,"No, but I think it is easy to understand as we go through the legislative history here why Congress thought they were including everyone, but nevertheless did not; that the plaintiff's class was actually exempted."
1980.79-870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1920.085,1930.61,"Mr. Byron, do you suggest that a statute enacted by the Congress is constitutionally vulnerable because some erroneous information was submitted to the Congress?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,1930.61,1953.196,"Mr. Justice, I've... I'm suggesting that in part based on the Delaware Tribal Systems v. Weeks, the note by Justice Stevens, I believe, in there, that while the motives of Congress, for example, is not... does not... germane to the decision here."
1980.79-870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2028.946,2036.428,"Well, then that turns back to what were existing benefits or vested benefits at that time, does it not?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2036.428,2037.631,Yes.
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2043.94,2052.999,"You're not suggesting the act doesn't, shouldn't be read as doing what the District Court said was unconstitutional?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2052.999,2056.637,"I don't understand the question, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.637,2059.668,"Well, you... the act did hurt your client?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2059.668,2060.449,Fine... yes.
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.449,2062.448,There's no question that on its face it does.
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2062.448,2063.073,"No, Mr. Justice, what--"
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.073,2064.917,You're not suggesting construing it otherwise?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2064.917,2067.321,"--No, and in fact, there is no question about that."
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.155,2092.982,"Well, nevertheless, this is what the act does."
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2092.982,2093.701,Yes.
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.764,2100.854,"And it does that, and the question is whether... let's just assume there wasn't a fragment of legislative history."
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2105.587,2115.708,"Well, Mr. Justice, there is this question about the rational connection to the legitimate objectives of the statute, but the objectives if the statute were to cover our class."
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.159,2121.611,Why?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2128.093,2139.306,"--As I understand equal protection analysis, we're looking at the legislative goals of Congress and our concern here is, what did Congress really... legislative intent, and what did Congress really intend to do here?"
1980.79-870,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2139.306,2145.867,What better source is there than the statute itself for finding out what Congress wanted it to do?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2145.867,2150.304,The written primary purposes of the bill contained in the House and Senate reports which say contrariwise.
1980.79-870,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2150.304,2156.925,You say they would override the express declaration... the enacted legislation would?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2156.925,2171.826,"Given the complexity of 3(h)(1) and 3(h)(2) I would submit, yes, and in further response, President Jerry Ford at the time vetoed this legislation in large part because of the failure to understand the great complexity of the act."
1980.79-870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2173.637,2175.183,Whose failure to understand it?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2175.183,2175.558,--Pardon?
1980.79-870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2175.558,2177.027,Whose failure to understand it?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2177.027,2182.681,"President Ford said that it defied analysis, essentially, in his veto message to Congress."
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2187.475,2188.116,Congress did it twice.
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2188.116,2188.522,--Pardon?
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2188.522,2194.192,Congress did what you say it really didn't intend to do twice.
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2194.192,2194.895,Right.
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2196.409,2197.55,Both by two-thirds vote.
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2197.55,2199.299,"--That's right, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.029,2220.665,"After the President says, you really don't understand what you're doing, they said, we understand perfectly what the act says, and passed it and overruled his veto."
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2220.665,2227.585,"--But, but, Mr. Justice, no one raised the question, the veto message did not say, we have a divestment problem here."
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.465,2270.645,Let me ask you... approach it another... suppose it was perfectly clear from the legislative history that Congress intended to do what the act says on its face and suppose... I suppose you would still be here arguing that it was irrational.
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2270.645,2285.921,"--Yes, because... that's right, Mr. Justice, because we are submitting without question that there is no rational distinction between the similarly situated vested classes, those with ten to 25 years of service."
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2285.921,2290.217,Aren't these really the... isn't this really what you have to win on here if you're going to win?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2290.217,2295.855,"Mr. Justice, I'll take a win on any particular point, that or any other."
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2472.095,2484.184,"Mr. Byron, are you arguing... it seems to me you're arguing that any cutback that didn't either exclude all vested benefits or no vested benefits would have been unconstitutional?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2484.184,2485.699,"--No, I am not."
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.699,2492.744,"But is... well, the presentation to Congress was, we're going to preserve all vested benefits, and you seem to place great emphasis on the vesting concept."
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2492.744,2499.929,"Yes, I do, because, you see, the JLMC in the colloquies they engaged in in Congress assured Congress everyone was being vested."
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.411,2516.516,"I understand all that, but as soon as you admit that Congress could have constitutionally cut back on some of the vested benefits, it seems to me your whole argument is beside the point, the only argument you've made thus far, is beside the point."
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2516.516,2528.386,"--Mr. Justice, it is not... the... because we're looking at what the legislative objectives in this particular reported bill and statute are."
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2543.833,2548.956,And that the goal you're relying on is the goal to preserve all vested benefits.
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2548.956,2550.534,"Yes, and that was the goal of Congress."
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2550.534,2552.392,Any cutback on that would have been inconsistent with that goal.
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2552.392,2555.531,"Yes; now, that's just... that's one argument."
1980.79-870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2586.082,2587.768,"Mr. Byron, who misled Congress?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2597.593,2599.139,Yes.
1980.79-870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2599.702,2600.514,Who misled them?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2600.514,2603.747,"--In my opinion, the JLMC."
1980.79-870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2603.747,2604.325,In your opinion?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2608.697,2610.166,That is not my gut reaction.
1980.79-870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2618.131,2621.942,"Well, do you take the position that Congress was misled?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2621.942,2625.457,"--Yes, and I think that helps explain--"
1980.79-870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2625.457,2628.408,And then can't you oblige and say by whom or by what?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2628.408,2631.096,--And JLMC.
1980.79-870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2646.181,2648.337,Who got them to do that?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2648.337,2652.82,"--Well, they asked the JLMC to negotiate the statute."
1980.79-870,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2653.679,2663.207,"Mr. Byron, following up on my brother Marshall's question, you've referred several times to the statement of primary purposes of the act."
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2663.207,2664.174,--Yes.
1980.79-870,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2664.174,2665.111,Where does one find that?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2673.155,2675.389,It's not.
1980.79-870,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2678.606,2683.746,"Oh, is it... it's not a statement of purposes contained in the legislation itself?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2683.746,2684.324,--No.
1980.79-870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2691.056,2695.415,What you're saying then is that Congress made some mistakes.
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2695.415,2699.85,"Yes, but not just made a mistake."
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2854.258,2876.64,"Mr. Byron, isn't it true that in a lot of pension situations a person who retires with 20 years of service in 1974 will get a higher pension than someone who retired with 20 years of service in 1970, say, simply because there's been a decision to increase benefits; and therefore the timing of the date of retirement has a rational... provides a rational explanation for why you get a higher benefit?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2876.64,2880.514,"--Well, I can't... I'm not familiar with the hypothetical I've never seen that--"
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2880.514,2881.871,But would that be irrational?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2905.533,2907.892,"--No, that is incorrect, in our opinion."
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2916.498,2917.108,Put the vesting concept to one side.
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,2922.418,2931.991,"Well, that might be the case if there were no vesting or no actually having earned it, but if you're talking about non-vesteds, they're in a different category and that's a different situation."
1980.79-870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3002.306,3010.694,Can you distinguish in fundamental terms between the Railroad Retirement Act and the Social Security Act as to purpose and objective?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3010.694,3013.272,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3013.272,3014.52,What are the distinctions?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3014.52,3016.473,As the dissent--
1980.79-870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3016.473,3017.769,"They're contributory, aren't they?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3017.769,3019.581,--They're both contributory.
1980.79-870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3032.357,3035.81,How would the amount affect the vested or non-vested aspect?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3035.81,3053.646,"--In this way: as the Railroad Board pamphlet showed, if you have past service, plus in addition to that made the necessary contributions over those particular years of past service; then you earned your permanent right to the benefit."
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3067.702,3079.26,Would you still be here if they... if the law had been changed so as to destroy all of the windfalls?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3079.26,3081.978,Because the act had been--
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3081.978,3086.507,Suppose all vested benefits had been terminated?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3086.507,3090.615,"--Your Honor, I'd have a different class."
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3090.615,3091.49,"Well, you'd have quite a different class."
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3091.49,3093.037,And I'd have a much more difficult problem.
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.442,3100.503,"So this reliance business, that doesn't carry the day, does it?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3100.503,3102.628,It... it assisted--
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3102.628,3104.767,"The fact of vesting in reliance, in that statement in the pamphlet?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3104.767,3106.125,--Yes.
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3108.78,3109.686,But it wouldn't if they'd--
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3109.686,3111.293,"--Well, no, I disagree with that."
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3111.293,3113.496,"--If they'd really been mean about it, it wouldn't."
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3113.496,3119.51,"No, I disagree in the sense that if I had that class to come here and present--"
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3119.51,3120.323,--you'd have a tough case.
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3120.323,3121.073,--I'd certainly be arguing that.
1980.79-870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3121.073,3122.323,But you'd have a tough case.
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3122.323,3124.524,I'd have a tougher case than I've got right here.
1980.79-870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3233.168,3241.571,"All of these things certainly are persuasive that Congress acted unwisely, possibly even unfairly."
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3248.803,3253.143,"--We find that out by looking at the House and the Senate reports, and--"
1980.79-870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3253.143,3254.19,If the language is clear?
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3254.19,3256.018,--The language is not clear.
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3411.19,3419.296,"Mr. Byron, could you give me an example so I'll understand it better of a man who could have made a different choice in the past and qualified?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3419.296,3420.561,--Yes.
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3446.723,3448.972,"Well, they didn't lose the railroad benefit that it vested."
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3448.972,3450.658,Yes--
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3450.658,3457.328,"And they did get the social security... what did they... and they did get additional benefits by additional work in the social security program, didn't they?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3457.328,3457.609,"--No, no."
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3480.381,3480.647,I understand that.
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3482.676,3483.082,--Right.
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3483.832,3488.94,"And it is true that at the time he left railroad service he knew he was going to get a lesser benefit, or did he?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3489.924,3490.237,"No, no."
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3490.565,3492.063,--Is the railroad service always more--
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3492.063,3495.375,"No, and they followed... the benefits pamphlet said they had a permanent right to it."
1980.79-870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3495.375,3496.797,--I see.
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3496.797,3501.138,"But they... so, they did not, and what they're saying is, there's an excess of--"
1980.79-870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3501.138,3505.45,"What did Hisquierdo case say about that contract you've been talking about, that pamphlet?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3505.45,3508.151,"--Well, Hisquierdo did not bring it up."
1980.79-870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3508.98,3510.916,"It said it wasn't contractual, didn't it?"
1980.79-870,1,20537,daniel_p_byron,,3510.916,3513.618,"--It said... yes, the majority said it was--"
1980.79-870,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3561.083,3564.644,Just several points I wanted to make.
1980.79-870,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3665.948,3668.978,"Mr. Kneedler, I understand the legal argument based on Flemming."
1980.79-870,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3695.656,3698.014,"--Well, I think it's... yes I think it's conceivable that persons could have done that."
1980.79-870,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3698.014,3705.276,"Well, he would have been carrying out the purpose of the Railroad Retirement Act when he did it, because part of the purpose was to encourage early retirement."
1980.79-870,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3705.276,3711.836,"Well, yes, but not in the... I mean, the purpose is to... is... talk about early retirement."
1980.79-870,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3714.242,3715.82,Or getting out of the railroad business.
1980.79-870,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3715.82,3717.303,"Well, by retiring."
1980.79-870,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3723.91,3728.078,"Well, it would have been consistent with their purpose to go to work as, say, a milkman or a baker driver or something else, wouldn't it?"
1980.79-870,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3728.078,3729.703,"--That's right, but--"
1980.79-870,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3729.703,3741.48,"So that these people that I am discussing in my hypothetical did fulfill the purpose of retirement, whole retirement program by leaving with the understanding they would get more money under social security?"
1980.79-870,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3741.48,3746.994,"--Yes, it is... I mean, it's conceivable that there could be people who did that, but I think it would be a considerable leap to say that--"
1980.79-870,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3746.994,3748.789,I understand.
1980.79-870,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3750.195,3751.992,--I concede that that would be the majority of the persons in the class.
1980.79-870,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3760.582,3761.519,--Why wouldn't that be a typical person?
1980.79-870,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3764.44,3771.827,"He may have had an expectation but in terms of that being the motivating factor for his leaving the railroad industry, I think that I don't really know--"
1980.79-870,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3771.827,3772.717,It's certainly not unreasonable.
1980.79-870,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3788.133,3788.618,--Right.
1980.79-870,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3788.618,3790.086,"Going on, why should we--"
1980.79-870,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3790.086,3795.866,"No, I... of course, I think that just goes back to whether he had an expectation under prior law."
1980.79-870,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3795.866,3797.553,"--You are saying, well, maybe he did that it's too bad."
1980.79-870,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3799.708,3800.88,That's right.
1980.79-870,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3800.88,3801.271,Yes.
1980.79-870,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3801.271,3803.519,"Thank you, gentlemen."
