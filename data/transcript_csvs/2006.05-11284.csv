2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.684,"We'll hear argument next in 05-11284, Abdul-Kabir vs. Quarterman, and 05-11287, Brewer versus Quarterman."
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,12.292,15.338,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-11284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,103.474,121.31,"Why, when we are told that, that the State will surely challenge Nelson in this Court, and we already have the issue before us, so all that you would achieve is delay, just substituting the Nelson case for this one?"
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,121.31,127.949,"I don't believe, Your Honor, that, that all that would be accomplished by that would be certainly not just delay."
2006.05-11284,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,171.65,175.992,"Well, why can't we just read Nelson and then say in these cases whether or not it's correct?"
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,175.992,194.547,"--I think the main reason, Your Honor, is that these cases aren't Nelson, and that Nelson if it presents issues that are worthy of the Court's consideration, that would be the better vehicle, rather than trying to use in effect these cases to decide issues that are presented by a different set of facts."
2006.05-11284,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,194.547,198.857,If these cases aren't Nelson that's a reason why we should decide these cases; it seems to me.
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,198.857,207.37,"Well, Your Honor, I am, I am confident that if the Court chooses to proceed on the merits of this case that we will prevail on the merits, until it finds--"
2006.05-11284,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,207.37,209.213,"Well, why don't you try to convince us of that?"
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,209.213,211.322,"--Then let me turn, let me turn to our, our merits, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,399.681,402.571,How would you compare that evidence with the evidence in Penry itself?
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,402.571,404.165,"--I think, Your Honor--"
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,404.165,406.726,"These are closer cases than Penry, I think."
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,408.412,413.036,"--I think they are different cases, Your Honor, I'm not willing to concede that they are closer cases."
2006.05-11284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,428.763,446.287,"How does that, if the evidence, suppose we think the evidence is weaker, it's still evidence of childhood abuse and mental disorder of some kind, and those are relevant mitigating factors."
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,446.287,448.568,--Absolutely.
2006.05-11284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,448.849,454.801,So you... if your case is less strong than maybe the jury will decide it the other way.
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,461.844,463.375,"I couldn't agree more, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.26,480.571,"Tennard, Tennard was decided after the State decision here, wasn't it?"
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,480.571,486.147,--This Court's decision in Tennard postdates the State court decisions in both of these cases.
2006.05-11284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,486.6,487.849,"And where is... this is an AEDPA case, isn't it?"
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,487.849,488.536,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.536,516.681,"So we're, we're asking whether this State court made an unreasonable decision at the time, and at the time regardless of what the Fifth Circuit has now said, at the time under Johnson, and... and there is another earlier case, we said that you didn't have to give full mitigating effects; as long as there was some manner in which mitigating effect could be given that was enough."
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,516.681,518.946,The Court has been consistent--
2006.05-11284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,518.946,523.116,So I think Tennard is utterly irrelevant even if it is right.
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,523.116,525.007,"--I, I... I don't agree."
2006.05-11284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.553,567.412,"Did Tennard purport to overrule Smith, even when it came down?"
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,577.469,579.672,"I, I see where Your Honor is--"
2006.05-11284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.672,582.108,"I'm sorry, Johnson, not Smith."
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,582.108,582.389,--Yes.
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,638.303,638.928,In Brewer--
2006.05-11284,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,638.928,640.178,"Well, in Johnson wasn't there also--"
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,640.178,640.834,--Go ahead.
2006.05-11284,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,640.834,651.486,"--Wasn't there also mitigating evidence about a troubled, about his troubled youth, which is analogous to what was involved at least... well in both of these cases?"
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,651.486,654.438,"Very little such evidence, Your Honor, in Mr. Johnson's case."
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,693.313,702.529,"But in, in Brewer's case, it's, quoting the record, evidence of one hospitalization for a single episode of nonpsychotic major depression."
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,712.321,713.649,"--I don't think, Your Honor--"
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,713.649,714.821,Quite a bit different than Penry.
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,714.821,730.034,"--I don't think that you can separate the diagnosis of depression, that, even that one single episode of hospitalization for depression, from what the jury knew about Mr. Brewer's upbringing, from the fact that they knew he had been hit by his father in the terms of, his mother said, numerous times."
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,743.919,753.68,"And your submission... your submission is that every juror is, or a reasonable juror is going to look at that, and the only conclusion that they are going to draw is that he is more likely to be violent in the future?"
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,765.895,779.28,"I think that it's not simply speculation, Your Honor, I think this Court recognized in Tennard as it did in Penry, that when there is evidence of mental impairment before the jury, there is at least the probable inference of dangerousness."
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,810.252,811.299,"So that was in, in Brewer."
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,811.58,812.36,--Yes.
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,812.36,819.732,--there was no reliance or no similar statement by the prosecutor in Abdul-Kabir or Mr. Cole's case.
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,819.732,821.138,There was no similar--
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,821.138,823.496,So do we have different results in these two consolidated cases?
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,823.496,824.37,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,853.407,859.577,"So the, so the... but my point is the absence of a similar prosecutorial statement in the Cole case cuts against you."
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,859.577,862.153,"--It simply doesn't cut as far in favor of us, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,904.369,908.384,Where is evidence of abatement in that case that was before the jury?
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,926.502,931.921,--I think that it's not unconceivable that a juror could have reasoned in that fashion.
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,979.011,982.447,But in Penry we didn't establish a per se rule.
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,991.116,994.224,"I don't... no, Your Honor, and don't let me, please don't let me be misunderstood."
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1026.539,1029.943,"But it's not no reasonable probability, that's not the standard."
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1034.238,1049.561,"I think, Your Honor, that again, removing that language from Smith, from the language in... if you're talking about Johnson, I know you're referring to Johnson, that the language in Johnson about some effect can't be separated from the language about meaningful effect."
2006.05-11284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1049.561,1051.374,It's absolutely one step removed from that.
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1051.374,1052.06,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2006.05-11284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1052.06,1055.387,I say the actual question is even one step removed.
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1062.024,1062.884,That's correct.
2006.05-11284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.367,1063.898,But unreasonable.
2006.05-11284,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1063.898,1065.211,"--That's correct, and I think that it is unreasonable."
2006.05-11284,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1102.961,1104.086,"Thank you, Mr. Owen."
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1108.396,1111.629,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1153.628,1156.173,It's the same kind of evidence.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1179.243,1181.226,"--Well, I disagree, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1197.876,1204.264,"But the evidence was that he didn't react hostilely, he didn't do bad deeds."
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1222.617,1226.832,"Well, Your Honor, that's not the way counsel argued it to the jury in either case."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1238.437,1249.636,"What other choice does defense counsel have, given that the jury is going to get a question, is this man likely to be a danger in the future?"
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1252.713,1255.805,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, that's not the question before the Court."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1261.662,1261.959,Yes.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1282.795,1286.918,"--Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, that's not the question before the Court, though."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1306.846,1318.295,"But realistically, a defense counsel who knows that the jury is going to have those two questions, he's got to fit his argument to the jury into those questions."
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1318.295,1320.279,"--Your Honor, that was a strategic choice, though."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1330.885,1332.914,You're looking at what Texas law forced him to do.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1332.914,1335.226,"I don't think that's the issue before the Court, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1372.415,1381.786,"Jurek was a facial challenge, and the Court said no, on its face we can see that there are things that would fit into it."
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1421.786,1422.379,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1432.733,1436.654,I thought in Johnson the only question presented was age.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1436.654,1438.34,"--In Johnson, Your Honor?"
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1438.34,1439.136,Yes.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1439.136,1446.822,"Youth was the central point of Johnson, but Graham involved youth and a distinctly troubled childhood, much like we have in these cases."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1463.752,1466.236,I don't see how this fits in the Graham package.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1493.303,1495.552,"That's essentially the picture, Justice Ginsburg, in Brewer."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1522.463,1524.665,Where is that charge?
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1524.665,1529.133,"--It appears at page 90 of the joint appendix, Your Honor, and that's the Brewer joint appendix."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1579.644,1585.391,"Is that what the Penry Court was talking about, something like what you just read?"
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1585.391,1597.462,"I think so, Your Honor, and the Penry Court was not specific about what that definition should say, but this is certainly helpful to the jury in this case and in taking account some of this evidence that was before it."
2006.05-11284,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1597.462,1612.41,"But you see, in Johnson the Court was confronted with the special issues and it makes the assumption based on the State's representation there, that the special issues had enough latitude for a jury to fully consider this."
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1638.229,1645.196,"That may be a concern, Justice Kennedy, but the Cole case provides a particular example of how defense counsel countered that argument."
2006.05-11284,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1663.907,1665.28,But that's because the issues confined him to that.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1665.28,1689.74,"That's correct, Your Honor, but that's a legitimate argument on the evidence here, and I think that it would be, it's difficult in my mind anyway to determine that the State court in reading Graham and Johnson could unreasonably determine that that wasn't a good vehicle for the jury when he said, you have a reasonable doubt about this man's dangerousness because of the testimony that we presented to you from his experts that said he wouldn't be dangerous in the future."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1689.74,1694.691,"He's 30 years old, and the testimony is 40, 50."
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1709.842,1715.058,"Justice Ginsburg, that's easily as effective as the... as youth was in Graham and Johnson."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1738.033,1776.845,"--Mr. Marshall, I heard what you read from this charge, and I don't have the exact words of what the Court was talking about in Penry, but it did say a special instruction that would enable the jury who believed Penry committed the crime deliberately, that he committed it deliberately, not slowly, whatever you just read, but also believed that his background and diminished mental capacity diminished his moral culpability, making the imposition of the death sentence unwarranted."
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1808.223,1821.406,"It's different, Your Honor, but I don't think it's that much different, and the reason is that this makes the crime a function of awareness of the consequences of slow unhurried consideration of those consequences."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1849.816,1853.487,Wasn't there something about moral culpability in what you read?
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1853.487,1853.938,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1855.688,1875.664,"That's what Penry makes clear, makes the distinction, between these are factors that don't say he is that dangerous, don't say he didn't act deliberately, but they reduce or the jury may decide that they reduce his moral culpability."
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1878.35,1881.818,"This charge is different and you're correct in that, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-11284,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1984.886,1990.727,"How do we, how does that factor in on the issues that are before us, the weakness of the mitigating evidence?"
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,1996.724,2000.551,"There is no harmless error question, correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-11284,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2031.788,2042.987,"So your argument is that the mitigating evidence was not precluded by, reasonable consideration was not precluded by the instruction; it was precluded by the fact that there wasn't much mitigating evidence to begin with?"
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2042.987,2043.831,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.773,2076.505,"Well, do you think the case should have been decided differently should it have been decided after those decisions?"
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2076.505,2085.141,"Well, Justice Stevens, if we take into account the full effect language that gets quoted in Penry II, we might well have a different result."
2006.05-11284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.844,2090.248,But those decisions didn't purport to change the law.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2090.248,2092.67,"--Well, under Teague they did not purport to change the law."
2006.05-11284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.97,2140.152,"Am I correct, your position essentially is that, while it may well be true that these instructions did not permit the jury to give full effect to this mitigating evidence, that was not clearly established law at the time of these decisions?"
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2140.152,2141.058,"--That's correct, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-11284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2141.058,2143.103,That's your view.
2006.05-11284,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2143.103,2145.556,Were these decisions post-Johnson.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2145.556,2146.603,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2220.166,2236.16,Are you suggesting that some kind of a psychological expert would say that abuse as an adolescent is not as damaging as abuse as a young child?
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2236.16,2237.425,"--I'm not suggesting that, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.609,2245.531,I guess striking a big--
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2248.045,2250.295,"That may be true, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2250.295,2255.058,If the question is one of--
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2263.257,2267.084,"Well, there is, there is that--"
2006.05-11284,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2269.349,2270.036,The likelihood of?
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2270.036,2272.254,Of constitutional error.
2006.05-11284,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2272.254,2274.223,"Well, constitutional error--"
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2274.457,2275.425,Is the reasonable likelihood--
2006.05-11284,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2275.425,2275.94,--Yes.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2275.94,2280.643,--Reasonable likelihood that the juror was precluded from considering the relevant mitigating evidence.
2006.05-11284,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2280.643,2281.049,All right.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2293.229,2299.633,"Well, I think it's a reasonable reading of Graham and Johnson, though, Your Honor, that weak evidence does fit within these special issues."
2006.05-11284,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2308.177,2321.595,"So imagine you're a juror and you think to yourself, I see all this stuff about the childhood, frankly it doesn't move me so far as his dangerousness, I think he's dangerous, and I also think he did it deliberately."
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2337.119,2346.645,"Well, Your Honor, the State court considering this case was looking at Graham, in which the Court Stated that that evidence fit within future dangerousness."
2006.05-11284,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2346.645,2347.926,"No, no."
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2365.872,2366.543,Yes.
2006.05-11284,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2366.543,2367.121,The answer is no.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2367.121,2369.075,"Yes, Justice Breyer, the answer is yes."
2006.05-11284,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2369.075,2370.308,The answer is yes?
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2370.308,2372.542,The answer is yes because this Court said it was yes.
2006.05-11284,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2386.505,2388.504,I'm not talking about future dangerousness.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2402.499,2403.936,"Yes, yes."
2006.05-11284,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.936,2406.2,"All right, and the answer is yes, you can take it in to show mercy?"
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2406.2,2407.872,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2407.872,2412.072,And what's the Texas case that says that?
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2412.072,2414.104,"Your Honor, it's not a Texas case."
2006.05-11284,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2429.847,2435.204,"Well, did we say that in the case of all childhood, in cases, in every case of childhood abuse and so forth?"
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2435.204,2436.969,--The question is--
2006.05-11284,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2436.969,2441.186,Or was it really applied just in the context of the Graham evidence?
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2441.186,2446.23,"--Well, Your Honor, in these cases it's relevant for the same reasons it was in Graham."
2006.05-11284,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2452.276,2453.072,Right.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2464.021,2465.739,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2465.739,2471.628,"And that depends on the nature of the evidence, I take it?"
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2497.773,2499.601,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-11284,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2499.601,2512.267,"And so when you get into this evidence of child abuse, I mean, how are we supposed to decide if the evidence is sufficient so that anyone looking at it is going to say, he's only going to do it again, or if someone who's looking at it is going to say, well, there's an excuse for it and he's going to outgrow it?"
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2519.046,2521.014,"I don't think there's any other way to do it, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-11284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2532.947,2554.672,"Unless you take the view that Penry took, which is you have to let the jury distinguish between dangerousness and deliberate conduct on the one hand and mitigation for mercy purposes that don't tie in at all to dangerousness."
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2554.672,2560.81,"--That's because, Justice Ginsburg, the Penry's evidence was relevant only in an aggravating way to those issues."
2006.05-11284,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2579.163,2591.846,"Can you tell me, if you know, how many cases in the Texas system, capital cases, are pending that were decided before the legislature amended the instruction?"
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2591.846,2598.419,"Justice Kennedy, there are 47 inmates on Texas death row that were sentenced under this statute that remain there."
2006.05-11284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.926,2626.065,But that wasn't the question.
2006.05-11284,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2630.688,2634.983,But I take it your answer was that all these were tried before Texas amended the statute.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2637.934,2638.575,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2638.575,2640.934,And all the cases you mentioned were tried before 1991.
2006.05-11284,1,22743,edward_l_marshall,,2640.934,2641.184,Yes.
2006.05-11284,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2650.976,2652.694,"Thank you, Mr. Marshall."
2006.05-11284,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,2655.663,2663.628,I'd like to make two points about Graham since it's been a subject of some discussion.
2006.05-11284,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2788.562,2791.609,How old was Brewer at that time?
2006.05-11284,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,2791.609,2793.325,"I believe he was 15, Your Honor."
2006.05-11284,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2827.749,2837.51,But the argument is that the jury hearing this evidence in light of all the instructions will only conclude that the evidence shows that he will be violent again.
2006.05-11284,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,2856.019,2857.268,"--I think, Your Honor--"
2006.05-11284,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2857.268,2864.187,"Or that in, I guess in Brewer's case in particular, that since the violence was caused by a particular bout of depression, that would not necessarily recur."
2006.05-11284,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,2864.187,2868.78,"--I, I don't think that's... that's not our argument, first, Your Honor, for this reason."
2006.05-11284,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2885.585,2892.941,"--that was after... I guess the question would be under Johnson, whether or not it could be considered in some manner."
2006.05-11284,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,2892.941,2897.675,--In some manner that is reasonable and that gives effect to the relevant mitigating qualities of the evidence.
2006.05-11284,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2997.932,2998.432,Thank you Mr. Owen.
