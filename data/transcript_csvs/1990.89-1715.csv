1990.89-1715,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.451,"We'll hear argument now on No. 89-1715, Cathy Burns v. Rick Reed."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,9.762,12.995,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,22.132,27.006,"You are not say to [inaudible], just an opportunity."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,27.006,28.177,"An opportunity, yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1715,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,88.668,95.197,"Excuse me, when you say the exclusive prerogative of the prosecutor, you mean under the particular State law in question."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,103.819,117.127,"Justice Scalia, I think that the functional approach and the review of the common law which suggests that that would be taken into account in a primary way."
1990.89-1715,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,135.744,137.4,"Well, I thought you were talking about the filing of charges?"
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,144.429,147.505,--In... what I'm saying--
1990.89-1715,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,147.505,162.156,"Because if so, that would take care of Justice Scalia's question and, I assume, preclude absolute immunity for the filing of any... through the application for any search warrant before formal charges are filed."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,162.156,174.759,"--Justice Kennedy, I believe that the... this Court's consideration in Malley v. Briggs suggested that the application of a search warrant was typically not a judicial act."
1990.89-1715,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.858,202.967,I understand that.
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,215.259,216.509,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1715,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,221.273,222.304,I did say arrest warrant.
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,222.304,222.522,Yes.
1990.89-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.05,393.69,"Well, what about... well, maybe that's because prosecutors don't give advice in those circuits."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,393.69,396.624,"That is possible, Your Honor."
1990.89-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,396.624,400.936,"Well, I mean they're probably obeying... they're probably avoiding a risk."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,400.936,414.305,"The idea of giving advice, Justice White, is certainly to be encouraged, and we're not suggesting that any ruling under Imbler or any clarification should impede that."
1990.89-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,421.615,423.348,Do you think qualified immunity is enough?
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,423.348,425.333,"--Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1990.89-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.957,475.61,"What... why should anyone, judge or prosecutor at his core functions, why should he have absolute immunity?"
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,478.78,496.944,"The... Your Honor, the public policy and functional assessment or analysis of that office has led this Court and traditionally has resulted in the belief that certain core, essential functions must be protected by absolute immunity--"
1990.89-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,496.944,497.694,Because?
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,497.694,501.709,"--Because they act as a judicial officer, making critical decisions."
1990.89-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,501.709,509.221,"Well, I know but that... why should the judicial officer... what's the purpose of giving him more than qualified immunity?"
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,509.221,513.376,It would impede his ability to make impartial and objective judgements.
1990.89-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,537.757,546.346,"Oh, a judge... perhaps a judge ought to know what clearly established law is, and he wouldn't be liable unless he violated it."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,550.188,564.84,"--The... Justice White, the prosecutor's office as sovereign... as counsel for the sovereign is perhaps the most powerful office and his discretionary power requires him to make judgments, often close calls."
1990.89-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,566.667,576.6,"How can it be a close call in identifying what you've just said isn't too hard a thing, a clearly established law?"
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,576.6,584.19,"--Oftentimes, it is difficult to discern on the spot what clearly defined law is."
1990.89-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,596.327,601.511,"It also keeps him out of litigation, absolute immunity does."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,601.511,608.791,"Well, absolute immunity would keep him out of litigation, but it would not promote the public good and would not serve any legitimate public policy interest."
1990.89-1715,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,625.174,632.873,"Why doesn't that apply when he moves... the magistrate for a search warrant before an arrest, before filing charges?"
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,643.261,656.973,"Justice Kennedy, I think that issue was addressed in Malley v. Briggs, in that if you apply the functional test it should make no difference what hat the person is wearing, but what the function under scrutiny truly is."
1990.89-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.884,694.068,"xxx this fellow... here's this person sitting behind the bench, issuing a search warrant who gets absolute immunity."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,694.068,705.11,"--That is correct, Justice White, and that's as it should be because he is... he is charged with being an impartial magistrate, determining whether or not a warrant should be issued--"
1990.89-1715,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.11,706.141,"Yeah, but the suit says he isn't."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,713.904,718.809,--In this country anybody can be sued for the cost of a filing fee.
1990.89-1715,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.232,756.028,"Mr. Sutherlin, why... let's explore that."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,796.901,805.256,"Justice Scalia, in this particular case, all the conduct preceded any judicial involvement."
1990.89-1715,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.484,877.759,"I understand that, and that's all terrible if it... you know, if it occurred the way you say, but what also could have occurred is he could have... he could have filed a... an indictment that was just... just a pack of lies for which he would have had absolute immunity."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,880.977,882.397,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1715,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.397,884.475,"Now why, is the one different from the other?"
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,889.395,900.483,"In most competing interests where one right could be, say, trampled by a governmental objective, there must be a balancing."
1990.89-1715,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1073.819,1083.659,"Of course, there's a third alternative, too, isn't there, and isn't that that if the immunity is only qualified, any prosecutor who has the option is not going to give advice at all."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,1097.528,1107.9,"Justice Souter, if... that is a possibility of course, and I suppose it might depend on each individual's propensities to give advice and to involve themselves in--"
1990.89-1715,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1107.9,1114.788,"Well, if you had the choice and you knew that by giving no advice, you had nothing to worry about."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,1139.903,1142.636,"--If I may answer this way, Justice Souter."
1990.89-1715,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1163.471,1180.309,"That... that's right, but your rule would in fact encourage that the situation in which the advice would be coming from the sergeant rather than coming from a prosecutor whom one hopes might have some detachment and perhaps a greater fund of legal knowledge."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,1180.309,1214.67,"Well, if... if the public policy to be served is to protect the integrity of the judicial process, that is, the integrity of the discretionary power of the prosecutor to file charges or not, then other activities of the prosecutor, which perhaps might make him less objective and might draw him into being a part of the investigative effort, that might cause him to jeopardize his impartiality and his objectivity."
1990.89-1715,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1334.84,1340.089,"Well, that's true of... lots of cases are settled on the merit... settled by payment of money, aren't they, Mr. Sutherlin?"
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,1344.961,1357.801,"That's true, Mr. Chief Justice, but this particular article actually analyzed the method by which these cases were disposed, and the vast majority of them, all but two as I recall, were disposed of by motions to dismiss or summary judgment."
1990.89-1715,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1385.618,1388.429,Or else that the prosecutors are pulling their punches in those circuits.
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,1388.429,1390.413,"That is quite possible, Your Honor."
1990.89-1715,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1450.561,1459.23,"Mr. Sutherlin, most of your argument has been in the nature of a kind of argument you make to a legislature about what kind of rule we ought to adopt and what would be a wise rule."
1990.89-1715,0,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,1467.053,1471.709,"The... Your Honor, if I could answer that question very briefly."
1990.89-1715,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1534.418,1535.886,"Very well, Mr. Sutherlin."
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1538.51,1544.85,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1715,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1574.792,1588.16,Are both the functions here are functions that the State law says are within the scope of the prosecutorial function in that State?
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1588.16,1588.66,"Yes, Your Honor, they are."
1990.89-1715,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1615.415,1616.93,Is it covered by statute?
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1616.93,1619.054,"No, Justice, it is not covered by statute."
1990.89-1715,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1623.178,1625.927,Is there case law on the question?
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1625.927,1643.811,"--Only to the extent, Your Honor, that the Packman itself discusses Griffith v. Slinkard, which is the text on common law case we rely on and later on we see Foster v. Pearcy in Indiana in the 1970's dealing with a wide-ranging deal, a wide-ranging variety of prosecutorial duties."
1990.89-1715,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1674.58,1683.655,"How about getting warrants in the, in the State; is it customary that warrants are obtained by the prosecutor as opposed to the police?"
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1683.655,1684.373,"Almost always, Justice."
1990.89-1715,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1738.711,1745.224,"Well, didn't the State trial judge testify in this hearing that the prosecutor had to be in her court before a search warrant would be issued?"
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1745.224,1751.128,"Yes, Justice, this is a local custom and practice rather than State law but absolutely that is correct."
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.128,1757.11,"Mr. Spear, looking at your, your answer to Justice O'Connor prompted this thought in my mind."
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1778.632,1789.846,"That is a cutting edge of the question, whether that immunity would apply in that situation, Justice, and I would believe that it would depend on whether or not it was an integral part of their duties under State law, whether that be statutory law--"
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1789.846,1797.516,"Well, I'm assuming it would be that the police have a regular procedure of going to some lawyer... maybe they hire the lawyer just to give the police legal advice... but he never prosecutes."
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1797.516,1803.202,"--Under those circumstances, if it was the functional equivalent of what a prosecuting attorney does in most cases, yes--"
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1803.202,1803.53,Well--
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1803.53,1804.186,"--otherwise, no."
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1804.186,1807.637,--It's the functional equivalent of what some prosecutors do.
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1807.637,1810.277,"Yes, Justice."
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1810.277,1817.305,"But you say that, that if, if any... a nonprosecutor gives legal advice, he'd get the prosecutorial immunity?"
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1817.305,1820.897,Only in a limited circumstance where it was an integral part of his duties.
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1820.897,1821.085,Part of his duties.
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1821.085,1822.21,It would not be a wide-ranging thing.
1990.89-1715,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.612,1832.643,I don't understand what principle you use to get there.
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1843.997,1846.371,The question comes about--
1990.89-1715,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.371,1846.84,What is all this based on?
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1848.387,1854.322,"--Whether or not it's an integral part of the judicial process we would submit is the answer to that, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1715,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.322,1858.288,"Giving, giving legal advice is an integral part of the judicial process?"
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1858.288,1859.428,We would submit that it is.
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1880.342,1884.98,Does he give better legal advice if he has absolute immunity than if he has no immunity?
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1888.089,1894.68,"--Most lawyers, Justice, are not subject to the kind of litigation from 1983 that the prosecuting attorney is."
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1894.68,1895.087,"Well, some of them are."
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1902.208,1913.422,"I would submit, Justice, that in the hurly-burly of the criminal justice system that, that police officers, judges, and prosecuting attorneys draw far many more lawsuits than the average member of the bar."
1990.89-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1913.422,1922.091,"Mr. Spear, getting to the person involved, do you claim this right to everybody in the prosecutor's office?"
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1922.091,1925.87,"Only a prosecuting attorney or his deputies who are members of the bar, Justice."
1990.89-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1925.87,1926.698,Only what?
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1926.698,1930.228,Only the prosecuting attorney or his deputies who are members of the bar.
1990.89-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1930.228,1938.99,"For all of those and if the prosecutor's office has 250 people, they all have absolute immunity--"
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1938.99,1940.457,If they are lawyers.
1990.89-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1940.457,1941.051,--without more.
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1941.051,1947.83,"For the facts in this case and for those key prosecutorial functions under Imbler, Justice, yes."
1990.89-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1947.83,1951.188,But not just because he's the prosecutor?
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1951.188,1955.264,"No, it relates to the function and not simply because he's the prosecuting attorney, Justice."
1990.89-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1955.264,1959.169,"Well, well, the function would be anybody in the prosecutor's office who is a lawyer."
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1959.169,1960.512,"Yes, Justice."
1990.89-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1960.512,1967.181,"Well, where does a lawyer who was just hired yesterday get any policy making theory?"
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1967.181,1975.054,"I would submit, Justice, that in this particular instance it's not necessarily policy making but the choice of whether or not--"
1990.89-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1975.054,1979.005,"Well, don't the cases say policy making position?"
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1979.005,1991.515,"--I would submit, Justice, that they deal in a criminal justice context simply with a judge and prosecutor context, as opposed to for instance the absolute immunity of the President of the United States which is, which is a policy making question."
1990.89-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1991.515,1996.747,"And if the opinion's limited to policy making people, you lose?"
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1996.747,1998.716,I would suggest--
1990.89-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1998.716,1999.262,You want to go that far?
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,1999.262,2001.199,"--Not necessarily, Justice, because I'm not sure--"
1990.89-1715,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.199,2001.699,I hope not.
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2001.699,2011.024,"--Justice, I would think not, simply because in a courtroom whether you are the prosecutor or the deputy prosecutor, you are the State of Indiana when you bring an action."
1990.89-1715,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.187,2071.795,"Mr. Spear, the, the phrase... you didn't use quite the phrase that we used in Imbler."
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2085.071,2088.538,"Well, do you think that's an accurate description of what you're urging us to accept?"
1990.89-1715,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.377,2147.608,But Imbler saved the question of whether in giving advice... wasn't that subject to an absolute immunity?
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2147.608,2160.822,"Certainly, Justice, it did not decide the specific issues in this case, but it gave us the teachings to apply to a fact situation and reach a result which we believe that the circuits and the district courts have over the years."
1990.89-1715,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.241,2180.579,But just giving legal advice is perhaps different from actually appearing in court to get a search warrant.
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2180.579,2188.341,"We would suggest that it is a similar situation because this prosecuting attorney did not appear in court as a witness, Justice."
1990.89-1715,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.966,2191.121,"Sure, sure, sure."
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2191.121,2193.606,This is a function that he would be doing in a trial situation.
1990.89-1715,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.933,2197.042,But it's different from just giving legal advice?
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2197.042,2198.213,"--Yes, Justice, it certainly is."
1990.89-1715,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.213,2204.398,And somewhere I suppose there might be differences between what the advice related to.
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2214.909,2220.688,"We believe those two are almost identical questions where his asking questions in court is a separate question, Justice."
1990.89-1715,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2221.985,2230.012,And how is it that the giving of the advice is intimately associated with the judicial function?
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2230.012,2242.663,"We would submit, Justice, that if the... the prosecuting attorney by analogy does exactly the same thing with regard to a grand jury that he or she does in this case."
1990.89-1715,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2271.105,2281.133,"Mr. Spear, what, what happens down the line... if the person who gives the advice has absolute immunity and the person who receives it continues to have qualified immunity I suppose, right?"
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2281.133,2282.367,"Yes, Justice."
1990.89-1715,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2282.367,2295.69,"So that if you have somebody who has absolute immunity giving advice to a policeman, as long as a policeman seeks advice from somebody who can't possibly be held liable for it, the policeman can't be held liable and also the person who gave the advice can't at all be held liable."
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2295.69,2298.626,"I'm not sure the policeman can't be held liable, Justice."
1990.89-1715,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2315.711,2320.101,"Well, I think it would be a pretty hard fact situation where you get advice from a lawyer."
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2327.926,2334.58,"The, the doctrine of absolute judicial immunity, prosecutorial immunity, Justice, is not to protect the individuals."
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2345.231,2346.059,Mr. Spear--
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2356.227,2362.099,"I would suggest that at least in Griffith v. Slinkard, which is the Indiana case--"
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2362.099,2363.646,Which is not a legal advice case.
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2363.646,2367.535,"--I would suggest that giving advice to a grand jury is a legal advice case, Justice."
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2367.535,2369.096,Isn't that the one where he added the name to the--
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2369.096,2377.031,"Yes, he did, but he also asked what... allegedly suborned perjury in front of the grand jury and allegedly... and gave legal advice to the grand jury as well."
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.031,2381.374,"--Well, have you got any cases involving giving legal advice to police officers?"
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2381.374,2383.716,In terms of--
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2383.716,2387.715,Wherein at the common law it was found that that was absolutely immune.
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2387.715,2388.887,"--No, Justice."
1990.89-1715,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2388.887,2402.177,"Mr. Spear, do you think that the prosecutor here would have been able to obtain summary judgment under qualified immunity?"
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2402.177,2404.223,"We believe so, Justice."
1990.89-1715,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2404.223,2406.55,Or is that open to some question?
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2406.55,2410.283,"We obviously would disagree with petitioner about that, but we believe he would."
1990.89-1715,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2435.086,2441.957,How about concealing the basis for the background of the warrant from the judge?
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2441.957,2446.299,"--We would submit, Justice, that the record shows that he asked the officer questions."
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.847,2487.252,"Yeah, but that's not an immunity argument, that's just there was no cause of action, isn't that right?"
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2487.252,2487.768,"Yes, Justice."
1990.89-1715,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2487.768,2488.033,Yeah.
1990.89-1715,1,40533,robert_s_spear,,2488.033,2490.766,But there is a common law principle involved here.
1990.89-1715,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2562.91,2564.971,"Thank you, Mr. Spear."
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2566.534,2578.278,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1715,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2653.029,2675.551,"Well, the prosecutor goes with the police to execute a search warrant because he thinks and the police think maybe there's some question about how far they can go with the search if he goes with him and gives him some advice and he's dead wrong."
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2678.206,2693.42,"In that situation, Justice White, rare as it may be at least in the Federal practice... it doesn't matter where the prosecutor is, whether he's on the phone in his office or at the scene, although it's a bad practice for the prosecutor to be on the scene because he could become a witness, which is something you don't want."
1990.89-1715,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.543,2698.058,So you're answer is he would be absolutely immune--
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2698.058,2698.761,"--Yes, but if he's on the--"
1990.89-1715,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.761,2700.151,--Because he's only giving advice.
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2700.151,2700.354,--Right.
1990.89-1715,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2719.486,2721.736,Does it matter if he's a prosecutor?
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2729.889,2733.716,--We... our submission here is not that anyone who gives legal advice--
1990.89-1715,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2733.716,2734.544,"--Well, why not?"
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2734.544,2735.777,--Because that person--
1990.89-1715,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.777,2737.979,If you say it's an integral part of--
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2737.979,2738.651,"--It's, it's--"
1990.89-1715,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2738.651,2740.464,--the integrity of the judicial process?
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2740.464,2747.959,"--The person, the legal advice giver in your hypothetical who's not a prosecutor isn't functioning the system the way a prosecutor does."
1990.89-1715,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.374,2775.417,"Well, the police are always trying to make cases, and so here's one police department that hires their own lawyer to give them advice about search warrants."
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2781.415,2784.039,"--I wouldn't say it's a major difference, Justice White, but in this case--"
1990.89-1715,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2784.039,2785.178,"Well, enough to--"
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2785.178,2795.753,"--Yes, we would, we would pause before we would want the court to clothe absolute immunity to that person as opposed to a prosecutor and the distinction is... and it's what Imbler against Packman suggests."
1990.89-1715,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2832.924,2839.156,--You label him greater immunity than the cop on the beat who obeys his advice?
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2839.156,2851.699,"Yes, the unfortunate or as was pointed out before, one apparent anomaly is that the police officer goes to the prosecutor and says... one hypothetical would be... can I beat this person up to get a confession?"
1990.89-1715,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.804,2863.46,"The competent prosecutor who knows it's unconstitutional says, yes, that's constitutional, go beat him up."
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2865.302,2870.815,"--Yes, it doesn't... in our submission the prosecutor is scot-free."
1990.89-1715,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2887.528,2889.808,"Mr. Lazerwitz, can I ask you the same question I've asked the other lawyers?"
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2894.212,2899.586,"Justice Stevens, in our brief we made three points on this particular question."
1990.89-1715,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2919.358,2920.858,With the cuts against you of course.
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2920.858,2927.433,"--It does to a certain extent, but to the extent that we look for a common law analog... this goes back to my point before."
1990.89-1715,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2969.418,2974.354,"Well, I suppose it's still somewhat unsettled as to the nature of the cause of action here, too."
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2975.712,2977.821,--It is... it's at least on the--
1990.89-1715,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2977.821,2985.475,"So you want to argue alternative, not argue for immunity, but just argue as an analogy of the common law that while the lawyer isn't responsible in this situation."
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2985.475,2989.349,"--Well, at common law, of course, today, the privity rules have changed--"
1990.89-1715,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2989.349,2989.817,Yeah.
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2989.817,2991.457,--and there are suits where people sue lawyers.
1990.89-1715,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3015.571,3026.52,"The rule, rule we get from what you say is that if a policeman wants to violate somebody's rights the rule is be sure and get a prosecutor to advise you?"
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3026.52,3028.378,"Yes, in some respects--"
1990.89-1715,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3028.378,3029.863,Is that what the rule is?
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3029.863,3042.781,"--That's, that's one of the offshoots of our submission, that the reason why we believe that absolute immunity is necessary is to keep the prosecutors in the wheel, in the decision making, to have them available, so they can--"
1990.89-1715,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3042.781,3048.028,"Yes, but you don't really suggest that no prosecutor would ever give legal advice if he didn't absolutely mean it."
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3063.802,3078.859,"--In looking at individual cases, there's no doubt that you don't, you wouldn't think that you need this absolute protection, but the point of the doctrine, and this Court has recognized this in Imbler and other cases, is you have to look at the broader category of cases."
1990.89-1715,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3105.488,3107.894,"Yes, but the thing you're avoiding is frivolous suits."
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3127.496,3134.039,"--Well, I can't stand before the Court and say that which ever way this case comes out, the Federal prosecutor is no longer going to answer the phone and give advice."
1990.89-1715,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3152.266,3153.375,Has it happened up until now?
1990.89-1715,2,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,3158.296,3163.637,"There are reported cases, there may be several dozen if that many."
1990.89-1715,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3165.23,3166.933,"Thank you, Mr. Lazerwitz."
1990.89-1715,3,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,3168.479,3170.213,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I do."
1990.89-1715,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3266.376,3281.542,"We have said that qualified immunity is an objective standard insofar as our involved cases in which the plaintiff tries to show that, that the defendant knew it was wrong."
1990.89-1715,3,36776,michael_k_sutherlin,,3307.688,3332.585,"I believe that I can't right now cite you to one, Justice Scalia, but I believe have run across at least two cases in preparing where the courts have said it would be an inconsistent outcome to hold the prosecutor absolutely immune and to find that the police officer was not entitled to any immunity, although he might otherwise be, because he sought the advice."
1990.89-1715,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3403.462,3405.837,The case is submitted.
