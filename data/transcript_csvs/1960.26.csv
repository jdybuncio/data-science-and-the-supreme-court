1960.26,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,285.145,292.777,Was Wenzell's connection with First Boston known to Dodge and Hughes when they saw everything?
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,292.777,294.826,There's no question of what it was.
1960.26,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,294.826,295.499,It was known.
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,295.499,299.557,"It was known, all the way through."
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,394.723,400.171,"When you said his employment, Mr. Solicitor, was the -- was the term of the employment formal?"

1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,403.893,405.558,-- oral negotiation.
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,405.558,412.198,I think that the nature of it is not disputed as far as the record is concerned.
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,518.409,523.381,When did First Boston first entered the entire plant action?
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,528.249,552.918,"The first time was on January 20th, when Mr. Wenzell, without consulting Mr. Hughes or Mr. Dodge, took Paul Miller from First Boston who had worked on OVEC, the big similar project at Portsmouth, Ohio in earlier time."
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,569.943,570.823,This was on his own?
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,570.823,572.906,That was -- this was on his own.
1960.26,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,575.024,576.052,1954.
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,576.052,577.156,Yes.

1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,749.831,752.726,"So now, this is the first time that you've mentioned this."
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,765.191,771.361,"Well, what he was doing was going back and asking them in order to substantiate his --"
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,771.361,773.26,"Well, is -- is Miller and --"
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,773.26,777.044,"It is -- no, First Boston including other people in First Boston."
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,777.044,783.939,Is this right that this is the first time to enter to -- your story as a corporate being?
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,783.939,784.811,"Well, I think so."
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,809.837,813.099,I wasn't getting to the point of -- of liability or responsible -- I just want to get --
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,813.099,813.4,Yes.
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,813.4,814.729,-- the sequence of events.
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,814.729,815.709,Yes.
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,836.407,839.82,The information derived from the -- his superior at First Boston?
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,839.82,840.8,Yes.
1960.26,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,938.974,943.337,Are we still into that January (Inaudible)?
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,943.337,944.961,I think in February as when --
1960.26,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,944.961,946.608,February.
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,946.608,951.629,-- we get to the meeting with Mr. Linsley.
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,968.79,970.595,I miss -- who raised the question?
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,970.595,981.808,"Mr. James, who was the -- one of the counsel with Mr. Cahill's firm for Mr. Dixon's Middle South Utilities that was one of the sponsors in this matter."
1960.26,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1019.224,1020.538,Whom he said this to?
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1020.538,1023.723,"He said that to Mr. Dixon, his client."
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1171.229,1177.198,(Voice Overlap) if I understand it was Wenzell who raised the question to the Director of the Budget --
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1177.198,1177.731,That's right.
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1177.731,1183.307,"-- and he was the Director who -- who specified his -- his doubts, is that it?"
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1183.307,1190.356,"Yes, but he did say, Your Honor, if he was disturbed about it, he ought to consult his lawyer and he ought to tell Mr. Dodge."
1960.26,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1263.585,1272.491,We'll recess now.
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1272.491,1292.903,Mr. Wenzell did not do as requested by (Inaudible) through the Bureau of the Budget that First Boston was going to be involved in the financing and give the Budget an opportunity to pass upon the advertising for any fee.
1960.26,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1370.997,1373.834,"To whom was the proposal made, Mr. Solicitor General?"
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1375.1,1375.98,The proposal was made to --
1960.26,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1375.98,1376.936,-- Atomic Energy Commission or --
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1376.936,1379.957,The proposal was made to the Budget.
1960.26,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1384.215,1385.878,You mean the head of the Budget?
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1385.878,1398.528,"No, I think it was -- as a government of the matter, it -- it was given to the -- the Budget but I think no question what he was acting on behalf of the Government at the time."
1960.26,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1420.889,1422.938,"Now, this was Mr. Dixon's proposal."
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1422.938,1423.565,That's right.
1960.26,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1423.565,1424.322,Yes.
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1424.322,1444.065,"Now, after that, there was a considerable period when it was being studied by Budget and by AEC and Mr. Wenzell, shortly after that, said that he was not qualified in regard to overall cost and the Government should get someone else."
1960.26,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1644.197,1647.907,And he was then working for -- for First Boston?
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1647.907,1648.773,First Boston.
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1649.374,1679.27,"Do I understand -- do I -- am I right to infer that if -- to the extent that you can disentangle Wenzell from what conceded between April 3rd and April 10th, you know that -- in addition contrary to the fact but assume one could that as to the events between April 3rd and April 10th, he was dissociated from -- from the governmental activity, is that right?"
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1679.27,1680.72,"Well, he was -- I cannot --"
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1680.72,1681.804,I don't mean formally.
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1683.566,1683.62,Yes.
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1683.62,1685.2,-- we had no active (Inaudible)
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1685.2,1685.915,In that form --
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1685.915,1688.993,"-- in what was going on between April 3rd and April 10th, is that right?"
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1688.993,1689.682,That's right.
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1690.495,1690.605,But your --
1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1690.605,1691.01,Now --
1960.26,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1691.01,1695.687,-- position is that that was an organic rule that we trust repeatedly (Inaudible).

1960.26,0,32701,j_lee_rankin,,1737.186,1744.857,"Raben because Arthur Dean, the senior partner was not then available in New York and he told him about what he'd done."
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,3564.289,3567.636,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3746.465,3746.724,May I ask you --
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,3746.724,3748.633,-- not by us but by the Bureau of the Budget.
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3749.249,3750.229,May I ask a general question --
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,3750.229,3750.291,Sure.
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3750.291,3751.873,-- Mr. Cahill.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,3764.633,3766.189,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3768.12,3768.488,That's why I'm asking you.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,3768.488,3779.409,"But we say in our main brief, it is not facetious that the (Inaudible) statement facts of the Government's brief must not have been acquainted with the man who wrote the argument, in the Government brief."
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3791.372,3794.968,"But in any event, there's a universal acceptance of the findings of fact by the (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,3794.968,3797.026,"As a matter of record, that is so."
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3797.026,3797.913,"Right, thank you."
1960.26,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3797.913,3801.877,And the findings of fact include the only findings the Court made.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,3801.877,3804.55,That is right and they're unanimous before Your Honor.
1960.26,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3808.906,3813.635,So that any casualization of opinions are not findings of fact for the casualization.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,3813.635,3817.318,"Right, sir."
1960.26,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3905.939,3907.618,Those days are not on the proposal.
1960.26,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3907.618,3908.352,(Voice Overlap) not here.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,3908.352,3909.565,They're all of record.

1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,3910.906,3916.284,"No, they're not on the chart that you have before Your Honor because they have no relation with what ultimately happened."

1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4039.395,4040.869,Who was known by whom?
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4040.869,4042.101,It was known by the Government.
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4042.101,4043.678,"Well, the Government's --"
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4043.678,4044.075,"Well, take for --"

1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4044.799,4045.03,He came to view --
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4045.03,4046.006,Was it known by this --
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4046.006,4046.038,-- he came to --
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4046.038,4048.572,-- was it known by this congressional committee?
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4048.572,4050.375,I can't speak as the congressional committee.
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4056.235,4057.008,Yes.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4057.008,4058.421,-- of Hughes.
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4058.421,4058.892,So Mr. Hughes -- Mr. Dodge --
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4058.892,4060.678,And they -- Mr. Hughes knew he was --
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4060.678,4062.374,Yes.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4062.374,4068.35,-- First Boston when he went over the Atomic Energy Commission and Your Honor knows what security precautions they have.
1960.26,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4077.567,4081.172,He knew (Inaudible)
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4081.172,4106.255,"So then, we come to October the 6th where the Atomic Energy Commission reported to the Joint Committee of the Congress that the October 1st proof of contract had been approved by the AEC, which had received favorable letters from the Federal Power Commission, General Accounting Office, Tennessee Valley Authority, Bureau of the Budget, Chief of Engineers and General Council of the AEC."
1960.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4145.265,4151.344,Are these the only dates in Wenzell's consultancy that -- that you think we should be interested?
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4151.344,4152.435,"That's all, Your Honor."
1960.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4153.809,4154.207,Well --
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4154.207,4154.921,That is it.
1960.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4154.921,4175.225,"-- it seemed to me that Solicitor General gave us number, rather dates between January 18th and April 3rd that -- in which Mr. Wenzell did certain things that were more active than just went to Washington."
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4175.225,4183.938,"Oh, Mr. Chief Justice, I will deal with what Mr. Wenzell did during this period of time.Remember, there's only a part-time occupancy with them."
1960.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4184.462,4189.252,"Oh, I -- I just -- I just wondered that there weren't other dates in there that --"
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4189.252,4194.691,"There are other dates, Mr. Chief Justice, but they're all to the common point which I'm about to deal with now, namely --"
1960.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4194.691,4194.966,Go ahead.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4194.966,4207.629,"-- the title on the second chart, “From the opinion of the Court of Claims, the cost of money was determined by forces beyond the control of the contracting parties.”"
1960.26,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4207.629,4209.106,"That is not a finding, is it?"
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4209.106,4211.41,"No, that's from the opinion."
1960.26,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4281.738,4283.828,"But the 54, that's what he says."
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4283.828,4291.416,"Yes, fairly studied but on the other hand, it wasn't the judgment of Wenzell of First Boston that counted."
1960.26,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4316.103,4318.819,It's very often for you to think they're right and it turned out to be wrong.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4318.819,4319.672,That is true.
1960.26,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4324.608,4325.317,This is guesswork.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4325.317,4332.418,"Yes, on the gallop hole, Mr. Wenzell was in his prophecy of 3.50."
1960.26,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4332.418,4335.591,"Well, you encourage me in -- in my precision at least."
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4337.473,4340.525,I agree completely.
1960.26,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4529.356,4530.64,"May I ask you, Mr. Cahill --"
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4530.64,4531.113,"Surely, Mr. Justice Black."
1960.26,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4531.113,4533.736,-- to see if I can get the argument.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4536.025,4537.604,"Oh, in no respect."
1960.26,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4537.604,4538.213,Will you do it?
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4538.213,4538.612,"Oh, no."
1960.26,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4538.612,4544.526,All of this has to be on the basis that the statute does not allow the Government to disaffirm (Inaudible)?
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4544.526,4546.754,"Completely so, yes."
1960.26,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4546.754,4548.868,If the statute does apply --
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4548.868,4549.452,Excuse me?
1960.26,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4549.452,4554.833,"-- if the statute does apply, would it make any difference whether the contract was good or bad or whether you (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4554.833,4556.429,"Yes, I think it would."
1960.26,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4562.246,4564.828,Does it (Inaudible) the statute -- if -- if you --
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4564.828,4565.169,"No, no."
1960.26,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4571.528,4572.059,I'm -- I'm sorry.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4572.059,4572.275,Alright.
1960.26,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4572.335,4573.754,But I was trying to get ready for --
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4573.754,4577.823,[Laughs] Just for a minute if you'll allow me.
1960.26,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4594.778,4596.392,I think you were to enforce purposes.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4608.971,4619.377,I accept a better statement within my position.
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4930.781,4941.014,"Mr. Cahill, I'm a little confused perhaps but you said a moment ago that Mr. Wenzell concurred that the -- the original offer was too high."
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4941.014,4943.106,Never (Voice Overlap) any objection of it.
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4943.106,4971.382,"Yes, well, now -- of course, he -- he -- there's no allegation that he was interested at all in Dixon-Yates as such but rather and he was as -- considerably he was an officer and an employee of First Boston and would it necessarily have been to First Boston's interest to have a high price pay but First Boston was interest in, was that there'd be such a contract entered into so that they could perhaps get for the financing business."
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4971.382,4975.146,"No, it wouldn't be the First Boston's interest to have a high price pay."
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4975.146,4975.904,"So in other words, this --"
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,4975.904,4979.686,Our -- our interest here was in common with that of the United States.
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5008.052,5008.099,Now --
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,5008.099,5008.995,-- the proposed division between --
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5008.995,5031.29,"-- my question was -- was only prompted by this, you made -- or I've seen you that you're making something of a point of the fact that Mr. Wenzell concurred in the view that the original offer by the (Inaudible) was too high and my question was prompted by the thought that this would -- this reaction would not at all be antithetical to his position in First Boston."
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,5036.028,5036.568,"Oh, yes."
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5036.568,5041.431,Their interest was that a contract be negotiated so that they can get part of the financing business whatever the price was.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,5041.431,5054.607,"Oh, no, Mr. Justice, their interest is on a fair contract being negotiated because of (Inaudible) and if it weren't a realistic figure, they couldn't bar from the constitutional method to a very sophisticated (Inaudible) so we all were at one."
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5064.99,5066.364,It was the construction cost estimate.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,5066.364,5066.847,That's right.
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5066.847,5067.828,I see.
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,5068.596,5069.11,That's right.
1960.26,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5140.726,5142.085,(Inaudible)
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,5142.085,5149.835,"No, I'm quoting from the opinion of the court below, Mr. Justice Whittaker."
1960.26,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5149.835,5151.732,It wasn't a finding of (Inaudible)
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,5151.732,5154.223,"No, that's -- that's from the opinion of the court below, Mr. Justice Black."
1960.26,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5154.223,5157.285,What I -- I mean was the finding to that effect (Voice Overlap) --
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,5157.285,5165.972,It's -- it's an accurate summary of the findings.
1960.26,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5255.955,5262.821,Is there any explanation as to why -- as to why this would be better policy?
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,5262.821,5278.112,"Well, I think since First Boston's lawyers felt that we have gotten ourselves and trained in what the court below describes as a free-for-all fight between private power and public power and I'm accurately with no holds barred."
1960.26,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5495.001,5499.652,(Inaudible)
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,5499.652,5509.293,"Because the purpose of the TVA was to secure an appropriation of a $100,000,000 to be put in the budget for the construction of the plant at Fulton, Tennessee."
1960.26,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5538.964,5545.524,(Inaudible)
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,5545.524,5547.484,"No, I don't think it cost Memphis' hands."
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5574.346,5580.422,"Mr. Cahill, as I understood Mr. Justice Whittaker, he was trying to get at your theory as to how you would save the Government $100,000,000."
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,5580.422,5583.819,Because the moneys that actually went out was not federal government money.
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5583.819,5585.953,(Inaudible)
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,5585.953,5586.341,That's it.
1960.26,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5586.341,5588.207,It was -- it was the fact that Memphis (Voice Overlap) --
1960.26,1,29582,john_t_cahill,,5588.207,5589.473,That's right.
1960.26,2,44328,william_c_chanler,,5885.732,5888.959,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please."
1960.26,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6484.538,6485.559,(Inaudible)
1960.26,2,44328,william_c_chanler,,6485.559,6487.788,"78, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I'm sorry."
1960.26,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6491.169,6493.212,79 also is relevant here.
1960.26,2,44328,william_c_chanler,,6493.212,6493.445,Yes.
1960.26,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6493.445,6495.326,(Inaudible)
1960.26,2,44328,william_c_chanler,,6495.326,6498.52,I believe this is not on the note.
1960.26,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6713.546,6715.71,Mr. Solicitor General.
1960.26,3,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6715.71,6719.63,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."

1960.26,3,32701,j_lee_rankin,,6835.74,6846.868,That's the last paragraph of 126 finding on page 156 of the appendix to the Government's petition for certiorari.
