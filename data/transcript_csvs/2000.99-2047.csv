2000.99-2047,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.825,We'll hear argument now in number 99-2047.
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,13.698,16.781,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2000.99-2047,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,44.567,49.434,Now when you say local regulations that's a zoning authority of the town.
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,49.434,50.518,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-2047,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,50.518,52.977,"What is that zoning authority, the zoning board?"
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,52.977,55.639,"That is the Town of Westerly's zoning authority, Your Honor."
2000.99-2047,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,55.639,56.242,All right.
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,122.517,143.147,"That is correct, Your Honor. We know from the reasons given by the Coastal Resource Management Council, CRMC, for its denial of the 1985 application, that it found that a beach club would not serve the compelling public interest standard that the CRMC has for approving applications."
2000.99-2047,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,143.147,145.101,Was it that beach club or any beach club?
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,160.596,169.513,"I do not believe they will, Your Honor, because they have never made that allegation or statement previously in this case with regard to any kind of beach club use being allowed."
2000.99-2047,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,202.007,223.775,"I thought that the record showed that the Rhode Island courts concluded that Mr. Palazzolo could have built quote, at least one house on the upland portion of the property, the CRMC director testified he might have built as many as four, and that the residual property would have had a value of about 157,000 dollars if given as open land."
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,223.775,252.338,"Your Honor, if I may try to clarify the record a bit on that, we do readily admit that the State has said that it would gladly allow Mr. Palazzolo to apply for one homesite on the small upland area on the property, a 40 by 90-foot... 40 by 80-foot turn around, 50 by 80-foot turn around, excuse me, at the end of the 1500-foot roadway."
2000.99-2047,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,285.85,288.707,They wouldn't let you build the house or not?
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,302.142,318.258,"--And later on in testimony by CRMC's biologist show that to reach any other upland on the property wetlands would have to be filled, and that would not be in the public interest."
2000.99-2047,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,320.466,322.786,So there's a finding by them that you couldn't build four?
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,330.895,332.444,"To 200,000."
2000.99-2047,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,332.444,348.45,"Some... or that what you think is equivalent to Lucas zero, because it might have been worth 3 million. We'll have a record here in findings and all kinds of argument about what the value of the house would have been, the value of the place would have been, how do we know?"
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,337.687,364.795,"I think, Your Honor, the best way of telling is looking at the State's opposition to the petition for cert where they say in there that they would gladly allow Mr. Palazzolo to build a single family home--"
2000.99-2047,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,364.795,394.232,"--Twice in the brief in opposition they acknowledge that the CMRC would have approved a single home site, which would have netted greater proceeds i.e. 200,000 dollars at less risk, they say that on page four, and again at say, page 19, they say specifically the Council would be happy to have petitioner situate a single home thus allowing petitioner to realize 200,000 dollars."
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,397.712,398.855,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-2047,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.855,400.305,We might not have taken it had I thought it was in the case.
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,400.305,402.445,"Your Honor, I couldn't agree with you more."
2000.99-2047,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,402.445,414.59,"Is it also the case that in order to build more, whatever the more might be, beach house, residential development, whatnot, there would have to be filling of the wetland; is that correct?"
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,414.59,416.11,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-2047,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,416.11,439.679,"Now, what is the significance of the finding, and I think it was in Judge Israel's opinion, but I could be wrong about which one it was, that any such filling would have been a nuisance at common law for the simple reason that it would in effect have eliminated the use of the wetland for fin and shellfish breeding and so on, what's the significance of the nuisance finding?"
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,439.679,443.327,Judge Williams' decision is the one that talked about nuisance.
2000.99-2047,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,443.327,443.481,Williams used nuisance?
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,443.481,443.621,"Yes, your Honor."
2000.99-2047,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,467.006,469.056,Because they were going to have portable toilets?
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,469.056,470.23,"--That is correct, your Honor."
2000.99-2047,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,474.759,506.077,"No, but I'm... I don't want to reduce the case to something silly, but I mean is the takings claim predicated on the right that in measuring the taking, we should measure it on the assumption that he was somehow reasonably bound to be allowed to build a beach club with nothing but portable sanitation, is that in effect the kind of baseline for the claim?"
2000.99-2047,0,29108,james_s_burling,,506.077,507.508,"Not precisely, Your Honor."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,1705.746,1710.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-2047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1766.633,1769.14,The Supreme Court of Rhode Island did not rely on that?
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,1769.14,1773.595,"--They didn't speak to it one way or the other, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.99-2047,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1773.595,1792.242,Can we take the case on the assumption that the only likely permitted use of the property in question is to build one residence on the upland area leaving the 18 or so wetlands area unimproved.
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,1792.242,1809.981,"I do not believe Justice Kennedy that that would be consistent with the decisions of either the Rhode Island Superior Court, or the Rhode Island Supreme Court, which both indicated that there were additional economically viable uses available and they did not refer to those as the building of a house."
2000.99-2047,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1809.981,1815.99,"It seems to me odd then that they would get to the question of a Lucas taking, et cetera."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,1815.99,1821.213,"Well, there are three categories of information here."
2000.99-2047,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.828,1849.851,Did you reference that in your brief in opposition?
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,1860.065,1860.29,"No, Your Honor."
2000.99-2047,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1860.29,1862.819,"Well, it's too late now."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,1862.819,1864.086,Well--
2000.99-2047,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1864.086,1866.186,"Well, you didn't say--"
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,1866.186,1867.542,"--Sorry, Your Honor."
2000.99-2047,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1867.542,1873.135,"--I want the answer to that, that's why I read the part that Justice Scalia cited earlier."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,1873.135,1873.419,Yes.
2000.99-2047,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1873.419,1878.878,You do say a portion of the site would have been approved as a single home site.
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,1878.878,1879.304,Correct.
2000.99-2047,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1879.304,1879.924,Which is true.
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,1879.924,1880.738,Which is true.
2000.99-2047,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.738,1884.364,But you don't say whether other things might also have been approved.
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,1884.364,1887.272,"Correct, because that's the uncertainty area."
2000.99-2047,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1887.272,1898.803,"But he's right though in saying that, in reading it, one might have thought that what we're talking about is it's been established that this could be used just for a single home and that's it."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,1909.286,1917.113,"It has been established that it can be used as at least one single family home, and that was what I intended to refer to."
2000.99-2047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1964.345,1972.428,"Is it... is it your position, General Whitehouse, if someone has, say a section of land, a square mile, either... a square mile."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,1994.762,1996.134,"--Yes, I think it is, Your Honor."
2000.99-2047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1996.134,1998.5,I don't think our cases support that.
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,1998.5,2027.357,"Well, the most recent... I would go back to, for instance, at the earliest expression the Penn Central case, which used the term parcel as a whole and from which the parcel as a whole discussion has emerged and then most recently in Justice Scalia's concurring opinion in the Suitum decision, you referred to the relevant property as the aggregation of all the owners property subject to the regulation at least those that are contiguous."
2000.99-2047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2027.357,2029.975,We don't generally get our law out of concurring opinions.
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2029.975,2031.265,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-2047,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2031.931,2046.327,"But in the Chief's hypothetical, what if he then sells off all except the 10-acre plot and then reapplies, and the 10-acre plot is again denied to development, then there's been a taking."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2062.15,2082.558,"--We always face in these takings cases, the problem of whether it is the regulation itself that has effected the taking or whether property interests have been arranged in such a way as to create a valuelessness portion."
2000.99-2047,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2161.43,2171.672,Even when they've made it clear we are not going to allow you to fill this for anything unless the public at large benefits from it.
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2181.158,2190.716,"--The critical word, Your Honor, in your question was this, and the question if this is the wetland then you're correct."
2000.99-2047,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.969,2222.463,How do we--
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2223.718,2223.718,"The part that's not wetland, absolutely and the part that is--"
2000.99-2047,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2223.718,2231.655,"Let me ask you a question about the geography, I've been looking at tab six."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2231.655,2232.36,--Yes.
2000.99-2047,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2232.36,2237.331,Is the uplands... is the wetlands between the uplands and the ocean?
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2245.537,2252.767,"Let me start at the ocean. You start at the Atlantic Ocean and you come up the beach, and at the top of the beach is Atlantic Avenue."
2000.99-2047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2270.016,2273.54,On both sides of Atlantic Avenue or just on the seaward side?
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2273.54,2275.438,They only owned on the pondward side--
2000.99-2047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2275.438,2275.983,Pondward.
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2275.983,2281.352,--and they sold off that first layer of development that is consistent with the development pattern up and down that area.
2000.99-2047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2330.177,2342.101,"Well, do you think cases like Williamson County and some of the other leave the States completely free to exact whatever they want in what you might call procedural requirements for zoning."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2342.101,2343.502,"No, I do not think so."
2000.99-2047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2394.576,2397.938,"Yes, you have answered it."
2000.99-2047,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2397.938,2407.791,Do you think at some point the State or the governmental agency has the obligation to come forward and say what it will allow?
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2407.791,2422.722,"That may be, if you have a situation in which the entire parcel is put before that agency, so that it can make a sensible decision."
2000.99-2047,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2469.537,2469.977,"Well, what other property?"
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2510.884,2519.781,But in this case the record below and the findings of the courts is that there is valuable use there and perhaps a good deal of valuable use.
2000.99-2047,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2519.781,2530.451,"Not the swampland, not the part he wanted to fill. You acknowledge that there is no feasible economic use of the part that is not filled."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2530.451,2537.151,I would argue that he would almost certainly never be permitted to fill it for residential subdivision purposes.
2000.99-2047,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2537.151,2541.243,"And that... or for any other purpose, do you think, for any other purpose?"
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2541.243,2543.392,"It would be very, very hard."
2000.99-2047,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.392,2545.805,Any other purpose that would enable any feasible economic use.
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2546.891,2552.898,"It would be very, very hard. There is testimony, Your Honor, that it's worth 7,000 dollars an acre as an amenity value to the existing uplands."
2000.99-2047,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2552.898,2566.466,"--So you're making it essential to your case that in determining the taking, we must look at the whole parcel and cannot restrict ourself to the wetlands portion, whose development has been forbidden."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2566.466,2569.995,"Well, I think... I'm trying to make a narrower point, Your Honor."
2000.99-2047,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2569.995,2570.258,Okay.
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2571.542,2571.542,"Which is that for ripeness purposes, which is what I was intending to be talking about, the parcel that is brought forward to the regulators should be the whole parcel so that they can make an assessment of what the value is, and when you can't, you leave the numerator and the denominator uncertain."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2571.542,2601.18,"But the two questions are the same, what you need for ripeness depends on what you need to find a taking, and if all you need to find a taking is that the wetlands couldn't be used for anything, then it didn't matter that he applied for nothing but the wetlands."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2602.962,2616.364,"If the test of a taking is the value that is left in the property after the application of the challenged regulation, then you have to know that value."
2000.99-2047,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2628.665,2630.027,You have to know the value of the property.
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2630.027,2630.709,Correct.
2000.99-2047,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.709,2632.051,"But the question is, what property?"
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2636.086,2638.506,And we know that it isn't in this case.
2000.99-2047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2638.506,2654.917,"--Then you're saying in my hypothesis of an entire section of land, a developer fences off 10 acres, that when he's turned down for 10 acres saying no use at all, that not only is there no, but it's not even ripe."
2000.99-2047,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2654.917,2660.874,He has to come back for some proposal for developing the rest of the land.
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2660.874,2677.797,"Well, ripeness is a somewhat discretionary doctrine, and there may be facts in which it can become ripe, as this Court did in Lucas, can find and ripen a case in which there hasn't been a formal application made for the use."
2000.99-2047,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.659,2694.009,I thought you said a moment ago--
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2694.009,2694.186,From the administrative record.
2000.99-2047,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2694.186,2696.874,"--that the wetlands had a value of 7,000 dollars an acre?"
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2696.874,2699.093,But that wasn't determinable from the administrative record.
2000.99-2047,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2699.093,2701.766,"Oh, that's determined from the trial record?"
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2701.766,2702.403,From the trial record.
2000.99-2047,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2702.403,2719.551,"Isn't the problem here, I mean we probably would all agree that your first proposition that you may not simply isolate from the parcel, the one unusable portion, define that as a separate parcel, call it a 100 percent taking and go home free."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2719.551,2720.046,Correct.
2000.99-2047,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2720.046,2744.568,"At the other extreme there's got to be some limit to the parcel that you use for defining value or somebody with, you know, a hundred square miles can have, in effect, no way of ever proving a taking even though by most of our lights the taking might be extensive on some portion."
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2785.813,2793.74,"Let me first... I'm not sure that I would agree with your premise, first."
2000.99-2047,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2818.985,2820.685,I will agree with you.
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2869.286,2879.739,--I think that the argument could become so extravagant that you got to the point of having to define those parcels.
2000.99-2047,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2885.994,2888.493,A parcel is what you thought it was reasonable to buy.
2000.99-2047,1,42225,sheldon_whitehouse,,2888.493,2889.228,That's what you got.
2000.99-2047,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3214.576,3227.457,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-2047,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3256.376,3263.675,He's relying on the just compensation clause and Armstrong isn't the only case construing the just compensation clause.
2000.99-2047,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3263.675,3264.698,"No, that's correct."
2000.99-2047,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3282.985,3291.142,"The case is somewhat like Lucas, it seems to me, in that other landowners who got there first were left alone and then the wetlands people got into the act."
2000.99-2047,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3292.78,3294.082,I think that's incorrect.
2000.99-2047,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3390.21,3397.24,How do we know what size of the property to look at in looking at this takings claim?
2000.99-2047,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3401.774,3406.221,"--I don't think we can, Justice O'Connor and for one reason, I think--"
2000.99-2047,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3406.221,3408.769,"Well, why and what principle governs?"
2000.99-2047,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3408.769,3420.39,--I think the short answer is that as the case comes to this Court I think the petitioner has really given up any claim that the wetlands portion of the property constitutes a separate parcel because the third question presented was--
2000.99-2047,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3420.39,3420.39,It didn't sound like it today.
2000.99-2047,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3420.39,3431.654,"--I agree that the argument has... the point has been raised at oral argument, but the third question presented in the cert petition was--"
2000.99-2047,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3431.654,3440.276,Whether the remaining permissible uses of regulated property are economically viable.
2000.99-2047,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3440.276,3443.706,"--Right, merely because the property retains a value greater than zero."
2000.99-2047,3,29108,james_s_burling,,3822.697,3826.899,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.99-2047,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3890.533,3891.777,Which part are we talking about?
2000.99-2047,3,29108,james_s_burling,,3895.4,3898.673,"--Excuse me, Your Honor, I didn't hear the first part of your question."
2000.99-2047,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3898.673,3904.84,"I thought the decision we were reviewing was one that was on ripeness, not that there's no claim."
2000.99-2047,3,29108,james_s_burling,,3909.244,3939.59,"There are three independent grounds of the decision below, one ground, of course, is that the case is not ripe and I think we've talked about that, the other that he bought the property on notice of the existence of the regulation, and third the court did look at the fact that there was some value left in finding that the existence of some value took the case outside of the Lucas situation and therefore it did not need to consider further whether or not there had been a denial of economically viable use."
2000.99-2047,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3970.69,3986.547,"--Mr. Burling, may I ask you a very brief question on the valuing, your third question, the value greater than zero, does that mean we should just assume there's a value greater than zero because the uplands has value, or do we assume for the purpose of the case that the wetlands also have value that enhances the value of the uplands?"
2000.99-2047,3,29108,james_s_burling,,3986.547,3998.99,"--Either way, Your Honor, the 200,000 figure does include a so called 7,000 dollar per acre attribution from the wetlands that cannot be used."
2000.99-2047,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4058.161,4071.613,"Well, under your view of the case, if you lose because there's 200,000 dollars worth of value and we hold that Lucas bars you, then some later purchasers could just purchase the 18 or so acres of wetlands and sue."
2000.99-2047,3,29108,james_s_burling,,4071.613,4091.294,"A later purchaser of those 18 acres, after attempting to go through the permitting process, may indeed be able to sue if, as the question said earlier, this area is within the economically viable size of development in the area."
2000.99-2047,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4138.198,4139.015,Why not?
2000.99-2047,3,29108,james_s_burling,,4139.015,4155.575,"Because in looking at economically viable use, an appropriate way of looking at it would be what would an investor, looking at the property before it is regulated, be willing to pay if he knew what that property was worth at the end of the day."
2000.99-2047,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4155.575,4158.966,"Suppose he would pay 200,000 dollars?"
2000.99-2047,3,29108,james_s_burling,,4158.966,4166.551,"If an investor would pay 200,000 dollars for this property, that is a different case from what has been alleged below."
2000.99-2047,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4166.551,4169.915,I thought we were agreeing that the value of the 18--
2000.99-2047,3,29108,james_s_burling,,4169.915,4170.126,"Oh, yes."
2000.99-2047,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4170.126,4172.292,"--The value is 200,000."
2000.99-2047,3,29108,james_s_burling,,4172.292,4186.511,"And if an investor, knowing that before the regulations are imposed, that that is all the value of the property, then indeed there may be a different circumstance, that is why this case needs to be remanded."
2000.99-2047,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4186.511,4189.523,"No, no, I'm trying to figure out, Lucas versus Penn Central."
2000.99-2047,3,29108,james_s_burling,,4208.278,4211.93,Because no reasonable investor would put 3.1 million dollars--
2000.99-2047,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4211.93,4212.367,"No, absolutely right."
2000.99-2047,3,29108,james_s_burling,,4226.565,4230.34,"--Your Honor, we do not believe it is enough to take it out of that box."
2000.99-2047,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4239.717,4240.528,"Thank you, thank you, Mr. Burling."
