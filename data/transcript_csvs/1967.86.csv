1967.86,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2603.997,2607.672,"Plus five loans means, loans about at least there is some doubt?"

1967.86,1,22471,e_william_henry,,3509.281,3518.197,"Well the first thing I would point out of course, that it is not the case here and there was no evidence of any other offer, other than from a competitive bank in the county."
1967.86,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3523.899,3525.355,"Well, in that case --"
