1991.90-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument next in number 90-838, Shirley M. Molzof v. The United States."
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,55.401,59.103,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,127.978,143.506,"Mr. Rottier, do you think that this punitive damages exception to governmental liability under the act is a question of Federal law, which requires uniformity?"
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,143.506,151.243,--I believe the definition of punitive damages as used in the exclusionary clause is a matter of Federal law.
1991.90-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,151.243,157.063,"So that does not depend, then, on the law of the particular State which would otherwise govern tort liability?"
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,157.063,169.823,"That's correct, but I... but I believe the Federal interpretation should bear in mind the other objectives of the act, one of which is to treat the Government as an individual citizen would be treated if it were a defendant."
1991.90-838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,169.823,172.525,"Well, except... except it doesn't."
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,187.416,210.197,"The approach I would suggest is the one used by the this Court in the Neustadt case, where the issue was how to define misrepresentation, since that is also an excluded basis of liability for the Government, and there what the Court did was to look at the commonly accepted definition of misrepresentation as it existed at the time the Federal Tort Claim Act was enacted."
1991.90-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,290.197,295.149,What principle of Wisconsin law is it that leads you to answer that question the way you did?
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,295.149,309.159,"Under traditional Wisconsin common law in tort cases, if a plaintiff can show that the negligence of a defendant was a substantial factor contributing to the need for future medical expenses, those are awardable."
1991.90-838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.531,406.886,"Mr. Rottier, I suppose you're just arguing that this is governed by State law, right, and if a State chose not to allow double recovery, then there wouldn't be."
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,407.886,409.421,That's correct.
1991.90-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,453.8,461.639,"Well, did Judge Shabaz actually award damages here, or did he say these are what you would be entitled to accept for the punitive damages exception?"
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,463.989,466.572,That's... you're correct on both points.
1991.90-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,479.665,482.951,"May I ask you a question, Mr. Rottier?"
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,507.149,509.432,To the contrary.
1991.90-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,523.176,530.432,But might they not have given credit for the full amount of the care that the Federal Government is going to give to this individual?
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,530.432,538.336,"Under Wisconsin law, that would have been viewed as a collateral source, and that would not have been factored in with respect to the award of future damages."
1991.90-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,538.336,541.371,"Well, how can you be so sure it would have been viewed as a collateral source?"
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,542.604,550.227,"In Wisconsin, and partly from experience, in Wisconsin governmental benefits are viewed as a collateral source."
1991.90-838,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,566.819,567.836,"Well, is there a set-off?"
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,572.473,574.942,It does affect eligibility under Wisconsin law.
1991.90-838,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,574.942,584.881,"Well, suppose the Wisconsin defendant was a hospital, and that hospital had entered into a contract after the injury to give lifetime care."
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,588.416,591.368,I know of no such arrangements.
1991.90-838,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,594.284,597.772,Because it... because it... it seems to me that's quite different from a collateral source.
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,597.772,609.061,--The way the set-off provisions work in Wisconsin with respect to State-paid benefits is that the receipt of an award for future medical expense affects eligibility.
1991.90-838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,609.061,613.013,"But this is not just a State-paid benefit, I think that's the point that's being made."
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,623.285,626.404,None that have been reported.
1991.90-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,671.7,698.0,"Well, if the suggestions made by my colleagues here are correct, perhaps whatever problem exists could be remedied simply by the fact-finder, the awarder of damages in the Federal Tort Claims Act case, if in fact the collateral source doctrine as applied in Wisconsin doesn't squarely cover this subject."
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,698.0,722.448,"I think the deficiency in that approach, Mr. Chief Justice, is that it will require Federal courts to evaluate each and every element of compensatory damages and address the effect of their receipt on the plaintiff, instead of focusing on what I think is the more appropriate question, which is, on what basis is an award being made."
1991.90-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,737.125,764.644,"Well, what I'm suggesting is not that this comes within the punitive damages exception, but that perhaps the district judge sitting in Madison might conclude that although Wisconsin law follows the collateral source doctrine, this is not, strictly speaking, a collateral source question, so perhaps, even without any action from Congress, the plaintiff is not entitled to double recovery."
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,764.644,773.85,Some courts in fact have used that approach with respect to medical expenses paid by the Government prior to trial.
1991.90-838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,817.094,820.398,"That would be a very bad thing for Wisconsin to do, let's agree with you."
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,827.468,830.187,"--Well, I very much agree with you."
1991.90-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,846.28,847.213,"--Well, you don't have a case that says that, though."
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,859.587,860.789,I have no such case--
1991.90-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.789,866.86,"--And it's certainly not beyond the realm of possibility that the Wisconsin court would say, this is a double recovery, it's a set-off."
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,876.882,882.452,"--I know of no case, Your Honor, that... where a defendant... a private defendant has come in--"
1991.90-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,882.452,884.436,And the district judge certainly didn't decide it in this case.
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,884.436,890.272,"--Nor does the Government know of any such case, at least as reflected by its brief, and it would strike me--"
1991.90-838,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.272,897.545,"But it's certainly not a frivolous position, when the family seems happy with the Government service it's getting in the future to say the Government shouldn't have to pay for it twice."
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,902.497,904.615,--I'm not contending it's a frivolous position.
1991.90-838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.516,935.42,But it's only a serious problem in those... States that choose to make it a serious problem.
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,950.511,951.53,It was the law of other States.
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,962.801,972.626,"Well, you seem to have... if you get you want, you seem to concede that there would be a double recovery."
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,972.626,978.93,"I don't necessarily concede that, but what it would do... I concede it creates the potential."
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,978.93,983.815,"Well, you'd be... you'd be being paid for something that you're not out of pocket for."
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,983.815,985.731,I concede there is that potential.
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,985.731,986.564,Is that right?
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,986.564,988.481,"I concede there is that potential, Your Honor."
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,988.814,995.568,"And yet... and yet you say that every... every dollar you want, you would categorize as compensatory?"
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,995.568,1004.241,"--Every dollar we're requesting I would categorize as nonpunitive, and if it is nonpunitive, it falls outside the exclusion."
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1004.241,1008.876,"Well, what is it if it isn't compensatory or punitive?"
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1008.876,1010.126,"Well, as the Court knows--"
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1010.126,1010.876,What do you call that?
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1010.876,1019.232,"--As the Court knows, there's been much written about those two components and whether they're totally mutually exclusive or not."
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.367,1031.872,So I suppose you would lose if we concluded that anything that is not compensatory is punitive?
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1031.872,1038.943,"--Yes, but I respectfully disagree with the approach."
1991.90-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1058.721,1067.511,Would you say that actual damages imposed in a State which follows the collateral source doctrine were compensatory?
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1067.511,1071.664,--They are compensatory even in circumstances where they're--
1991.90-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1071.664,1072.58,Where there's a double--
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1072.58,1073.08,--where they're duplicative.
1991.90-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1073.08,1073.48,"--Yeah, okay."
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1073.48,1082.52,"They remain compensatory because the basis on which they were awarded was simple negligence, as opposed to some higher level of egregious conduct."
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1082.52,1087.84,Well isn't the definition of punitive damages a question of Federal law?
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1087.84,1089.007,It is--
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.007,1092.209,"I mean, what punitive damages means under the Federal Tort Claims Act?"
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1092.209,1093.692,"--I agree with that, Your Honor."
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1093.692,1098.696,And if the Federal law is that anything that isn't compensatory is punitive--
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1098.696,1102.565,I lose.
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1102.565,1103.448,--Yeah.
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1110.086,1114.872,"I'd like to just take a half-step back, if I may, Your Honor."
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1129.048,1135.535,We aren't... we aren't... we aren't required to follow State law in defining punitive damages?
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1135.535,1138.468,--Not with respect to the Federal Tort Claims Act.
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.468,1138.92,Yes.
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1138.92,1152.478,"But I think the precedents of this Court are clear as to what punitive damages are both in the context of the Federal Tort Claim Act as well as in the broader context, going back to the 1800's."
1991.90-838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.009,1274.942,"Mr. Rottier, suppose we were to agree with you on the punitive damages point but... but disagree with you on the... on the duplicative damages point, or at least not know what the answer to that is because we think it's a matter of Wisconsin law, what ought our judgment to be?"
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1309.046,1320.221,"I don't lose until a decision is made, but one option is to... I assume, to certify it to the Wisconsin Supreme Court to answer that question, if you're uncomfortable with the status of Wisconsin law on that issue."
1991.90-838,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1332.029,1339.933,"Well, is there... is there the same doubt... you have another claim for a different type of damages, the loss of life enjoyment?"
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1339.933,1340.749,Yes.
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1341.667,1345.669,Is that... is there doubt about that under Wisconsin law?
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1345.669,1347.638,--There is doubt about that under Wisconsin law.
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1347.638,1348.388,I see.
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1359.446,1360.562,That is correct.
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1379.008,1380.36,"Well, I--"
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1380.36,1381.943,"There have been trial court decisions, but--"
1991.90-838,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1381.943,1394.001,"--I suppose if someone loses an arm, he can recover damages for having lost an arm even, though he never well have the chance of using that arm at all?"
1991.90-838,0,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,1394.001,1407.391,"--Well, the... obviously the side of the argument that I prefer is the one that no awareness of a loss is needed if an objective analysis can be made that a loss did occur and that some reasonable value can be affixed to it."
1991.90-838,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1474.736,1477.488,"Thank you, Mr. Rottier."
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1479.357,1487.944,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.1,1523.4,You don't think there is under any State law that you know of?
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1523.4,1536.874,"--I know of no State that defines it, that has a third category, and frankly I don't think opposing counsel was able to come up with a third category today."
1991.90-838,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.669,1557.121,"Mr. Wright, could you step a little closer to the microphone?"
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1558.887,1559.521,Sorry.
1991.90-838,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1559.521,1560.739,Mr. Wright xxx.
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1644.727,1646.679,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1991.90-838,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1699.147,1702.599,What's the difference between loss of enjoyment of life and pain and suffering?
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1702.599,1710.621,"Many... courts, States, think of it as a subcategory further of pain and suffering."
1991.90-838,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1719.775,1722.31,"Well, you wouldn't claim that pain and suffering damages are punitive."
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1722.31,1726.012,--We would not contend that pain and suffering damages are punitive.
1991.90-838,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1726.012,1726.345,All right.
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1731.547,1741.104,"Only under the circumstances of this case, where Mr. Molzof was never aware of a loss of enjoyment of life."
1991.90-838,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1741.104,1751.727,"But isn't that a question that goes to the definition of what can be compensated for loss of enjoyment of life, as opposed to what goes to what is punitive and nonpunitive?"
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1778.195,1785.716,"Well, Your Honor, we have a different view of punitive damages than does petitioner."
1991.90-838,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1849.374,1850.243,"Well, but the--"
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1868.704,1888.618,"With respect to loss of enjoyment of life, our entire argument is that because Mr. Molzof, under these unusual circumstances, never had any appreciation of loss of enjoyment of life, an award for that item is necessarily noncompensable and hence punitive."
1991.90-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.592,1912.197,"And you wouldn't be challenging this, if... except that the... if the patient weren't in a vegetative state."
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1912.197,1912.78,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-838,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.957,1948.286,"Mr. Wright, suppose you have a State statute that says, for all trespasses the trespasser shall be liable for the owner of the property for five... for $ 5, 000, and the Government somehow is... is sued under the Tort Claims Act on a trespass."
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1954.024,1961.928,"I think not, the way you say it, because I assume that something like the following would be proposed as a rationale."
1991.90-838,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1971.034,1974.319,So whatever the State thinks is compensation is good enough?
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1974.319,1977.436,"--We think that as a general matter, that's so."
1991.90-838,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.661,1999.017,"Maybe the State here thinks that, you know, that this is... for loss of enjoyment of life they might deem it compensatory."
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2008.956,2018.744,--Certainly not... you could recover here certainly if a State said that for the reasons I outlined that it needs to be compensatory.
1991.90-838,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.766,2046.911,"What if... what if you have a State that follows the normal collateral source doctrine and you subscribe to Blue Cross, the Blue Cross covers your hospital, your hospital bill is $ 5, 000, you're entitled to recover that amount, I believe, from the tort-feasor."
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2050.846,2061.987,"No, Your Honor, and you could say that the key difference there is that in that situation the tort-feasor is not required to pay twice for the same injury."
1991.90-838,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2081.032,2082.465,So double recovery does not mean it's punitive.
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2083.65,2086.784,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-838,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.695,2103.528,I thought some States don't allow that.
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2112.134,2116.252,It is possible that subrogation does not always work in some circumstances.
1991.90-838,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2116.252,2118.704,"--Right, and in that case, would you consider those punitive damages?"
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2118.704,2118.954,No.
1991.90-838,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.87,2120.47,Why not?
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2120.47,2123.739,"--we would say... well, it's a timing problem, really."
1991.90-838,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2133.095,2135.595,"Well, but that... that bears no relationship to whether it's compensatory or not."
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2158.724,2166.03,--It... it seems clear to us that the first payment is compensatory and the second payment is punitive.
1991.90-838,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2183.992,2201.703,"Well, I agree that punitive is looked at from the... from the standpoint of the person that pays, but you say everything is punitive that is not compensatory, and yet you accept the Chief Justice's example of something that is clearly not compensatory, and for some reason you say that that is not punitive."
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2203.803,2205.403,"Well, a first payment isn't."
1991.90-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2260.972,2277.665,Why do you say that?
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2294.841,2298.744,--Under petitioner's view that punitive damages--
1991.90-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2298.744,2310.636,"I mean, if we assume Congress meant to adopt the common law version of punitive damages, the Government would have to pay just like any private party would in that situation, wouldn't they, if you just read the statute literally, and if you interpret punitive damages in the common law sense."
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2310.636,2316.206,--If you interpret punitive damages to mean what petitioner says.
1991.90-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2321.175,2322.11,"Well, you don't agree with his--"
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2322.11,2322.677,--Right.
1991.90-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2322.677,2323.26,--understanding of the common law.
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2323.26,2327.545,An element of agreement has actually occurred during the course of the briefing of this case.
1991.90-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2370.472,2375.443,"Yes, but it is true, is it not, that at least in this paragraph of the statute the word ""compensatory"" doesn't appear?"
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2375.443,2377.793,"That's right, Your Honor."
1991.90-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2377.793,2380.061,It only appears in the death action section.
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2380.061,2394.67,"I think that Congress in 1946 understood that there was one exception to the rule that punitive damages... I mean, I'm sorry... that compensatory damages are the purpose for awarding damages in tort."
1991.90-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2426.291,2443.42,"Supposing you had a situation instead of your double recovery where you had a no-fault program in the State system and they awarded... they set precise recoveries for different kinds of injuries like you do under workman's compensation, and they were demonstrably 30 percent higher than the actual compensation required."
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2446.455,2449.991,"I'm sorry, a workers compensation award?"
1991.90-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2449.991,2472.154,"Say you have a no-fault tort program in which the amount of damages for different kinds of injuries are set by statute, as they are in the workman's compensation program, and those amounts were deliberately set by the legislature at maybe 25 or 30 percent above what they would calculate to be actual damages, to add a little deterrence and to... and to take care of possible inflation, one thing and another."
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2477.974,2502.007,"I would think in the general case, no, our position is not that compensation can be and must be awarded exactly, and I can well imagine a State situation that we would not challenge where a damage was an approximation, as most nonpecuniary damage awards are."
1991.90-838,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2523.92,2526.52,"Mr. Wright, what about this case?"
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2580.25,2584.118,"In the unusual case that you suggest, I think so."
1991.90-838,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2585.284,2586.134,It would be punative.
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2586.134,2597.926,"--Until you got to the point where you said that it's clear that you suffer absolutely no sensation for pain, I was prepared to say, oh, that sounds like the sort of approximation that, frankly--"
1991.90-838,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2597.926,2598.942,But you kind of invite my question.
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2612.564,2613.533,--No.
1991.90-838,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.075,2632.244,The narrower it gets the less logical it gets.
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2632.861,2644.219,"--If you suffered no pain whatever, as Mr. Molzof suffered no cognition of loss of enjoyment of life, we would say yes, it can only be punitive."
1991.90-838,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2645.821,2649.023,--You didn't realize how stoic these New England Yankees are.
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2664.948,2682.826,"In both circumstances, the court went past the question of Wisconsin law and held as a matter of Federal law that punitive... that such awards would be punitive under 2674, in the one case, because it would require the United States to pay twice."
1991.90-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2682.826,2695.467,"So that was essentially a construction of the Federal Tort Claims Act, but that means that the Government shouldn't be held to the definition of punitive damages of common law?"
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2695.467,2697.835,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-838,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.227,2713.695,"Well, but it certainly would be left over if we didn't agree with you on the reach of punitive damages."
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2713.695,2715.028,It would be left over.
1991.90-838,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2745.88,2748.916,"Well, Mr. Wright, it's not really... I don't think it's really paying twice."
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2786.307,2789.826,"No, Justice Scalia, our position is narrower."
1991.90-838,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.195,2791.661,Okay.
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2791.661,2792.678,--less logical in this respect.
1991.90-838,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2832.188,2839.758,"So you're really... you're really not objecting to paying the money, you're objecting to providing the VA services, or, I mean, one or the other?"
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2839.758,2842.544,We're objecting to paying the money on top of the VA services.
1991.90-838,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2879.585,2899.98,"Mr. Wright, in the New York regime, where I take it there's no payment for loss of enjoyment when the person becomes comatose, is that person's recovery the same as in a wrongful death action, or does that person get less than if there had been a wrongful death?"
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2899.98,2902.932,I think... I think he gets the same.
1991.90-838,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2903.482,2904.932,It would be a lost earnings--
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2904.932,2908.15,"--Oh, yes."
1991.90-838,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2912.752,2916.74,"--In other words, those cases approximate the recovery to what a wrongful death recovery would be?"
1991.90-838,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2916.74,2917.49,--Yes.
1991.90-838,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2963.285,2964.887,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."

1991.90-838,2,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,3170.855,3176.057,The Government didn't go so far as to say Wisconsin law did not allow it.
1991.90-838,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.127,3183.663,And the court of appeals agreed with that?
1991.90-838,2,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,3183.663,3184.313,That's correct.
1991.90-838,2,21419,daniel_a_rottier,,3184.313,3197.923,I agree with the Government's counsel that the basic approach of both the trial judge and the Seventh Circuit was that both of these components of damages resulted in the punitive effect and therefore was prohibited by the Federal Tort Claims Act.
