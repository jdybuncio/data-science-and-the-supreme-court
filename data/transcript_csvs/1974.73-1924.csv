1974.73-1924,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.749,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-1924, Muniz against Hoffman."
1974.73-1924,0,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,56.984,60.867,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1924,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,207.744,210.405,-- the individual however is not --
1974.73-1924,0,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,210.405,210.912,Has not appealed --
1974.73-1924,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,210.912,212.777,-- is not in the position to make the constitutional claim.
1974.73-1924,0,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,212.777,219.146,"Because of the nature, because of the nature of the adjudication, we do not appeal on the criminal side for James Muniz."
1974.73-1924,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,223.545,224.787,"Well, alright."
1974.73-1924,0,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,224.787,226.928,Now the issue Your Honor is --
1974.73-1924,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,226.928,229.027,But he can make the statutory argument?
1974.73-1924,0,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,229.027,230.983,"Yes, he makes the statutory argument."
1974.73-1924,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,364.835,375.783,Is the argument you make -- this agency argument any different from what it would be with the corporation and its Chief Executive Officer?
1974.73-1924,0,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,375.783,381.173,It is different in many respects for this reason.
1974.73-1924,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,445.453,451.74,"But stockholders can, even though it maybe very difficult, they can fire presidents of corporations, can't they?"
1974.73-1924,0,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,451.74,454.102,"Yes, they can."
1974.73-1924,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,491.707,494.854,How long was the President's term of office in this case?
1974.73-1924,0,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,494.854,500.035,"At the time of this conduct was engaged in, it was his first term and it was not a full term."
1974.73-1924,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,503.627,507.784,How long did he have to serve that -- of the remainder of the term?
1974.73-1924,0,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,507.784,512.751,"As I recall it, it was one half or two-thirds of a three year term."
1974.73-1924,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,956.102,958.702,Very well.
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,961.573,964.118,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1924,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1215.802,1235.596,"And certain categories of defendants also, in other words would -- is your argument, your constitutional argument such that it would lead to the conclusion that a cooperation is never entitled to a jury trial under criminal contempt?"
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1235.596,1236.133,I don't --
1974.73-1924,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1236.133,1240.049,Because a corporation by definition cannot be put in prison?
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1240.049,1247.502,I think Mr. Justice Stewart that I would say that perhaps only in combination with the additional factors I wish to mention.
1974.73-1924,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1260.018,1261.762,Corporation or a labor union (Voice Overlap) --?
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1261.762,1274.055,"Yes, yes and I'm going to suggest that we are indeed -- I trust that the beginning of an evolutionary development in the law in this area and I cannot for that reason make bright line distinctions."
1974.73-1924,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1336.177,1343.079,"But if a state statute or a federal statute specified the -- I mean, punishment for contempt?"
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1343.079,1346.563,"Oh, if it specify the punishment for contempt, then I suppose we'd have to take the --"
1974.73-1924,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1346.563,1355.852,"Even within someone that -- I mean even there -- that although there were the ranges for discretion, you would still have a traditional rule of none renewability, is that right?"
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1355.852,1371.42,"I suppose not, but here we have a reviewable fine and I think in cases where we do have a reviewable fine, we certainly have a fundamental safeguard, not available in the criminal case which suggests less need for the jury trial."
1974.73-1924,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.777,1657.228,"Well, is the part --"
1974.73-1924,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1657.228,1665.33,Mr. Solicitor General would your argument be the same if Mr. Muniz had been sentenced to one year in prison without probation.
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1666.416,1667.695,No I think not Mr. Justice Stewart.
1974.73-1924,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1671.708,1672.116,I know.
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1672.116,1679.292,"And we are accepting for this purpose, the distinction between imprisonment and fine."
1974.73-1924,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1679.292,1680.804,Imprisonment beyond six months at least?
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1680.804,1681.535,That's right.
1974.73-1924,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1688.779,1689.283,You would not --?
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1689.283,1690.366,I would not be arguing that.
1974.73-1924,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1690.366,1701.6,Is part of your argument General Bork based on the proposition that a fine is a less worrisome type of sanction than imprisonment?
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1701.6,1702.738,I think it -- that is part of it.
1974.73-1924,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1710.174,1724.945,"Well why, why is it any good at all as matter of fact when you look at the Seventh Amendment that requires there is a trial of a jury in its civil action where $20.00 or more is involved and compare it with the jury trial provisions in connections with the criminal case."
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1733.789,1746.841,"I doubt that that would be reason Mr. Justice Rehnquist for the Seventh Amendment, but in any case we now allow that taking of money in large amounts without jury trial."
1974.73-1924,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1768.462,1774.321,"Well, what's our society's feeling got to do with the meaning of a constitution?"
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1774.321,1782.944,Well it's one way of -- it's one way of asking ourselves how much injury is inflicted upon a person.
1974.73-1924,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1828.476,1832.848,"Mr. Solicitor General, I gather none of these factors are arduous, does it?"
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1832.848,1833.519,I beg your pardon.
1974.73-1924,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1833.519,1841.25,Does any -- do these factors singly or in combination suggest unconstitutionality in the statute which required a jury trial?
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1841.25,1844.027,"Not a bit, not a bit Mr. Justice Brennan."
1974.73-1924,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1850.758,1852.867,(Inaudible) was it --
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1852.867,1853.248,"No, no, I think --"
1974.73-1924,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1853.248,1857.475,Your emphasis on that had the sound of separation of powers?
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1857.475,1857.895,I did nothing.
1974.73-1924,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1857.895,1861.513,But there are some things that this being judicial orders and --
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1861.513,1886.394,"Or there maybe a occasions Mr. Justice Brennan which I think we need not reach here which have Congress purported it -- deprived the court of any ability to function as a court, such statute might be unconstitutional, but I don't think we're discussing that range of considerations in this case and I trust we will never have to discuss that range of considerations, but it is useful to mention Congress because the evolution I'm discussing need not to be entirely judicial."
1974.73-1924,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.754,2135.971,Are you (Inaudible) -- does that include a suggestion that at least that Congress was asserting there should be no jury trial in those situations?
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2135.971,2136.725,Yes Mr. Justice White.
1974.73-1924,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2386.184,2390.219,"(Voice Overlap) the substitution -- the substituted language is much broader though, isn't it?"
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2390.219,2390.853,It is.
1974.73-1924,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2390.853,2392.717,(Voice Overlap) Section 11 initially.
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2396.527,2397.841,And they repealed -- my repealed --
1974.73-1924,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2397.841,2398.186,Yes.
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2398.186,2406.142,"For this purpose, they repealed Section 11 and took -- they picked the provision up and put it over in Title 18 and it can no longer be cases arising under this Act."
1974.73-1924,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2406.142,2415.478,That's right and -- but the substitution arising under the laws of United States governing issuance of injunctions or restraining orders in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute.
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2417.958,2423.936,But the new language Mr. Justice Brennan does -- is a case involving or growing out of labor dispute which is Norris-LaGuardia language.
1974.73-1924,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2423.936,2425.81,"And you think that's what ties it, limits it (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.73-1924,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2425.81,2426.878,I think it has to.
1974.73-1924,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2592.666,2595.021,Do you have anything further Mr. Van Bourg?
1974.73-1924,2,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2595.021,2599.259,"Yes I do Mr. Chief Justice, just if I can for a moment."
1974.73-1924,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2600.996,2602.769,Yes you do.
1974.73-1924,2,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2602.769,2620.676,I think that it is inappropriate to state as the Solicitor has stated that if the Court were to adopt the posture taken by the First Circuit in Union Nacional that you would be making a major change in the nation's labor policy.
1974.73-1924,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2862.933,2869.297,"But didn't we grant, didn't we not to exclude question one which raises that as (Voice Overlap) --"
1974.73-1924,2,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2869.297,2870.845,"Yes, you did."
1974.73-1924,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2870.845,2872.207,So that's not before us.
1974.73-1924,2,43550,victor_j_van_bourg,,2872.207,2872.382,No.
1974.73-1924,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2961.733,2962.333,Thank you gentlemen.
