1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,41.007,"We'll hear arguments next in number 73-5744, Taylor against Louisiana."
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,45.553,50.671,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,100.902,112.788,Would your position be the same Mr. King if in fact there had been five women on this jury who had got there by the existing processes?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,112.788,119.085,"With the existing constitutional and statutory provisions, the position that we take would still be the same."
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,119.085,120.59,Or would you --
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,120.59,131.794,"On its face we say the constitutional and statutory provisions which not only exempt, but exclude one is unconstitutional."
1974.73-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,251.931,253.443,What is that?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,253.443,254.049,Pardon me?
1974.73-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,254.049,257.31,What is that essential attribute?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,257.31,266.722,"In the very case which denied the extension to the 12-man jury, this Court declared what the essential attribute was."
1974.73-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,310.332,319.109,"Well, why would a jury composed of 12 men be expected to hurt your client's chances since your client is a man?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,319.109,330.312,"If Your honor is asking me whether I can feel, touch, smell or taste that home or whether there is a home that is tangible in character, I cannot do so."
1974.73-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,330.312,335.446,Then what authority do you have for saying that in the absence of such and what decision this Court do you rely on?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,335.446,342.768,"Well, I rely primarily in the federal context in the federal courts on Thiel -- on the Thiel case."
1974.73-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,342.768,349.44,"But of course that wasn't -- that was a federal court decision reviewing the jury system in federal court, was it?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,349.44,369.144,But the court found there that the exemption by the federal judge of daily wage earners violated the system of jury to such an extent that it would not even look into whether the party -- the appellant in that case was a member of that class.
1974.73-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,376.985,383.373,But that -- that was a Seventh Amendment case involving a civil jury trial.
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,386.335,396.793,"That's correct Your Honor, but if the -- if that application was made in a civil jury trial much more so shall apply to a criminal jury trial and --"
1974.73-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,396.793,402.326,That's your principal authority then as the Thiel case for saying that your client has standing to raise this issue?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,402.326,408.73,Only by application and by a mode of reasoning.
1974.73-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,409.738,411.679,You rely on Duncan -- you rely on Duncan and it's not a case.
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,411.679,412.662,I believe Duncan.
1974.73-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,412.662,420.899,Let's say that you're going to satisfy the jury requirement of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment if the jury should be drawn from a fair process there?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,420.899,424.81,"Absolutely, I believer that Duncan case is the principle case."
1974.73-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,434.252,435.476,On a grand --
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,435.476,436.486,-- on a grand jury.
1974.73-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,446.899,449.252,Was there a Court opinion in that case?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,449.252,449.791,Pardon?
1974.73-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,449.791,452.04,Was there an opinion for the Court in that case?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,452.04,455.784,"There was a -- you know -- divide a Court 3, 3, 3."
1974.73-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,455.784,457.496,Which opinion are you going to rely on?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,457.496,491.154,"[Attempt to Laughter] The language in the -- in Justice Marshall's opinion and the language in Chief Justice Burger's opinion that there’s any of them, express the thought of the Court I believe that if that had been a post Duncan case there would have been little question of the standing to complain."
1974.73-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,491.154,498.125,"I thought the Chief Justice's opinion relied on the notion of prejudice and that there ought to be some showing of prejudice, it was a dissenting opinion?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,498.125,514.038,"I believe that in essence is that so but the language in the Court's dissenting opinion stated that we are not here concerned with the essential attributes of trial by a jury, but here you are concerned with the essential attributes of trial by a jury."
1974.73-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,538.395,550.465,"Well, if you would I suppose would say that the rule would only be that the jury panels should -- part of venire it should have could be a representative cross section not the actual jury?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,550.465,552.791,"Oh no sir, the jury venire."
1974.73-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,563.452,565.441,Let alone peremptory challenges?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,565.441,567.805,Yes sir.
1974.73-5744,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,601.432,609.267,Well then you're really saying that we haven't had juries at all for over a century in this case?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,609.267,620.096,"When 53% of a community are excluded from the jury, I would say that that's correct Your Honor."
1974.73-5744,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,620.096,627.036,Would you join the limbo conviction that had been -- had been for -- in the old system for years and years?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,627.036,628.829,Of course that's a problem.
1974.73-5744,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,654.116,660.682,"I merely asked that only because you said that this didn't equate with a jury, therefore, we haven’t had the jury system and --"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,660.682,665.816,It doesn't equate with what the Court had said was a jury.
1974.73-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,665.816,680.937,"Yes but Duncan -- Duncan was never made mention because Duncan didn't question the reliability of the then cross section jury, if this is quite it emphasize the critical role of the jury?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,680.937,684.013,"Well, it does no good Your Honor."
1974.73-5744,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.013,686.319,And you did want to make that correction?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,686.319,714.6,"It was not made that's right, in Duncan, but it does no good to say that juries are meant to protect people’s liberty and yet deprive the jury of an essential attribute because the same jury that was present in the Thiel case may well have been the same jury to protect the liberty that we speak of."
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,714.6,725.773,But that argument would apply equally to a jury from which the five -- the only five women were stricken by peremptory challenges but you have --
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,725.773,730.128,"But there Your Honor that's a matter of choice, peremptory challenges."
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,730.128,732.481,Not the choice necessarily of the defendant?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,732.481,740.462,"But were the law, the law excludes, I believe that's another matter."
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,740.833,749.593,It says to know the law -- the law does exclude them as of now in Louisiana in the sense that you’re talking about?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,749.593,751.905,That's what say as so vicious.
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,755.509,765.277,"Well, but is not the peremptory challenge in operation sometimes a mode of exclusion by operation of law?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,765.277,772.311,"Correct Your Honor but that's a right that's granted to all alike, the peremptory challenge."
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,772.47,776.862,"Not necessarily all alike, sometimes one side has given more peremptory challenges than the other?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,776.862,787.305,"But only -- but only in a numerical fashion, it's not meant to be a device that can be used to exclude segments from the community."
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,787.305,797.567,But are you standing in any degree on the proposition that women as a category might be more compassionate toward a defendant or --
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,797.567,798.338,Probably best --
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,798.338,799.856,-- have a different attitude toward defendant?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,799.856,804.765,"I can't say that, I know there have been studies made of that."
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,826.318,828.477,That was your personal experience in that case?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,828.477,829.363,Pardon?
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,829.363,830.447,What do you mean?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,831.894,851.003,"He was found guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter and after the case, the jurors were questioned, she happened to be the president of the league of women voters and volunteered for the jury service but I didn't know that at the time, she was the first woman in the state of Louisiana in 1948."
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,851.003,852.32,In a capital case?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,852.32,852.797,Pardon?
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,852.797,853.48,In a capital case.
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,853.48,867.469,"In a capital case and in answer to question after the case, it appeared that she had a greater sense of justice, fair play and compassion than the men sitting on the bench."
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,867.469,871.587,"I wouldn't be surprised that you should think that one, they reduced from first degree murder to manslaughter."
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,871.587,876.957,Oh Your Honor asked and that's the only way I can answer the question is by my own personal experience.
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,876.957,883.58,"Mr. King, your client here was -- Billy Taylor was convicted of what aggravated kidnapping?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,883.58,885.46,Yes.
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,885.46,888.312,Was the victim a man of woman?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,888.312,889.951,The victim was a woman.
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,894.964,895.681,Three victims?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,895.681,908.641,Three victims but within the charge and part of the evidence introduced was that of aggravated rape of the mother at knife point.
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,908.641,915.299,In the Hoyt case it was the woman's -- Mrs. Hoyt had killed her husband as I remember --
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,915.299,916.109,With a baseball bat.
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,916.109,932.058,"Hitting him over the head with a baseball bat and her implicit claim was that women would be more understanding of her actions than men, women jurors, you don't have any such claim here, do you?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,932.058,940.406,"No sir, I couldn't honestly and intellectually I couldn't make that statement, but I believe in the Hoyt case it was based an equal protection --"
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,940.406,946.303,"Here, the defendant Billy Taylor was a man and the two others three victims were women really, is that correct?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,946.303,947.365,Correct.
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,947.365,959.15,Now and you're not -- you're not making the claim explicitly or implicitly that women would be more sympathetic to the defendant intrinsically than men in this case?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,959.15,962.056,"You know honestly I couldn't say that, I couldn't say it."
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,962.056,964.057,"Unlike Hoyt, I just want to be sure?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,964.057,965.386,"No sir, I'm not saying that."
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,972.74,973.968,What conclusion?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,973.968,977.88,That women are more sympathetic to than man.
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,977.88,978.524,In rape cases and kidnapping cases?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,978.524,979.862,In kidnapping types of case.
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,991.509,993.606,"Well then you are making the claim, are you?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,993.606,997.297,"Only insofar as the Court can recognize it, I can't give any more to it."
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,997.297,1009.076,"In Hoyt, it was a very -- it was a very colorful claim one could say but are you making any such similar claim in this case on the circumstances of this case?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1009.076,1010.656,If your Court asks -- if the Court ask me that.
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1010.656,1012.248,[Inaudible] the argument that was made in Hoyt?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1012.248,1014.612,I can only make the argument without proof.
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1014.612,1017.608,"Well, are you making it, aren't you, that's all I'm asking?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1017.608,1019.569,I would like to be able to make that argument.
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1019.569,1020.836,Well then --
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1020.836,1021.447,But I have no proof to --
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1021.447,1022.713,You would like to be able to make your last final argument?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1022.713,1025.218,I have no tangible evidence of that.
1974.73-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.218,1047.075,"Mr. King, when we use to try jury cases where I practiced, we use to follow a maxim which was perhaps an old wise tale that woman is man's best friend but her own worst enemy and the idea was if you had a male client you wanted a bunch of woman on the jury and if you had a woman client you wanted a bunch of men on the jury."
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1051.424,1051.491,If it is --
1974.73-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1051.491,1053.734,"If you can't -- you can't in Louisiana, can you?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1053.734,1056.091,"I'd have to say again, I have no proof of that Your Honor."
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1056.091,1059.829,"You don't have a chance -- you don't have the chance, do you?"
1974.73-5744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1059.829,1064.775,"You have -- if you have 5% women jurors, you at least have some access to it?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1064.775,1073.098,On the jury venire -- on the jury venire.
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1073.098,1076.114,Does the record show how many are actively used?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1077.836,1091.946,"The record show that in 170 -- 13 women were included in the total of 1815 names drawn for the petit jury system, term."
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1106.731,1112.961,You just want the chance to keep them or strike them as the particular case fits your needs?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1112.961,1118.6,They should be available for jury service without the volunteer system and that's a failure.
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1135.775,1142.3,Do you think its a necessary corollary that the Court would have to approve under Hoyt voluntary system for men only?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1142.3,1156.534,"I believe that would be the same in order to acknowledge that that's a proper system for women, the Court would have to acknowledge that that would also be a proper system for men and it doesn't work."
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1189.411,1191.012,Exemption is waivable?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1191.012,1192.833,"The exemptions given to man are waivable, yes."
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1192.833,1194.03,A man could volunteer?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1194.03,1197.244,Yes Your Honor they are.
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1208.842,1211.613,"Well, I think it was -- wasn't it a due process case?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1211.613,1225.028,It was an equal – excuse me I understand correctly I just felt in my memory had -- but in that case the contention was made that that woman was entitled to women on the jury.
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1225.028,1235.097,"Well, she was entitled -- her claim was to a system that would treat woman the same way as man in so far as jury service?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1235.097,1242.168,"I recall language of that stated the core of the case, I maybe mistaken."
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1251.395,1270.478,"Well, in any event, your claim is that you're entitled to a -- you and all criminal defendants in Louisiana are entitled to a system that calls women and men equally to jury duty?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1270.478,1272.05,Gives a fair possibility.
1974.73-5744,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1272.05,1272.767,Right.
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1272.767,1275.94,Yes sir.
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1299.202,1319.647,"If the state would be free I take it to set its own age limits for men and women as long as they treated them in the same way, would they not?"
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1319.742,1324.131,From the standpoint of equal protection that's probably correct.
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1324.131,1326.382,Let me suggest a hypothetical?
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1335.311,1336.311,Yes sir.
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1356.573,1359.109,We resume after lunch.
1974.73-5744,0,45243,william_mcm_king,,1378.038,1379.401,If there are no further questions?
1974.73-5744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1379.401,1380.723,Yes.
1974.73-5744,1,34013,kendall_l_vick,,1384.6,1388.635,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court?
1974.73-5744,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1581.517,1584.184,"Now, which one no applicability here?"
1974.73-5744,1,34013,kendall_l_vick,,1584.184,1586.941,Thiel versus Southern Pacific.
1974.73-5744,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1586.941,1588.181,How was that about?
1974.73-5744,1,34013,kendall_l_vick,,1588.181,1590.929,That was the daily wage earners being excluded from --
1974.73-5744,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1590.929,1594.521,"Oh yes, yes, yup."
1974.73-5744,1,34013,kendall_l_vick,,1594.521,1610.896,"Now, I have searched Peters versus Kiff, I have not found one mention of Hoyt."
1974.73-5744,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1721.099,1739.548,Are there any cases in this Court with respect to federal juries that hold that part of the concept of the Sixth Amendment jury is a fair cross section?
1974.73-5744,1,34013,kendall_l_vick,,1739.548,1742.2,The case is cited in both briefs.
1974.73-5744,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.2,1743.885,Do they actually hold that?
1974.73-5744,1,34013,kendall_l_vick,,1750.408,1754.635,"Well, I would think that Ballard held that."
1974.73-5744,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1760.463,1763.667,"Well, we're talking about Sixth Amendment?"
1974.73-5744,1,34013,kendall_l_vick,,1763.667,1763.807,Not that I know of.
1974.73-5744,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1763.807,1765.153,Talking about Sixth Amendment.
1974.73-5744,1,34013,kendall_l_vick,,1765.153,1774.093,Not that I know of but it's alluded too because of the applicability of the Sixth Amendment through the Fourteen Amendment.
1974.73-5744,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.093,1784.198,"Duncan -- in Duncan that the issue, that wasn't the particular the issue but Duncan said that federal jury wasn't a fair cross section type of jury?"
1974.73-5744,1,34013,kendall_l_vick,,1784.198,1785.14,Was not.
1974.73-5744,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1785.14,1788.125,And that -- but do you know of any other cases that --
1974.73-5744,1,34013,kendall_l_vick,,1788.125,1792.437,Not directly on point.
1974.73-5744,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1792.437,1796.04,The tip given sometime ago with respect to grand?
1974.73-5744,1,34013,kendall_l_vick,,1796.04,1799.398,Yes it does give me some trouble especially the --
1974.73-5744,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1799.398,1802.148,The plurality of Mr. Justice Marshall?
1974.73-5744,1,34013,kendall_l_vick,,1802.148,1805.119,Yes.
1974.73-5744,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1805.119,1821.236,Is there any allegation anywhere in this case that the jury commissioners or other state officials systematically sought to discourage or exclude the presence of women on juries anyway?
1974.73-5744,1,34013,kendall_l_vick,,1821.236,1828.543,None Mr. Chief Justice and as a matter of fact I think that the counsel for the opponents conceded that.
1974.73-5744,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1844.019,1846.817,"Very well, thank you Mr. Vick."
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,1848.581,1850.614,Just briefly Your Honor.
1974.73-5744,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1869.373,1874.278,"In Duncan, the issue there was whether -- what was the issue of the Duncan?"
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,1874.278,1881.618,The issue was whether a jury trial should be provided and is required of a right in state criminal cases.
1974.73-5744,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.618,1885.913,"Well, but there wasn't a square issue there is that there is one, what kind of the jury does it have to be?"
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,1885.913,1887.207,"No sir, this is the case."
1974.73-5744,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1887.207,1891.738,So that whatever Duncan may have said that they may not have been part of the whole?
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,1891.738,1893.04,"It might not have been, this is --"
1974.73-5744,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1893.04,1896.639,Is there a case -- is there a case which does have that holding?
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,1896.639,1902.396,"No sir, that why I think this is the case which squarely presents the issue to the Court."
1974.73-5744,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1902.396,1910.416,"It is now of course at federal policy, is it not, to undertake to see that every jury represents a cross section?"
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,1910.416,1911.209,Correct.
1974.73-5744,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.209,1912.355,The statute?
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,1912.355,1930.118,"Statutory for federal courts and the Court has held in due process cases, not held but there has been much language in the due process cases which would have require a representative cross section in the jury even without the application of the Sixth Amendment."
1974.73-5744,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1930.118,1938.497,"Yes [Inaudible] the heart of your cases that the Hoyt case is wrong and it should be overruled, it was wrongly decided, is that it?"
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,1938.497,1940.207,"It's part of it, yes."
1974.73-5744,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1940.207,1940.436,What else?
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,1940.436,1961.57,The second phase of it is that the jury even though the complaining parties such as Thiel is not a member of the excluded class that he as a right to have that vindicated that there is no representative cross section of the community from which the jury can be --
1974.73-5744,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1961.57,1971.238,That's just another way for saying that every person independent of sex or race has a constitutional right to what you call a cross section jury?
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,1971.238,1979.383,As far as possible without any arbitrary exclusion particularly of such a large class and that in volunteer.
1974.73-5744,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1979.383,1993.014,"When you put it in that way, arbitrary exclusion, you must of necessity carry the burden or you must of necessity be saying that to allow a women a preferential exemption is an arbitrary exclusion?"
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,1993.014,1994.919,Yes and we feel though that the burden --
1974.73-5744,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1994.919,1996.941,Would you care to enlarge on that a little bit?
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,1996.941,1998.669,Your Honor mentioned the burden.
1974.73-5744,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2031.804,2040.271,"Mr. King, can you prevail unless we overrule Hoyt?"
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,2040.271,2062.254,"I believe it be difficult to reach a decision without, I mean favorable to Theil without overruling that thought of Hoyt which sustained the constitutionality of the exclusion statute and the constitutional provisions of the state of the Louisiana, to that extent, yes."
1974.73-5744,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.254,2070.949,"Well, the point on it -- if this point raised only a due process issue or only an equal protection issue, that isn't an issue you're raising?M"
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,2070.949,2071.978,"No sir, I was --"
1974.73-5744,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.978,2072.32,You're raising a --
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,2072.32,2073.547,The Sixth Amendment due process.
1974.73-5744,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2073.547,2075.889,The Sixth and Fourteen Amendment --
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,2075.889,2076.232,Correct.
1974.73-5744,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.232,2076.985,-- issue?
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,2076.985,2080.841,"Correct but Hoyt causes interwoven, I mean what they said in Hoyt --"
1974.73-5744,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.841,2085.203,And you're not even raising a bias or an unfair due process issue?
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,2085.203,2091.466,"No, this is a jury, was purely and simply the quality of the jury."
1974.73-5744,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2091.466,2106.554,"Either one of those issue was not in or if your issue was not in Hoyt, maybe Hoyt stands on its own two feet but because Hoyt was pre Duncan?"
1974.73-5744,2,45243,william_mcm_king,,2106.554,2113.879,It could be.
1974.73-5744,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2113.879,2115.669,"Thank you Mr. King, thank you Mr. Vick."
