2016.15-8544,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.175,"We will hear argument this morning in Case 15-8544, Beckles v. United States. Ms. Bergmann."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,7.175,19.035,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: On average, attaching the ""career offender"" label to a Federal defendant both doubles his sentence and increases it by seven years."
2016.15-8544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,76.66,90.16,"You would agree, would you not, that, if the commentary counts, if it counts, then there's nothing imprecise about possessing a sawed-off shotgun; right?"
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,90.16,91.11,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-8544,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,124.7,147.48,"But the -- but suppose there were a statute -- and this is a -- I don't mean to interrupt, but this is part of Justice Ginsburg's question. Suppose there were a statute in Johnson, and it read just like the residual clause, that -- that an example of a dangerous offense is -- or an offense which creates a serious risk is the possession of a sawed-off shotgun."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,149.16,150.12,"Well, Your Honor, the --"
2016.15-8544,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,150.12,151.335,Would the statute then be valid?
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,151.335,152.42,"The -- Your Honor, the --"
2016.15-8544,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,152.42,153.31,In -- in the shotgun case.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,153.31,154.25,In the statute itself --
2016.15-8544,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,154.25,155.49,In the shotgun case.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,155.49,159.02,"If the statute itself included that language, yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-8544,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,160.22,161.625,"Yes, it would be valid."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,161.625,166.02,If the -- if the possession of a sawed-off shotgun was listed in the statute.
2016.15-8544,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,166.02,168.145,"Well, you didn't answer Justice Ginsburg's question."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,173.53,183.97,"Well, Your Honor, because when the Sentencing Commission was interpreting -- when the Sentencing Commission created the commentary, it was interpreting the language of the residual clause, and the --"
2016.15-8544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,183.97,185.46,Do we know that for sure?
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,185.46,204.455,"Well, yes, Your Honor, we know it in several ways. One, the sawed-off shotgun offense can only fall within the residual clause because the text of the Guidelines state three exclusive definitions for the term ""crime of violence."" Possession of a sawed-off shotgun does not fall within the first definition because there's no element of force."
2016.15-8544,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,230.09,257.34,"Well, what if the -- the Guidelines themselves said that the term ""crime of violence"" means, among other things, burglary of a dwelling, arson, extortion, involves use of explosives, involves possession of a sawed-off shotgun, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another? Would there be a vagueness problem then?"
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,257.34,286.91,"No, Your Honor, but that would be because the -- the offense would be in the text of the Guideline itself. And here the issue isn't just the vagueness, but it's also the -- the respect that the Court has to give to the agency's interpretation of a guideline. And with the commentary here, Your Honor, the -- the Commission was not interpreting the -- its own words -- I mean the text of the Guideline was not language that the Commission itself created."
2016.15-8544,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,294.17,298.485,But the Guidelines provisions are the -- are the Commission's words.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,302.99,303.86,"No, they didn't."
2016.15-8544,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,303.86,304.42,But they did.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,309.4,318.43,"Yes, Your Honor, but in terms of the deference that this Court gives to agencies' interpretations of its regulations, where a commission is -- I'm sorry."
2016.15-8544,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,342.26,345.7,Perhaps if we go back to the process here.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,353.695,363.04,"Well, the original definition of the career offender guideline did not include, but -- but at some point, yes, Your Honor, the Commission passed an amendment that included the residual clause."
2016.15-8544,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,363.04,366.42,Was it the Commission? Aren't those amendments approved by Congress?
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,366.42,368.885,"Yes, Your Honor, the residual clause, yes."
2016.15-8544,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,372.5,373.685,That's my question.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,387.395,389.5,"No, Your Honor, it was not. It was adopted in 2004."
2016.15-8544,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,398.53,402.69,Let me ask you a more -- let me ask you a more fundamental question.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,427.015,429.27,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-8544,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,429.27,434.125,"Well, that seems to be a lot -- a lot vaguer than what we have here."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,439.755,464.62,"Well, Your Honor, we submit that arbitrary determinant sentencing such as with the -- a vague guideline is not the same as an indeterminate sentencing scheme such as the Court described. Our position is that the use of a vague guideline, in fact, is worse than indeterminate sentencing because it systematically injects arbitrariness into the entire sentencing process."
2016.15-8544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,464.62,473.145,And there is more arbitrariness because of this guideline than there was before the Guidelines were passed? Is there any evidence of that? I have a lot of evidence it wasn't.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,473.145,477.95,"Well, I think, Your Honor, it's especially so here because --"
2016.15-8544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,477.95,478.75,Especially so.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,515.85,536.69,"Well, I think here, Your Honor, that the Guidelines hold a special -- special place in the sentencing scheme because the court has stated repeatedly that the guide -- the Guidelines are both the lodestone and the lodestar of Federal sentencing, and because of that they are sufficiently binding in a way that an indeterminate sentencing scheme is not."
2016.15-8544,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,536.69,542.845,"Well, less and less, right? I mean, there are steadily increasing percentage of departures from the Guidelines."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,542.845,546.61,"That's correct, Your Honor, there is an increasing number of departures from the Guidelines."
2016.15-8544,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,566.76,578.5,"Well, if the indeterminate sentencing is all right, it would seem to me that even the vaguest guideline would be an improvement and so difficult to argue that it's too vague to be applied."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,578.5,584.59,"I disagree, Your Honor, because in -- even in an indeterminate sentencing scheme, due process did apply."
2016.15-8544,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,612.13,645.235,"Are you saying there's more arbitrariness under this provision than there was under the pre-Sentencing Reform Act sentencing system, where a judge would pick a sentence between zero and 20 years based on that judge's personal ideas about retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation? And in practice, there were judges who, under that system, always imposed a very light sentence for a particular offense and other judges who always imposed a heavy sentence for that particular offense."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,645.235,646.1,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-8544,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,655.88,671.04,"Well, but your argument applies to State systems as well, and you're telling us that the more specific a legislature or an agency tries to make guidance for the judge, the more chance there is for vagueness."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,684.71,686.44,"But, Your Honor --"
2016.15-8544,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,686.44,695.815,"Your argument is sweeping. And you're saying the more specific guidance you give, the more dangers there is of unconstitutionality. That's very difficult to accept."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,695.815,700.77,"Well, I -- Your Honor, I would disagree with your premise that this is more specific guidance."
2016.15-8544,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,707.99,711.745,The less said the better in sentencing?
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,711.745,714.87,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2016.15-8544,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,714.87,717.915,You're saying that the less said the better?
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,717.915,718.65,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-8544,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,719.485,720.58,You like that system.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,720.58,734.01,"What I'm saying, Your Honor, is that if the Court is -- if the -- if a court is provided guidance with respect to how it is supposed to impose a sentence -- and here, district courts are required to calculate the Guideline range."
2016.15-8544,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,748.655,753.215,"If I go through the Sentencing Guidelines -- I mean, I just opened them at random."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,790.765,799.08,"Well, Your Honor, the same concerns expressed in Johnson with respect to the Court's application of the vagueness -- vagueness doctrine in that case."
2016.15-8544,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,827.41,852.485,"Wasn't the essence of our ruling in Johnson that it's one thing to ask a judge to apply a determination to existing facts, as opposed to what happens with the residual clause, which is you're asking a judge to basically fantasize about what the average case is like?"
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,852.485,853.74,"That's correct, Your Honor. That --"
2016.15-8544,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,853.74,865.38,"And so Guidelines that you're being asked to apply to specific facts are reviewable by a court, aren't they? We can look at the facts and say, was the judge right? Was this more than minimal planning or not? Correct?"
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,865.38,866.735,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2016.15-8544,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,866.735,878.11,"But it's almost impossible, according to Johnson, to find what an ordinary case would look like because there was no standard of comparison of what ordinary meant."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,878.11,889.54,"That's correct, Your Honor. And I'm aware of no other legal provisions, no other guidelines that use this ordinary case analysis that forces the court to imagine a typical case and then apply the guidelines in that way."
2016.15-8544,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,889.54,896.79,"There are -- there are circuit courts who already permit vagueness challenges to provisions, right?"
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,896.79,918.74,"That's correct, Your Honor. The Ninth Circuit has allowed vagueness challenges to Guidelines provisions for decades now, and none has been successful. I mean, what's unusual about the residual clause is that it -- it really is unique among sentencing provisions, and that was in part why the Court was concerned about its application in the Armed Career Criminal Act in Johnson, and it should be equally of -- of concerning nature here."
2016.15-8544,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,918.74,923.07,I don't know why -- I don't know why you run away from the proposition that less is better.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,959.61,982.65,"Well, Your Honor, I mean, arbitrary is -- arbitrariness is the main concern here with the residual clause, and also with the commentary, because the arbitrariness comes into play when the Commission is interpreting the vague language of the residual clause to conclude that certain offenses fall within it. The Commission was undertaking an effort that this Court deemed impossible in Johnson."
2016.15-8544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,983.29,983.51,Let me --
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,983.51,984.11,I'm sorry.
2016.15-8544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,984.11,1001.79,"Let me ask you a question that's peculiar to this case, and it's essentially whether the issue we're now debating became moot when this sentence was reduced to 216 months, which is well below the Guidelines range."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1001.79,1003.34,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-8544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1003.34,1011.895,"So his sentence, the -- the Guideline range, what was it? 262 to 327 months?"
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1011.895,1013.205,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-8544,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1013.205,1015.29,And he got 216 months.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1015.29,1016.16,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-8544,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1043.28,1043.83,Was this --
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1043.83,1045.605,-- without the career offender guideline.
2016.15-8544,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1045.605,1050.96,Was this 40 percent normal for this judge? Did he say he was basing it on a percentage?
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1050.96,1051.81,"She did, Your Honor."
2016.15-8544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1054.64,1118.05,"This is -- this is a fairly deep question, actually, you're going into, in my mind. And what is -- before I reached a constitutional question, I would ask whether the Guideline falls within the scope of the words ""Guideline-enabling statute."" I don't see why you have to get into the Constitution. But even doing it that way, it then becomes a matter of the extent to which the Federal courts are going to review the substantive Guidelines, itself an open question. So rather than get into that, I might think about your case like this: Why was the statute vague? It was vague because with three examples preceding the residual clause, they tried to apply it, Congress, to thousands of State criminal statutes that vary in a variety of ways one from the other."
2016.15-8544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1134.35,1137.5,But let's go -- let's go a step further.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1137.5,1139.57,My -- my best answer of the day. (Laughter.)
2016.15-8544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1139.57,1141.31,"No, you're -- you're thinking the right thing."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1141.31,1141.97,"No, Your Honor --"
2016.15-8544,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1141.97,1152.895,"But I have -- I have -- I'm conceding, because one way of clarifying the kind of vagueness that's there in the statute is through example."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1185.545,1192.73,"Well, Your Honor, because -- because -- sorry."
2016.15-8544,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1237.07,1288.07,"Well, why is this -- I guess the real question on this last point is: If what we're trying to do is to regulate the defendant's conduct, not possessing this thing or not committing a crime of violence, and he knows because the commentary tells him that if he does possess a sawed-off shotgun, he's going to get this enhancement, what's arbitrary at sentencing for imposing what the defendant already knows is illegal or will subject him to the greater enhancement? I buy your argument in terms of it would be arbitrary to the Johnson reasoning to have a judge determine that a sawed-off shotgun --"
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1288.07,1289.475,"Here, Your Honor --"
2016.15-8544,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1289.475,1292.76,-- is violent in one situation but not in another.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1307.41,1315.2,But the arbitrary here and the enforcement here comes into play when it is the Commission interpreting the language of the residual clause.
2016.15-8544,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1326.31,1329.065,I agree no discretion to apply the Guideline.
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1329.4,1331.61,No discretion -- I'm sorry -- to ignore the Guideline.
2016.15-8544,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1343.55,1380.97,"How is this different from all of the examples the government gave in pages 55 to 57 or the others where we've had a vague statute and the administrative agency has narrowed it, or you have a municipal ordinance that narrows, that the city narrows in its administrative processes? And all of those cases when they are challenged for vagueness, we look at how the statute is applied to the individual. How is this situation any different? If the statute was vague, it's vague."
2016.15-8544,0,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,1389.42,1429.62,"Well, two responses, Your Honor. With respect to the cases involving State and local provisions and ordinances, the Court, as a matter of Federalism, has to look to the clarifying constructions that the State court or agency or local governing body has given to that language and accept it to be an interpretation of a statutory provision or whatever the provision is and accept that as a clarifying construction of the State provision. With respect to respecting the decisions or the clarifying actions of a regulatory body, a Federal regulatory body, the Court will do that only in certain situations."
2016.15-8544,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1491.625,1496.815,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben."
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1496.815,1536.575,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The threshold question in this case is one of retroactivity, whether the rule that Petitioner seeks would be retroactive to cases on collateral review if the Court were to adopt it. In view of the questions from Justice Breyer and Justice Alito and others on the bench, I think it may be useful to start at the outset to describe what we think the Due Process Rule is in this case and why it does not call into question traditional discretionary sentencing within a broad range that is not informed by sentencing guidelines. So I think the starting point for analysis here is due process."
2016.15-8544,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1711.26,1743.325,"So basically, your argument is that there's a continuum, so that if you have complete judicial discretion, barring the consideration of some impermissible invidious factor, within the statutory guideline range, there's no vagueness problem. On the other hand, if you have mandatory guidelines, you may have to apply vagueness principles to the mandatory guidelines. Now, here it -- so someplace in the middle you get -- you are close enough to the mandatory that that has to apply."
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1744.795,1745.61,Yes.
2016.15-8544,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1752.35,1758.35,"Well, if advisory guidelines are subject to vagueness challenges, then surely mandatory guidelines would be subject to vagueness --"
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1758.35,1759.21,"Yes, for vagueness."
2016.15-8544,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1761.06,1761.46,All right.
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1785.475,1798.065,"I think it would depend, Justice Alito, on how the Guidelines were implemented and whether additional rules that were procedural in character, designed to reinforce the primacy of the Guidelines, were adopted."
2016.15-8544,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1837.08,1852.39,"But what will happen ten years from now? Let's say ten years from now when you have -- there's no district judge anymore who even remembers the mandatory guideline regime and there are departures in 85 percent of the cases, and the judges go through the drill."
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1862.67,1888.8,"Well, we -- we made a version of that argument in Peugh and this Court rejected it, and I think empirical evidence is not suggesting that sentencing courts are drifting radically away from the Guidelines, and one of the reasons for that is there's a feedback loop in place where the Commission examines the Guidelines in practice, takes note when district judges are varying or departing from them, and incorporates those refinements into the Guidelines."
2016.15-8544,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1888.8,1893.535,"Well, maybe not radically departing, but steadily increasing their departures, isn't that right?"
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1893.535,1895.2,"I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-8544,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1946.51,1955.345,It seems to me that that explanation is in conflict and considerable tension with your argument that this is not -- that this is procedural.
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1956.925,1959.07,"So I think, Justice Kennedy, that the --"
2016.15-8544,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1959.07,1962.09,It appears that you're taking two different positions on these points.
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1962.09,1971.32,And I think that's because there are two different legal tests that are in play. The vagueness doctrine is looking at the potential for lack of notice and arbitrary action.
2016.15-8544,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1984.27,1990.23,"Well, but you say the vagueness challenge analysis applies because this whole class is affected."
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1990.23,1990.84,Yes.
2016.15-8544,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1990.84,1997.255,And that seems to me inconsistent with saying that they're procedural because they don't play a dispositive role.
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1997.255,2001.78,They play an important role. I think dispositive is not the right statement.
2016.15-8544,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2041.77,2046.28,"Here's a thing I'd like you to think about, and -- and tell me what you think."
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2146.98,2154.68,"So, Justice Breyer, I agree with the impulse of that question to the extent that we're talking about the enumerated offenses in the commentary."
2016.15-8544,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2180.94,2192.92,We know that because this is -- the words I read you are just one set of what I bet are hundreds of examples in these Guidelines if you go through and think it doesn't make too much sense.
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2192.92,2198.075,"Well, I think -- no, I'd like to come back to whether the Guidelines are vague as a general matter, because I don't think they are."
2016.15-8544,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2383.35,2450.005,"Mr. Dreeben, can we go back to Justice Kennedy's question? In Montgomery, we had a rule that appeared procedural, just like this one. The judge at sentencing could still sentence the defendant to life without parole after a particular finding, i.e., that the individual was irredeemable. Why is that different than here? Meaning, if the Guidelines are procedural in the Montgomery sense because they are an anchor on what a judge does, why isn't there a substantial risk like in Montgomery that a defendant is going to be sentenced because of the Guideline and not because of a finding that he or she is entitled to that sentence? And I take that to be -- that substantial risk to be proven by your own statistic."
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2472.04,2477.055,"So, Justice Sotomayor, let me try to take the conceptual point and then the practical point."
2016.15-8544,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2525.98,2555.385,"But doesn't a judge still have to make a finding that there's a reason to give a defendant a higher sentence? There may be some judges who determine the nature of the past conduct qualifies this defendant for career criminal status, but absent that, it seems like the vast majority of those judges who are now resentencing don't believe that those -- that prior criminal history justifies the higher sentence."
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2555.385,2562.99,"We don't doubt, Justice Sotomayor, that the Guidelines range is influential. The question is whether it sets an eligibility threshold."
2016.15-8544,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2586.09,2614.77,"Could I just ask something? If we rule in your favor and say it's not retroactive, how much is left of the Johnson ruling? What effect would it have? How many cases are there in fact, except the -- I guess it's the felon in possession cases would be the one example that the Guideline -- that the Guidelines haven't already been structured to take care of all career offenders."
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2614.77,2630.39,"Our position is, as the Court knows from our submission in Welch, that in Armed Career Criminal Act cases where the effect of the residual clause was to change a defendant from having a maximum of 10 to a minimum of 15, Johnson is retroactive."
2016.15-8544,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2640.125,2642.13,Outside of felon and possessions --
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2642.13,2642.45,We do not --
2016.15-8544,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2642.45,2644.17,-- can you think of any other situations?
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2644.17,2647.97,We do not think that Sentencing Guidelines should be interpreted --
2016.15-8544,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2647.97,2649.965,You're not quite answering my question.
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2668.415,2669.425,That's right.
2016.15-8544,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2709.105,2713.91,The third -- the third issue -- you've confused me by your argument.
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2733.59,2737.625,"So, Justice Ginsburg, I would urge the Court to decide retroactivity."
2016.15-8544,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2743.365,2753.69,But would you say that is not necessary if we agree that in this case there was fair notice about the sawed-off shotgun being --
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2753.69,2774.96,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, this Court's Teague jurisprudence says that in a collateral review case, a habeas case, the threshold question is retroactivity because if the new rule that the Petitioner seeks would not be retroactive to cases on collateral review, there should be no adjudication of that prisoner's constitutional claim."
2016.15-8544,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2775.45,2782.675,"That's like jurisdiction, that we are bound, we have no choice but to decide retroactivity before deciding anything else."
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2782.675,2783.12,No.
2016.15-8544,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2805.005,2809.92,"Mr. Dreeben, what will happen to all those cases that have been resentenced already?"
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2809.92,2811.87,They will keep their sentences.
2016.15-8544,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2812.78,2817.71,Even the -- where the circuits said no retroactivity -- where they have permitted retroactivity?
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2817.71,2820.64,"Well, no circuit has actually ruled on retroactivity."
2016.15-8544,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2833.23,2835.52,But they've been resentencing?
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2835.52,2841.045,"They have been resentencing -- 88 are pointed to in Petitioner's reply brief, and Your Honor asked about those."
2016.15-8544,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2882.13,2890.23,"If I were a district court judge and I wasn't going to change the sentence no matter what -- what the reason for the retroactivity ruling, I would have just had the sentence."
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2890.23,2894.465,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, you would have produced an efficient result."
2016.15-8544,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2895.87,2899.22,I was known for that. (Laughter.)
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2899.22,2900.62,And that's admirable.
2016.15-8544,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2916.8,2925.205,"Well, if I think that it's retroactive, should I stop there, should I go on to consider whether it's vague, or should I just accept your concession that it's vague?"
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2925.205,2929.65,"Well, I think that the Court should decide the legal issue."
2016.15-8544,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3028.795,3029.96,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.15-8544,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3029.96,3030.49,Thank you.
2016.15-8544,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3030.49,3036.24,Mr. Mortara.
2016.15-8544,2,62773,adam_k_mortara,,3036.24,3045.61,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to start off correcting something that my friend said when he referred to historical sentencing as not being arbitrary."
2016.15-8544,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3068.32,3069.05,I'm sorry.
2016.15-8544,2,62773,adam_k_mortara,,3072.225,3073.22,"Correct, Your Honor."
2016.15-8544,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3073.22,3077.38,"-- meaning, the judge at issue always had his or her own reasons."
2016.15-8544,2,62773,adam_k_mortara,,3077.38,3077.86,Correct.
2016.15-8544,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3077.86,3091.045,What was arbitrary was that one judge could have put different values on a reason in one place and -- in New York and different values in California.
2016.15-8544,2,62773,adam_k_mortara,,3094.86,3105.235,"I don't think so, when one looks at the sentencing factors in 3553(a)(2), the purposes of sentencing that my friends both agree are not subject to vagueness challenges."
2016.15-8544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3141.18,3150.885,"But his point, I think, is that, yes, all that you say is true, but this is a special kind of guideline."
2016.15-8544,2,62773,adam_k_mortara,,3202.045,3212.26,"And, Justice Breyer, that amounts to an argument that because the career offender enhancement residual clause isn't quite that vague, it's more subject to constitutional vagueness challenges."
2016.15-8544,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3212.26,3215.94,"No, no, I'm not saying it's not that vague."
2016.15-8544,2,62773,adam_k_mortara,,3260.38,3270.66,"I do want to get back to the (a)(2) factors, but I -- I'll address your question directly. My friend said that the problem here is Molina-Martinez and Peugh and the weight that the Guidelines are given."
2016.15-8544,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3648.544,3656.984,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Bergmann, you have a minute remaining."
2016.15-8544,3,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,3656.984,3689.995,"I'd like to make -- start with a point about retroactivity analysis. Mr. Dreeben states that the rule here is a procedural rule, and I would disagree in part because Mr. Dreeben misstated Montgomery as an eligibility test. In both Welch and Montgomery, the defendant was eligible for the same sentence so long as the court made specific findings."
2016.15-8544,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3738.3,3739.42,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.15-8544,3,28932,janice_l_bergmann,,3739.42,3740.51,"Thank you, Your Honor."
