2017.17-965,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.17,8.83,"We'll hear argument today in Case 17-965, Trump, President of the -- Donald Trump, President of the United States, versus Hawaii. Mr. Francisco."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,8.83,32.105,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: After a worldwide multi-agency review, the President's acting Homeland Security Secretary recommended that he adopt entry restrictions on countries that failed to provide the minimum baseline of information needed to vet their nationals. The proclamation adopts those recommendations."
2017.17-965,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,71.97,74.685,You -- you mentioned 1182(f).
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,107.82,113.65,"Your Honor, yes, 1182(f) is a broad and flexible power in a narrow area."
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,139.12,141.57,"I'm sorry, Mr. -- General."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,209.325,209.77,And --
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,209.77,219.49,"So I -- but what I see the President doing here is saying, I'm going to add more to the limits that Congress set --"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,219.49,220.045,Right.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,220.045,222.98,-- and to what Congress said was enough.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,234.575,251.615,"Well, there are -- there's a lot packed into your question, Your Honor, and so let me try to unpack it a little bit. I think the basic answer is that 1182(f) gives the President the authority to impose restrictions in addition to those set forth in the INA, but to go to the statutes that Your Honor was --"
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,251.615,252.1,"But -- it might, but --"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,252.1,252.36,"Right, but --"
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,252.36,255.05,-- on the very grounds that Congress has already looked at?
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,255.05,266.83,"And that's exactly what I was going to address next, Your Honor. The Visa Waiver Program provides a special benefit to our closest allies and some of the safest countries in the world."
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,385.68,399.825,Can you represent that no other country that -- that fails all three of the criteria was excluded from this list?
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,399.825,406.075,"Well, Your Honor, what I can represent is that the -- the -- the analysis was holistic."
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,411.45,411.78,So given --
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,411.78,457.2,"So I can represent that all of the countries listed in the proclamation are the same countries that fell below the baseline, with the exception of Somalia, which the proclamation makes quite clear, and the exception of Iraq, which did fall below -- below the baseline but was not subjected to sanctions. And I think that this reflects the tailored nature of this proclamation and the fact that it was meant to impose tailored pressure on these countries while also taking into account other types of national security and foreign policy considerations to try to move those countries across the line into acceptability, which we've now seen has been successful, as with the case of the government of Iraq -- of Chad."
2017.17-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,457.2,469.14,"In fact, if you compare this proclamation to the Reagan and the Carter proclamations, which I think were one or two sentences, this is longer than any proclamation that -- that I've seen in this particular area."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,469.14,471.885,"This is, Your Honor, the most detailed 1182 --"
2017.17-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,471.885,472.86,"I'd say ""longer detail"" --"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,472.86,473.05,Yes.
2017.17-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,473.05,473.73,-- is -- is a better word.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,473.73,474.07,Yes.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,477.75,483.78,"General, the proclamations by Reagan and Carter, however, were not as broad as this one."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,483.78,487.83,"Your Honor, they were almost as broad, but --"
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,487.83,488.07,And -- and --
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,488.07,495.345,"-- to complete my answer to Justice Kennedy's question, this is the most detailed proclamation ever issued in American history."
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,501.55,507.95,"And more -- and more immigrants, because Carter's only applied to certain immigrants, not to all."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,507.95,517.19,President Carter's actually applied to all immigrants but then had an exception much like the waiver provision here for national interests and humanitarian concerns.
2017.17-965,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,521.485,527.025,Is your consular non-reviewability argument -- is that a jurisdictional argument?
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,527.025,544.93,"Your Honor, I -- yes, I think it is a jurisdictional argument. And that's why I don't think you really should address any of these issues. The basic rule is that the exclusion of aliens is a political act imbued with foreign policy and national security concerns and, therefore, subject to --"
2017.17-965,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,544.93,554.97,"I -- I thought in Sale, that we decided that this -- this wasn't jurisdictional or at least decided the merits despite the non-reviewability argument that the government made."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,554.97,559.31,"I think the second thing that you just said, Mr. Chief Justice, is accurate."
2017.17-965,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,565.37,567.65,Was the -- was the argument raised in that case by the government?
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,567.65,568.74,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
2017.17-965,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,569.18,573.15,"So -- so it's an argument we would have been required to address if it were, in fact, jurisdictional?"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,573.15,573.7,I think so.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,596.44,598.19,If you're about --
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,598.19,605.37,"May I turn, General, to the constitutional claims in this case?"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,605.37,606.175,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,606.175,626.145,"And your principal response to the Establishment Clause claim is to cite Mandel and to say that, once the government comes forward with a legitimate reason -- of course, national security is the most important reason one can come forward with -- the game is over, essentially."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,629.55,629.69,Sure.
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,629.69,639.19,"So, first, I want to ask whether that means -- you started off by talking a lot about the process of this proclamation."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,655.82,664.78,"We would have made a Mandel argument, but it is far stronger given that you have the process and substance upon which this proclamation was based, because whatever you --"
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,664.78,672.09,"Well, I guess I wonder why that is, just because, when I read Mandel, I don't see anything about process or you have to meet a certain kind of bar."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,672.09,672.29,Uh-huh.
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,672.29,677.09,Mandel really is kind of you state a reason and this Court stops.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,677.09,709.84,"And I think that that is right, but I think that when you, in addition to that, have the extensive worldwide process that we had that resulted in a cabinet-level recommendation, that applied a neutral baseline to every country in the world, concluded that almost all the world, including almost all of the Muslim-majority world passed that baseline, but a tiny number of countries didn't, I think that whether you apply Mandel or whether you apply McCreary, that makes the constitutional case in our favor overwhelmingly strong."
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,710.05,724.02,"So let me give you a hypothetical, and it's just -- you know, I think that there are ways to distinguish Mandel in this case, but -- but -- but, you know, just in terms of thinking about what Mandel really forecloses here."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,724.02,730.14,"And I -- because Mandel, there are only two cases in the area, and it's -- it's hard to understand the full contours of it."
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,730.14,731.27,I agree.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,746.99,747.64,Uh-huh.
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,747.64,791.43,"-- and says all kinds of denigrating comments about Jews and provokes a lot of resentment and hatred over the course of a campaign and in his presidency and, in the course of that, asks his staff or his cabinet members to issue a proc -- to issue recommendations so that he can issue a proclamation of this kind, and they dot all the i's and they cross all the t's. And what emerges -- and, again, in the context of this virulent anti-Semitism -- what emerges is a proclamation that says no one shall enter from Israel."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,791.43,792.085,Right.
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,792.085,798.65,Do you say Mandel puts an end to judicial review of that set of facts?
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,798.65,834.535,"No, Your Honor, I don't say Mandel puts an end to it, but I do say that, in that context, Mandel would be the starting point of the analysis, because it does involve the exclusion of aliens, which is where Mandel applies. If his cabinet -- and this is a very tough hypothetical that we've dealt with throughout -- but if his cabinet were to actually come to him and say, Mr. President, there is honestly a national security risk here and you have to act, I think then that the President would be allowed to follow that advice even if in his private heart of hearts he also harbored animus."
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,834.535,835.01,"Well, the question is --"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,835.01,842.35,"I would also suggest, though -- if I could finish that, Your Honor -- that I think it would be very difficult for that to even satisfy Mandel rational basis scrutiny."
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,852.06,852.66,Well --
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,852.66,856.22,"-- Mandel's rational basis standard on that, unless it truly were based --"
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,856.22,856.85,Yes.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,856.85,860.67,-- on a cabinet-level recommendation that was about national security.
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,860.67,867.355,"General, I'm -- let's -- this is a out-of-the-box kind of President in my hypothetical."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,869.49,871.645,"We -- we -- we don't have those, Your Honor."
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,871.645,895.31,"And -- and, you know, he thinks that there are good diplomatic reasons, and there might -- who knows what the future holds, that there might be good diplomatic reasons to put pressure on Israel or to say we want Israel to vote a certain way in the U.N. and this is a way to better our diplomatic hand, and so this is what he does. And -- and who knows what his heart of hearts is."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,903.83,904.17,Right.
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,904.17,908.6,"-- given this context, in which this hypothetical President --"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,908.6,908.87,Sure.
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,908.87,911.67,-- is making virulent anti-Semitic comments.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,911.67,912.08,Right.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,956.78,958.1,"Mr. General, you just --"
2017.17-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,958.1,967.035,"If -- if you have that extreme hypothetical, would that present a free exercise or an Establishment Clause claim or both?"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,967.035,980.85,"It could definitely present a free exercise clause challenge, Your Honor, just as you had a free speech type claim in the Mandel case. And there would be people who could bring that claim and who could potentially succeed on that claim."
2017.17-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,980.85,986.48,"And -- and the people that could bring that claim, I assume, were relatives of people that were excluded, father, son?"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,986.48,988.83,"On free exercise, potentially."
2017.17-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,989.34,990.515,"Yeah, what about a university?"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,990.515,994.425,"I think a university could bring a free speech-type claim under Mandel, much --"
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,994.425,996.54,Why not an Establishment Clause claim?
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,996.54,1014.0,"And -- and -- because, Your Honor, and the reason why I think they haven't pursued those types of claims is because I don't think they would possibly support the types of nationwide injunction that they're asking for. Your Honor, the reason why I don't think that they could bring an Establishment Clause claim is because the proclamation doesn't actually apply to the Respondents."
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1018.06,1038.085,"No, but the claim is that it -- that the proclamation is in place because of a dislike of a particular religion. And I thought the Establishment Clause at its heart is that we cannot be anything but neutral with respect to religion or its practice."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1038.085,1047.25,"That is true, Your Honor, but as the Valley Forge decision makes clear, not everybody has standing to challenge that negative message injury."
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1057.52,1064.62,But these people are saying that that negative religious attitude is stopping them --
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1064.62,1064.92,Right.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1064.92,1076.81,"-- from doing things that they would otherwise be able to do: To associate with scholars from these countries, to bring in students, to have family members join them."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1076.81,1076.9,Right.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1076.9,1080.855,Which is one of the purposes of the INS.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1080.855,1088.08,And -- and that's where they might have free exercise or free speech claims along the type that Justice Kennedy suggested --
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1088.08,1088.32,"Well, but I --"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1088.32,1090.955,-- but which couldn't support a nationwide injunction.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1097.07,1116.17,"General, today, can we go back to something that's been bothering me here, which is -- and it was argued in a case this week about the unitary executive theory, which basically says the President is at the head, I think -- I'm summarizing in an incomplete way --"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1116.17,1116.75,Uh-huh.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1116.75,1126.45,"-- but that the President is the head of the executive branch and that he should have, for those who are in the extreme of this theory or -- or on one end of the theory --"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1126.45,1126.58,Uh-huh.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1126.58,1134.89,"-- not extreme, that he can hire or fire anyone he wants and that he can put in place whatever policy he wants."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1134.89,1135.55,Uh-huh.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1135.55,1140.265,If we take Justice Kagan's hypothetical President --
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1140.265,1141.055,Uh-huh.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1141.055,1148.81,"-- who basically says to his review committee, I want to keep out Jews --"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1148.81,1149.55,Uh-huh.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1149.55,1153.71500005,-- period; find a way.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1177.31,1177.44,Uh-huh.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1177.44,1184.29,-- done here -- given that they are responsible to the executive --
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1184.29,1184.38,Right.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1184.38,1191.335,-- and they've been told what the outcome of their deliberations must be?
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1191.335,1191.86,Sure.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1265.76,1292.82,"General, the problem is that I don't see that that material was reviewed by the judges below, by the Ninth Circuit or the Fourth Circuit judges. I thought that the government had kept confidential and refused to share, either with the litigants or the courts, exactly what was done, how, what the evaluation and how --"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1292.82,1292.93,Right.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1292.93,1304.675,"-- it was applied to all those countries in the world. I understand some of the confidentiality that might concern you, but if the backdrop is the way that Justice Kagan described it --"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1304.675,1305.45,Right.
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1305.45,1308.68,-- that -- that heated --
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1308.68,1310.695,"Well, I -- yeah --"
2017.17-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1310.695,1329.15,"-- anti-Semitic background, don't you think that once you get through the Mandel preliminary stage, that you need an independent arbiter to look at all of that to ensure the process, in fact, is what is claimed it was?"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1329.15,1357.01,"Well, Your Honor, a couple of responses to that. First of all, I think that the proclamation is very transparent and lays out in great detail both the process and the substance upon which the proclamation is based. And I think that under the duty of regularity or good faith, or whatever you want to call it, that one branch of the government owes to another coequal branch of the government, there is a very strong presumption that what is being set out there is the truth."
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1357.01,1361.515,"You -- you said something earlier, General, I want to make sure that I got it right."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1368.76,1368.85,Uh-huh.
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1368.85,1371.61,-- that that would undermine the proclamation.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1371.61,1371.82,Yes.
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1371.82,1373.07,Did I get you right?
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1373.07,1373.575,Yes.
2017.17-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1373.575,1382.24,"So I -- I think, you know, honestly, the difference here then seems to be is everything that the President said effectively that?"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1382.24,1385.18,"I think there are two issues, Your Honor, there."
2017.17-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1411.42,1428.8,"But suppose you have a local mayor and, as a candidate, he makes vituperative hate -- hateful statements, he's elected, and on day two, he takes acts that are consistent with those hateful statements. That's -- whatever he said in the campaign is irrelevant?"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1428.8,1430.83,"Your -- Your Honor, if he takes the same oath --"
2017.17-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1430.83,1433.74,You would say whatever he said in the campaign is irrelevant?
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1433.74,1434.9,I would say two things.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1503.96,1504.775,All right.
2017.17-965,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1513.445,1514.06,"Yeah, don't worry."
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1514.74,1515.5,All right.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1536.54,1537.22,Uh-huh.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1537.22,1553.06,"And I looked at this order, and this has case-by-case exceptions. And then it says -- you know, it says case-by-case waivers may be appropriate in individual circumstances, such as, giving some examples, the following. And then they have to be no terrorists."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1563.67,1563.94,Uh-huh.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1563.94,1565.8,"So ""undue"" must be less than ""extreme."""
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1565.8,1566.09,Uh-huh.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1566.09,1584.23,"Okay? So I'm -- then they have a list: people with foreign contacts previously established, business reasons, they've been here studying, or other long-term activity, they want to visit or reside with a close family member, they have a disease or something that they need --"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1584.23,1584.55,Uh-huh.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1584.55,1588.83,"-- treatment for, they -- previously been employed."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1589.97,1590.23,Yeah.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1590.23,1590.7,All right.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1593.53,1594.04,Uh-huh.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1594.04,1602.085,"Now, in countries -- 150 million people, all together, there must be quite a few who have -- do fall within that class."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1602.36,1606.7,"Well, yes, Your Honor, but there's only a small number of people that seek to come into our country."
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1606.7,1608.12,"Well, that's what I'm asking about."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1608.12,1608.29,Yeah.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1608.29,1608.61,You see?
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1608.61,1608.81,Yeah.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1608.81,1621.83,"That's now -- if you -- you think -- now, as far as we're concerned, if they fall within that class, there -- there's no reason given here why they should be excluded, other than the -- the normal processes?"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1621.83,1623.95,"Well, a couple of responses, Your Honor."
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1623.95,1624.06,What?
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1624.06,1626.555,"First, in terms of the numbers --"
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1626.555,1627.7,I'm not asking about the numbers.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1627.7,1628.15,"Oh, oh, you're not asking --"
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1628.15,1628.7,I want to ask about --
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1628.7,1629.81,"So -- so, in terms of the reason --"
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1629.81,1630.0,Yeah.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1630.0,1639.61,"-- they should be excluded, one of the principal purposes of the proclamation is to exert diplomatic pressure on governments in order to get them to change and provide us with the information --"
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1639.61,1641.105,So you think they should be excluded?
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1641.105,1643.34,Not if they meet the criteria for the --
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1643.34,1644.41,Not if they meet the criteria.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1644.41,1644.84,-- for the waiver.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1644.84,1644.93,Okay.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1645.62,1647.18,That's why we have -- that's why we have the waiver.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1647.18,1648.28,That's -- that's -- that's what I thought you would say.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1648.28,1648.5,Yeah.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1648.5,1650.22,Then I get -- can ask my question.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1650.65,1650.885,Yes.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1650.885,1652.78,But I want to be sure we're the same wavelength.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1652.78,1653.26,Yes. (Laughter.)
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1653.26,1653.715,Okay.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1681.0,1681.31,That's not true.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1681.31,1686.12,"-- you haven't put in the guidance, and -- and -- and the most there are is 100."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1707.835,1708.36,Right.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1708.36,1712.64,-- then you have something new and different going well beyond what President Reagan did.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1712.64,1712.74,Sure.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1712.74,1712.935,Okay.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1727.795,1727.945,Right.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1727.945,1731.775,"-- but the other side says there are only two people, no notice, nobody knows."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1731.775,1733.2,"So, Your Honor, two --"
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1733.2,1735.19,"There are people in Yemen, there are people in Somalia --"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1735.19,1735.4,Yeah.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1735.4,1737.72,-- decent people. Business -- you see my point?
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1737.72,1737.99,Yes.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1737.99,1738.5,What's the answer?
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1738.5,1739.21,And two responses.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1739.21,1739.3,Yes.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1739.3,1750.755,"Our reply brief has our most -- most current number on waivers, and I believe the number at page 17, footnote -- well, it's -- it's over 400."
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1752.53,1752.78,All right.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1754.22,1754.6,And then --
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1754.6,1762.77,"And -- and is it well publicized in these countries that they know all they have to do is go to the visa office and say: I understand the thing, I want an exception?"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1762.77,1764.48,"No, Your Honor, and I have two -- two responses --"
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1764.48,1764.54,Yeah.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1764.54,1764.98,-- to that.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1779.99,1780.51,Not necessary.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1781.51,1790.325,"-- which is why most -- which is why most governments don't -- which is why it's -- it's a good thing, which is why most of these proclamations often have them."
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1791.29,1791.51,Okay.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1792.71,1793.86,-- the law that actually requires it.
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1793.86,1801.705,That's what you want. You want me to consider the lawfulness of this order on the assumption that there is no waiver.
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1801.705,1802.11,I don't --
2017.17-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1802.11,1815.18,"Which is not what -- not what President Reagan did, not what -- not what President Carter did, and if you go through every action that Congress took, waiver, waiver, waiver, possibility, case-by-case, case-by-case here, that's the -- that's the --"
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1815.18,1815.51,Right.
2017.17-965,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1832.565,1833.14,"Thank you, General."
2017.17-965,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1834.81,1841.16,Thank you.
2017.17-965,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1841.16,1842.155,Mr. Katyal.
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1842.155,1850.07,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The executive order is unlawful for three reasons: It conflicts with Congress's policy choices."
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1907.76,1910.25,"Well, let's take big sticks fail."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1936.795,1939.76,He could for two reasons. There's two different arguments.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1957.49,1959.51,"Well, just to stop, interrupt you there."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1967.25,1967.55,Right.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1967.55,1969.57,-- respond to your point that it has to be an immediate decision.
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1969.57,1969.64,Yeah.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1994.81,2000.57,"Well, imagine -- imagine, if you can, that Congress is unable to act when the President asked for legislation. (Laughter.)"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2000.57,2000.7,Right.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2000.7,2016.66,"And someone introduces a bill saying let's authorize -- first of all, the President may have qualms about sharing that absolute intelligence broadly, but let's say there's a bill introduced to say let's authorize the President and there's a bill introduced to say let's block the President, and neither bill moves."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2016.66,2017.23,Absolutely.
2017.17-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2082.19,2084.17,"Well, Congress did -- Congress did act."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2085.66,2086.08,Correct.
2017.17-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2086.08,2090.415,Why doesn't this fall squarely within the language of 1182(f)?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2090.415,2095.47,"For -- for -- we have both textual reasons that it's not a class, for reasons Justice Breyer was talking about."
2017.17-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2102.11,2105.41,"Well, maybe you could talk about the text."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2116.08,2116.465,Correct.
2017.17-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2116.465,2118.02,-- or any class of aliens.
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2127.51,2127.85,Right.
2017.17-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2176.08,2186.445,"Well, does this proclamation do anything like that? Does this proclamation purport to establish a new permanent immigration policy for the United States?"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2186.445,2191.69,"Absolutely, Your Honor. This is a perpetual policy that bans."
2017.17-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2225.77,2228.57,What is your basis for saying that it is perpetual?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2228.57,2231.12,"Well, there's nothing in the order that ends it."
2017.17-965,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2235.15,2237.415,I thought it had to be reexamined every 180 days?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2237.415,2239.16,"No, that's not what it says."
2017.17-965,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2244.02,2246.365,"Well, that -- that indicates there will be a reassessment?"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2246.365,2247.23,"Well, in --"
2017.17-965,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2247.23,2250.265,And then the -- and -- and the President has continuing discretion?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2250.265,2259.74,"Justice Kennedy, this argument wouldn't be there if there was anything about reassessment, the way there are in about half the orders, including the Cuba order, which says it sunsets once the crisis ends."
2017.17-965,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2285.55,2295.375,"Well, the statute says first that -- that -- that 1182 for such period as he deems necessary, and he can have continuing supervision over whether it's still necessary."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2295.375,2302.9,"Again, we wouldn't have a problem with that if it was tailored to a crisis, it says it sunsets, and then, you know, could be re-upped or something like that. That's not what this says."
2017.17-965,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2304.32,2308.55,"So you want the President to say, I'm convinced that in six months we're going to have a safe world?"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2308.55,2310.54,"Well -- well -- well, no, Justice Kennedy, that's not our argument."
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2331.66,2351.66,"What if the military advisors tell the President that, in their judgment, the President ought to order a strike, an air strike against Syria, and the President says, well -- does that mean he can't because you would regard that as discrimination against a majority Muslim country?"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2351.66,2352.46,Absolutely not.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2359.98,2363.465,"So, under 1182(f), you would say that there's no problem under that provision?"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2363.465,2366.35,"Well, under 1182, as I understand, it was a strike."
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2371.53,2379.715,"Well, any type of targeted action that would have a impact on the Muslim population."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2379.715,2380.29,Absolutely.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2387.08,2395.45,Why under your theory wouldn't that constitute or the argument would be that that's discrimination under your Establishment Clause argument --
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2395.45,2395.48,Oh.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2395.48,2402.005,"-- that that's discrimination on the basis of faith because he has said in the past, if you accept the --"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2402.005,2402.245,Yeah.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2402.245,2405.85,"-- accept the arguments, that he -- he is anti-Muslim?"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2405.85,2417.99,"Not at all, Your Honor, and no President has run afoul of this, you know, and that's because, here, the President and his advisors have directly tied this policy to those statements."
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2437.63,2438.01,He can never --
2017.17-965,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2438.01,2439.26,"Well, you might think --"
2017.17-965,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2439.26,2442.9,"Mr. Katyal -- Mr. Katyal, if I might on -- on the statutory question before we leave it."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2470.05,2470.66,"Well, several."
2017.17-965,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2475.36,2475.89,Oh behalf of --
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2475.89,2476.67,-- of the United States.
2017.17-965,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2476.67,2478.55,-- aliens not present in the country?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2478.55,2480.875,"Well, but they are directly -- they are directly harmed themselves."
2017.17-965,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2497.44,2502.36,"I understand that, but those arguments don't work with respect to aliens present in the country."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2505.54,2505.91,Because I --
2017.17-965,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2505.91,2507.93,Those very same arguments would not succeed.
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2507.93,2508.15,Well --
2017.17-965,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2508.15,2510.73,I think you'd concede that they wouldn't succeed for aliens present --
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2510.73,2510.84,Right.
2017.17-965,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2578.43,2599.49,"I -- I guess the question, though, Mr. Katyal, is maybe you're entirely right that 1182(f) needs to have some limits to prevent the President from doing something that's completely contrary to another section of the statute. But you're suggesting, well, the President can't do anything that's not contemplated by the rest of the statute."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2599.49,2600.54,That is not our argument.
2017.17-965,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2600.54,2600.63,Okay.
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2610.56,2610.75,Right.
2017.17-965,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2610.75,2614.52,-- between what the President is doing and another statutory provision.
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2614.52,2618.805,So our view is that the President can supplement; he just can't supplant.
2017.17-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2706.89,2725.64,Can -- can you imagine any situation in which the threat of the infiltration of the United States by terrorists was so severe with respect to a particular country that the other measures that you have mentioned could be deemed by a President to be inadequate?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2725.64,2725.93,Yes.
2017.17-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2725.93,2728.15,You cannot imagine any such situation?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2728.15,2728.96,"Yes, I can."
2017.17-965,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2733.38,2742.89,"And your argument is that courts have the -- the duty to review whether or not there is such a national exigency; that's for the courts to do, not the President?"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2742.89,2743.36,No.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2775.51,2776.88,But that's in the abstract.
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2799.06,2801.3,"Well, that, again -- that's, again, Mr. Chief Justice, not our argument."
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2812.42,2815.51,What about -- what about a change of administration in a particular country --
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2815.51,2815.88,Yes.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2815.88,2819.73,-- in which perhaps the vetting procedures are not going to be taken seriously?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2819.73,2820.065,Right.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2820.065,2821.875,That Congress could not have anticipated?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2821.875,2834.96,"Well, but, again, Congress anticipated a country that is a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" and even for -- with respect to that, providing no information and indeed fomenting against the United States, Congress said, oh, we're not going to have a nationality ban."
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2917.53,2935.45,"If your -- your argument based on discrimination based on the campaign statements, is there a statute of -- no the one that you do make based on the campaign statements, is there a statute of limitations on that, or is that a ban from presidential findings for the rest of the administration?"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2935.45,2938.655,"So, Mr. Chief Justice, I first want to be very clear about this."
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2956.48,2957.08,My question was on the --
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2957.08,2958.13,-- you're asking about the First Amendment.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2958.13,2958.22,Yes.
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2958.22,2964.35,"I just want to make absolutely clear that we're -- that's not -- you know, you don't need to do any of that for purposes of 1152."
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2969.6,2970.42,"My question, of course --"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2970.42,2970.51,Yes.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2970.95,2971.57,-- was not on 1152.
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2971.57,2971.7,Yes.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3012.93,3020.095,My question was whether or not the inhibition on the ability to -- to enter one of the proclamations applies forever?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3020.095,3020.485,Right.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3032.36,3038.77,"So, if tomorrow he issues a proclamation saying he's disavowing all those statements, then the next day he can reenter this proclamation?"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3038.77,3040.905,That's exactly what this Court said in McCreary.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3050.45,3052.15,Is your answer to my question yes?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3052.15,3052.34,Yes.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3052.75,3055.65,"Tomorrow, he issues a proclamation disavowing those statements --"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3055.65,3056.0,Absolutely.
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3056.24,3059.96,-- then the next day he could reenter this and your discrimination argument would not be applicable?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3059.96,3063.66,"And -- and -- and, Mr. Chief Justice, that's exactly what I told the Ninth Circuit in May."
2017.17-965,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3068.37,3068.79,So if another --
2017.17-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3068.79,3100.1,"Mr. Katyal, would any reasonable observer reading this proclamation, with -- without taking into account statements, think that this was a Muslim ban? I mean, there are -- I think there are 50 predominantly Muslim countries in the world. Five -- five countries -- five predominantly Muslim countries are on this list. The population of the -- of the predominantly Muslim countries on this list make up about 8 percent of the world's Muslim population."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3100.1,3100.71,Absolutely.
2017.17-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3100.71,3105.055,"If you looked at the 10 countries with the most Muslims, exactly one --"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3105.055,3105.54,Right.
2017.17-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3105.54,3108.23,"-- Iran, would be on that list of the top 10."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3108.23,3108.37,Right.
2017.17-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3108.37,3111.88,So would a reasonable observer think this was a Muslim ban?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3111.88,3124.665,"If it were -- if it were just the text of the order alone, it might raise eyebrows, for fit and other reasons that the briefs go into, but we wouldn't be here. We absolutely agree that just -- it's the same test as in Lukumi and other cases."
2017.17-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3148.14,3149.55,"No, I -- I understand that."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3184.74,3209.805,"Justice Alito, I think if it were just the list, I think we'd be right -- you'd be right, although I'd point out that you, yourself, in the Stormans case said that it's a religious -- it raises an inference of religious gerrymander, of ""the burden imposed falls almost exclusively on those with religious objections."" This is a ban that really does fall almost exclusively on Muslims, between 90.2 percent and 99.8 percent Muslims."
2017.17-965,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3233.78,3246.33,"Mr. Katyal, on that, it's been a long time since this Court has used the Lemon test, reasonable observer, even to strike down a domestic statute, let alone something with purely international application."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3247.755,3252.25,"Yeah, so two things. Number one is I think the very fact that this is immigration cuts the other way."
2017.17-965,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3281.945,3292.115,"Mr. Katyal, you said something earlier, you said you wouldn't be here if all of those statements, the background statements, were not made."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3297.89,3300.46,"Only on the Establishment Clause claim, not on anything else."
2017.17-965,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3308.54,3312.6,So let's -- let's go back to not being here without the statements.
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3338.885,3339.12,Yeah.
2017.17-965,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3407.54,3414.575,"And -- and yet, Mr. Katyal, you have a proclamation that says there are important national security interests at stake."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3428.16,3428.515,Right.
2017.17-965,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3453.67,3464.29,"What do you think -- it's a -- it's a -- it's still something I'm -- I'm thinking about, perhaps to the side, but the statute you point to, one of the ones that is stronger for you."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3523.05,3524.06,Right.
2017.17-965,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3524.06,3524.86,-- what do we do?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3524.86,3525.86,So two things.
2017.17-965,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3562.71,3562.8,That --
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3562.8,3563.92,We've heard very few instances --
2017.17-965,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3563.92,3565.27,-- raises a question of remedy for me.
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3565.27,3565.57,Yes.
2017.17-965,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3565.57,3570.67,"We have this troubling rise of this nationwide injunction, cosmic injunction --"
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3570.67,3571.045,"Yeah, yeah."
2017.17-965,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3571.045,3575.305,-- not limited to relief for the parties at issue or even a class action.
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3575.305,3575.64,Right.
2017.17-965,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3575.64,3587.05,"And, near as I can tell, that's -- that's a really new development where a district court asserts the right to strike down a -- a federal statute with regard to anybody anywhere in the world."
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3587.05,3587.185,Yeah.
2017.17-965,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3587.185,3590.18,What -- what do we do about that?
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3590.18,3593.56,"Obviously, the injunction here has been trimmed by this Court itself and others."
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3653.115,3655.32,Take five extra minutes.
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3656.805,3661.1,Okay. (Laughter.)
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3661.1,3663.835,You don't have to. (Laughter.)
2017.17-965,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3663.835,3667.68,"Well, if there are -- if there are any other questions, I'm happy to take anything."
2017.17-965,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3670.65,3675.15,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes for rebuttal, General."
2017.17-965,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3675.15,3690.725,"Mr. Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I -- I really do have just a few quick points, unless Your Honors have additional questions. Justice Breyer, I did want to respond in more detail to your question about how the waiver process works."
2017.17-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3737.53,3738.38,How do you deal with the --
2017.17-965,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3738.38,3740.415,So it does get applied in every single case.
2017.17-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3740.415,3745.375,How -- how do you deal with the example that was brought up of the child with cerebral palsy?
2017.17-965,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3745.375,3750.14,"Your Honor, the waiver is built to address those issues."
2017.17-965,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3758.1,3759.0,"But that's -- that's, you see --"
2017.17-965,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3759.0,3759.54,-- is intended to address.
2017.17-965,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3759.54,3761.745,"You've read the briefs, as have I."
2017.17-965,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3783.295,3783.44,Yeah.
2017.17-965,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3783.44,3796.395,"And then the business community lists a -- a whole bunch and says, my goodness, they have been unable to get -- we don't know what's going on. And then they say: Well, what's going on is nothing is going on."
2017.17-965,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3796.395,3796.91,"Well, Your Honor --"
2017.17-965,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3796.91,3799.035,Now I don't -- I'm not taking sides on that.
2017.17-965,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3800.92,3801.56,Right.
2017.17-965,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3847.04,3849.275,"General, could you stop just one second?"
2017.17-965,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3849.275,3850.78,"Yes, Your Honor, of course."
2017.17-965,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3850.78,3868.965,"I for one am, like Justice Breyer, concerned about is this window dressing or not? What's in place to ensure it's not? What are you personally doing to represent to us that it is, in fact, a real waiver process --"
2017.17-965,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3868.965,3877.83,"Your Honor, State Department consular officers automatically apply the waiver process in the course of every visa application."
2017.17-965,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3884.16,3885.09,Have you bothered --
2017.17-965,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3885.09,3886.41,-- the proclamation was issued.
2017.17-965,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3886.41,3890.265,-- to look to see if there are reasons for all of those people's exclusions?
2017.17-965,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3890.265,3894.51,"Your Honor, I cannot claim that I have looked into every individual case."
2017.17-965,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3894.51,3896.63,Could you make your 1152 point?
2017.17-965,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3896.63,3904.275,"Yes, Your Honor. 1152(a)(1)(A) addresses one thing, the issuance of immigrant visas."
2017.17-965,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4010.965,4012.04,"Thank you, counsel."
