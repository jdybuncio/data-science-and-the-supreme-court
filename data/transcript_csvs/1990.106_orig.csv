1990.106_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.738,"We'll hear argument now in No. 106 Original, the State of Illinois v. the State of Kentucky."
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,12.038,13.841,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.106_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,124.784,129.207,"Now, when you say low-water mark you have to tell us low-water mark at what time."
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,129.207,132.618,"As it exists from time to time, or currently."
1990.106_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,132.618,135.732,"The changing low-water mark, not the 1792 low-water mark."
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,135.732,136.222,That's correct.
1990.106_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,141.108,147.1,"Mr. Pearson, are you asking us to overrule Ohio v. Kentucky?"
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,153.485,157.118,"Your Honor, we're not asking this Court to overrule Ohio v. Kentucky."
1990.106_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,162.922,164.494,--And must be for you to win.
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,164.494,165.486,That's affirmative.
1990.106_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,168.798,171.211,Would you object if we were to overrule that area case?
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,171.211,171.812,"--No, sir."
1990.106_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,174.245,176.236,"Well, there was a dissent in that case, wasn't there?"
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,176.236,177.455,There was a dissent in that case.
1990.106_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.104,328.981,"Mr. Pearson, if you're not asking the Court to overrule Ohio against Kentucky, then your argument has to be based on acquiescence, does it not?"
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,328.981,329.722,"--It does, Your Honor."
1990.106_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.722,334.967,And how much of a part does the practicalities of the thing play in acquiescence?
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,340.321,340.801,You do.
1990.106_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,344.715,350.19,"And if they acquiesced, what difference does it make whether it's a practical boundary?"
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,353.603,361.229,"Your Honor, I think it's... it's very important that it's a practical boundary for the simple fact that it would best serve the public convenience."
1990.106_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,361.229,363.841,But what has that got to do with acquiescence?
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,370.466,371.358,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.106_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,384.226,387.117,Did that... did that case turn on acquiescence?
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,387.117,387.968,"--Yes, it did, Your Honor."
1990.106_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.852,448.231,"Well, at least it makes it more sensible to argue acquiescence if it's... if acquiescing was in the public interest or if it was practical to do so."
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,448.231,449.182,"I would agree, Your Honor."
1990.106_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,634.158,643.164,"Mr. Pearson, I guess Kentucky has boundaries along the Ohio River with Ohio and--"
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,643.164,643.565,Indiana.
1990.106_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,643.565,644.894,--Indiana as well.
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,644.894,645.685,That's correct.
1990.106_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,645.685,664.338,"And so I assume if somehow we were to agree with you that there has been acquiescence here for the Illinois boundary, that would mean the boundary is someplace else with respect to Indiana and Ohio?"
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,664.338,666.61,That's correct.
1990.106_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,670.322,672.045,"Yes, quite."
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,672.045,675.267,With respect to that conclusion... which it would.
1990.106_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,797.711,805.157,"Mr. Pearson, isn't it possible that the boundary is actually on the land north of where the water is, under Illinois' theory?"
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,805.157,807.298,"No, Your Honor."
1990.106_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.298,810.941,"I mean, maybe... isn't it possible the river has moved to the south rather than to the north?"
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,810.941,817.786,"I think, Your Honor, I think you're speaking with respect to a survey that was done by Illinois with respect to that."
1990.106_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,833.059,841.285,"No, my point is that all this activity rely on... say Illinois allowed all the policing and what went on on the water itself."
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,848.01,854.155,"That may well be true, Your Honor, but in the complaint they allege that it was the 1792 low-water mark."
1990.106_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.617,861.02,"Right, but I'm just saying if you don't know where it is, conceivably... I don't know, I don't know anything about the geography."
1990.106_orig,0,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,865.845,867.225,--It could have been.
1990.106_orig,1,28914,john_brunsman,,1573.945,1576.038,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.106_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1617.196,1624.001,How did the 1896 surveys deduce the 1792 low-water line?
1990.106_orig,1,28914,john_brunsman,,1624.001,1625.794,"It's obviously, Your Honor, it's not exactly."
1990.106_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1630.058,1639.284,"Well, so what you're saying is that the 1896 survey didn't purport to show the 1792 low-water mark; it showed the 1896 low-water mark?"
1990.106_orig,1,28914,john_brunsman,,1639.284,1645.94,"It showed... it used an average of gauge readings on various parts of the river going back a number of years before that, up to 50 years before that."
1990.106_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1650.033,1652.035,50 years preceding 1896?
1990.106_orig,1,28914,john_brunsman,,1652.035,1652.868,--Exactly.
1990.106_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1703.804,1716.51,"If you use a changing low-water mark as the boundary, what's the law if a dam is built or the low-water mark is changed by an act of one of the States?"
1990.106_orig,1,28914,john_brunsman,,1716.51,1723.486,I believe that there are cases that indicate that you can have in effect an evulsive change created by manmade intervention.
1990.106_orig,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1731.149,1732.151,"Well, what about the low-water mark?"
1990.106_orig,1,28914,john_brunsman,,1743.33,1747.432,--Assuming that we had a case other than Ohio v. Kentucky?
1990.106_orig,2,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2655.254,2655.474,I do.
1990.106_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2731.977,2734.738,"Thank you, Mr. Pearson."
