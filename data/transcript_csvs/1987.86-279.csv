1987.86-279,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.504,"The next case is Basic, Incorporated versus Levinson."
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,10.789,13.122,Justice Brennan and may it please the Court.
1987.86-279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,340.969,349.909,"Doesn't the SG suggest that a simple no-comment would be all right, and that's the way to handle inquiries of this kind?"
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,349.909,352.277,"xx, they have suggested that."
1987.86-279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,354.879,356.68,And what's the matter with that?
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,356.68,373.107,"I think that it would do a disservice to the investment community to encourage companies to say, no comment, when in fact in good faith they determine that whatever the market is doing with their stock has nothing to do with anything that's going on with the company."
1987.86-279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,400.959,408.013,"Well, the Court of Appeals found that this last statement at least was false when it was made."
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,408.013,427.594,"The Court of Appeals, although on rehearing, I think one of the Judges on that panel indicated that all they did was find that there were issues of fact that precluded its affirming the summary judgment that the District Court had awarded to petitioners, did seem to describe all of the statements as false and misleading."
1987.86-279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,464.017,470.254,"Well, without getting into the facts, we have, the District Court thought they were truthful?"
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,470.254,471.29,"--Yes, that's correct."
1987.86-279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,471.29,475.325,And the Court of Appeals thought the opposite?
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,475.325,476.292,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1987.86-279,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,514.033,520.77,"Mr. Sternman, are you arguing that we ought to find a different testing when a summary judgment is permissible?"
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,523.888,531.309,"Standard of review, the de novo standard that was applied in this case by the Court of Appeals."
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,547.135,556.693,"--Didn't the District Court go off on the notion that whether these statements were true or false, they weren't material."
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,560.228,561.178,That's correct.
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,561.178,566.882,"Well, that doesn't depend on any kind of factual notions about true or false."
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,566.882,569.417,The District Court opinion had three aspects to it.
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,570.917,573.469,"I know, but that aspect would be dispositive."
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,573.469,577.171,"--Either one of the three aspects was dispositive, Justice White."
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,577.171,579.189,"Well, then wholly aside from any issue of fact."
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,579.189,580.272,That's correct.
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,580.958,592.949,But if the Court of Appeals disagreed with that and said that there can be material facts represented prior to the time there's a deal.
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,594.616,606.257,"--The District Court's standard had been as long as the discussions have not proceeded to the point where it's reasonably certain that there will be an agreement in principle, the facts are not material."
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.257,606.959,That's right.
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,611.161,612.494,That's correct.
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.494,615.63,And so that was the end of the case as far as the District Court was concerned.
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,615.63,616.681,Except the District Court did much more.
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,616.681,618.164,It didn't have to.
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,618.164,622.051,I think that's correct.
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.051,624.535,If it wanted to take the risk that it was right on the law.
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,624.535,631.574,"We had presented the issue to it, however, in three steps, as Rule 10(b)(5) permits us to."
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,635.293,636.026,Yes.
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,636.026,637.811,"They were not false, they were not misleading."
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,675.853,695.165,"But I didn't think that you were, the questions you present here are in your petition was just whether the rule of law they used with respect to when a statement is material and then whether the presumption about reliance."
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,695.165,700.718,"--Well, on the questions of law that are directly before this Court, the legal principles."
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.718,702.253,Those are the only things that are before us.
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,702.253,704.622,I was responding to a question that I thought--
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.622,712.876,"I know, but you've been arguing the facts of the case saying that they were the facts."
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,712.876,725.619,"--Well, I think in order to apply the standards of materiality that have been proposed, some of them require that a few of the facts be xx."
1987.86-279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,847.232,850.534,"Mr. Sternman, can I interrupt you for one minute to see if I can understand your theory?"
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,850.534,851.317,"--Yes, sir."
1987.86-279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,851.317,854.838,Drawing a distinction between materiality on the one hand and truth on the other.
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,854.838,855.271,Yes.
1987.86-279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.271,869.078,"Assume for just purposes of discussion that a statement was made that our management has never met, we don't even know anybody at Combustion Engineering, a clearly false statement, but one that was made before any agreement in principle had been reached."
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,871.43,872.047,That's correct.
1987.86-279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,877.501,884.171,"So in order to judge this case in your theory, we don't really have to pass on the truth or falsity of the statement, do we?"
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,884.171,887.492,If you accept the agreement in principle test.
1987.86-279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.492,896.165,"If we accept your theory and we also agree with you that at the time of these statements, the discussions were sufficiently tentative not to satisfy the test, that's the end of the case."
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,896.165,896.698,That's correct.
1987.86-279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.698,898.265,So we don't really have to worry about the facts too much.
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,898.265,898.965,That's correct.
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,919.863,923.648,"Well, if you take the SEC standard, that isn't the standard the Court of Appeals used, either."
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,929.219,941.96,"Well, I think, as in Hochfelder where this Court felt it was appropriate not to remand but instead to give judgment to the respondents in that case because the matter had been litigated enough."
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.96,945.061,You mean reinstate the District Court's summary judgment?
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,945.061,946.597,Yes.
1987.86-279,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,983.271,989.69,"If we were to adopt the SEC test, that would require a remand to the Court of Appeals because we'd reject the Court of Appeals test, is that right?"
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,989.69,990.09,--Yes.
1987.86-279,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,991.126,994.761,"I know what you would hope, but that's a fact, isn't it?"
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,994.761,995.578,"--Yes, Justice Brennan, that's correct."
1987.86-279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,995.578,999.982,Do you think there's really that much difference between the SEC's test and the Court of Appeal's test?
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,999.982,1001.198,Yes.
1987.86-279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.368,1038.44,"That would be sufficient to make it untrue, but do you think that also under their view made it sufficient to be material?"
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,1038.44,1039.607,"Yes, that was their view."
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1206.967,1211.835,"Well, a fraud on the market theory doesn't even require knowledge, does it?"
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,1211.835,1213.954,It doesn't require knowledge of?
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.954,1215.806,That the statements were made at the time?
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,1215.806,1216.339,That's correct.
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.495,1230.732,"Nevertheless, just because we bought or sold on the market, we relied."
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,1230.732,1231.398,That's correct.
1987.86-279,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1231.398,1236.969,And the market reflects accurately what's going on in life.
1987.86-279,0,33078,joel_w_sternman,,1236.969,1237.569,Yes.
1987.86-279,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1483.11,1485.979,Mr. Cross?
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1485.979,1491.549,"Justice Brennan, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1621.701,1625.57,"That's the Third Circuit rule, isn't it?"
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1625.57,1627.188,"That I believe is the Third Circuit rule, Your Honor."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1627.188,1627.755,Any others?
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1627.755,1638.145,"The only other Circuit that has addressed that issue, and I believe at least you can say it's ambiguous, is the Seventh Circuit in the Flamm case."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1669.182,1674.985,"Well, has any circuit other than the Sixth rejected the fraud on the market theory?"
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1674.985,1680.722,"--The agreement in principle test, I'm not aware that any other circuit has addressed it squarely."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1698.268,1703.422,So it's really just the Sixth and the Third that have really addressed it?
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1703.422,1703.955,That's correct.
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.653,1732.938,"I take it you reject the SEC test then, too?"
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1732.938,1740.878,"Your Honor, I think the SEC test is very close to the Sixth Circuit test and I think very close to most of the other Circuits."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1752.852,1762.558,"Well, the SEC clearly rejects the Sixth Circuit's statement or holding that every false statement is necessarily material."
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1763.826,1765.11,No.
1987.86-279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1767.278,1768.897,"Well, it reads like it said."
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1768.897,1770.947,"Well, the interpretation the SEC has taken and I understand that."
1987.86-279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1774.449,1776.067,You don't defend that as the standard?
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1776.067,1785.323,"--I don't say that any, the denial of a merger negotiation makes any contact per se material, no, I don't."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.615,1854.067,The District Court didn't agree with you on that.
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1854.067,1859.288,"The District Court, Your Honor, the District Court's opinion is a very curious opinion."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1859.288,1864.542,"Well, nevertheless, it disagreed with some of the statements you've just made."
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1864.542,1867.994,It disagreed but it didn't disagree that the evidence was there.
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.748,1910.085,"You think that the District Court found that any of these statements were false and misleading, or did they think that they weren't?"
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1910.085,1931.267,"I think the District Court concluded that with respect to the first statement, there are not any negotiations underway for any company for a merger statement, that it concluded that the contacts prior to that statement were not cognizable as ""negotiations"" and hence the statement was true."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1931.267,1931.917,Yes.
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1931.917,1934.969,But that's a characterization of what is a negotiation.
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.969,1936.802,How about the other statements?
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1936.802,1947.943,"The other statements, I believe, the District Court conceded there was a possibility that the contacts prior to the September, November statements could be considered preliminary merger negotiations."
1987.86-279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1967.54,1979.914,"Well, how about ordinary corporate projections and forecasts in which the corporation says, well, we think prospects look good or bad or whatever they say?"
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,1998.376,2001.345,"Justice O'Connor, I think that's not right."
1987.86-279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2014.004,2019.389,"Well, then they are also I think you will find that they are deem I constructively immaterial."
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2031.531,2036.685,"Well, first of all, the no corporate development statement is not as neutral as it sounds."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.577,2086.831,"You would say that in response to a specific question about negotiations, the corporation could say, no comment, and there would be no liability?"
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2086.831,2087.715,That's right.
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.204,2098.39,Or none of your business.
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2098.39,2099.956,--No.
1987.86-279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2152.108,2163.583,"Well, I guess some writers on the subject think that it has the effect of chilling the prospects for mergers which in the long run can greatly harm the existing shareholders."
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2167.451,2168.835,There is some scholarly writing.
1987.86-279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2183.06,2196.554,"But in the long ran, that kind of disclosure can end up in effect causing a greater less in shareholder share value than otherwise."
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2196.554,2203.208,"That may be as a matter of economies true but I submit that if you adopt that as a policy reason for doing that, it is where I started my argument."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.275,2237.297,"If you were trying this case, say there hadn't been summary judgment, and you actually got to trial, what would be your definition of materiality?"
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2237.297,2240.999,My definition of materiality would be this Court's definition in TSC v. Northway.
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.999,2241.416,Which is?
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2241.416,2257.259,"Would the discussions at the time, take for example, the October, 1977 denial, would the discussions that had existed at that time have been considered important to the investment decision of the reasonable investor."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2257.259,2258.276,How about reliance?
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2258.276,2264.93,"Well, now you're shifting over into the fraud on the market theory."
1987.86-279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2277.654,2285.343,"--But there was a plaintiff class, wasn't there, here that did not apparently have to indicate reliance?"
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2285.343,2289.711,"Justice O'Connor, that is the ruling of the District Court."
1987.86-279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2304.055,2305.507,"Well, I'm confused."
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2311.577,2324.151,"The District Court, in certifying the class, chose our second alternative articulation of a reason for class certification, and said, in this case, fraud on the market is sufficient to certify a class and certified it that way."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.151,2325.134,And that stood up in the Court of Appeals.
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2325.134,2326.17,And that stood up in the Court of Appeals.
1987.86-279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2352.286,2361.308,"Well, I gather from what you say, though, you'd have no objection if we thought reliance had to be established or claimed for the class?"
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2361.308,2369.18,The only objection that I would have if you thought that reliance had to be established would be the right to relitigate the class action motion in the District Court.
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.356,2435.558,Then get the right class.
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2435.558,2436.392,What?
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2436.392,2437.442,Then get the right class.
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2437.442,2439.027,"Well, I think I have the right class."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.027,2445.847,"Well, in the long run, it would have to be a class of people who relied."
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2445.847,2460.106,"It would have to be a class of people who relied, but I think you still even in a class certification context under Rule 23, you still have a presumption of reliance of non-present class members."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.106,2462.523,Yes.
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2462.523,2465.492,"It may be on the damage phase, you get some inquiry."
1987.86-279,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2465.492,2471.914,"Mr. Cross, having set aside the summary judgment, you're now going back to trial, are you?"
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2471.914,2473.398,I hope so.
1987.86-279,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2473.398,2474.264,In the District Court.
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2482.187,2483.306,That's right.
1987.86-279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2537.255,2539.774,"Mr. Cross, I was a little puzzled by the Court of Appeals' opinion."
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2551.015,2558.938,"Your Honor, I'm intrigued by the opinion in the sense that--"
1987.86-279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2558.938,2561.054,"Yeah, but what are you going to do when you go back to the trial court?"
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2565.841,2575.863,"--I think that on the face of the Court of Appeals decision, what the Court of Appeals said was, in effect, summary judgment on the materiality issue was appropriate for me."
1987.86-279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2575.863,2576.513,Right.
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2576.513,2582.184,Not as Mr. Sternman has argued that it's articulating a rule of law for all cases.
1987.86-279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2617.757,2618.574,What is your view?
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2625.213,2636.87,"I would argue and I would argue notwithstanding the Sixth Circuit opinion, I would argue that we are entitled to a directed verdict on that issue, and well get all the evidence in."
1987.86-279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2645.274,2651.447,"Well, it's a little different arguing they're so significant you're entitled to it as a matter of law on this record."
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2658.934,2662.469,I think as a matter of pure jurisprudence I can't take that position because I didn't make the motion.
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2682.216,2683.182,You're still going to have to put in some evidence.
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2683.182,2685.334,"I think I'm going to have to put in some evidence, yes."
1987.86-279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.334,2690.322,That would make these statements material.
1987.86-279,1,44173,wayne_alan_cross,,2693.54,2694.574,Yes.
1987.86-279,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2894.969,2896.437,"Thank you, Mr. Cross."
1987.86-279,2,33078,joel_w_sternman,,2898.054,2899.554,"Thank you, Justice Brennan."
1987.86-279,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3212.703,3216.055,"Mr. Sternman, xx answer just one quick question."
1987.86-279,2,33078,joel_w_sternman,,3226.779,3243.325,"The sales data was given... first of all, in 1978, when there was some sales data given, Basic was interested in acquiring Combustion's refractories division, and it thought that it would pay for that acquisition with Basic stock."
1987.86-279,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3278.914,3279.448,Thank you.
1987.86-279,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3279.448,3280.698,"Thank you, Mr. Sternman."
