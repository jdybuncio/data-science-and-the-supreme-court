1971.70-14,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,25.058,We will hear arguments next in Cole against Richardson.
1971.70-14,0,45544,walter_h_mayo_iii,,27.709,31.79,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-14,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,192.055,195.511,Does the back pay issue filed to the case here?
1971.70-14,0,45544,walter_h_mayo_iii,,195.511,196.708,"No, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-14,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,201.826,204.498,How do you characterize the District Court’s opinion here?
1971.70-14,0,45544,walter_h_mayo_iii,,209.583,228.763,"Well, the District Court did not mentioned the Fourteenth Amendment in its original opinion on the constitutionality issue and based it entirely on the First Amendment and I believe by virtue of the fact that the First Amendment is applicable to the states or the Fourteenth, we must also characterize it as being a First and Fourteenth Amendment question."
1971.70-14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,228.763,231.07,You said that this is required to all employees.
1971.70-14,0,45544,walter_h_mayo_iii,,248.437,252.707,"Yes, excuse me Mr. Justice Stewart, that is correct provision, exception is written in the statute."
1971.70-14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,252.707,255.889,"Yes, even if an Equal Protection argument, based on that exception?"
1971.70-14,0,45544,walter_h_mayo_iii,,255.889,257.557,"No, no equal protection argument."
1971.70-14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,257.557,258.197,You do not?
1971.70-14,0,45544,walter_h_mayo_iii,,258.197,260.675,No.
1971.70-14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,358.44,367.236,"Mr. Mayo, I did not demean in my question to ask you, if you are making that Equal Protection argument on that, do you understand that your brother on the other side makes one?"
1971.70-14,0,45544,walter_h_mayo_iii,,367.236,371.589,"No, I do not believe so Mr. Justice Stewart."
1971.70-14,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,409.06,436.107,"Let me ask you Mr. Mayo, under this oath as it is traced with reference to defending, a person could have a private belief, philosophical and political belief of communism and still conscientiously take this oath to defend against those to overthrow the government, could he not?"
1971.70-14,0,45544,walter_h_mayo_iii,,436.107,437.408,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-14,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,437.408,443.178,"So in that part of the oath, it is not a case involving belief."
1971.70-14,0,45544,walter_h_mayo_iii,,444.532,447.064,And we would maintain the second portion of the oath likewise.
1971.70-14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,569.868,587.372,"They declare to you that the phrase “by force, violence or by any illegal or unconstitutional method” modifies or overthrow rather than oppose."
1971.70-14,0,45544,walter_h_mayo_iii,,598.381,603.111,"No, I think Mr. Justice Stewart the language modifies the word “overthrow” and not the word “oppose.”"
1971.70-14,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,607.277,612.288,"As a matter of grammar which you read it, it could be read the other way."
1971.70-14,0,45544,walter_h_mayo_iii,,625.252,637.158,"No, I could not agree, as the rule of grammar, that it would modify the word “oppose” because I do not think that an employee would use any illegal or unconstitutional method to oppose the overthrow."
1971.70-14,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,794.214,797.298,Thank you Mr. Mayo.
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,806.377,806.544,Mr. Chief Justice --
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,806.544,833.367,"Do you agree Mr. Oleskey with the response that Mr. Mayo gave to my hypothetical question, perhaps not hypothetical, that a person could be a philosophical believer in communism and yet take the oath, that he would conscientiously takes the oath that he would oppose the overthrow of the government by the force, violence and so forth?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,833.367,835.495,"Well, I am not sure that I do agree Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,835.495,839.497,"You think he might not be a very conscientious communist, perhaps?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,839.497,841.107,I think that is one possibility.
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,863.273,873.465,"Well, does that second part of the oath deal with belief per se or does it deal with the plaintiff with respect to future conduct?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,873.465,877.974,There is no reference as there was in the Connell concededly to belief.
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,884.879,888.781,"Future conduct, is it not rather than intent?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,888.781,918.583,"Well, the oath specifies “I will oppose” I would argue that that requires an affirmation of the time the oath has taken, the instance that the potential employee or is it just as someone about to take the witness stand in a trial will be required to swear to the truth of what he is about to say, that he intends from that time or forward, to act in conformity with the words which he repeated. Otherwise the oath cannot have any meaning."
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,918.583,936.108,"Do you see much distinction between the oath, the first part of the oath before the conjunctive and, and the oath that you took for example when you were admitted to the bar of this Court."
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,944.58,953.601,"I must confess with some slight embarrassment since I am appearing pro hac vice being three days short of eligibility for the admission of bar, the court, I have not yet taken that oath."
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,953.601,963.278,"Then I suppose that in terms of the oath that you will take three-days hence or thereafter, you heard the oath in this courtroom of course?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,963.278,965.402,"I have not Mr. Chief Justice, frankly."
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,965.402,973.31,"Well, I think it is essentially the same as the first part of the oath if you take out Massachusetts."
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,980.598,1005.073,"Well, I have tried to suggest that I feel it is more than conduct insofar as it does require, if the oath has to be taken, it has more than amenity and clearly there are those who like my brother Mr. Mayo feel that it is only an amenity, but if it is to me more than an amenity, it has got to comport with your belief at that time as to how you govern your future conduct and of course we just believe in that sense."
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1020.064,1032.087,"Back on the same theory, I suppose that lawyers, I disagree with an opinion of a court and yet as the officers of the Court be bound to uphold it?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1032.087,1053.619,"Yes, I agree that we are bound to uphold a court and a judicial system, but we are not required as this oath suggests on one interpretation to necessarily undertake arms or take any other action to physically or even verbally oppose the overthrow of the State or Federal Government which is what part two purports to say."
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1244.768,1247.082,How does it work?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1264.782,1284.085,"I agree that that would clarify, but I feel that it is equally unconstitutional, clearly following the line of such cases as Barnette and West Virginia Board of Education where it was said that consistent with those school children's beliefs in another duty, in another system, they could not be compelled to take the flag salute."
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1295.431,1296.098,Either one?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1296.098,1297.853,Either one.
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1297.853,1308.145,"Well, that it is not your -- it is not the thrust of your argument Mr. Mayo that the vice of this oath lies in its vagueness, unconstitutional vagueness?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1309.024,1311.266,"Yes, it is, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1311.266,1317.422,"Then, I do not understand your answer to my brother White’s question?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1317.422,1319.267,My position essentially is this.
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.068,1331.486,"But, it would not require anymore than one of those things or close to those two things, would it?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1331.486,1337.262,"We would grant your question, Mr. Justice White and to say, alright, this is all the oath does mean."
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1337.262,1340.811,What more could it mean in those two things?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1340.811,1346.082,"I suggest the sliding scale of possibilities, for example."
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1346.082,1353.76,"(Inaudible) that is I mentioned would be one end of the scale and one on the other, is it not?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1353.76,1355.971,With a whole range and a host of possibilities in between.
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1355.971,1358.744,(Voice Overlap) were a constitutional?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1358.744,1364.375,Were a constitutional?
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.254,1370.159,Do you argue those vagueness (Voice Overlap)?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1370.159,1382.115,"I suggest that under this Court’s construction of the cases, none of those things could be required, but I say if the oath read as you have just suggested --"
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1382.115,1384.394,(Inaudible).
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1384.394,1411.288,"Well, in my reading of the cases, I think this Court has frequently talked about both of them as different sides of the same coin, that coin being basically First Amendment freedoms, particularly speech and association and the deterrence which very frequently results when an employee like Mrs. Richardson or anyone else is faced with necessity of taking such an oath."
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1411.288,1418.688,"Do you think “oppose” as declared in their report, I mean, is it anymore vague in the clause?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1418.688,1436.764,"Well, the District Court suggested, as my brother Mayo has said, a range of meanings for “oppose” from actively oppose as to do something to merely refraining from some conduct themselves, to get on the different ends of the spectrum."
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1436.764,1439.429,"What about “support” though, in the first part?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1439.429,1441.797,Support is quite close.
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1450.5,1458.011,"Well, why is that “oppose” anymore vague than “support” which is not constitutionally vague?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1458.011,1473.314,"Well, the line of cases which include Connell and Higginbotham and before that Knight and Ohlson which were both procuring affirmances do not really discuss the question you have read and I admit it is a troubling and puzzling one."
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.153,1518.951,"Mr. Oleskey, you said that (Inaudible) required to take an oath that “I oppose,” would that be contrary or not?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1518.951,1541.58,"I think that “I oppose” would have the same constitutional defect of vagueness, but I suggest that it might be an easier case than “I will oppose” which requires a public employee in Massachusetts to assess somebody else’s conduct, not just his own, not just to govern his own conduct as “I support the constitution” does, but to go out and make a judgment."
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1561.041,1562.844,You are speaking now the second part?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1562.844,1563.425,Yes.
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1563.425,1564.661,After the oath?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1564.661,1565.714,Yes.
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1582.906,1590.501,"I think, it is usually separable in this context when they are divided or separated by “and?”"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1590.501,1591.994,Grammatically it is separable.
1971.70-14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1630.028,1638.304,"Mr. Oleskey, for the offset, I am against “the overthrow of the government.”"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1640.8,1643.273,The entire oath or the second portion?
1971.70-14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1643.273,1649.149,"After the “and,” “and that I am against the overthrow of the government” etcetera?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1649.149,1652.842,I think that would clearly conflict with belief Mr. Justice Marshall.
1971.70-14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1652.842,1653.101,Why?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1653.101,1666.319,Because the person might or might not in fact be against the overthrow consistent with decisions of this Court including the bar admission cases decided last term.
1971.70-14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1666.319,1673.344,"As of this moment, which means that immediately I have not taken my oath, I might change my mind, does it not?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1673.344,1679.066,"But, it does require and compel expression of belief as of that moment (Voice Overlap) which I do not think."
1971.70-14,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1679.066,1679.916,That one moment.
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1679.916,1686.837,"Yes, which I do not think consistent with the First Amendment, it cannot be compelled."
1971.70-14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1686.837,1704.472,"May I ask, if Mrs. Richardson were now asked to take the oath for stopping the word Massachusetts state violating the injunction which the District Court granted?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1704.472,1711.87,I believe that it would Mr. Justice Brennan because I believe that the injunction and the decision both go to the entire oath.
1971.70-14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1711.87,1732.663,What if the decision and the opinion seems to treat the two parts separately and indicate that the first part used in the authority in Knight is constitutional and that revises then the “I will oppose” part.
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1765.511,1780.863,"I think it would, because of the specific language, first of all in the judgment injunction, that Section 14 of chapter 264 violates the First Amendment, not Section 14, Clause 2 of the oath."
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1780.863,1787.439,"What would Massachusetts will be enforcing would no longer be the oath required by Section 14, but a different oath?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1787.439,1793.625,"If the legislature reenacted such an oath, it is conceivable that -- it is obvious that Mrs. Richardson could be again asked to do it."
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1793.625,1800.45,"I guess, what they are really saying is that the injunction is vague?"
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1800.45,1806.504,Do you think there is any impediment to a court amending the oath?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1806.504,1810.631,I think first of all this oath as I suggested is not clearly severable.
1971.70-14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1812.508,1816.574,"You mean that, that is a matter of the Massachusetts legislature?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1816.574,1816.951,Yes.
1971.70-14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1816.951,1820.584,"That said it was, and therefore, it cannot be treated as severable?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1820.584,1822.044,Yes.
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1933.477,1935.919,"That is quite, purely in personal terms."
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1946.542,1979.107,"I agree that it is personal and future, but I do not think that any bar through a prosecutor going out to Mrs. Richardson for violation of at least the second portion if she were found to be a member of a group like the one I suggested, which in fact had as one of its tenants, though she might be unaware of it, or although she might be a passive or inactive member or not even in favor of it as this Court suggested in United States and Noble (ph) decided several years ago, she can still be prosecuted."
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1979.868,1984.817,"But, you say there are some cases holding that?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1984.817,1985.175,I say that --
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1985.175,1986.205,What is your theory for that.
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,1993.143,1999.953,"My proposition is only that, in terms of the words of the oath requiring a future promise of opposition."
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1999.953,2000.994,What she will do in the future?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2000.994,2001.42,Yes.
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2001.42,2002.554,She personally will do?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2002.554,2004.224,Yes.
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2061.902,2069.543,"What do you suggest, what language would you suggest that might meet your standards of clarity and lack of vagueness and lack of broadness?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2069.543,2084.396,The only standards which it would appear to be consistent that this Court has said would be the language of the Connell Oath part one or the language required by the constitution support and uphold.
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2084.396,2095.799,"This is “uphold and defend,” do you think those words have any more precise meaning than the word “oppose,” “Uphold and defend?”"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2095.799,2098.123,I think that support --
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2098.123,2098.838,"Well, that is not in this?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2098.838,2112.94,"-- or uphold have come to be traditional words associated with the kind of minimal residual loyalty which we have decided under the constitution, in fact, in Article 6, Section 3 from the very beginning."
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2128.164,2129.243,But is this a matter of words?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2148.042,2156.479,"I think that uphold or support which have been read by the Court below and by this Court I think is roughly synonymous, have this historical context."
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2161.571,2171.371,"Well, that I thought you told us would be very, very constitutionally invalidated, if you are inquiring about somebody’s beliefs."
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2172.432,2183.676,"If the question were open to me for the first time today, I think I would make a strong argument that support and uphold certainly requires, some affirmation of belief."
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2190.107,2199.885,And that does not involve (Inaudible) “oppose” is a different word?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2199.885,2217.624,"I think in terms of the future conduct, in terms of the number of variance of acquired conduct which the state itself has suggested in three years of this case, that “oppose” appears to be much more illusive for all of us than “support or uphold.”"
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2217.624,2221.563,We will try another one on you then Mr. Oleskey.
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2242.576,2250.681,At least the last part of that “That I will support the Constitution of the United States” clearly does not go any farther than the Connell language or the constitutional language which (Voice Overlap)
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2250.681,2255.531,The language “I will conduct myself uprightly.”
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2255.531,2261.321,It seems to me that is a simple promise of conduct consistent with being an officer of the bar.
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2267.515,2281.348,"Well, if this doctor -- your client were required to take that oath, would you have any trouble with it?(Voice Overlap)"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2281.348,2282.612,I personally would take the oath.
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2284.747,2294.303,"(Inaudible) advise her that there was any difficulty about taking that oath “conduct yourself uprightly” as a physician, a surgeon or whatever she may be?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2294.303,2295.483,I do not think that is what it tells us.
1971.70-14,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2345.254,2349.584,Let me try another one on you.
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2368.591,2379.376,"Well, I think clearly, in light of our discussion in the last half-hour, that becomes a narrower case, particularly it would be use of the word “defend.”"
1971.70-14,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2386.549,2389.36,You see vagueness difficulties.
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2398.289,2412.049,I think I would elude now to my previous conversation with Mr. Justice White and say that there are certain oaths or general terms of support which had been with us since the beginning.
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2412.049,2415.269,"And that certainly is not the only vague provision of the constitution, is it?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2415.269,2418.779,"No, it is not."
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2418.779,2431.139,Justice Blackmun was reading the oath that the Constitution requires of President of the United States to take as you perhaps recognize?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2431.139,2458.508,"I can only suggest again that in all honesty, the range of meanings of word “oppose” when set aside as it is here in Clause 2 and not linked by implication with “support and uphold” as in the Presidential oath that you read does create much greater difficulties both in terms of vagueness and in terms of broadness deterring both speech and association."
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.508,2466.642,"So, you are -- if it is just an oath that says “I will defend the Constitution,” you have no vague problems with that at this point?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2466.642,2472.803,"I think an oath that says “I will defend the Constitution” is quite close to an oath that simply says “I will support the Constitution,” they are really the same."
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.803,2482.389,"And that you would find trouble if it said, “I will defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies and against this overthrow by force and violence.”"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2482.389,2482.732,Yes.
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2482.732,2486.982,Then you have trouble with “defend”?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2486.982,2494.353,"Yes, because I think then we have imported more language."
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.179,2520.173,So really it is the context in which the word “defend” is used?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2520.173,2533.591,"Yes, it can be and I think it is in this oath, although it is particularly the words “oppose the overthrow” with which we find fault in this oath, not the word “defend”."
1971.70-14,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2533.591,2540.081,You are not suggesting that the Article 2 oath became unconstitutional by the adoption of the First Amendment?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2540.081,2540.719,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-14,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2540.719,2543.207,Alright.
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2543.207,2548.121,"Very briefly, in making our brief, I would make today, two other arguments."
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.556,2617.65,(Inaudible) in a three-judge Court?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2617.65,2620.068,The particular problem of --
1971.70-14,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.068,2620.781,No hearing?
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2620.781,2621.222,No hearing.
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2624.076,2638.985,"Is there a provision, either explicit or implicit, that under the statute for somebody who objects to take an oath generally to affirm rather than to take an oath?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2638.985,2642.843,The only provisions in the oath are those finally open it.
1971.70-14,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2646.951,2650.039,"Or affirm, so that is not an issue in the case?"
1971.70-14,1,41833,stephen_h_oleskey,,2650.039,2673.701,"No, it could be an affirmance rather than a swearing, nonetheless as I see it that double penalty under the Massachusetts statute, both for prosecuting for perjury which Section 14 explicitly refers to, and under Section 15 of the same Chapter 264 for violation of the terms of the oath, whatever that may be, still remain."
1971.70-14,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2675.049,2678.53,"Thank you. Mr. Mayo, do you have any comments?"
1971.70-14,2,45544,walter_h_mayo_iii,,2678.53,2680.691,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not have rebuttal."
1971.70-14,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2680.691,2681.81,"Very well gentlemen, thank you."
