2004.03-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,5.367,We'll now hear argument in Van Orden against Perry.
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,7.159,10.381,"Good morning, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,37.213,56.821,"Mr. Chemerinsky, I suppose that opening statement suggests that you think that Thanksgiving proclamations are also unconstitutional, which were recommended by the very first Congress, the same Congress that proposed the First Amendment."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,56.821,58.39,"No, Your Honor, I would--"
2004.03-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,58.39,65.737,"They also refer to one God, to a theistic ruler of the universe."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,65.737,69.164,"--No, Your Honor, I think the Thanksgiving proclamations would be constitutional."
2004.03-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,77.049,77.709,All right.
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,93.851,96.945,"Yes, Your Honor, but it all depends on how it is done."
2004.03-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,113.541,123.117,"I don't know whether that's any more profound or ultrareligious, super religious than the prayer that the chaplain gives every day in the House."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,123.117,133.725,"Your Honor, there is a difference between a prayer that a chaplain gives... in Chambers v. Marsh, this Court emphasized that the prayer by the chaplain was a nonsectarian prayer."
2004.03-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,139.176,140.307,"Well, I mean, I haven't read the prayer."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,149.783,163.613,"--Your Honor, I would be surprised because here, if you look at these commandments, it's that God has claimed that he is the only God, prohibiting idolatry, prohibiting graven images, prohibiting taking the name of the Lord and God in vain."
2004.03-1500,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,171.127,180.908,"Is there any other... I mean, you can continue if you want, but one difference which I've written down is you say that the difference between this and the prayer is that this is more profoundly religious."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,183.759,184.252,No.
2004.03-1500,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,185.366,185.616,That's the difference?
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,200.681,201.341,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1500,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.17,235.028,How about if they're packaged in a museum like setting and there is some interest on the part of the State in preserving something.
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,235.028,236.142,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-1500,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.142,239.28,And displaying a whole variety of things?
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,239.28,244.787,"Of course, there can be Ten Commandments or any religious works as part of a museum setting."
2004.03-1500,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.281,249.517,Is this a kind of a park?
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,255.461,256.742,--It is a park like setting.
2004.03-1500,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,282.665,289.148,"Well, would it be all right, in your view, if they put several others up for different religions?"
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,290.55,297.072,"--If the clear purpose and message was to honor the diversity of religions in Texas, it would then be permissible."
2004.03-1500,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,301.408,302.273,You don't object to that?
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,302.273,303.653,"--Quite the contrary, I think it's a--"
2004.03-1500,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,303.653,306.625,Or the depiction on the door of the Court?
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,306.625,308.444,--Quite the contrary.
2004.03-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.705,317.194,But the prayers in Congress doesn't do that and our Thanksgiving proclamations don't do that.
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,327.985,329.538,"Yes, Your Honor, there is--"
2004.03-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,329.538,332.881,"We don't pray to gods, the prayers are always to God."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,366.583,368.425,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,378.372,384.4,"Mr. Chemerinsky, too, doesn't the venue count?"
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,401.862,403.802,"Of course, Justice Ginsburg, the venue counts."
2004.03-1500,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,417.344,417.594,Okay.
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,430.719,433.857,"Your Honor, I think there is a very different message that's conveyed."
2004.03-1500,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,433.857,434.6,Can it do that?
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,434.6,443.971,"No, Your Honor, it can't post the Ten Commandments by itself in its legislative halls because that would then be the government endorsing expression for support for that message."
2004.03-1500,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,454.541,456.686,But it's so hard to draw that line.
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,468.491,472.373,"--That's right, because the message from the government is quite different."
2004.03-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,511.383,518.236,"Well, you know, in the First Amendment speech area, we're very, very strict."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,540.733,543.667,"Your Honor, I don't believe there should be an obsessive concern with religion."
2004.03-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,556.337,558.566,This is a classic avert your eyes.
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,564.882,566.739,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2004.03-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,577.696,579.471,May I ask you this question.
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,612.415,615.22,"--It would be a harder case, but I don't think it would be an adequate remedy."
2004.03-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,634.827,646.882,"But if the test is whether the reasonable observer would think that the government is endorsing the religious message, wouldn't the disclaimer make it clear to the reasonable observer the government was not endorsing the message?"
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,646.882,663.889,"I think the disclaimer would make it a harder case, but I think when you're dealing with the ground in a Texas State Capitol and the Texas Supreme Court, that placement, when you're dealing with the Ten Commandments, sacred texts, I still think that the message the reasonable observer would be that this is the government endorsing religion."
2004.03-1500,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,663.889,673.344,"At some point, would the State's interest in preserving old objects overcome the objection constitutionally?"
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,673.344,679.576,"Yes, at some point, it could where it was clear to the reasonable observer that it was there because it was an old object."
2004.03-1500,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,679.576,682.093,How did this monument get there?
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,689.235,691.177,The record is unclear as to that.
2004.03-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,704.634,712.929,"Isn't the display on the tablets on the top before you get to the text, before you get to, I am the Lord, thy God."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,716.812,719.534,"I don't know that, Your Honor."
2004.03-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.383,749.877,I thought Muslims accept the Ten Commandments.
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,749.877,760.195,"No, Your Honor, the Muslims do not accept the sacred nature of the Ten Commandments, nor do Hindus, or those who believe in many gods, nor of course, do atheists."
2004.03-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,773.116,787.976,"You know, I think probably 90 percent of the American people believe in the Ten Commandments, and I'll bet you that 85 percent of them couldn't tell you what the ten are."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,813.777,815.097,"I disagree, Your Honor."
2004.03-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,832.724,845.19,"It is a profound religious message, but it's a profound religious message believed in by the vast majority of the American people, just as belief in monotheism is shared by a vast majority of the American people."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,875.738,876.648,"I disagree, Your Honor."
2004.03-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,885.026,895.8,"Well, suppose a non Christian, say a Muslim, comes before a judge who has very strong Christian beliefs, a very religious person."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,913.921,915.119,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1500,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,957.471,971.218,"That's an important point to me, but I don't see any way to get there in these difficult cases without making a practical judgment about whether that's really so."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1043.997,1048.334,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that the test that this Court has formulated do draw those lines."
2004.03-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.714,1111.286,"What about the opening of this Court's session today, in a manner that has been used since John Marshall, is that divisive because there are a lot of people who don't believe in God."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1111.286,1117.974,"Because You Honor, I think that you have to distinguish between minimal religious content and maximum religious content."
2004.03-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1117.974,1137.831,"Mr. Chemerinsky, on that point, how much of the Ten Commandments... I mean, once we get to thou shalt not kill or murder, then there are tenets to govern a society, but how much are strictly about the obligation that man owes to God?"
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1137.831,1148.355,"The first of the two tablets, the first five commandments, Your Honor, and of course religions belief this was written in God's own hand and given to Moses."
2004.03-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1188.729,1205.076,"Well, suppose, Mr. Chemerinsky, it was like Moses on that frieze where there are commandments showing, but there are only the sixth through tenth commandment."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1206.934,1214.243,"Your Honor, if it was Moses on that frieze together with fourteen other symbols, absolutely okay, because it would clear to the reasonable observer--"
2004.03-1500,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1214.243,1225.676,But if we just had the Moses with the tablet that has the instructions for how people will conduct themselves in a civilized society versus worshipping.
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1225.676,1239.135,--I think that would still be unconstitutional between the Texas State Capitol and the Texas Supreme Court because it would still be the State of Texas expressing the message that there is a God and that God has dictated these rules for behavior.
2004.03-1500,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1239.135,1258.741,"Okay, what if you go one step further and there was simply a tablet without any embellishment about source saying, you know, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet, et cetera, basically just the last five commandments, pure and simple."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1261.63,1274.179,"If the tablets were by themselves in that way, between the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas State Capitol, it would be a harder case, but I believe it would still be unconstitutional because those tablets do convey a message that God--"
2004.03-1500,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1274.179,1277.773,"No, I'm just talking about when I... I don't know if I used the word tablet."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1300.64,1302.126,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.194,1311.02,Who are you kidding?
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1347.14,1351.804,"But Your Honor, this Court has emphasized that content and context matter enormously."
2004.03-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1375.293,1379.751,I think you're telling us the State cannot accommodate religion.
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1395.643,1396.386,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1500,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1444.395,1448.111,So the word accommodate should not be within our jurisprudence?
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1448.111,1450.811,Accommodate should very much be in the jurisprudence.
2004.03-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.252,1477.256,Can the State express its support for religion generally?
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1477.256,1479.978,"--Your Honor, it all depends--"
2004.03-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1479.978,1485.901,"Suppose it didn't have the Ten Commandments, it just had a big thing that says religion is good."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1492.96,1495.726,--I don't think that would be a problem under the Establishment Clause because it's minimal--
2004.03-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.726,1498.533,But there are atheists who disagree with that intensely.
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1498.533,1501.959,"--But Your Honor, I'm not arguing for a heckler's veto by atheists."
2004.03-1500,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1518.102,1524.046,Doesn't it matter whether that text has acquired an independent meaning of its own?
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1542.584,1551.129,The Ten Commandments monument by itself conveys the message that the Ten Commandments are the source of law and it's that message the State can't convey.
2004.03-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.275,1554.139,"Yes, you may save your time."
2004.03-1500,0,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,1554.139,1554.777,Thank you.
2004.03-1500,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.777,1557.544,"General Abbott, we'll hear from you, please."
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,1557.544,1560.616,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1609.945,1611.764,May I ask you this question?
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,1623.774,1626.829,"--Justice Stevens, I think that would pose a much greater problem."
2004.03-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.829,1627.778,That's not my question.
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,1636.201,1651.555,"I seriously question whether or not a crucifix would be constitutionally acceptable in that same location, and for the very same reasons which I'm articulating why the Ten Commandments would be acceptable in this location."
2004.03-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.151,1668.273,It's not a secular message.
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,1687.964,1694.158,"Well, Justice Scalia, the Ten Commandments send both a religious message and a secular message."
2004.03-1500,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1695.765,1712.278,"But the district court, I think in this very case, found that commemorating the Ten Commandments' role in the development of secular law was not one of the State's purposes in accepting the monument."
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,1724.045,1728.875,--The Court obviously is correct to accept that finding.
2004.03-1500,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1740.02,1744.479,But you're arguing for something contrary to the district court's finding.
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,1744.479,1763.798,"--I'm actually, Justice O'Connor, arguing for purposes that are in addition to that district court's finding because there was an ongoing purpose to retain this now historical monument that has stood for more than 40 years without controversy on a national and historic landmark."
2004.03-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1763.798,1780.599,"So in another case, if a government official feels that the Ten Commandments have been very, very important in his or her life as a spiritual or religious matter and wants other people to know how important the Ten Commandments are, he cannot accept on behalf of the city the Ten Commandments. And so you can have no Ten Commandments in city A with the Ten Commandments in city B."
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,1805.286,1814.452,"Well, with regard to both purpose and effect in this particular setting, I don't think that religion was the driving force."
2004.03-1500,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1819.404,1842.232,"I suppose that every monument that's on the State Capitol grounds in Texas in a sense conveys a message of State endorsement, State endorsement of the role of servicemen in fighting earlier wars or in support of the Boy Scouts or whatever it might be, doesn't it?"
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,1851.437,1863.576,"If I may clarify an important fact and that is clearly the state of Texas, by displaying 17 monuments in a museum like setting on Capitol grounds, is trying to acknowledge and commemorate certain events."
2004.03-1500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1877.444,1886.899,"Isn't it all the case, as has been pointed out, that no monument is going to be on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol without the approval of the legislature?"
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,1889.128,1889.582,Not at all.
2004.03-1500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1890.158,1896.763,And you don't dispute that anyone going on those grounds would assume that the State government approved it or it wouldn't be there?
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,1896.763,1907.825,"Justice Souter, of course the presumption would be that people on the Capitol grounds would assume the State of Texas wanted those monuments on the Capitol grounds."
2004.03-1500,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1907.825,1917.008,"Well, I'm not sure that that endorsement... in England, there is a square where they have King Charles on one hand... on one end and he's looking at Oliver Cromwell, who beheaded him, on the other."
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,1921.905,1934.286,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I believe that there is a very meaningful difference between this Court's standards of an endorsement and what a State or the nation may do with regard to commemoration."
2004.03-1500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1957.199,1970.984,"But you have to contend with the fact that the district court found that this sort of commemoration of the commandments involved was not the objective in placing the monument there, so you're left basically with a religious text."
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2000.584,2018.333,"--All other factors, though, Justice Souter, as a person who stands in front of that monument clearly recognizes, centered in a specialized scroll is an indication that this was a monument that was dedicated and presented to the people and the youth of the State of Texas by the Fraternal Order of Eagles."
2004.03-1500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2021.676,2038.972,"But you're not trying to withdraw the... I took it to be the concession that of course anyone would reasonably assume that the State of Texas approved this message, and thought it was appropriate to devote state property to its promulgation."
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2038.972,2044.627,Clearly the State of Texas approved the monument being on the grounds--
2004.03-1500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2044.627,2049.456,"But then the fact that the Eagles also approve it doesn't really get us very far, does it?"
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2049.456,2058.085,"--Well, where I believe it gets you, as this Court has recognized, there is a very meaningful difference between acknowledging something and endorsing something."
2004.03-1500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2060.891,2061.634,Let me ask you this.
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2072.507,2084.175,"I think the Eagles' disclaimer on there helps our case but if it were not on there, I think the monument could still stand just as the creche did in Lynch or the menorah in Allegheny."
2004.03-1500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2098.497,2115.959,"What is the... that's one of the problems with the argument, it seems to me, that by putting the Ten Commandments monument on grounds that have lots of other monuments, that the religious message is somehow either diluted or changed."
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2183.25,2195.071,"Well, just as this Court may display in the courtroom itself, Moses with the Ten Commandments amongst law givers, doesn't mean that that is the only way the Ten Commandments--"
2004.03-1500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2195.071,2201.758,"Maybe it doesn't, but I'm trying to find a rationale for the argument that's being made, and that I thought you were alluding to."
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2251.17,2255.34,"--Your Honor, if I may explain with two points."
2004.03-1500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2268.632,2270.284,But what do you do with the district court finding?
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2270.284,2283.387,"Well, the district court finding obviously chose to decide that the secular purpose for the display was to honor the Fraternal Order of Eagles for their commitment to combatting juvenile delinquency."
2004.03-1500,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2295.381,2298.891,You had a second point and I don't want to miss your second point.
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2298.891,2303.926,The second point is that there are other displays in this Court.
2004.03-1500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2318.127,2320.645,They see blank tablets.
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2337.613,2350.738,"Justice Ginsburg, clearly the Ten Commandments that are reflected on the doorway into and out of this courtroom don't have words on them like the tablets do in the State of Texas."
2004.03-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2350.738,2352.224,"But we know what they are, don't we?"
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2352.224,2353.672,We do and that's the point.
2004.03-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2357.675,2360.026,But do we know which version of the Ten Commandments it stands for?
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2361.967,2366.136,--I happen to agree with the Petitioner.
2004.03-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2379.965,2380.997,"And it doesn't matter what the version is, does it?"
2004.03-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.028,2402.711,"General Abbott, would the Texas purpose be equally served if the monument had on it the kind of disclaimer that the city in Wisconsin put on its monument?"
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2402.711,2406.343,"Justice Stevens, I apologize, I'm not familiar with that disclaimer."
2004.03-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2406.343,2407.086,It reads this way.
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2432.804,2437.839,A disclaimer like that would surely ensure that this display is constitutional.
2004.03-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2439.287,2443.206,And would it undermine the message that you legitimately seek to convey?
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2443.206,2444.61,--I don't believe it would.
2004.03-1500,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.61,2447.749,Why don't you do it and we wouldn't have this case?
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2471.421,2494.539,"Well, this Court obviously has decided Establishment Clause cases on a case by case basis, but in this particular instance, the Ten Commandments displayed in a museum like setting on the Capitol grounds arrayed among 17 other monuments, the message that is received by the viewer who is trekking through the Capitol grounds looking at monuments is clearly one not of the State of Texas."
2004.03-1500,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2494.539,2500.483,I've got to get one question before you leave because you're the one who knows the record.
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2538.478,2541.6,The state provides a walking tour guide.
2004.03-1500,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2541.6,2544.034,And the brochure doesn't tell what they are.
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2545.891,2557.287,"Your Honor, Justice Breyer, if I could refer you to page 205 of the joint appendix, it provides a description of each of the monuments on the walking tour."
2004.03-1500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2619.331,2622.607,Is it like how many other monuments?
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2634.396,2637.823,"--Justice Ginsburg, it is actually not clear from the record."
2004.03-1500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2648.021,2667.833,"When you said that every court that has considered this case has said it's compatible with the Establishment Clause, did you mean just this Texas case or other cases involving an Eagles Ten Commandments?"
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2667.833,2679.146,"Justice Ginsburg, my reference was to the fact that every case that has considered the specific... every court that has considered the specific facts of this case, meaning the Texas case--"
2004.03-1500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2679.146,2684.985,So you didn't mean this particular depiction of the Ten Commandments?
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2684.985,2685.29,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-1500,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2735.988,2747.506,Kind of an eclectic museum.
2004.03-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2755.929,2768.394,"General Abbott, I want to thank you for your argument and also for demonstrating that it's not necessary to stand at the lectern in order to a fine job."
2004.03-1500,1,24900,greg_abbott,,2768.848,2769.675,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2004.03-1500,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2769.675,2775.452,Mr. Clement.
2004.03-1500,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2775.452,2783.337,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2827.094,2830.438,Can I ask you to address one thing that troubles me about the case?
2004.03-1500,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2875.186,2877.128,"Justice Stevens, I don't think so."
2004.03-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2952.391,2960.481,"Of course, the other thing that's notable about your listing is most of the examples are examples of displays of the event itself rather than the text."
2004.03-1500,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2969.936,2982.029,"Well, Justice Stevens, I think that quite a few... both types of displays and I think the very fact the Fraternal Order of Eagles put a lot of displays out suggests that a bunch of them are textual displays."
2004.03-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3015.814,3020.272,A symbolic display is less objectionable when quoting the text as this monument does?
2004.03-1500,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3020.272,3025.556,"--Well, Justice Stevens, I would say... my point is not that there are not other ways to display it."
2004.03-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3045.907,3053.503,"Well, except the four commandments and Moses would avoid the differences between the three different versions of the Ten Commandments, whereas when you quote one, you must select one over the other two."
2004.03-1500,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3053.503,3056.188,"Well, I guess I'm not sure that's true."
2004.03-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3063.906,3064.816,Most of them don't.
2004.03-1500,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3064.816,3066.84,"--To be sure, to be sure."
2004.03-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3083.475,3088.305,"General Clement, there is a question I have about the government's position."
2004.03-1500,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3116.13,3120.339,"Justice Ginsburg, I certainly think location and context matters."
2004.03-1500,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3150.886,3152.539,It looks just like this monument.
2004.03-1500,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3167.183,3179.039,"Justice Ginsburg, I think putting it in the rotunda of the court as a stand alone monument, giving it sort of pride of place, if you will, raises a much more difficult question, to be sure, and may well cross the constitutional line."
2004.03-1500,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3190.806,3199.101,And do you think that it should cross the constitutional line under the interpretational theory of the First Amendment you wish us to adopt?
2004.03-1500,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3199.101,3206.986,I think the display that I have in mind in the Alabama Supreme Court probably does cross the constitutional line even under our view.
2004.03-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3266.968,3270.311,What would your comment be on requiring a disclaimer of some kind?
2004.03-1500,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3270.311,3273.283,"--Well, Justice Stevens, two points to make about that."
2004.03-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3284.223,3284.966,It is kind of ambiguous.
2004.03-1500,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3284.966,3293.844,"It is, Justice Stevens, and I'm troubled frankly by the suggestion that they would have to go as far as you suggested they would go under the City of Lacrosse case."
2004.03-1500,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3384.056,3391.964,"Mr. Chereminsky, you have four minutes left."
2004.03-1500,3,22098,erwin_chemerinsky,,3513.45,3391.964,Thank you.
2004.03-1500,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3514.648,3516.505,"Thank you, Mr. Chereminsky."
