1980.80-169,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.498,"We will hear arguments first this morning in United Parcel Service, Incorporated, against William Mitchell."
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,12.043,27.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-169,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,136.883,139.397,"The union, Mr. Segal, did not file?"
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,139.397,140.647,--The union did not file.
1980.80-169,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,140.647,143.161,"And does the judgment stand, then, as to it?"
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,143.161,156.531,"I would suppose that the judgment stands and that the case would be remanded unless this Court were to order otherwise, which on occasion it has done, but very rarely."
1980.80-169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,159.593,161.951,Well the union remains a party to the case though?
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,161.951,163.527,--It is a party to the case.
1980.80-169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,163.527,164.699,"It's a respondent, isn't it?"
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,164.699,167.558,"It is a respondent in the case, just as it has been."
1980.80-169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,167.558,172.087,Well isn't it entitled to file a brief for or against the judgment below?
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,172.087,182.615,"It has done so, we have been in consultation with the union and while I am not here to argue its cause, if the Court should have any questions I would endeavor to answer them."
1980.80-169,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,182.615,187.971,"Well Mr. Segal, if you prevailed, what would be the status of the case against you?"
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,187.971,217.491,"If we prevailed, it would be up to this Court and there have been differences on this Court, as Mr. Justice Brennan, you know, quite recently on this kind of issue, on whether they are divisible, whether they should be divisible, whether the Court should, itself, ordain a rule, if it were finally to get around to what the dissenters most recently said I guess, in the Occidental case."
1980.80-169,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,291.227,292.256,But different?
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,292.256,293.897,But different.
1980.80-169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,302.581,304.111,And the union?
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,304.111,305.83,"And the union, correct."
1980.80-169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,314.732,320.433,Well if we applied that same notion to joint board decisions--
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,320.433,322.698,"--Yes, Mister--"
1980.80-169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,322.698,324.37,--This wasn't arbitration?
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,324.37,330.414,--This was an arbitration in terms of our agreement with the--
1980.80-169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,330.414,333.773,"Well, it was the end of the line, and--"
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,333.773,334.693,"--And it was the end of the line,--"
1980.80-169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,334.693,335.928,--But there was not an independent arbitrator?
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,335.928,341.972,--This Court has expressly stated that a joint panel decision is an arbitration award.
1980.80-169,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,341.972,345.625,"Wasn't that in the Railway Labor Act context though, Mr. Segal?"
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,345.625,359.574,"No, it was... Justice Brennan, it was in a Railway Labor Act, it was in a seaman's case and I have a vague recollection that it was in a teamster case, but I'm not sure."
1980.80-169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,521.899,525.912,Well wasn't Hoosier some time before?
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,525.912,526.99,1960.
1980.80-169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,526.99,531.442,"So it was before Hines, a good deal before Hines?"
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,531.442,531.534,Yes.
1980.80-169,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,561.632,568.864,"Hoosier involved, as I remember, a claim for breach of a collective bargaining contract under Section 301."
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,571.159,573.018,Hoosier?
1980.80-169,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,573.018,573.893,Hoosier.
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,573.893,574.658,Hoosier did not.
1980.80-169,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,574.658,575.58,No.
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,579.922,582.655,"It involved neither arbitration nor conduct that would have been an unfair labor practice, that is--"
1980.80-169,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,582.655,584.576,"Right, merely a breach of a collective bargaining contract."
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,584.576,586.122,"--Right, precisely."
1980.80-169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.852,643.444,"Well Mr. Segal, the 90-day... what's the source of the 90-day--"
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,643.444,645.99,The 90-day is the New York statute--
1980.80-169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.99,646.302,--Yes.
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,646.302,647.909,--applying to arbitration.
1980.80-169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,647.909,654.36,"But you're saying, every district court around the country, they were applying their own state statutes, I take it--"
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,654.36,657.969,"Well Your Honor, around the country, there are 42--"
1980.80-169,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.969,658.312,--Yes.
1980.80-169,0,18058,bernard_g_segal,,658.312,660.64,"--statutes, and 37 of them are--"
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,1762.946,1776.987,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Whatever the statute of limitations may be in a section 301 claim, it is not the statute of limitations to vacate an arbitration award."
1980.80-169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1801.851,1816.862,"Isn't that the... doesn't that permeate the whole structure of federal law on industrial relations, to resolve matters as quickly as possible?"
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,1816.862,1819.048,"--Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1853.595,1858.079,Is that an unfair labor practice on the part of the union?
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,1858.079,1861.016,"It might be construed an unfair labor practice yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1861.016,1878.179,"Well what is it if those two events occur; that the union sells him out and he then has a forum in the courthouse, what is the nature of his action, what is it for and what statute of limitations is it governed by?"
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,1878.179,1886.895,"I believe, Justice Rehnquist, that it's a statutory claim, and I think it's most analogous to a 1983 action under the civil rights law."
1980.80-169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1909.479,1912.977,"But United Parcel Service isn't a state agency, is it?"
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,1912.977,1916.508,"No, but United Parcel Service, Justice Rehnquist, is his employer."
1980.80-169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1920.818,1922.927,"There's no 1983 claim, because--"
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,1922.927,1924.489,"--No, there was no 1983--"
1980.80-169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1924.489,1924.942,--it has to be under color of state law.
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,1924.942,1926.005,"--claim, no, no."
1980.80-169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1928.019,1928.441,"No, it couldn't."
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,1928.441,1945.777,"I'm simply saying that the most analogous situation is that of a 1983 claim where all the Courts have said that the statute of limitations to be applied is the state statutes for a claim upon a statutory claim, which in New York is three years, in other states it might be two years."
1980.80-169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1945.777,1962.895,"Well my question as to whether or not it's an unfair labor practice was prompted by the amicus brief filed in this case by the AFL CIO, which suggests that the proper statute of limitations is that supplied by Section 10(b) of the Labor Act."
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,1962.895,1964.988,"Which would be, I believe, the six month statute."
1980.80-169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1964.988,1965.832,A six month statute.
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,1965.832,1966.535,Which is what they are opting for.
1980.80-169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2009.423,2023.902,"You think it contributes to the... what permeates the whole industrial relations statutory structure, to allow the employee to wait five years and 11 months and then bring a lawsuit of this kind?"
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2023.902,2026.558,"--Well there are two answers to that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2046.252,2048.876,"You mean, applying a laches doctrine against him?"
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2048.876,2050.75,--There could be a laches doctrine precisely.
1980.80-169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2050.75,2052.14,In the face of a six year statute?
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2052.14,2069.727,"If the union can show or the employer can show that an employee had deliberately waited knowing of his right and that the employer had been harmed because it hired other people in the interim, laches might very well be applicable."
1980.80-169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.727,2077.395,"But that's not a contract action, which is traditionally governed by a statute of limitations it's an equitable action that's governed by laches."
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2077.395,2092.389,"No, Your Honor, the actions by the employee against the employer, it is the Plaintiff's position or Mitchell's position, that it would be either a breach of contract action... because the collective bargaining agreement has now been breached."
1980.80-169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2102.808,2112.662,"No, but either one of the two that you mention is the sort of thing that's governed by a traditional statute of limitations and not by any doctrine of laches, isn't it?"
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2112.662,2128.874,"If Your Honor pleases, I didn't say it should be governed by laches, I was responding to the Chief Justice's question as to what happens if an employee waits for six years and I said if he waits properly because there's a valid reason, then the statute would be his cutoff point."
1980.80-169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2133.169,2137.684,"Isn't there a brand new law, statute of limitations?"
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2144.275,2148.539,"Well perhaps laches is the wrong pigeonhole to put it in, Your Honor, but in labor cases--"
1980.80-169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2148.539,2161.908,"I thought that the statute of limitations meant if you filed it within the period of 20 years it's under the statute and you don't have to explain to anybody under any circumstances, am I right?"
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2161.908,2162.424,"--Yes, Justice--"
1980.80-169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2162.424,2162.752,Am I right?
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2162.752,2163.127,--Yes.
1980.80-169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2164.127,2164.846,So where'd you get laches in there?
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2164.846,2170.874,"--trial, the Court could mitigate his damage and say I'm not going to let you recover for waiting 19 years."
1980.80-169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2170.874,2172.952,Give me a case on that.
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2172.952,2175.434,Where there are frequent cases--
1980.80-169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.434,2177.558,"No, cite me one, cite me one."
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2177.558,2179.043,--I'll be happy to--
1980.80-169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2179.043,2181.761,I'll even take a justice of the peace case.
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2181.761,2190.538,"--Where an employee is out of work because he's been discharged and for a year he doesn't get another job when a job is available to him, and sits back."
1980.80-169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2197.331,2200.486,This is a arbitrator-judge... what is this you called this man?
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2200.486,2201.189,--If there was an--
1980.80-169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2201.189,2203.048,I'm talking about a judge-judge.
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2221.76,2224.789,"--I cannot refer, Your Honor, to a case of that nature."
1980.80-169,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2224.789,2226.055,I don't think you can.
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2229.601,2230.958,Laches is an equitable defense.
1980.80-169,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2236.597,2240.361,"--It's not available in a legal action when there's a statute of limitations, as my Brother Marshall suggests."
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2240.361,2241.236,--I agree with--
1980.80-169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2241.236,2245.515,"You're not arguing laches, you're just arguing the duty to mitigate, which reduces the damage claim."
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2246.53,2247.763,"--Yes, that's basically--"
1980.80-169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2247.763,2256.308,"And that assumes you're in Court, that you have passed the statute of limitations bar and now you're talking about damages."
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2256.308,2258.76,--And I believe that he has a right to get to Court.
1980.80-169,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2262.477,2271.629,Would you agree with Judge Timbers' statement in the... for the Second Circuit that six years is not... is a relatively rapid disposition?
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2271.629,2275.19,I believe Justice Timbers took that from this Court's decision in Hoosier.
1980.80-169,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.644,2469.534,I do have a question.
1980.80-169,1,21055,david_jaroslawicz,,2480.919,2482.106,No facts in the complaint.
1980.80-169,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2482.106,2487.058,Very well.
1980.80-169,2,18058,bernard_g_segal,,2488.792,2490.026,"Nothing, if it please the Court."
1980.80-169,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2490.026,2490.995,"Thank you, gentlemen."
