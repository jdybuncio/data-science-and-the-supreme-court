1996.95-1858,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.449,"We'll hear next in No. 95-1858, Dennis C. Vacco, Attorney General of New York, versus Timothy E. Quill."
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,10.449,17.053,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please The Court.
1996.95-1858,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,55.048,66.246,"Well, perhaps a more accurate way of putting your point of view, if I understand, would be that the Equal Protection Clause is not offended by treating those two differently, not that it's not implicated?"
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,66.246,70.008,"The Equal Protection Clause is indeed not offended, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1858,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,78.034,93.255,"Mr. Vacco, instead of going down the list of six, if we could focus on what was of concern to the Second Circuit so we're not talking about a right to withdraw treatment from age 16 to age 96."
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,119.203,127.268,"Justice Ginsburg, simply put, the people that you describe, or that the Second Circuit described, are not similarly situated."
1996.95-1858,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,193.436,205.72,"But, if we had just those two neat categories, this might be an easier case; that is, of pulling the plug, that's the patient's choice, anything affirmative."
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,235.6,238.142,"Justice Ginsburg, in all due respect, I disagree."
1996.95-1858,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,276.47,278.66,--Is that really a correct use of the word sedation?
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,287.996,309.31,"Mr. Chief Justice, as the medical professionals have written in their briefs and even the articles that are alluded to in the various briefs will indicate, the medication that is provided in these limited circumstances is provided only for the very limited effort to control those four symptoms that I articulated."
1996.95-1858,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,309.31,313.314,"Yes, my only question is whether it's properly called sedation or not, or perhaps something else."
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,313.314,318.196,I am taking that terminology and that phraseology from the medical professionals.
1996.95-1858,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,328.104,363.997,"General Vacco, may I ask you, then, to train your attention on what has been described as the worst case, it's been called the barbiturate coma or whatever, that is not in the last hour or hours, what you've just been addressing, but you render a person unconscious, you withdraw nutrition, and water, and it goes on for days and days and the person finally shrivels up and dies, and that that, we're told, is permissible and goes on in hospitals in New York?"
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,363.997,372.672,"Justice Ginsburg, again I believe that the description of this by the Plaintiff Respondents is simply incorrect."
1996.95-1858,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,415.051,422.398,"But the question I'm asking you is, you say you've distinguished the drugs at the last hour or hours of life."
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,440.4,446.114,"Justice Ginsburg, it's rationally distinguishable because it is consistent medical practice."
1996.95-1858,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,455.831,484.191,"--But, when you say it's consistent medical practice, I take it you mean, but if I'm wrong, tell me, I take it you mean that, once you accept the right of a patient to withdraw all life support including hydration and feeding, then the only way to prevent excruciating pain as the person nears death is with these extraordinarily high dosages of painkiller that induce coma."
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,500.033,501.375,"Yes, essentially, Justice Souter."
1996.95-1858,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,502.924,505.155,So it's not merely that the doctors have been doing this.
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,518.716,519.066,--Yes.
1996.95-1858,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,587.082,605.634,"But Mr. Vacco, you don't dispute that a legislature in New York or elsewhere could come to the rational judgment that a legislature in Australia or in Oregon or... I don't know how it came about in the Netherlands, but a rational decision could be made the other way, couldn't it?"
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,605.634,614.891,"--Yes, Justice Ginsberg, indeed we do assert that the State of New York's legislature, if it so chose, could indeed make a judgment in the opposite direction."
1996.95-1858,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,670.49,673.412,"May I ask you, General Vacco, kind of a basic question?"
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,697.188,720.663,"Justice Stevens, I believe that, if the New York State legislature or for that matter the New York State Court of Appeals had decided differently on the issue of refusal of treatment than they have already, that we would be back here in another context discussing the right of an individual to have the ability to refuse treatment."
1996.95-1858,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,720.663,722.245,I'm curious to know what your answer is to the question.
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,722.245,736.734,I don't believe that the legislature of the State of New York could constitutionally prohibit the ability of a patient in the end stages of their life to refuse treatment.
1996.95-1858,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.734,738.857,Just a patient in the end stages of their life.
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,749.816,750.987,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1858,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,750.987,751.188,I see.
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,760.384,763.897,"No, I'm not drawing the same line, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1858,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.897,768.339,I don't know why you want to limit the discretion of the New York legislature that way.
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,768.339,780.656,"The... indeed the discretion of the New York State legislature would only be limited to the, to an individual's right to refuse... right to refuse treatment."
1996.95-1858,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,781.397,785.481,"That's what I'm talking about, an individual who says I'm on a hunger strike, I do not want to be force-fed."
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,785.481,799.279,"--That's a different circumstance than an individual who is by virtue of medical treatment being force-fed, by virtue of some tubes that are implanted into his person."
1996.95-1858,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,818.392,826.61,It seems odd that your bodily integrity is violated by sticking a needle in your arm but not by sticking a spoon in your mouth.
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,835.383,851.706,"--Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, indeed this Court said in Cruzan that, in the context of an individual who is otherwise healthy, that the State need not stand by neutrally in the face of somebody who is attempting to commit suicide."
1996.95-1858,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,899.419,902.491,"General Vacco, if you could be more precise about who is the we that you are talking about."
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,922.515,932.413,"The decision that I speak to in the context of the example that I posed is a decision of the New York State Court of Appeals, but it's not inconsistent, for instance, with legislation--"
1996.95-1858,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,932.413,935.115,What was that decision and who did it affect?
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,935.115,945.803,"--That decision affected a prisoner in the state correctional facility who was indeed on a hunger strike, announced a hunger strike for the purposes of committing suicide and he wanted to starve himself."
1996.95-1858,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,945.803,951.767,"Well, how about a person with terminal kidney disease and says I'm not going on dialysis."
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,959.126,961.287,"No, Justice O'Connor, New York cannot."
1996.95-1858,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,981.111,985.983,"We're not talking about what you do, I'm talking about what you may do."
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,1004.369,1006.159,I am suggesting--
1996.95-1858,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1006.159,1009.652,The Consititution is what is sensible and good; is that right?
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,1015.168,1020.872,"--Justice Scalia, in the context of equal protection, the Constitution says that the state may do what is rational."
1996.95-1858,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1039.453,1053.444,"Is that the reason you draw the line ultimately between ending the life support and the affirmative act of giving the pill, is it essentially a line that depends on the argument for risk of abuse?"
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,1053.444,1063.921,"--Justice Souter, in all due respect, I believe that the line was drawn much longer ago than the time that the notion of assisted suicide--"
1996.95-1858,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1063.921,1066.252,I grant you that it was.
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,1077.28,1086.166,"--The principal... yes, the principal justification indeed, one of the most compelling reasons, state interest, is the risk of abuse."
1996.95-1858,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1089.288,1115.525,"Well, why isn't there a risk of abuse that those who might stand to profit or at least themselves risk further discomfort by an early death for a person on life support will try to coerce or persuade that person to end life support when it really isn't a voluntary decision, why isn't that a risk?"
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,1115.525,1122.761,"--Justice Souter, there is no question that in certain instances there is an overlapping of the risk of abuse."
1996.95-1858,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1130.107,1136.101,"Is it far greater with respect to those who, in fact, are truly terminally ill?"
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,1141.374,1144.386,"--It's for both reasons, in our estimation."
1996.95-1858,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1157.082,1176.878,"What about the risks on the other side, that even the American Medical Association recognizes; that is, this gray area in between makes doctors fearful of putting people out of pain because they don't know whether that's going to constitute physician-assisted suicide or accepted relief of pain?"
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,1180.488,1188.455,"It's a minimal risk, Justice Ginsburg, because we can indeed treat virtually all forms of pain."
1996.95-1858,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1204.914,1219.804,What if what's given is some form of sedation and the person has asked to be relieved of life support systems and so the sure consequence of sedation will be an earlier death?
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,1219.804,1231.032,"Then, Justice O'Connor, if the purposes of that sedation is to bring about the death as opposed to treating the symptoms of the pain--"
1996.95-1858,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1231.032,1236.758,It's to alleviate pain but with the certain knowledge that it will hasten the death?
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,1236.758,1250.025,"--In the context of treating the pain, even though there is a risk of death, pursuant to the principle of double effect, that is not criminal conduct in the State of New York."
1996.95-1858,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1250.025,1251.347,"Thank you, General Vacco."
1996.95-1858,0,21653,dennis_c_vacco,,1251.347,1252.185,Thank you.
1996.95-1858,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.185,1255.047,"General Dellinger, we'll hear from you."
1996.95-1858,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1255.047,1287.609,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please The Court, the issue that is raised with more saliency in New York is that even if the state may, as a general matter, legitimately prohibit the granting of lethal medication, the fact that these state permit practices that are in the Respondents' view medically, ethically, and morally indistinguishable from lethal medication requires that these states also do that."
1996.95-1858,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1317.198,1331.267,"So I take it the example or the hypothetical, taken either way, that we're considering, is a person... consider that the asset, is a terminally ill person on a life support system."
1996.95-1858,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1351.152,1352.371,That is correct.
1996.95-1858,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1352.371,1368.232,"And you support that distinction based on these other factors; namely, the long-standing tradition against permitting suicide?"
1996.95-1858,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1368.232,1369.935,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
1996.95-1858,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1384.454,1401.854,"Well, could we put this in the framework of the position, General Dellinger, that you have taken here, which is that there is some recognizable liberty interest, and how does that affect the analysis under an equal protection approach?"
1996.95-1858,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1411.051,1423.41,"I think it does, even in an equal protection context, ask for something more than a merely plausible explanation."
1996.95-1858,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1424.782,1427.544,"More than a rational basis, I think that's the term."
1996.95-1858,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1427.544,1437.571,"--More than a rational basis, yes, and by that I meant... yes, more than a rational basis, and by that I meant that sometimes the rational basis test seems to be a little tougher than others."
1996.95-1858,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1438.97,1448.137,So what test is it that you say this Court should apply in the equal protection context?
1996.95-1858,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1448.137,1458.715,"--In the equal protection context, I think at most this Court should apply something on the order of an intermediate scrutiny."
1996.95-1858,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1481.07,1497.15,"Well, what about the hypothetical that I put, patient A is going to have 10 to 20-day lingering, painful death; patient B in exactly the same position wants to unhook the life system and have the lethal dose?"
1996.95-1858,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1512.44,1527.881,"Justice Kennedy, the historic distinction between killing someone and letting them die is so powerful that we believe that it fully suffices here."
1996.95-1858,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1527.881,1529.721,I could agree with that.
1996.95-1858,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1532.174,1533.404,I agree.
1996.95-1858,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1533.404,1544.862,"But doesn't the strong historical distinction which you mentioned, aren't you suggesting that if you did need heightened scrutiny, that would help the thing pass it?"
1996.95-1858,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1544.862,1546.354,"Yes... yes, of course."
1996.95-1858,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1546.354,1556.572,"Do you agree with your cocounsel in this case that, in fact, it also reflects a difference in risk assessment?"
1996.95-1858,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1556.572,1557.353,That is true.
1996.95-1858,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1579.398,1582.431,--So then what happens under your analysis?
1996.95-1858,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1665.125,1687.491,"Justice Breyer, I believe that that would strengthen a state's concern about introducing lethal medication into such a medical system, that is, that they... if the need of the medical system is to further the process that the medical associations contend is ongoing of enhancing palliative care, enhancing--"
1996.95-1858,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1687.491,1697.686,"Suppose they don't, suppose they just don't do it, you have 25 percent now, suppose that number keeps going up, then suppose New York changes its law about the double effect?"
1996.95-1858,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1697.686,1723.104,"--The state in our view is entitled to think that introducing lethal medication into a system is... puts an even greater risk on those who are... particularly those who are poor and those who are handicapped, an even greater risk if that system is decreasing the amount of palliatives."
1996.95-1858,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1774.181,1788.951,"General Dillinger, if you could deal with the argument that's been made about winks and nods, that all of this is really a great sham because physician-assisted suicide goes on for anybody who is sophisticated enough to want it."
1996.95-1858,1,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1788.951,1796.888,"Judge Ginsburg, I simply... we looked and we don't know what the evidentiary basis is for that."
1996.95-1858,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1847.396,1848.808,"Thank you, General Dellinger."
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1850.787,1859.563,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please The Court."
1996.95-1858,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2080.163,2087.098,"That wasn't the basis of the Second Circuit's ruling, was it, that Mark Chapman could be force-fed?"
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2087.098,2095.043,"Well, the Second Circuit, Mr. Chief Justice, did base its ruling on the equal protection principle that Mark Chapman, I think helps me illustrate."
1996.95-1858,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2097.187,2117.299,"They didn't talk about that particular provision, they said you can't distinguish between... as I understand their opinion, you can't distinguish between a removal at the patient's instance of life support mechanisms and asking for a lethal dose?"
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2120.481,2124.634,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's true it had nothing to do with that particular fellow."
1996.95-1858,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2192.278,2214.481,"So you disagree, Mr. Tribe, if I understand it, with counsel for Respondent in the prior case, who asserted that it was not only rational but that there is a Constitutional line between suicide of those who are at the threshold of death and the suicide of the young and healthy but despondent."
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2214.481,2216.094,"No, Justice Scalia, I did not say--"
1996.95-1858,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2216.094,2216.765,That's what I thought you were saying--
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2216.765,2217.193,"--Well, can I--"
1996.95-1858,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.193,2219.015,"--that it's irrational, but it can make an exception between--"
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2219.015,2221.839,"--No, Justice Scalia, it's not irrational--"
1996.95-1858,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.839,2222.328,--Tell me why.
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2222.859,2241.261,"--Because for purposes of defining a particular liberty, recognizing a greater freedom to decide this amount of agony is enough, it may make a difference whether someone is dying or healthy and just temporarily disabled."
1996.95-1858,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2315.57,2315.901,--Excuse me.
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2338.28,2338.551,--No.
1996.95-1858,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2361.144,2363.334,"I see, you just object to the taking out of the tube."
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2367.317,2367.527,--in the first place.
1996.95-1858,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2367.527,2368.369,--you would have no problem with that?
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2368.369,2369.11,I think there I--
1996.95-1858,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2369.11,2370.049,--you would have no problem with that?
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2370.049,2370.7,--I think that's right.
1996.95-1858,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2412.277,2438.677,"But, Mr. Tribe, the whole solution now you've given us, I think, in your answer to Justice Scalia, New York could say and be perfectly compatible with equal protection, as you've just described it, person who is terminally ill, you've got to make the choice now before we give you the life support, you have a right to refuse it, but once you've accepted it, you have no right to have it taken out."
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2448.542,2450.692,"--No, I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.95-1858,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2465.384,2467.775,"That's one of the problems, isn't it?"
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2469.675,2477.279,"If I can get to it, I'll try to discuss how one might deal with that, but if I might just stick with equal protection for a moment."
1996.95-1858,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2500.837,2516.075,"--Well, I suppose it's based on the distinction between allowing events to take their own course and third-person intervention, which the law has recognized in the law of torts and in most of its other substantive areas for centuries."
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2516.075,2519.507,"--Justice Kennedy, none of these patients is in a state of nature."
1996.95-1858,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2526.884,2527.104,Yes.
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2541.403,2544.204,--If I could explore nature just for a moment.
1996.95-1858,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2636.268,2647.455,"Well, Mr. Tribe, if we go into this sort of intricate analysis of state law in order... in accepting... we won't be deciding any case except New York's here."
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2659.423,2664.648,"--Well, The Court did say that in that case that the prison context did not determine the outcome."
1996.95-1858,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2675.544,2676.605,--How then do you react?
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2721.477,2727.131,"Well, Justice Breyer, my answer is in part equal protection and in part Judge Calabrese."
1996.95-1858,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2739.682,2744.525,I would be interested in your definition of the liberty interest as well.
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2744.525,2745.416,--I'll try.
1996.95-1858,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2834.049,2841.093,What do you mean... do you mean nothing more by terminal sedation than the sedation of those who are terminal?
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2841.093,2842.955,"--Oh, much more, yes, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1858,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2909.673,2919.3,"Well, Mr. Tribe, you say they've fallen into it and you referred in answering Justice Breyer a moment ago to the state laboratories operating with the lights out."
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2949.427,2953.341,"Well, I thought it had a lot of punch to begin with."
1996.95-1858,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2962.627,2966.009,But do they have less light than we do?
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2966.009,2966.97,"No, not at all."
1996.95-1858,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3013.449,3028.98,"But the New York report, and perhaps this will get you to the autonomy interest and it bridges what Justice Breyer and Justice Souter suggested, that we're just beginning to get a public awareness and to find out much more about these things."
1996.95-1858,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3217.337,3222.229,"Mr. Tribe, that's a discrete situation."
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3239.252,3241.042,They already have it unfortunately.
1996.95-1858,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3241.042,3253.451,"But the moment this Court says, liberty interest is broad enough to cover the terminally ill, we don't define what that is, there is no law."
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3264.588,3282.34,"It seems to me, Justice O'Connor... oustice Ginsburg, that the methodology of equal protection... sorry... that the methodology of equal protection does mean that any line would be subject to meaningful scrutiny."
1996.95-1858,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3304.595,3308.977,But that is what... how many legislatures have.
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3314.029,3314.27,--No.
1996.95-1858,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3317.972,3318.473,"Yeah, but they recommended that."
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3341.88,3343.062,"--Well, but that's--"
1996.95-1858,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3343.062,3356.98,"And suppose the legislature comes to us and says, hey, that's what we want and that's the reason we're more interested in people dying without suffering, we've looked at this information, we think this is the way to do it, just the way they recommended in the report."
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3358.522,3367.107,"--Well, I think, if one were a legislator, one might look at that report and say, you know, there is no better line, we're going to stick with it."
1996.95-1858,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3383.469,3388.562,"Well, why on earth would it be any different unless you would buy Justice... Judge Calabrese's idea?"
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3388.562,3393.387,"Well, by the tone of your question, I guess I'm supposed to say I thought it was a crazy idea, but I didn't."
1996.95-1858,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3413.939,3421.253,"That's traditional equal protection jurisprudence though, but this idea of can I send it back for a second look, do you really want to do this?"
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3423.864,3427.428,"--Well, it looks different, I grant you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1858,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3444.448,3450.442,"Sort of a legislative process requirement in the Constitution, legislative due process?"
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3461.574,3463.664,--I thought you joined Justice O'Connor's opinion in Croson.
1996.95-1858,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3463.664,3465.584,"I didn't mean to do that, that was a mistake."
1996.95-1858,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3468.118,3503.281,"I think that it does make... I think that, when one concludes... in an area as profoundly difficult as this, when one concludes that something is Constitutionally doubtful, and when it came about by kind of inadvertence, that is, various things being subtracted from an existing piece of legislation, it's a little bit like a law that looks suspect and that doesn't have behind it the kinds of findings by the government that could satisfy--"
