2006.05-1126,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.702,We'll hear argument first today in Bell Atlantic Corporation vs. Twombly.
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,6.57,9.272,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,89.391,93.526,"Well, but isn't the next sentence, the substance of the sentence is"
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,117.557,118.907,"It does not, Your Honor."
2006.05-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,118.907,119.407,It does not?
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,119.407,120.843,It does not state a claim.
2006.05-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,120.843,128.513,"I mean, you could leave out everything before plaintiff, the part you quoted, that's not part of the declaration in the sentence."
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,134.853,138.655,"The sentence recites the language of the Sherman Act, that is correct."
2006.05-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,142.173,150.213,"It's got the language of the Sherman Act, a conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their respective telephone and/or high speed markets."
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,154.915,170.14,"--It is true that they have described the alleged conspiracy, but what Dura, Associated General Contractors, and other cases of this Court require is a statement of facts that warrants the legal conclusion that the plaintiffs wish to--"
2006.05-1126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,170.14,179.132,"Mr. Kellogg, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure assiduously avoid using the word fact throughout."
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,202.161,216.138,"--Your Honor, every case of this Court dealing with pleading standards has indicated that it is not sufficient merely to recite a legal conclusion, and claim an entitlement to relief therefore."
2006.05-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,221.892,230.948,"But Mr. Kellogg, that's not a legal conclusion, it's an allegation of fact that there was an agreement to prevent competitive entry into respective markets."
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,236.468,245.407,"--Your Honor, in the context in which this claim is made, the allegation of agreement or conspiracy is not a statement of fact."
2006.05-1126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,268.69,270.642,But negligently drove.
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,278.545,295.19,"--That is correct, Justice O'Connor, but you have a direct context... Justice Ginsburg, you had a direct context in which an eyewitness participant in the event is claiming negligence on behalf of the driver of the car."
2006.05-1126,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,306.815,310.183,"But you do have a case... anywhere, forget antitrust."
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,323.274,325.209,"I do not think so, because I don't think--"
2006.05-1126,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,325.209,325.759,All right.
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,337.25,337.717,--Yes.
2006.05-1126,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,337.717,339.702,--Either is valid or is not valid.
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,346.506,356.831,"I would cite, for example, the Court's decision in the Papasan case, where the plaintiffs claimed that they were not getting a minimally adequate education."
2006.05-1126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,367.603,371.34,"But of course, there the legal standard was not clear."
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,385.767,386.7,"Well, I think Dura is--"
2006.05-1126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,386.7,387.683,And that's the way I read Dura.
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,387.683,390.219,--I think Dura is an exact analogy.
2006.05-1126,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,410.732,415.786,"You can get into trouble by alleging too much, I guess, because if you allege a lot, you might leave something out."
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,429.86,430.912,That would not provide--
2006.05-1126,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,430.912,432.712,"Well, why not?"
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,432.712,434.664,--The grounds upon which the claim is based.
2006.05-1126,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,434.664,438.616,So the only thing that's missing there are some facts.
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,438.616,442.703,Some facts indicative that the defendant is responsible for the--
2006.05-1126,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,442.703,443.053,All right.
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,446.071,446.888,--Absolutely.
2006.05-1126,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,446.888,451.042,"Well, I thought you were also making a different argument."
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,513.116,515.15,Our position would not be different.
2006.05-1126,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,531.327,538.915,"So that would not be good enough, but are you saying that this is worse because, in effect, they have gone some steps towards specification."
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,545.069,551.075,--It is certainly true that all they have alleged is conduct from which they seek to draw an inference of conspiracy.
2006.05-1126,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,555.277,561.347,And you're saying that inference cannot be drawn from the particular facts that they have alleged.
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,561.347,562.031,That is correct.
2006.05-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.248,598.472,"Of course, that may be true on summary judgment, you may be dead right on the merits, but are you telling me that an allegation that the defendants have agreed not to compete with one another is not a statement of fact?"
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,598.472,600.139,I am.
2006.05-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.34,607.911,"Well, what if they said they agreed in writing not to compete with one another, would that be sufficient?"
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,613.565,616.933,--If there were a specific context and they said--
2006.05-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,616.933,626.039,"If they said they have agreed orally not to compete with one another, would that be a statement of fact, an allegation of fact?"
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,626.039,626.523,--Yes.
2006.05-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.206,629.241,Then why did you leave the words orally out?
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,631.527,641.483,"--Because the plaintiffs here were very careful, in light of Rule 11, not to make any direct allegations of conspiracy, not to suggest that there was a time and place--"
2006.05-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,641.483,645.1,"But that's a direct allegation of conspiracy, that very statement."
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,645.1,648.571,--But they make it clear in that paragraph that it's an inference.
2006.05-1126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.571,657.927,"They make it fairly clear that they may only have the evidence of parallel conduct that you describe, and that may not be sufficient, and maybe for that reason, you get a summary judgment."
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,662.462,666.014,I'm saying that it's not sufficient to state a claim.
2006.05-1126,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,677.306,690.231,"Now you're, that's the part precisely which you're following that I don't, that I actually don't know, is the extent to which you have to put in a complaint, in whatever field of law, you can allege a fact."
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,693.6,694.083,--Yes.
2006.05-1126,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,694.083,697.635,"--Or you say, they treated me negligently."
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,724.553,730.273,"Well, ordinarily in a complaint like that, you could file a 12(e) motion and ask for more specificity."
2006.05-1126,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,730.873,731.992,"Well, why couldn't you do the same?"
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,731.992,736.444,"--Our problem with the current complaint is not a lack of specificity, it's quite specific."
2006.05-1126,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,749.604,761.412,"Oh, but they're... they're using the fact that there was parallel behavior as a basis for thinking there was more than parallel behavior."
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,778.021,778.621,That's correct.
2006.05-1126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,790.429,795.083,Wasn't that a summary judgment case and hadn't there been discovery before?
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,796.835,797.618,That is correct.
2006.05-1126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.727,816.945,"They just have to say orally, I wish you would reconsider that?"
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,856.804,860.789,--I... I should not agree to that.
2006.05-1126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,885.423,898.914,"So in the negligently drove case, the plaintiff negligently drove over... the defendant negligently drove over the plaintiff, if it's not specific as to time and place it must be dismissed?"
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,903.218,905.734,"--Well certainly, Form 9 is very specific."
2006.05-1126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,909.269,911.002,What if it does say within the last 10 years.
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,911.002,914.59,"I don't think that's sufficient, Your Honor."
2006.05-1126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,916.023,921.16,"Do you have a case, do you have a case I can look to that tells me that?"
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,921.16,931.199,"--With a negligence case a 12(e) motion could then specify the actual time and place, but the plaintiffs here have had ample opportunity to amend their complaint to supplement."
2006.05-1126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.673,947.477,Did you seek a more specific statement?
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,947.477,948.394,"We did not, Your Honor."
2006.05-1126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,948.394,949.444,Why not?
2006.05-1126,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,953.798,962.504,"Well again the whole way this was litigated below by the plaintiffs was that they, they acknowledged they had no specifics."
2006.05-1126,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,977.263,978.579,"Thank you, Mr. Kellogg."
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,993.456,996.408,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-1126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1023.475,1026.926,"What do you mean can be held, can be thought to hold that?"
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1030.045,1048.256,"Well there are certain portions of the decision that talk about a plausibility requirement but when it turns to the specific area of a Section 1 complaint and a complaint alleged on parallel conduct, I agree with you, Justice Scalia, that that's the only interpretation I can draw from that passage."
2006.05-1126,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1060.064,1099.789,"Well, is that really what they... I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that the, that the Court spoke of no set of facts, only on the assumption that there had been a pleading which did raise a plausible, possible inference of forbidden conduct, and I thought the Court was saying if the, if the plausibility criterion has been satisfied, then the only way that the defendant can get a dismissal is by showing that there is no set of facts which would actually support the action."
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1128.625,1136.981,"Well, Justice Souter, I read that passage of the Second Circuit decision as not expressly referencing the plausibility requirement."
2006.05-1126,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1174.523,1180.593,"So, so that if plausibility is the standard this does not meet the standard of plausibility, that's your argument?"
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1180.593,1195.57,"Well, we prefer the formulation that, from the Court's opinion in Dura that says that the facts need to demonstrate some reasonably founded expectation that there is an unlawful agreement within the meaning of Section 1 of the Sherman Act."
2006.05-1126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1195.57,1199.072,And some parallel action would indicate that wouldn't it?
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1213.481,1214.914,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.497,1221.235,"So you're, you're not saying that parallel action can never create this, this kind of--"
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1221.235,1222.035,That is correct.
2006.05-1126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.145,1294.013,"It's clear it's not sufficient to prove it, but is it admissible evidence?"
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1294.013,1298.501,It may be admissible evidence but depending on the facts and circumstances--
2006.05-1126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1298.501,1304.821,"Should a plaintiffs's complaint fail because it includes unnecessary, verbose, admissible evidence?"
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1304.821,1305.338,--No.
2006.05-1126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1311.242,1316.127,Is not it an allegation that they've agreed not to compete with one another an allegation of fact?
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1316.127,1326.434,"--It is a combined question of law and fact in our view, because as I said the Section 1 law limits the kinds of facts that can be used to establish an agreement."
2006.05-1126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.703,1330.836,But they have alleged more.
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1332.655,1338.642,"--But as paragraph 51 of the complaint is, as you were discussing, in some ways even worse."
2006.05-1126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1343.861,1344.729,--But what if it didn't?
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1356.787,1365.542,And that is not sufficient because in our view the complaint needs to allege some facts that demonstrate a basis for believing there was an unlawful agreement within--
2006.05-1126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1365.542,1380.069,"What if the complaint in addition to that alleged that up to a certain date, it was unlawful for the companies to compete with one another but the law was changed and after that change took place they were advised by their lawyers they could compete, but they agreed not to."
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1381.252,1382.002,--No.
2006.05-1126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1388.422,1395.009,But Justice Stevens's question was that the allegation was that after that date they agreed not to compete.
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1398.361,1399.128,--No.
2006.05-1126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1413.303,1425.945,"Can they say on the 14th of January, 2004, we believe that in the city of New York, they agreed upon this course of action?"
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1427.711,1434.449,That may be sufficient because it is providing enough facts to give you a reason to believe that the plaintiff has a basis for--
2006.05-1126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1434.449,1438.086,"Well, it's saying, all I've done is limited it in time and space."
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1451.66,1452.943,"--Well, and it... you... you--"
2006.05-1126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1452.943,1453.445,Isn't it?
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1453.445,1454.662,--It needs to allege enough specifics--
2006.05-1126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1454.662,1457.414,"Well, look, the one I just alleged in the tort law is a complaint."
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1459.432,1460.899,--I want to be clear--
2006.05-1126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1460.899,1462.201,Am I right or not?
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1462.201,1465.736,--The facts allege need to be specific enough to suggest--
2006.05-1126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1465.736,1467.036,"Well, I understand the standard."
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1467.036,1467.403,--Yes.
2006.05-1126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1467.403,1472.256,I want to know how to apply the standard and now I take my tort case--
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1472.256,1472.74,Yes.
2006.05-1126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1472.74,1479.11,"--which is okay, and now I say sometime during the last 10 years he drove negligently and injured me."
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1480.412,1482.864,In my view that's probably insufficient--
2006.05-1126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1482.864,1490.551,"And so you're saying that this case is like that, when because they don't say when they met, they don't say what happened, they don't give a time or place."
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1519.97,1523.256,--I believe that this Court's decision in Dura Pharmaceutical--
2006.05-1126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1523.256,1524.108,Dura is still the best.
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1527.326,1527.793,--You did--
2006.05-1126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1527.793,1530.862,I'm not drawing total comfort from it.
2006.05-1126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1539.151,1540.251,"Mr. Barnett, I thought--"
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1540.251,1543.17,--I thought our brief lists cases that go to that point.
2006.05-1126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1543.17,1550.426,"--Mr. Barnett I thought you had, you had said that you don't need to indicate the particular day of the agreement."
2006.05-1126,1,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,1573.022,1576.993,"Well, it does provide notice that... this is a fairly low threshold."
2006.05-1126,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1596.404,1599.089,"Thank you, Mr. Barnett."
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1602.474,1624.64,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: There are four essential dimensions to the problem that's before the Court and on every one of those dimensions the guidance that the Solicitor General gave in its amicus brief in the Swierkiewicz case is 180 degrees opposite the guidance that the Solicitor General is providing in its amicus brief in this case.
2006.05-1126,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1661.563,1663.765,Now you're reading from the Swierkiewicz brief?
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1663.765,1666.301,--From the Swierkiewicz Solicitor General brief.
2006.05-1126,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1670.369,1672.805,"Well, i mean, you know, that's shame on them."
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1701.89,1706.961,"--There's a big difference between... the answer is I don't know, perhaps."
2006.05-1126,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1706.961,1707.861,Perhaps?
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1707.861,1708.478,Perhaps.
2006.05-1126,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.716,1722.234,The agreement happens at one moment in time.
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1722.234,1723.32,"--Oh, it could happen in many moments."
2006.05-1126,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1723.32,1725.22,"Meetings of the minds, meeting of the minds."
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1730.324,1746.6,"But what the Second Circuit said on this point, and I submit that the Second Circuit was correct, was that the complaint does set forth the temporal and geographic parameters of the alleged illegal activity and the identities of the alleged key participants, and I think that's correct."
2006.05-1126,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1746.6,1748.936,But where does it set forth agreement?
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1748.936,1750.971,It alleges--
2006.05-1126,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1750.971,1759.426,"Temporal, geographic, the identities, but where does it set forth anything evincing an agreement other than the allegation of parallel conduct?"
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1759.426,1769.782,"--It alleges that there was an agreement, but it doesn't prove that there was an agreement because proving the facts alleged is not a plaintiff's burden in the complaint."
2006.05-1126,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1769.782,1775.636,"Do you have any, is there an allegation of an agreement apart from the parallel conduct?"
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1775.636,1776.205,Yes.
2006.05-1126,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1776.205,1777.771,And what does that consist of?
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1777.771,1806.39,"The leading plus factor that's generally used in, in the Matsushita context, in the Monsanto context, is action that would have been against the self-interest of the conspirators in the absence of a conspiracy, and this complaint alleges very clearly that the conduct of not entering into one another's territories and competing among the ILECs as a CLEC was contrary to what would have been--"
2006.05-1126,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1806.39,1823.35,"So it states... would it state an antitrust violation if had you a grocery store on one corner of the block and a pet store on the other corner of the block and you say, well, the grocery store is not selling pet supplies and they could make money if they did, therefore that's an antitrust violation?"
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1823.35,1827.721,"--If that conspiracy were implausible, if it made no sense."
2006.05-1126,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1827.721,1829.423,That's all the facts that are alleged.
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1829.423,1853.221,"Right, but the Second Circuit standard and the standard we defend is that if someone alleges a conspiracy I that just makes no sense because it's obvious from the face of the complaint that the alleged conspirators aren't in the same product market, not in the same geographic market or something of that kind, there is no conceivable motive for them to enter into the kind of conspiracy at hand, the complaint can be dismissed."
2006.05-1126,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1853.221,1863.411,"If my case, the gasoline, oil prices fell, but I happen to know there were four gasoline shops near each other, gasoline stations, and they didn't cut their prices."
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1865.096,1865.613,Yes.
2006.05-1126,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1865.613,1870.081,"Well, then that's the economy, and you can go sue half the firms in this economy."
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1891.944,1912.19,"Well, Justice Breyer, in the NHL case, the National Hockey League case, which is one of the cases that the petitioners relied upon for a circuit conflict to get here, what the court said is that allegations that defendant's action taken independently would be contrary to their economic self-interest will ordinarily tend to exclude the likelihood--"
2006.05-1126,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1912.19,1948.464,"Ordinarily, if you take that sentence and read it for how you're reading, a consciously parallel action is a violation of Sherman Act section 2, then we have that radical change that many have advocated for the last 40 or 50 years, that half the economy is in violation, because in any concentrated industry, after all, it is in the interest of a firm to cut prices and to make a large market unless he knows his three competitors will also keep prices up."
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,1961.621,1965.073,"--Well, Justice Breyer, we don't just allege conscious parallelism."
2006.05-1126,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1966.008,1993.742,"I know that, but if in fact all you have to do in order to bring a price-fixing case and get into discovery is to allege conscious parallelism and then add without further foundation, and we think there was a real agreement too, but there's nothing other than the conscious parallelism to back it up, now we've got just what I said, with the exception you might not win at the end of the day."
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2002.614,2017.174,"--Well, Justice Breyer, the difference between that, a critical difference between that scenario and what we have alleged in this complaint is that we do allege in great detail that not entering into one another's territories would have been contrary to the interests of--"
2006.05-1126,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2017.174,2026.13,"But that does not help you with respect to the other claim, the claim that there was a conspiracy to prevent upstart competitors from coming in."
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2047.16,2057.418,"--As to that aspect of the case, paragraph 50 does allege two plus factors, but they are essentially allegations of common motive, which is a less strong, I'll grant you--"
2006.05-1126,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2057.418,2066.357,"Yes, but a common, isn't the common motive consistent, just as consistent with no agreement as with agreement?"
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2071.208,2091.906,"--The important thing as to that aspect of the conspiracy is the Continental case in this Court, which said that you're not supposed to dismember... it's an inappropriate way to approach a conspiracy to dismember it, look at one piece of it in isolation, evaluate it as though it's by itself and then wipe the slate clean at the end of that analysis, and that's essentially what the other side is trying to do repeatedly."
2006.05-1126,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2091.906,2113.087,"No, what the other side is saying is that simply by alleging parallelism when it would be in the interest of each of the alleged conspirators to do just as you claim they are doing in the absence of an agreement, you have not alleged something that gets to the threshold of plausibility."
2006.05-1126,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2114.204,2138.053,"I think, by the way, that that argument applies not just to the keeping out the upstart claim, but also to the not entering the other alleged conspirator s' fields of monopoly, if you want to put it that way, because if I, if I enter your field I know that you're going to enter mine."
2006.05-1126,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2168.056,2171.024,"--You may reply to us jointly or severally, however you may want."
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2172.376,2180.297,"If I may, I'll try to pose a hypothetical that I think addresses Justice Souter's question and then, Justice Scalia, I'll try to address your question."
2006.05-1126,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2210.835,2224.409,But the difference between that case and this is that the allegation with respect to the agreement to procure the getaway cars gets to a kind of specificity that is not present here.
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2253.612,2275.443,"I understand, but the point I'm trying to make with the hypothetical is that what one does if one is just looking at the conspiracy to keep CLECs out by itself first, taking the secondary aspect of the conspiracy, putting it first and analyzing it in isolation, is like taking the getaway car theft, analyzing it in isolation, saying, well, they have a reason individually to steal the cars, so I guess that couldn't--"
2006.05-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2275.443,2278.312,"Mr. Richards, can I ask you this question."
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2312.051,2319.304,"--In the context of summary judgment or at trial, we would be required to prove what we have now alleged."
2006.05-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2319.304,2330.845,"But my question is you can prove what you've now alleged factually, but they deny the existence of any agreement and they explained the reasons for it exactly as the lawyers did in this brief."
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2332.814,2336.349,"If we don't have proof at that point of what we've alleged here, we'd lose--"
2006.05-1126,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.349,2337.032,After several years--
2006.05-1126,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.032,2343.172,"Prove what you have alleged, in effect, except for the key allegation of agreement among the competitors."
2006.05-1126,2,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2347.224,2357.346,"--If we had proof that they actually acted against what would have been their self-interest in the absence of a conspiracy, we would satisfy then the Matsushita standard for summary judgment."
2006.05-1126,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2357.346,2359.697,I don't understand acting in self interest.
2006.05-1126,3,42485,thomas_o_barnett,,2378.176,2387.617,"Surely it is possible to conceive of facts under which they would not have not conspired and they would have had a different motive, but that's not the legal standard under Conley versus Gibson."
2006.05-1126,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2387.617,2388.534,But I'm questioning you.
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2407.679,2408.162,I understand that.
2006.05-1126,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2422.921,2430.925,You mean the mere fact that you have alleged something is against their self-interest is enough to make an issue of fact on whether it's against their self-interest?
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2430.925,2431.86,"--Yes, yes."
2006.05-1126,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.86,2443.585,"They could have gone on the stand, they gave all the reasons in the red briefs... or the blue briefs in this case, that say it's not against their self-interest; you'd say that would be a jury question?"
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2443.585,2445.035,"No, not at summary judgment."
2006.05-1126,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2458.51,2461.962,Are you suggesting that you don't have to prove an actual agreement?
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2466.014,2472.668,--Conduct contrary to self-interest is a way of inferring actual agreement in the absence of direct evidence.
2006.05-1126,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2472.668,2476.953,Do you agree you must... do you agree that you must prove an actual agreement among the defendants?
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2476.953,2484.226,"There must be an inference of actual agreement, but the inference can be drawn from circumstantial evidence, and that's what Matsushita is all about."
2006.05-1126,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2484.226,2501.87,"So then when we get back to the paragraph 51, let me start with your statement at the bottom half of that paragraph, that plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that they have entered into a contract, is a conclusion based upon your prior allegations, it's not an independent allegation of an agreement."
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2509.024,2517.63,"Counsel presented it as though it's a complete summary of everything, but what it says is, and the other facts and market circumstances alleged above, and it's preceded by--"
2006.05-1126,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2517.63,2522.101,But it's a statement of a conclusion based upon your allegations that precede it.
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2522.101,2522.617,--Correct.
2006.05-1126,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2522.617,2527.253,"It's not a statement that independently there apart from all of this, there's an agreement."
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2527.253,2533.908,"Well, it's also an independent statement and allegation on information and belief, which is permitted under Rule 8, that there is agreement."
2006.05-1126,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2533.908,2549.251,"I guess if you had just alleged the last part of paragraph 51, plaintiffs have alleged, plaintiffs allege upon information and belief, et cetera, without the detail that you provided, would that have been sufficient?"
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2549.251,2558.19,"If you gave no context of what kind of a conspiracy you were alleging and what kind of scope it had, so that a court could balance--"
2006.05-1126,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2558.19,2576.151,"But you omit all the allegations about parallel conduct and the other allegations that you think provide a basis for inferring a conspiracy from the parallel conduct, if you omit all that but you just include the last part of 51, would that be enough?"
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2576.151,2586.874,"--If there isn't enough in the way of facts alleged to permit a court to understand what it is you're claiming in general terms happening, then you haven't satisfied Rule 8."
2006.05-1126,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2587.409,2591.877,What's the answer to Justice Alito's question in this case?
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2591.877,2594.579,"--Well, in this case we have provided, as the Second Circuit--"
2006.05-1126,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2594.579,2594.996,No.
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2611.255,2616.473,"--In this case with the allegations of the nature of the conspiracy that precede that sentence, it's enough."
2006.05-1126,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2616.473,2616.757,No.
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2621.594,2622.311,That sentence by itself--
2006.05-1126,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2622.311,2633.034,"--Is that enough in this case for what Justice Alito asked, and I think we are interested in the answer that you make given this complaint in this case that we are faced with."
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2633.034,2637.905,--I think that that would satisfy conventional pleading standards under Rule 8(a).
2006.05-1126,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2654.198,2662.452,"I'd also like a clear answer, and I would like to go back to Justice Stevens' question because I'm not sure what you're thinking there."
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2700.677,2701.843,--That would depend on the vehicle--
2006.05-1126,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2701.843,2702.427,There is no depend.
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2706.345,2708.831,"--If that's the evidence, I think I win."
2006.05-1126,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2708.831,2709.414,All right.
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2711.216,2711.683,No.
2006.05-1126,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2714.801,2725.524,"If you're right, then I guess we could engage in this major restructuring of the economy, and if that's the law, I'm surprised they haven't done it, but maybe they have just been recalcitrant."
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2725.524,2727.193,"Well, there's no major restructuring of the--"
2006.05-1126,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2727.193,2749.039,"Well, because we have concentrated industries throughout the economy, I guess, or at least we used to, and I suppose that that's a perfectly valid way of reasoning for an executive in such a company, at least they teach that at the schools of government, and people who aren't really experienced in these things, but--"
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2749.039,2760.797,"--Well, the way Judge Posner explains it in High Fructose is to say that it is possible to have an agreement without a moment where there's a statement of agreement."
2006.05-1126,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2775.606,2776.256,"--Okay, fine."
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2796.553,2809.43,"Well, Your Honor, the strongest... plus factors that, in the absence of direct evidence of conspiracy at the outset of a case, which private plaintiffs will almost never have because people don't conspire in public parks."
2006.05-1126,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2825.839,2826.322,But how do you tell?
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2846.37,2859.612,"--This is different from that because this is a situation where when the Telecommunications Act was passed in 1996, Congress expected that the ILECs would compete in one another's territories as CLECs."
2006.05-1126,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2876.722,2884.261,"Is it an adequate response for the executive to say, I'm a little risk averse, I want to see how things work out over the next five years."
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2890.232,2897.736,"--If they can prove that that's the reason why they didn't jump in and compete, then they have a nonconspiratorial reason for what they did."
2006.05-1126,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2897.736,2909.627,"But if they don't do that, is it your argument that simply by behaving differently from the way Congress assumed when it passed the statute, that raises the plausible inference of violation?"
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2909.627,2923.034,"Within the other facts that I was identifying, there is a strong suggestion here that competition as a CLEC would have been, in the absence of the pattern of conduct that we allege here, would have been a profitable endeavor."
2006.05-1126,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2923.034,2923.434,Okay.
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2932.823,2935.592,That's one factor that I point to among several to--
2006.05-1126,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2935.592,2939.396,"But I mean, the congressional assumption is part of your case, in other words?"
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2939.396,2940.012,--It is.
2006.05-1126,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2940.012,2940.462,Yes.
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2940.462,2954.756,"I believe that along with other factors such as the constant complaints to Congress about how CLECs had the better side of the deal than the ILECs, along with the pledges of the defendants that they would do, and that they didn't do."
2006.05-1126,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2954.756,2970.765,"--I used to work in the field of telecommunications and if the criterion is that happens which Congress expected to happen when it passed its law, your case is very weak."
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,2970.765,2982.573,"Well, Your Honor, that... I certainly don't expect that that is the evidence that we would be relying on at trial or at summary judgment to support our case, but in our motion to dismiss we don't have to have the evidence to support our case."
2006.05-1126,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.573,3002.786,"Well, you need what is called the plus factor, and I gather that you acknowledge that if I disagree with you that this, this parallel action seemed to be against the self interest of the companies, you no longer have a plus factor and you would lose."
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,3002.786,3018.329,"I don't think that the Court, if the Court comes to a conclusion on its own that the facts that we have alleged, which is that it would have been in their interest to do this in the absence of conspiracy, is wrong, then the Court is not following conventional pleading standards."
2006.05-1126,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3018.329,3027.535,"So all you have to do to prove, to establish a plus factor is to say in your pleading, and there is a plus factor?"
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,3027.535,3028.72,"Well, you have to say what it is."
2006.05-1126,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3028.72,3033.089,"You have to say what it is, that's all, and even if it's implausible?"
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,3033.089,3036.81,"Well, if it's implausible, that might be a different consideration."
2006.05-1126,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3036.81,3041.361,"Mr. Richards, didn't the Second Circuit say you don't need a plus factor?"
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,3049.883,3050.5,That's correct.
2006.05-1126,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3050.5,3059.089,"And that can be wrong or right, but the Second Circuit was very clear that Rule 8 wants a plain statement of the claim and no plus factor."
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,3059.089,3064.977,"I agree with that, Your Honor, and my contention as to what the law is is that we are not required to plead plus factors."
2006.05-1126,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3071.983,3080.337,"What if you pled more than you had to, and it's clear from what you pled that you were drawing an implausible inference?"
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,3083.104,3096.931,"--No, I don't believe that it can be if... because the Court is not, the correct function of the Court under a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is not to be decided by whether it believes or is persuaded by the allegations in the complaint."
2006.05-1126,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3096.931,3108.072,"Well, let's take the Form 9 where you take the form complaint for an automobile accident, and suppose what it says is, I was injured in an automobile accident at a particular place in time."
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,3128.985,3136.739,"Well, if the allegation is also made that the defendant was negligent, then I think it clearly satisfies the pleading standard under Form 9."
2006.05-1126,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3141.81,3151.249,Even if it reveals that the only basis for identifying this person as the defendant is the fact that the person has a Massachusetts license plate and a compact car?
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,3151.249,3156.317,"Yes, because that's more than nothing, and the rule in Form 9 contains nothing."
2006.05-1126,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3156.317,3161.288,"Well, it contains a time and a place."
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,3202.862,3211.718,That is the situation that any plaintiff is going to be in in a horizontal conspiracy case in the sense that we don't know for certain that there was a conspiracy.
2006.05-1126,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3231.897,3234.065,But you don't think you have to prove that either?
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,3241.168,3259.549,"--If the Court... if we were to prove to the satisfaction of the finder of fact that the conduct we have pointed to here was or would have been contrary to the interests of the defendants in the absence of a conspiracy, we were to prove that as distinguished from pleading, we would satisfy Matsushita."
2006.05-1126,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3271.94,3281.645,How much money do you think it would have cost the defendants by then to assemble all of the documents that you're going to be interested in looking at?
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,3292.017,3297.402,"Well, to address that concern, which we share, because we don't gain anything with Matsushita."
2006.05-1126,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3321.384,3327.94,"At what point does it get characterized as a class action, before this discovery or after?"
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,3327.94,3333.092,It's at the Court's discretion when to entertain the motion for class certification.
2006.05-1126,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3380.306,3384.027,"Well, how would it be focused if you're talking about whether it's in their economic interest?"
2006.05-1126,4,32670,j_douglas_richards,,3395.065,3401.135,We'd... we would ask for production of documents reflecting their thinking process about entering into one another's territories.
2006.05-1126,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3413.726,3419.013,"Thank you Mr. Richard, Mr. Kellogg, you have four minutes remaining."
2006.05-1126,5,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3419.013,3419.263,Thank you.
2006.05-1126,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3547.194,3547.777,"Thank you, Mr. Kellogg."
