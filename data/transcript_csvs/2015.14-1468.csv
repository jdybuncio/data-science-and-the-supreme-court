2015.14-1468,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.805,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-1468, Birchfield v. North Dakota and the related cases. Mr. Rothfeld."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,10.805,36.565,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The fundamental problem with the statutes at issue in these three cases is that they make it a criminal offense to assert a constitutional right. Under laws of North Dakota and Minnesota, a person who is stopped on suspicion of impaired driving is obligated to take a warrantless chemical test to determine the alcohol content of their blood. The States concede that these tests are searches under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment."
2015.14-1468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,50.57,62.335,"Is it correct to say that you concede that the State could revoke the driver's license for refusing to take the test, either blood-alcohol or Breathalyzer?"
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,62.335,64.1,That -- that is not at issue in this case.
2015.14-1468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,69.22,73.65,"Well, let's -- let's assume that that is a concession or that we hold that or that that's a premise."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,94.275,119.96,"I -- I think the fundamental distinction that -- that governs the outcome of this case, we think, is that -- is that between the State taking away a benefit that it didn't have to give you in the first place, which is what the Court addresses in the unconstitutional conditions line of cases, and this situation here, where the State is saying by fiat, you are subject to a criminal penalty, affirmative criminal penalty, for -- for asserting a constitutional right. In the case that you are hypothesizing --"
2015.14-1468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,119.96,122.85,"Well, I think the conditions are just different."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,130.15,149.84,"But I -- I have to disagree with that, Your Honor, for this reason: I -- I think that in the unconstitutional conditions line of cases, what the Court has said is the State has given someone a benefit that it did not have to give in the first place. And that all the State is doing when it takes that benefit away is saying you're back in the position that you were to begin with."
2015.14-1468,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,192.57,193.09,One way --
2015.14-1468,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,193.09,193.315,This --
2015.14-1468,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,193.315,202.04,"One way of looking at what the State is doing is not to criminalize the assertion of a constitutional right, but to criminalize reneging on a bargain."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,220.8,225.81,"I -- I think it -- to look at it that way, I think you're sort of in -- in the world of consent."
2015.14-1468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,239.04,250.955,"Well, under Justice Alito's hypothetical, suppose if for every driver's license you had to sign a consent form, I consent to take a Breathalyzer test in the event the officer has grounds to require it."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,250.955,253.34,"Well, let me answer that question in two parts, Your Honor."
2015.14-1468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,266.59,270.38,I'm testing Justice Alito's question.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,273.26,277.59,"Well, I -- then -- then the analysis would be -- not the analysis in this case, but -- but a consent analysis --"
2015.14-1468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,277.59,280.805,"I mean, it's -- it's real in that everybody had to sign this form that they don't --"
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,280.805,282.48,I'm -- my --
2015.14-1468,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,282.48,285.09,I'm assuming they're going to stop everybody at the border.
2015.14-1468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,293.22,297.0,"Well, that's my next question, but let's just talk about just the State -- the State."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,297.0,300.44,"And, Justice Sotomayor, that, in fact, is the reality of this State."
2015.14-1468,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,300.44,300.77,I know.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,300.77,309.565,"But -- but I -- I think, as I say, the analysis there would be not the analysis in this case, but a consent analysis under the Schneckloth line of cases."
2015.14-1468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,325.89,334.535,"You know, that especially in North Dakota and sparsely populated States, you have to drive in order to -- so we know that consent is -- is fictional in that sense."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,340.15,340.7,But -- but -- I think --
2015.14-1468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,340.7,341.59,-- and the drivers sign it.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,344.905,346.11,I think that's right.
2015.14-1468,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,362.96,366.02,So that would be grounded in what provision in the Constitution?
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,366.02,369.905,"That would be grounded in the Fourth Amendment, because the -- the --"
2015.14-1468,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,369.905,373.44,"No, the -- the right people have to drive."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,379.42,379.69,"No, no, no."
2015.14-1468,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,404.43,404.97,"Well, no."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,416.965,419.99,I -- I think that's not a -- not a right that's granted in the Constitution.
2015.14-1468,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,430.72,437.795,"So -- so for purposes of analyzing this case, we have to assume that States could prohibit people from driving, period."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,437.795,439.015,I think that that's right.
2015.14-1468,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,439.015,439.54,Okay.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,453.885,481.655,"Again, that would -- that would not be this case, because in this case there is no suggestion that these defendants had any idea that these statutes existed, let alone that they were voluntarily surrendering their right to assert the Fourth Amendment. But in the hypothetical that you suggest, I think it would be a difficult case for the State to make, because the State's obligation would have to be to carry the burden of showing that the defendant actually voluntarily surrendered the right to -- to resist --"
2015.14-1468,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,481.655,485.97,Is it true that the State could prohibit driving altogether without a reason?
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,485.97,488.64,"Well, I -- I sort of conceded that to the Chief Justice."
2015.14-1468,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,500.89,501.39,You mean --
2015.14-1468,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,501.39,512.61,"I suppose the reason would be that the issue we're talking about, all the traffic deaths, right? I mean, if -- I mean, obviously it's not a realistic contention, but that's -- a lot of the hypotheticals aren't."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,532.84,533.18,That's right.
2015.14-1468,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,558.395,562.965,But we're interested in -- in other possibilities.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,654.455,658.36,I think there would be a number of -- of distinctions.
2015.14-1468,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,680.89,685.08,"In those cases, don't you just lose the benefit? You don't come into the building."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,685.08,686.72,That -- that's correct.
2015.14-1468,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,686.72,687.58,You lose your job.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,687.58,691.8,"Well, again, let's -- let's be -- be clear on -- on sort of what the doctrine is."
2015.14-1468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,705.005,711.905,"Well, but if -- if you say that, and I -- and I recognize that there's some circularity in -- in both positions here."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,718.76,719.775,But I --
2015.14-1468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,719.775,722.54,So it doesn't seem to me to help us.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,722.54,726.47,"I -- again, I -- I think I -- I would look at it differently, Your Honor."
2015.14-1468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,739.47,742.89,"Well, we would say, suppose we said this is like Skinner."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,762.54,767.4,"Well, I -- that, I think, Your Honor, would be creating a new exception to the Fourth Amendment, and it's not a certain-conditions analysis."
2015.14-1468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,798.33,802.625,"Maybe -- maybe I misunderstood, but I thought that was the whole thrust of Justice Alito's question."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,808.07,809.66,But I -- I think that it's -- I think it's --
2015.14-1468,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,809.66,814.515,"And when we talk about -- talk about innocent -- innocent lives, just as we were in Skinner."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,814.515,827.545,"I think -- I think that the analysis there is, I mean, do we look -- we look to the basic Fourth Amendment's characteristics that go into whether a search is required."
2015.14-1468,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,844.71,849.75,"Well, I'm not sure that was the -- I'm not sure that's different in this case."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,876.96,882.02,"But I think that that was not the rationale in Skinner, certainly not the entire rationale."
2015.14-1468,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,930.255,953.165,"The presumption -- but there are many ways of analyzing this case, so let me try to get you to focus on one that doesn't have to do with consent or any of these differences that you -- many of them that you've been discussing. One way to analyze it is you just ask: Is it -- there is no such thing as an exception to the Fourth Amendment."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,978.895,979.29,It --
2015.14-1468,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,979.29,982.775,"And I don't find this very much in the briefs, and it surprises me."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1056.49,1058.6,And I will do that.
2015.14-1468,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1103.45,1109.715,"Well, why can't we say that with respect to a breath test that this is a search incident to arrest?"
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1109.715,1136.82,"I think that it's not a search incident to arrest for the reasons that were stated by the dissenting opinion in -- in the Bernard case by Justices Stras and Page of the Minnesota Supreme Court, which is, the court has made very, very clear consistently from Chimel on through Riley most recently that search incident to arrest turns on the existence of one of two considerations, either the search is necessary to preserve officer safety, or to preserve evidence."
2015.14-1468,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1136.82,1150.665,"Well, I think that this would be based on the notion that it's necessary to preserve evidence, plus the notion which Justice Breyer suggested that this is about as uninvasive as a search can possibly be."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1165.2,1167.72,"Well, let me answer both of those points."
2015.14-1468,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1183.39,1199.525,"Yes, but there's something very different in the level of invasion, and certainly it's appropriate to look at the invasiveness of a search when deciding whether to do a search incident to arrest. I mean, if that weren't true, we wouldn't have talked about how much you could get off of a cell phone in Riley."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1224.84,1227.28,"Well, let me say two things about that."
2015.14-1468,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1245.71,1255.35,I didn't say ordinary way. I said you blow hard into a little straw-like thing that's connected with what looks like a cell phone.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1259.0,1259.265,Well --
2015.14-1468,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1259.265,1261.36,"I mean, it is what it is."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1261.36,1261.81,It's --
2015.14-1468,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1261.81,1283.95,"And that -- that -- the question is why it is so intrusive that the Constitution insists on a warrant where that insistence could undermine in many cases the evidence that you are looking for? Now, that's -- that's a question of several factors."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1290.65,1300.38,"Well, as to why we think it is -- why we think it is significant as a personal matter, when one takes a Breathalyzer test of this kind, a tube is inserted into the person's mouth."
2015.14-1468,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1311.63,1325.705,"What does that have to do with it? I mean, after all, if in fact the person's eyes turn bloodshot when every time he drank four bottles of whiskey, you could look at his eyes, and that wouldn't be intrusive at all."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1339.9,1345.9,You're inserting a tube into a person's mouth to get them to expel something from deep within their body so that it can be tested by the government.
2015.14-1468,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1346.18,1347.085,Excuse me.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1405.9,1407.85,"And that is true with a Breathalyzer, too."
2015.14-1468,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1419.95,1423.765,"As I said, there's always -- there's probable cause, and there's probable cause."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1423.765,1424.53,But these --
2015.14-1468,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1424.53,1434.47,I'm meaning why can't we view it as just part of the necessity of the -- of the stop and suspicion of the stop?
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1434.47,1445.19,"Because I think again the -- the tests we're talking about here, the -- under the laws of both North Dakota and Minnesota, the officer has the right to give --"
2015.14-1468,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1445.19,1445.98,The right.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1458.55,1461.59,"Well, there -- as I said, they're field sobriety tests."
2015.14-1468,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.665,1471.415,I'm saying what percent is which? Okay? I'm asking because I'm curious and think that might be relevant.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1473.95,1475.24,"I don't know, Your Honor."
2015.14-1468,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1487.26,1491.06,"Suppose the Breathalyzer test was improved, there's better technology."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1504.895,1506.62,I think that might not be a search.
2015.14-1468,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1508.0,1508.3,All right.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1517.02,1532.76,"Well, I would think, Your Honor, that most people -- maybe this is just me, but my suspicion would be that if presented with the possibility of either inserting something into your mouth and expelling something from deep within your body to be tested by the government, people will find that more intrusive than having an officer look in their backpack."
2015.14-1468,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1532.96,1534.63,It doesn't seem -- it doesn't seem realistic.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1547.0,1550.86,"Well, I -- I think maybe I do, Your Honor."
2015.14-1468,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1556.45,1557.49,"Well, that's not true."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1560.395,1562.59,"Well, I think -- I think that's an intrusion, too."
2015.14-1468,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1566.07,1576.27,"It's an intrusion when you pat down someone having probable cause to believe he's committing a crime, and you pat him down, which is the worst intrusion, I would guess."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1583.5,1584.38,"Well, I --"
2015.14-1468,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1584.38,1586.54,But we allow it.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1586.54,1588.93,"Let me, again, sort of offer two points on that."
2015.14-1468,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1602.15,1604.75,Why? That's -- that's really my unknown question: Why.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1608.31,1617.29,"And -- and I think the answer, Your Honor, is that people understand the breath test to be -- it's designed to obtain the same evidence, literally -- exactly the same evidence as the blood test."
2015.14-1468,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1619.56,1620.9,"But that's, I guess -- please, go ahead."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1620.9,1629.96,"But I -- I think that you were concerned about the dissipation of this evidence. I think as to the blood and the breath test, it's -- it's exactly the same."
2015.14-1468,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1629.96,1637.355,"Yes, you're right that it's designed to get at the same evidence, and you're right that the dissipation of the evidence works in exactly the same way."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1668.415,1673.06,"Well, as to the nature of the breath test."
2015.14-1468,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1696.025,1704.905,"What about the standard sobriety tests? I take it you're not challenging a police officer said, walk a straight line."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1704.905,1705.91,That's -- that's right.
2015.14-1468,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1710.37,1715.76,"Even though it's involuntarily, the person doesn't want to do it?"
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1715.76,1719.62,"If it's not a search, we're not concerned with Fourth Amendment limitations."
2015.14-1468,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1719.62,1720.625,So --
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1720.625,1727.52,"It -- it may be a seizure and -- and I -- that's something we have not analyzed or thought about, and we certainly are not challenging it here."
2015.14-1468,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1727.52,1739.57,"But it is -- it is a seizure if you say to a person, now you walk a straight line, and that person is in the control of the police officer at the time."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1739.57,1742.12,I think these are almost all voluntary.
2015.14-1468,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1756.52,1757.23,"I guess, for some --"
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1757.23,1758.155,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2015.14-1468,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1758.155,1758.32,No.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1758.93,1792.39,"Just to return to Justice Kagan's point, I think in addition to the particular characteristics of the breath test, which we do think are personally intrusive, I think it is the fact that the Court has always, whenever it has confronted a search -- and there is no question that these are searches -- in an ordinary law enforcement investigation, not in the special needs kind of, sort of general investigation, the Court has said there must be a warrant unless one of the recognized exceptions apply. And the recognized exceptions, I think, are substantially conceded by the other side, do not apply here."
2015.14-1468,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1793.85,1818.39,"Well -- but I guess the question that I asked -- I mean, I agree with you that you do need a recognized exception, and that we should not feel good about making up new exceptions willy-nilly. The question is, why isn't this a search incident to arrest given the various aspects that I've mentioned, the fact that the evidence does dissipate over time, that getting a warrant might interfere with that, and that it's -- relatively uninvasive."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1818.39,1818.92,Right.
2015.14-1468,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1821.16,1821.525,Sure.
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1821.525,1843.91,"I think -- for dissipation for search-incident-to-arrest purposes, my understanding of -- of that doctrine is, one is concerned with -- with the suspect doing something affirmatively to get rid of the evidence, flushing the evidence down the toilet. That is the classic search-incident-to-arrest situation. The Court in McNeely made very clear that we're not dealing with that here."
2015.14-1468,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1864.93,1882.87,"Why isn't -- why isn't it an affirmative effort to get rid of the evidence because you know the longer the interval passes, the less likely that the test is going to reveal a level that's over the standard amount."
2015.14-1468,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1882.87,1897.71,"Well -- but, I think, Your Honor, for the evidence suggested in McNeely, which -- which says that there is nothing you can do, nothing affirmative you can do to take this evidence and hide it, it's going to be dissipated in a predictable way, and it's not in your control to do it."
2015.14-1468,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1909.925,1917.705,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. McCarthy."
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,1917.705,1945.06,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The North Dakota statute strikes a bargain with individuals who wish to use the State's public roads. Conditioning their use thereon, on consent to a blood-alcohol test, if arrested for drunk driving, the Court has held that this is a valid bargain, and that States may enforce it with the imposition of significant consequences, including license revocation and the use of test refusal as evidence in criminal proceedings."
2015.14-1468,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1945.06,1968.35,"What about another bargain, if people find that texting while driving is becoming an increasing problem, and so when you get a license, you're -- you give implied consent for the officer to look at the texts or whatever they can look at on your cell phone to make sure, you know, a minute ago you were texting somebody while driving? Is -- would that be acceptable under your rationale?"
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,1968.35,1971.8,"I -- I think it's highly doubtful, Your Honor."
2015.14-1468,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1980.14,1980.75,"Well, I assume."
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,1989.125,1996.76,"Even still, Your Honor, I think this statute, it's -- given the history, given the history here, it's a uniquely compelling interest."
2015.14-1468,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1997.685,1999.13,"What do you mean ""the history""?"
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,1999.13,2002.085,The history of the State's battle in combatting drunk driving.
2015.14-1468,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2002.085,2007.85,"Well, there's not that much history for texting, because there haven't been iPhones around."
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2007.85,2020.935,"Certainly, Your Honor. Nonetheless, there's -- in these cases, there's first, the search only comes up when the driver has been arrested."
2015.14-1468,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2024.58,2024.82,I know.
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2025.07,2030.74,So this law is targeted very tightly right there on the -- on the people that are causing the problem.
2015.14-1468,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2030.74,2034.54,I don't -- I don't see that that's a difference with respect to my hypothetical.
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2034.54,2035.095,Well --
2015.14-1468,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2035.095,2042.09,"People swerve in the road because they're texting just like they do when they're -- you know, when they're intoxicated, and they're stopped for doing that."
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2051.285,2059.115,"Again, Your Honor, I think -- I think it is different because there is probable cause. The officer has reason to believe the person has been drinking and driving as opposed to --"
2015.14-1468,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2059.115,2062.26,What does it -- where does that probable cause come from?
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2062.26,2064.325,It comes from the field sobriety tests.
2015.14-1468,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2065.535,2068.355,He's got to do those before the Breathalyzer?
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2068.355,2070.85,Not necessarily.
2015.14-1468,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2081.67,2086.545,The car's been weaving. The alcohol is smelling.
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2091.41,2091.8,Yes.
2015.14-1468,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2092.3,2094.225,This is -- this is standard stuff.
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2094.225,2095.44,"Yes, this is all standard."
2015.14-1468,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2095.44,2101.9,So it's like the Chief Justice's hypothetical of weaving on the road while you're texting.
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2101.9,2110.42,"Well, even -- even aside from that, there's a whole separate set of -- the intrusion is much different."
2015.14-1468,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2144.04,2144.16,Well --
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2144.16,2144.665,-- for this --
2015.14-1468,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2144.665,2149.6,"-- you can get a warrant. I mean, you're not left with that."
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2192.705,2217.73,"Well, Your Honor, two things. One, we think McNeely's helpful for us because what the -- what the Court was concerned about there was forced blood draws over the objection of the arrestee. And those don't happen under this system. And that's -- the second part of McNeely is that McNeely pointed to these types of statutes and said, these are alternatives that don't require forced blood draws, that avoid the problem because they're --"
2015.14-1468,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2217.73,2226.63,They were only talked about in civil consequences; suspend the license. That's directly related to the condition that the license is given.
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2239.99,2242.82,Criminal penalties are different; we don't dispute that.
2015.14-1468,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2256.63,2269.23,Could you say something about what the practical consequences of requiring a warrant for every Breathalyzer would be in a State like North Dakota? I -- when -- my picture of North Dakota is that it's not like New York City.
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2288.135,2297.5,"Well, I'll -- the first -- first part of my answer is that if a warrant was required in every case, that would go well beyond what the Fourth Amendment requires."
2015.14-1468,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2320.38,2327.76,How long? What it says in the ACDL brief is that in Wyoming it takes five minutes and in Montana it takes 15 minutes.
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2329.515,2343.625,"In North Dakota, in the larger jurisdictions where there's a little bit of a quicker process where they use more telephonic warrants, and the arresting officer can go directly to a magistrate in those systems, my understanding is it takes about a half an hour to hour."
2015.14-1468,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2355.12,2360.68,Why is it harder to get somebody on the phone in rural -- than in a busy city?
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2360.68,2361.64,I think a large --
2015.14-1468,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2361.64,2370.6,I think people in the rural areas were sitting waiting for the phone to call. (Laughter.)
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2370.6,2377.32,"Your Honor -- Your Honor, I think in large part it's a lack of resources and manpower."
2015.14-1468,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2380.18,2396.69,"So that excuses you from a constitutional requirement? We're now going to bend the Fourth Amendment, which I always thought started on the presumption that we favor warrants, we don't disfavor them."
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2405.65,2408.74,It's not that -- it's not that North Dakota's asking for a pass here.
2015.14-1468,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2414.94,2421.52,"Mr. McCarthy, I think what we're -- people are asking you is to try to get some sense of the real world harms here."
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2441.495,2452.445,"The -- the interest would be almost the same, really, because -- and this is the important part here -- is that the warrant -- the -- the purpose of the warrant is to authorize a search over the objection of the arrestee."
2015.14-1468,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2465.4,2465.555,If you --
2015.14-1468,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2465.555,2465.67,If --
2015.14-1468,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2465.67,2478.965,"If you obstruct justice by refusing to comply with the warrant, you can punish someone for the obstructing justice, and you can get the same outcome as putting them in jail for being drunk and driving."
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2489.67,2490.54,Again --
2015.14-1468,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2490.54,2492.9,If you can do it in 15 minutes.
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2492.9,2498.48,"Again, it's not that the State is trying to get rid of the warrant requirement. I think it helpful if we -- to take --"
2015.14-1468,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2498.48,2498.67,No.
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2519.49,2520.41,Your Honor --
2015.14-1468,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2520.41,2520.79,This is --
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2520.79,2521.665,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1468,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2548.77,2549.06,"No, but --"
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2549.06,2549.61,-- because the way it is --
2015.14-1468,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2549.61,2550.66,But that's what we're asking.
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2585.86,2588.33,"Again, there's two -- there's two problems."
2015.14-1468,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2593.58,2601.98,"But I'm asking about your practical needs, and then, you know, we'll figure out like what is or what isn't consistent with the Fourth Amendment."
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2603.81,2611.78,"Again, the -- the other point here is that the warrant -- all -- is -- the point of the warrant is to authorize the search over the objection."
2015.14-1468,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2615.39,2617.91,I think it's not -- I did not understand that answer.
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2647.445,2649.025,Well --
2015.14-1468,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2649.025,2653.29,You're asking for an extraordinary exception here.
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2684.285,2686.72,"Well, there's a -- there's a couple reasons."
2015.14-1468,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.52,2698.79,We're making law.
2015.14-1468,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2715.09,2723.76,"The policeman presses it. A voice comes on, and it says, what's the problem? You explain it in 15 seconds, and they say, ah, I got it. Okay."
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2754.965,2760.09,"On the facts, there is delay in -- in -- some delay in getting a warrant, and that does make a difference here."
2015.14-1468,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2760.09,2763.47,Why does it make enough of a difference?
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2763.47,2765.55,"Well, there's a couple reasons."
2015.14-1468,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2786.94,2787.37,How long --
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2787.37,2789.06,So it's really just the criminal element that --
2015.14-1468,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2789.06,2789.32,All right --
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2789.32,2791.16,-- makes it different --
2015.14-1468,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2791.16,2792.81,You're not answering the question.
2015.14-1468,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2792.81,2800.93,Do you know how many Breathalyzer tests or blood tests are administered during any period of time in North Dakota?
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2800.93,2806.165,"There's approximately 6,000 of the two, and they're roughly 50/50 over the course of about a year."
2015.14-1468,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2806.165,2807.17,"6,000 per year?"
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2807.17,2807.37,Yes.
2015.14-1468,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2807.37,2823.6,"Could I ask you just a different kind of just factual question, which -- how many of these are done roadside, how many are taken to the police station, when are people taken to a police station? What is the practice? Sorry."
2015.14-1468,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2824.46,2825.68,Please answer.
2015.14-1468,1,62698,thomas_r_mccarthy,,2825.68,2832.9,So there -- the only -- the only test that's done on-site is the preliminary test which is not admissible in a court.
2015.14-1468,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2845.945,2853.785,"Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Keena."
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,2853.785,2864.375,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to follow up on some of the questions of the practicality of search warrants in these situations."
2015.14-1468,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2897.94,2898.62,What -- why?
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,2898.62,2908.62,"Because, why -- why would I now, as a police officer, cause any more delay? Because there is going to be a delay getting that search warrant."
2015.14-1468,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2919.73,2921.084,Blood and breath?
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,2921.084,2922.735,"Breath, yes."
2015.14-1468,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2922.735,2923.23,Breath.
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,2923.23,2923.69,And breath.
2015.14-1468,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2923.69,2924.495,Are they done --
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,2924.495,2927.04,"Blood -- blood, you have to go to the hospital."
2015.14-1468,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2927.04,2933.03,Because I see -- I see the -- the breath part is the part that sort of now gets me.
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,2943.21,2952.47,"But -- but why bother? Because now I've -- I've transported this person to the police station, I then have to get a warrant, and now take the --"
2015.14-1468,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2952.47,2953.07,Phone on the way.
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,2954.32,2960.81,So -- so let's talk -- let's talk about the rural aspects of Minnesota and North Dakota.
2015.14-1468,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2990.16,2992.165,"But you do the breath test, then."
2015.14-1468,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2993.64,2996.32,-- do blood test. That's the practical alternative.
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3000.2,3000.44,Right.
2015.14-1468,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3000.44,3004.96,You can choose precinct or hospital.
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3004.96,3014.43,"If they choose to take the breath test. Now, what -- I'm not going to get a warrant to take a breath test, because --"
2015.14-1468,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3014.43,3015.155,Why?
2015.14-1468,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3015.155,3015.68,Why?
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3015.68,3018.45,I can't force somebody to blow into the straw.
2015.14-1468,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3018.45,3019.34,Right.
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3023.12,3023.31,That's --
2015.14-1468,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3023.31,3027.16,I knew -- that was somehow missing in this argument.
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3049.4,3049.725,And --
2015.14-1468,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3049.725,3052.665,The Constitution leans in that direction.
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3074.615,3074.99,Well --
2015.14-1468,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3074.99,3078.37,Is there -- and so why is that bad for the State?
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3078.37,3084.635,Well -- and I have to look at our implied-consent statute and what that allows and doesn't allow.
2015.14-1468,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3096.12,3102.32,But you -- I don't -- I don't know how to explain it more clearly than that. I'm not talking law.
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3133.745,3138.03,Well -- and I don't have those type of statistics to answer that question.
2015.14-1468,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3138.03,3145.64,"Can I ask a different -- maybe a different way of asking a similar kind of question. When we decided McNeely, there were two opinions."
2015.14-1468,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3154.9,3155.77,There was one that --
2015.14-1468,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3155.77,3162.99,"The Chief Justice's opinion, even that said -- and this was with respect to a blood test."
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3209.44,3222.42,"And, you know, and speaking on behalf of Minnesota -- and it's very clear, Minnesota treats -- and I don't necessarily disagree with you. We're -- Minnesota's up here as kind of the alternative argument."
2015.14-1468,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3266.205,3267.16,That's good.
2015.14-1468,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3286.18,3299.53,"Let's assume -- I know my colleagues are -- but as part of this, okay, assume, as Justice Kagan did, that a system could be put in place for a warrant on a breath test."
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3347.29,3350.67,"Well, what we're really losing out is the enhanceability."
2015.14-1468,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3354.61,3355.41,What's enhanceability?
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3355.41,3356.85,For a DWI.
2015.14-1468,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3380.35,3382.235,Why? You change the law.
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3410.01,3416.58,But not the same -- not the same consequences that it would be if it was a DWI or a refusal.
2015.14-1468,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3416.58,3426.325,"Well, that's because you choose not to penalize obstruction at a higher level. That's your choice."
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3431.535,3438.115,Well -- and -- and it's Minnesota's position that a warrant isn't necessary.
2015.14-1468,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3438.115,3440.04,I -- I appreciate that.
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3440.04,3440.245,Okay.
2015.14-1468,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3440.245,3444.204,But I'm assuming if you can get a warrant.
2015.14-1468,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3444.204,3448.775,Justice -- Justice Sotomayor is assuming that you're going to lose.
2015.14-1468,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3454.89,3455.25,"Well, it --"
2015.14-1468,2,62699,kathryn_keena,,3455.25,3457.11,I don't like it.
2015.14-1468,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3463.62,3468.375,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gershengorn."
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3468.375,3475.015,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to do three things this morning. First, address the real-world consequences."
2015.14-1468,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3533.37,3537.52,"Well, why is that? Why -- why in Maryland have they been able to and Virginia not?"
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3537.52,3540.65,"In the Federal -- for the Federal system, it's not a resource constraint."
2015.14-1468,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3561.94,3564.61,How long it takes -- how long does it take --
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3564.61,3564.87,Eight.
2015.14-1468,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3564.87,3565.685,No number.
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3573.48,3574.33,"To dissipate, I don't --"
2015.14-1468,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3574.33,3580.68,"I mean, how long before that would -- would register 10 percent above is now equal to or less than?"
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3580.68,3581.25,So Your Honor --
2015.14-1468,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3581.25,3583.51,Is there a number? Have you come across any kind of study on --
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3583.51,3588.01,"So some of the statistics -- I don't have the exact statistics, Your Honor."
2015.14-1468,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3623.74,3628.18,"But there are more and more every year, aren't there? I mean, we're now up to over 40, aren't --"
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3628.18,3630.9,"So Your Honor, there are definitely more and more every year."
2015.14-1468,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3803.11,3812.59,"Well, I think one of our concerns is that driving is so essential for so many people that it's really different than opting to work for the Solicitor General's Office. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3812.59,3815.76,"So Your Honor, I take that point, but I think this is the critical."
2015.14-1468,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3839.925,3846.025,"This is a helpful answer, and your -- your time is running, but I'm going to stop you just to ask another question."
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3846.025,3846.435,Yes.
2015.14-1468,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3846.435,3861.265,"Is it permissible, based on the pleadings and the briefs that are filed with us, for -- for the Court to make a distinction between taking a breath test, refusing to take the breath test and refusing to take a blood test?"
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3861.265,3864.34,"Certainly, it is, Your Honor, and we set forth that in our brief."
2015.14-1468,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3899.34,3905.23,And are those tests often administered roadside or -- everybody has -- they've been telling us they have to go to -- I thought they were roadside.
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3905.23,3908.03,"Your Honor, as a general manner, they're actually done at the station."
2015.14-1468,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3970.2,3975.94,"Well, but presumably there're sanctions for failing -- failing to comply with a valid warrant."
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3975.94,3976.17,But --
2015.14-1468,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3976.17,3984.3,"If the police have a warrant to search your house and you say I don't care, I'm not going to let you in, I mean that -- it's -- presumably is subject to criminal sanctions as well."
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3984.3,4002.86,"So, Your Honor, it might well be, and I -- but I just think it just -- it shows a little bit why the use of the warrant doesn't -- doesn't quite map on, the way I think in a usual search context. I think the other problem that you have is because you can't force compliance, you might have a -- a statute -- another statute later to -- to do it."
2015.14-1468,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4023.99,4032.015,"Again, what about that is -- assuming, for argument's sake, that you can take a Breathalyzer without a warrant."
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,4041.55,4049.78,"So, Your Honor, one difference, of course, is that the blood test does -- if an officer has a suspicion that there's other than alcohol at issue, the blood test is critically important."
2015.14-1468,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4050.51,4052.94,Of course it's important. But it's going to take time.
2015.14-1468,3,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,4078.585,4091.605,"Your Honor, we -- we win on the blood test, because the -- because there is no bright line on criminal sanctions, and because it's critically important outside the blood context and -- where you need the drug evidence. Thank you, Your Honor."
2015.14-1468,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4091.605,4096.385,"Thank you, Counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Rothfeld."
2015.14-1468,4,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,4096.385,4121.91,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And if I may, I'll make three quick points, two legal and one practical. First, I think given the discussion here, the Court should not lose sight of the -- what we think is the fundamental legal proposition, what's going on in this case, which is in North Dakota and Minnesota, people who drive on the roads are automatically -- irrevocably lose their Fourth Amendment right to resist warrantless searches."
2015.14-1468,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4276.66,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
