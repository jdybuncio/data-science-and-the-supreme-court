1984.83-1476,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.994,The Court will hear arguments next in United States against Dann.
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,53.287,56.309,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1984.83-1476,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,56.309,57.901,You may raise that lecturn if you would like.
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,61.103,63.105,--Thank you.
1984.83-1476,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,119.381,128.748,"May I ask, Mr. McConnell, do I understand there is some kind of Congressional consideration of a settlement of this litigation or something?"
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,128.748,133.379,The respondents would state that there needs to be Congressional--
1984.83-1476,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,133.379,137.894,"No, is there in fact anything pending in the way of a Congressional solution?"
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,137.894,139.174,"--No, there is not."
1984.83-1476,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,139.174,139.614,There is not.
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,139.614,160.497,"In this case, it is important to know there were actually two cases, one, the first case before the Indian Claims Commission, and the second case, this one here, both in which... both involved a claim of title, specifically, Western Shoshone title to lands in Nevada."
1984.83-1476,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,201.093,209.789,"Mr. McConnell, suppose we affirm, and I will give you the same question, suppose we reverse?"
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,213.813,232.326,"The only remaining thing here, it is our position, is that Congress will eventually have to take an affirmative action, affirmatively act to pass legislation to distribute, to distribute funds that have already been paid."
1984.83-1476,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,243.332,248.685,"Certainly whatever we decide here does not tie the hands of Congress, does it?"
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,248.685,251.129,"No, that is correct."
1984.83-1476,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,251.129,254.739,Are we spinning our wheels in this case?
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,254.739,257.041,"No, I don't believe so, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1984.83-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,312.669,317.932,"That sort of a defense is no good against the government, is it, aboriginal title?"
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,327.288,339.226,"Well, you are correct, but we have had a long history in this country of trying to resolve Indian matters in a fair and understanding way."
1984.83-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.403,352.113,Let's try to be precise.
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,366.782,367.713,It should be.
1984.83-1476,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,373.197,375.137,Isn't that all that is claimed here?
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,375.137,378.329,"It is claimed that aboriginal title, that they have aboriginal title--"
1984.83-1476,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,378.329,383.876,They have given up any claim for recognized title other than aboriginal?
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,383.876,391.269,"--Mr. Justice Blackmun, I am not sure that they may have given up any other claim, but certainly before the Indian Claims Commission."
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.328,412.964,"Well, the Claims Commission found that aboriginal title had been extinguished."
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,412.964,419.486,"That is correct, and that was after eleven years of listening to anthropologists and taking evidence."
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,471.081,481.067,What have you got to say about the claim that the United States has not gone through the procedures that are necessary under the Act to effect payment?
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,481.067,485.739,--We believe that the government has gone.
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,492.785,493.226,Yes.
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,496.538,519.283,"Section 22(a) establishes that a judgment of the Indian Claims Commission is as a judgment of the Court of Claims, and that... and then Congress has provided subsequent to the establishment of the Indian Claims Commission that the appropriation, the appropriation that would satisfy that judgment is an automatic appropriation."
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.685,526.966,"Is there another statute that deals with how payment is to be effected, some procedural detail?"
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,526.966,533.31,The respondents have argued some other statutes that really go to distribution and not to payment.
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,533.31,534.332,That is what I am interested in.
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,536.173,545.109,Section I believe it is 25 USC 118 that they cite is really a... it's a 1911 statute that deals with payment.
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,588.088,595.492,"And so has the Interior, has the Interior got that judgment to its credit now?"
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,595.492,600.016,The money has been placed in a trust account in the--
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,600.016,601.537,Have you reported that to the Secretary of Treasury?
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,601.537,605.509,"--Yes, the Secretary of Treasury knows the money is there."
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.572,611.904,What can ever be done with that money?
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,614.034,615.226,It is tribal money.
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.51,625.612,For whom?
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,625.612,630.795,"Well, for the claimant, the Western Shoshone identifiable group."
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.681,658.334,"If it is to be distributed, I suppose the tribe could just hold it and use the income from it for the benefit of its members."
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,658.334,662.575,It is... a lot of different things are possible.
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.547,687.382,And what makes you think that the... let's assume that the judgment really is final with respect to the tribe.
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,688.834,690.604,That's correct.
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,690.604,691.075,You sued individual Indians.
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,691.075,692.157,That's correct.
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,692.157,695.337,Why do you think they are foreclosed by the fact of payment?
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,698.138,699.67,They have not been paid anything.
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.67,700.662,Their tribe has.
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,700.662,706.686,"The tribe, the Western Shoshone identifiable group has been paid money."
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,706.686,720.985,So you say that the Indian Claims Commission judgment which you say has been paid forecloses any other claim by the tribe or by any of its members to that particular land for which the money was paid.
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,720.985,724.128,"Based on tribal title, yes."
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,737.084,742.588,But I suppose the individual Indians have claims that have original title.
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,757.921,772.559,"Well, we would contend that aboriginal title is a tribal title, but the Indians certainly could in the situation that you have put forward make that claim based on that tribal title."
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,772.559,774.562,But their title is no better than tribal title?
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,774.562,777.364,Not as long as they are basing it on tribal title.
1984.83-1476,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,777.364,783.616,"Right, so that if tribal... but their right, their right doesn't last any longer than tribal title does."
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,786.799,792.363,"They may have an individual title, but they have not asserted that there."
1984.83-1476,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,825.534,833.789,"If an individual Indian or two or three of them brought an action, they would be bringing it in terms of any result for the benefit of the whole tribe, would they not?"
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,833.789,878.159,"Well, I think it is important that in the context of this particular case, Mr. Chief Justice, the Indian Claims Commission when it was set up, it established a specific procedure for who could come forward and submit claims, and indeed it did provide that Indians, individual Indians could come forward, bands, tribes, but it did also have, as took place in this case, that in the instance where that identifiable group of Indians had among it a recognized tribe, a recognized tribe under the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, that entity would be the exclusive agent or representative before the Commission."
1984.83-1476,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,878.159,881.942,"It is something like a class action, in effect?"
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,881.942,899.613,"Well, there are some similarities, but not... but really the Indian Claims Commission is a creature of the statute itself, and provided for a specific procedure, specific representation appeals, and all of those were used in this case."
1984.83-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1065.081,1070.834,Did they make their due process argument at all in the Court of Claims as intervenors?
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,1070.834,1071.876,"Yes, they did."
1984.83-1476,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1071.876,1074.047,Why do you get to the merits of it at all?
1984.83-1476,0,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,1075.868,1077.83,"We feel that they are, yes."
1984.83-1476,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1119.107,1129.103,Mr. O'Connell.
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1129.103,1145.894,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Mary and Carrie Dann were born on the very lands that are the subject of this case over a half-century ago, and all their lives they have used these lands to support themselves by their own labors."
1984.83-1476,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1178.954,1185.8,"You don't agree that they can get a grazing permit now, as your friend just suggested?"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1185.8,1196.656,"They could get a grazing permit, Your Honor, but they do not need a grazing permit to graze on lands that do not belong to the government, and the government does not want to litigate whether or not these lands belong to the government."
1984.83-1476,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1206.203,1209.205,"Well, isn't it their impression that they have already tried that issue?"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1209.205,1216.27,--In another form with what we believe are different parties on a different claim.
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1269.685,1277.059,"Well, did the District Court make any finding as to whether this was land acquired by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo?"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1277.059,1284.886,"I don't know whether the Court made that finding, but I believe both parties... that was in the pretrial order."
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1285.154,1286.205,They agreed that it was?
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1291.489,1305.827,"Under the decisions of this Court, Your Honor, the fee would be in the United States, but the beneficial title was in the Western Shoshone, quite clearly, and the trial court found that it was up until December, 1979."
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1309.651,1314.315,How did the District Court find that the beneficial title had gotten into the Shoshone?
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1314.315,1323.629,"The government conceded that the Shoshone had beneficial title at the time of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Your Honor, and that was in the pretrial order, too."
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1329.904,1331.176,Not legal title.
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1331.176,1333.046,"Beneficial title, aboriginal title."
1984.83-1476,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1333.046,1333.957,Aboriginal.
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1334.798,1335.457,Yes.
1984.83-1476,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.457,1336.138,Possessory.
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1336.138,1337.149,"Yes, possessory title."
1984.83-1476,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1337.149,1338.1,The right of possession.
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1338.1,1342.622,"Yes, and it was conceded that the Indians have title."
1984.83-1476,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.764,1639.138,"Mr. O'Connell, can I just ask you one question, going back to what the Chief Justice asked earlier?"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1645.713,1664.654,"Well, Your Honor, it would be a financial burden... this area is so marginal that the people who operate in it are mostly hobby farmers and these Indians, who are willing to do the hard work and work the long hours, and I believe that is in some of the material you furnished the Court."
1984.83-1476,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1664.654,1664.904,How serious--
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1664.904,1668.637,"But the offensiveness of getting a permit, Your Honor, is to get a permit for your own home."
1984.83-1476,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1668.637,1671.229,--Don't you... you are going to have to get the permit sooner or later.
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1671.229,1673.78,"No, Your Honor, I do not recognize that."
1984.83-1476,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1673.78,1677.964,"Even after payment you would say, ever after what you would agree was payment."
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1677.964,1681.586,"In regard to the Danns, I don't believe the Danns will have to get a permit."
1984.83-1476,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1681.586,1686.099,"In other words, I thought the question was just when--"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1686.099,1691.031,"For several reasons, Your Honor, which I would be willing to go into."
1984.83-1476,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.031,1696.286,"--I don't want to... just tell me, how serious is this financial burden of getting a permit?"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1697.905,1705.68,"Your Honor, the Danns contend that they would be unable to maintain their operation and pay $16,000 a year, and that is what the government wants."
1984.83-1476,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1705.68,1716.489,"Well, is the fee for a BLN permit based on the number of head of livestock that are run?"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1717.18,1717.728,Yes.
1984.83-1476,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1717.728,1722.874,--Isn't it just an annual fee per head of livestock actually being run?
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1722.874,1723.362,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1476,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1804.576,1805.958,We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock.
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1831.023,1865.877,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I was discussing that until Congress does legislate approval of a distribution plan, these funds are in limbo because there is no existing entity that has a beneficiary interest, and this Court has held that no entity has a right to assert such an interest, that that is entirely within the plenary power of Congress to designate who is going to be this identifiable group."
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1973.596,1978.38,In the Congress that just adjourned?
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,1978.38,1982.702,"No, Your Honor, it was... I'm sorry."
1984.83-1476,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2011.801,2024.391,"Of course, I take it part of your position is that even if there had been an Act saying, telling Interior to whom to distribute the money, and they had distributed it, that your clients would not--"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2024.391,2026.571,"Yes, for the two reasons--"
1984.83-1476,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2026.571,2027.593,--would not be bound at all.
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2027.593,2031.955,"--Yes, for the two reasons that I now am going to raise."
1984.83-1476,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2045.485,2047.896,Was that presented to the Court of Appeals?
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2047.896,2048.607,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1476,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.45,2051.789,"They didn't need to reach it, I take it."
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2051.789,2057.081,They just did not... they declined to reach it.
1984.83-1476,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.213,2074.886,What is your other point?
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2077.199,2087.307,"Oh, then our individual use and occupancy rights, which are entirely separate from the tribal rights, and survive tribal rights."
1984.83-1476,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2087.307,2088.459,"Now, did you present that to the Court of Appeals?"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2088.459,2090.218,"I presented it, Your Honor."
1984.83-1476,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2091.751,2092.479,All right.
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2092.479,2098.993,Because they were going to... they said that the Western Shoshone tribal title was not extinguished.
1984.83-1476,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2201.603,2212.171,"Why isn't this fund something like, not precisely like, but something like a deposit the government makes with the District Court when they condemn land?"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2218.636,2221.779,"I am not intimately familiar with how such deposits are made, Your Honor."
1984.83-1476,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2221.779,2227.371,"--Well, title passes to the government when they make the deposit."
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2235.496,2240.409,"But in that sort of situation, at some point somebody could go into a court and say, we are entitled to that money."
1984.83-1476,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2253.508,2257.891,"It is in trust, is it not, for these Indians?"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2257.891,2277.284,"--It is in trust for the Western Shoshone identifiable group, and at some later time, I think... I could concede that at some later time somebody could bring an action for breach of trust, but at this time there is nobody who could bring such an action because constitutionally it is in the Congress's power to define who has a right to those funds."
1984.83-1476,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2282.387,2284.828,"Isn't your quarrel there with Congress, with the law as it is?"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2284.828,2295.206,"--No, I don't have a quarrel with that, because I am the one... certainly I don't want anybody to have a right to those funds, so I have no quarrel."
1984.83-1476,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2316.611,2317.042,I think you understate that a little.
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2318.822,2320.382,--It is drawing interest.
1984.83-1476,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2322.745,2323.584,The government couldn't take it back.
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2323.584,2327.878,"No, no."
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2444.914,2446.797,"Well, did the Danns move to intervene in the Indian Claims Commission?"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2446.797,2452.939,"They did not directly, but I think that we could concede it would be the same as if they did."
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2455.072,2457.503,And was that motion granted or denied?
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2457.503,2458.104,It was denied.
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.104,2459.173,How about in the Court of Claims?
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2463.637,2470.241,It was denied on a discretionary basis because it was late and because of this... what they viewed as this Congressional remedy.
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2470.241,2471.223,I see.
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2478.729,2485.174,"No, Your Honor, because it was not litigated, and... it was not litigated."
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2494.097,2499.402,"Well, the fact that they didn't let you put on evidence doesn't mean that res judicata doesn't apply."
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2499.402,2504.946,"Well, if it is not litigated... ch, res... I am sorry."
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2529.811,2536.857,"Well, what was the theory of your motion to intervene before the Indian Claims Commission?"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2536.857,2544.311,That we had a right to intervene because they were giving up title to land that we wanted... that we said was not taken.
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2553.376,2557.389,Was the same theory used in your motion to intervene in the Court of Claims?
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2557.389,2562.613,"That there was collusion, yes."
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2562.613,2567.467,"You are precluded, at least on the issues on which you sought to intervene, are you not?"
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2567.467,2577.362,I do not believe that we are precluded on the matters asserted by the association that we were connected with.
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2583.316,2588.281,Even as to the same issues which you litigated with the government before the Court of Claims?
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2588.281,2597.604,"As I stated, I do not feel that we were allowed to litigate them in a real sense, but even if we were, this is a separate claim, Your Honor, and I am asserting that."
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2597.604,2600.597,Distinct from the one that you asserted in the Court of Claims?
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2600.597,2602.83,Yes.
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2751.96,2759.494,"Those were all cases, though, where the fight was between the Indian claimants and a grantee of the government under the Railroad Act."
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2763.226,2780.47,"But that would make no difference, Your Honor, because I believe what Your Honor is going to is this idea that there is some language in some cases that it is... aboriginal title is good against everyone but the government."
1984.83-1476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2781.569,2781.869,Right.
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2781.869,2784.451,"--I would like to address that, because that is a very important problem."
1984.83-1476,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2916.957,2922.643,Your time has expired.
1984.83-1476,1,32280,john_d_oconnell,,2922.643,2923.14,Thank you.
1984.83-1476,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2923.14,2927.605,"Do you have anything further, Mr. McConnell?"
1984.83-1476,2,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,2927.605,2948.369,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, respondent raised issued of damages in his argument before lunch, and it has been determined, and I wanted to inform this Court... I have been authorized to do so... that the government will not try to collect damages for trespass prior to the determination of this case."
1984.83-1476,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3008.246,3016.253,"Well, certainly no one would suggest that the mere filing of an ejection complaint would extinguish any title at all."
1984.83-1476,2,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,3026.799,3057.359,"Well, we would feel that in this case just filing the ejection action, of course, was us, the government acting in its litigative capacity, and anything else is really not before us here in this case, and that we feel that you need to... the government should properly, as I indicated when we had the exchange, try to deal in fairness, and that was what actually took place here, and title had already been extinguished."
1984.83-1476,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3057.359,3075.232,"Well, respondents obviously don't think the government has been fair, and I think the government may have kind of spoken out of both sides of its mouth in the District Court, but it seems to me when you come up here and you get a question as to what is the nature of aboriginal title, can it stand against the government, a member of the Court is entitled to a frank answer."
1984.83-1476,2,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,3078.385,3085.687,"I think that aboriginal title can be taken by the government, and can be taken without compensation."
1984.83-1476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3085.687,3093.634,Can the executive branch do that without going to court at all?
1984.83-1476,2,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,3093.634,3099.027,"No, we believe there needs to be action by the Congress to take without any compensation."
1984.83-1476,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3099.027,3099.608,Right.
1984.83-1476,2,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,3102.15,3102.788,That is correct.
1984.83-1476,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3103.99,3106.08,"May I ask one other question, Mr. McConnell?"
1984.83-1476,2,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,3124.683,3126.724,"Justice Stevens, I am going to have to apologize."
1984.83-1476,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3182.45,3188.406,"They make the argument... I am not sure it carries the day by any means, but they say, in effect, well, that is all well and good."
1984.83-1476,2,38872,robert_a_mc_connell,,3200.302,3218.815,"--But the payment, the claim submitted, the judgment, and then the payment was for a wrong, if you will, an action that affected the tribal entity, the Western Shoshone identifiable group, not individual members as such."
1984.83-1476,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3218.815,3222.048,"Thank you, gentlemen."
