1992.91-2079,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.218,"We'll hear argument next in Number 91-2079, Good Samaritan Hospital v. Donna E. Shalala."
1992.91-2079,0,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,21.825,25.178,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-2079,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,243.24,248.433,And you think the statute expressly provides it in that final provision.
1992.91-2079,0,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,248.433,250.413,I believe Clause (ii) provides that.
1992.91-2079,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,276.242,280.123,And you assert that the Georgetown opinion supports you.
1992.91-2079,0,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,280.123,280.854,Yes.
1992.91-2079,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,280.854,284.217,And your opponent--
1992.91-2079,0,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,284.217,285.967,And they say it doesn't.
1992.91-2079,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,285.967,287.549,"--They say it doesn't, yes."
1992.91-2079,0,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,287.549,288.17,Right.
1992.91-2079,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,288.17,289.199,And they say it supports them.
1992.91-2079,0,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,289.199,289.98,Yes.
1992.91-2079,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,300.068,308.125,Do you have a page number in the Georgetown case that you think supports you--
1992.91-2079,0,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,308.125,309.134,--Yes.
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1310.927,1322.107,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-2079,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.401,1376.082,"Mr. DuMont, you refer to the cost limits."
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1401.689,1431.16,"That's how the provision begins, and that's how the provision stood in 1965 when it was enacted, but in 1972, Congress explicitly enacted authority later on in the same section of the statute for the Secretary to provide for the establishment of limits on the direct or indirect overall incurred costs to be recognized as reasonable for purposes of Medicare reimbursement, and we submit that that language is essentially conclusive of the issue presented in this case."
1992.91-2079,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.55,1436.113,Where are you... okay.
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1436.113,1444.168,"--I'm sorry, I'm reading... I'm in section 1395x(v)(1)(A) about in the middle of the--"
1992.91-2079,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1444.168,1444.909,I see.
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1453.985,1465.231,"--Using the copy of the statute that's at the beginning of the petitioners' brief, it's almost at the bottom of page 2 of the petitioners' brief."
1992.91-2079,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1465.231,1467.142,Thank you.
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1467.142,1479.29,"In fact, we would assert that there are three principal reasons why this Court should not--"
1992.91-2079,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1479.29,1485.524,"Before you leave that section, would you just... I'm a little slow in following this rather complicated statute."
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1493.59,1505.687,"--Well, Your Honor, we think that the language... first of all, section 1861 provides the definition of reasonable cost, which is the key to Medicare reimbursement entirely."
1992.91-2079,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1512.372,1513.023,Right.
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1513.023,1520.627,--And is to be determined by regulations promulgated by the Secretary specifying the methods to be used in calculating reasonable cost.
1992.91-2079,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1520.627,1521.308,Right.
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1521.308,1528.494,"The... in 1972, Congress enacted a specific authorization for a particular method."
1992.91-2079,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.005,1535.558,"Now, is that the sentence that begins, '72?"
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1535.558,1544.112,"That entire sentence was not added, but the authorization that it may provide for establishment of limits was added in 1972."
1992.91-2079,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1544.112,1546.316,What about Clause (ii)?
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1548.115,1550.657,Clause (ii) has been there since the beginning of the statute.
1992.91-2079,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1550.657,1553.81,In that particular language.
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1553.81,1554.541,Yes.
1992.91-2079,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1620.434,1665.083,"Well, I... the concern, though, is that here the statute spells out how the Secretary is going to determine the calculation of reasonable costs, but then subsection (ii), the clause on which petitioners rely, says that where the aggregate reimbursement made by these methods of determining reasonable cost proves to be either inadequate or excessive, that some adjustment will be made, and that suggests at least that it's more than just going through the reasonable cost analysis."
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1669.616,1677.123,"Well, Your Honor, I think the language suggests... you know, mandates that there must be some adjustment and there's going to be some comparison of aggregate amounts."
1992.91-2079,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1694.554,1706.621,"Well, there's another statutory provision, I think that requires the book-balancing, so Clause (ii) must mean something else."
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1742.335,1769.116,"Well, I certainly agree that if Clause (ii) requires anything more than we say it does, which is to say, year-end reconciliation, then whatever obligation it imposes on the Secretary is first of all qualified by the words ""suitable retroactive corrective adjustments"" which implies a certain range of discretion, and second is fully accounted for by the exceptions and exemptions that the Secretary has in fact built into the cost limits."
1992.91-2079,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.435,1844.102,"Could I ask you, the Secretary has determined the compensation for this provider under his prescribed methodology--"
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1844.102,1845.094,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-2079,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1845.094,1845.795,--I take it.
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1856.1,1857.102,That's correct.
1992.91-2079,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1857.102,1874.423,"Now, how would the Secretary ever go about saying that what we have paid is excessive, even though our methodology says that's supposed to reflect cost?"
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1874.423,1878.414,"Well, I think that's a very interesting question, Your Honor, and in fact--"
1992.91-2079,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.414,1884.579,"It would be almost impossible, wouldn't it, for the Secretary to confound his own methodology?"
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1884.579,1887.132,"--Well, no, Your Honor, in fact I'm not sure that it would be."
1992.91-2079,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1887.132,1895.588,"Well, I'm just suggesting to you that maybe excessiveness could only really mean book-balancing."
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1895.588,1914.92,"First of all, I think that is by far the most natural interpretation of the statute, is that that language refers to the same kind of accounting comparison that we submit, the comparison of an aggregate reimbursement produced by estimated methods with a total final audited reimbursement produced by the same methods but applied to final numbers."
1992.91-2079,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1971.239,1980.265,"Mr. DuMont, what about a third possibility, besides the two represented by the Government's position and the petitioners' position here?"
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2032.647,2054.101,"That's correct, Your Honor, and we would agree with you that even if Clause (ii) had originally allowed for some kind of originalized challenge to the determination of costs under the original statutory scheme, that once Congress came in in 1972 and spoke very specifically to the concept of imposing costs--"
1992.91-2079,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.101,2054.952,Of established limits.
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2073.125,2076.978,"--Well, we would submit that the cost limits are, in fact, one of the methods of determining costs."
1992.91-2079,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.36,2107.717,"Well, suppose... he's imposed a limit of... imposed limits on costs of specific items or services or groups of items or services."
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2117.104,2136.785,"We would submit that no, it could not, because after all, Clause (ii) only authorizes an adjustment in accordance with the methods prescribed by the Secretary, and cost limits are one of those methods, so once you have a validly promulgated applicable limit, we think that ends the question as to those costs."
1992.91-2079,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2136.785,2143.631,It's not clear to be why you can't reach the result you want to reach in making these adjustments under 1395g.
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2155.088,2168.446,"First of all, because, as I said the... we think 1395g refers only to a payment mechanism and that the first sentence of 1395g requires an external determination of what amounts are in fact due under--"
1992.91-2079,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.446,2169.267,What kind of determination?
1992.91-2079,1,22157,edward_c_dumont,,2169.968,2171.579,"--External, I'm sorry."
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,2981.696,2997.577,"I don't think it's superfluous, because it... you have to wait till all the regulations are applied at the end of the year before Clause (ii) kicks in."
1992.91-2079,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3004.479,3010.474,"But you could reach the result your clients reached, and you could reach the results of reimbursement without use of that word."
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3010.474,3016.508,"Yes, I believe that's correct."
1992.91-2079,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3063.378,3065.381,"Which regulations are these, Ms. Hedlund?"
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3065.381,3068.551,The one cited in footnote 2 of the Georgetown decision.
1992.91-2079,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3093.449,3100.934,"Ms. Hedlund, what about the... what is your response to the question that I asked Mr. DuMont?"
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3134.805,3157.851,"We did challenge the validity of the cost-limits methods, and we lost on that challenge, and we're saying Clause (ii) assumes or recognizes that valid methods can produce inaccurate reimbursement in individual circumstances, so we... it's not sufficient for our purpose to be able to challenge the cost-limit method."
1992.91-2079,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3157.851,3161.983,I'm not sure I understand your response.
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3171.31,3174.89,The limits are a method.
1992.91-2079,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3178.354,3183.338,"So you have to challenge both, the limits and the methods, you're saying."
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3185.108,3190.091,"In this case, we're... I'm confused by the question--"
1992.91-2079,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3190.091,3191.173,"Well, when I say challenging--"
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3191.173,3192.402,--Because the cost limits are one of the methods--
1992.91-2079,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3192.402,3197.618,"--When I say challenging, I mean, you're saying that both the limits and the methods require an exception in your case."
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3203.49,3204.131,--Yes.
1992.91-2079,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3245.88,3269.716,"If I understand you correctly, the Secretary could invoke Clause (ii), saying to recapture a lot of depreciation he thought was excessive, without promulgating a regulation... just say, we just realized there's this method, that one of the consequences of our regulations is that these hospitals have been able to make all sorts of money because they've overestimated or overaccounted for depreciation, something like that."
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3279.7,3289.658,"If the Secretary could prove that they had paid more than the actual cost to a provider, they could do that under Clause (ii)."
1992.91-2079,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3289.658,3294.082,"Without a special regulation on depreciating, just doing an accurate accounting job by--"
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3294.082,3302.007,"Not just... well, not just... I think that's different, if it's an accounting question as to whether they didn't properly--"
1992.91-2079,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3302.007,3303.469,--They just--
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3303.469,3304.971,--The costs were properly recorded--
1992.91-2079,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3304.971,3307.162,--There are all sorts of cost accountants who can figure costs a million different ways--
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3307.162,3307.913,--I'm sure of that.
1992.91-2079,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3307.913,3321.083,"--As we all know, and they just now have got a new cost accounting expert who figured they've been... your hospitals have been overcharging depreciation for years, so we're going to take a second look at your costs on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis."
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3322.786,3325.105,Clause (ii) works two ways.
1992.91-2079,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3325.105,3328.197,I just wonder who wins this lawsuit if you prevail.
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3329.748,3330.309,It is a two-edged sword.
1992.91-2079,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3331.678,3333.851,"Well, they'd have the burden, I assume, wouldn't they?"
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3333.851,3335.281,They would have the burden of showing--
1992.91-2079,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3335.281,3336.913,They would have the burden of showing that their own regulation is bad.
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3336.913,3342.176,"--That's correct, or that it resulted in over-reimbursement, or that the provider's costs were unreasonable."
1992.91-2079,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3342.176,3343.168,In a particular case.
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3343.168,3344.137,In a particular case.
1992.91-2079,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3344.137,3350.221,The regulators generally find that where you've go a place in Nebraska where a lot of people work part-time and not full-time you've got this strange result.
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3352.264,3353.005,Yes.
1992.91-2079,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3373.707,3377.029,"Do you mean the language of g is broad enough, or the language of x is broad--"
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3377.029,3389.258,"--Of the regulations, the book-balancing regulations, where it talks about a reconciliation to actual cost, that that... Clause (ii) does require regulation."
1992.91-2079,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3395.482,3398.815,--So you say the Secretary has just misinterpreted his own regulation.
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3398.815,3404.678,--They've been applying them... they've not allowed us to show... to get reimbursement for our actual costs.
1992.91-2079,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3410.942,3416.165,So you say that this is a case in which the Secretary has misconstrued his regulation.
1992.91-2079,2,19213,carel_t_hedlund,,3416.165,3418.568,"Misapplied it, I believe."
1992.91-2079,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3418.568,3419.428,Very well.
