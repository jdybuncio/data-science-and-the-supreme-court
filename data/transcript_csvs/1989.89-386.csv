1989.89-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.058,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-386, Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation v. Patrick Feeney."
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,15.926,19.545,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,211.603,218.59,"Mr. Lesser, suppose a municipal corporation had those characteristics."
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,243.457,244.474,"--No, I don't think so."
1989.89-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,273.593,278.045,"Well, you... you... you say that... you say that either... either governor can veto the... the action."
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,278.045,279.23,--Absolutely.
1989.89-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,279.23,282.849,But being able to veto it is not the same as being able to direct it.
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,289.603,293.99,"Well, they... what the Port Authority does is subject to legislative control."
1989.89-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,300.061,304.613,"Well, how can it be subject to legislative control when you have to have the two legislatures get together on it?"
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,309.416,310.433,Not... not at all.
1989.89-386,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,418.305,427.911,"Getting back to the Holland Tunnel, wasn't that supposed to be tax... toll free at a certain time?"
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,427.911,429.445,"No, I think that was the--"
1989.89-386,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,429.445,433.814,"When it was built, wasn't it two or three years, then it was supposed to be toll free?"
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,433.814,435.516,"--No, it was never written into the statute."
1989.89-386,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,440.753,442.97,Assumption by whom?
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,442.97,443.622,--By--
1989.89-386,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,443.622,445.238,All the people.
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,445.238,446.422,"--By the general public, yes."
1989.89-386,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,446.422,446.957,Yes.
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,446.957,448.857,And the legislatures--
1989.89-386,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,448.857,460.548,"Well, speaking of the general public, is this true that the tunnel... I mean that your Authority has more funds in its pocket than the treasury of New York State?"
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,460.548,462.084,"--Oh, I would doubt that, Justice Marshall."
1989.89-386,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,462.084,462.85,Sir?
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,462.85,463.617,I would doubt it.
1989.89-386,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,508.564,512.265,Does the treasury of New York have surplus funds?
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,512.265,513.416,I... I really don't know.
1989.89-386,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,515.051,515.683,"Oh, yes, you do."
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,515.683,516.15,I would--
1989.89-386,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,516.15,517.034,You don't read the newspapers?
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,517.034,517.586,--I do.
1989.89-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,574.59,583.296,"Well, sir, I... I... I'm not sure what you mean when you say that the... that the Port Authority can't do anything that isn't authorized by the... by the legislature."
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,591.218,600.324,"Well, the compact, which both state legislatures adopted, states that the commissioners of the Port Authority constitute a board."
1989.89-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.302,626.123,"Well... suppose... suppose they want to hire more... more policemen for the tunnel, or suppose they want to paint a bridge."
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,628.475,634.561,"--Well, they... when they appropriate... when the Port Authority adopts a budget, that's subject to gubernatorial veto."
1989.89-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,635.747,638.699,"No, I'm not talking about... I understand, everything is subject to veto."
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,638.699,639.099,--Right.
1989.89-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.099,642.401,But I'm talking about prior legislative approval.
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,642.401,647.805,"Well, the prior legislative approval to appoint a staff has come in the initial compact."
1989.89-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.805,650.257,"Well, then, you can say the same thing about municipalities."
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,656.244,657.011,Only in a very--
1989.89-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.011,658.327,--that... that you need a state statute.
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,658.327,660.196,--only in a very remote sense.
1989.89-386,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,724.555,734.594,"Mr. Lesser, do the directors of the Port Authority have the power to waive immunity in any suit that they choose?"
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,734.594,736.196,"No, they do not."
1989.89-386,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,739.398,759.811,"Well, if that's the case, then it would seem to me that your construction of what you call the venue permission... provision... is unacceptable because then we have to interpret it as a waiver in all cases."
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,759.811,761.144,"No, I think... I think--"
1989.89-386,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,761.144,774.654,"If... if... if it's not a venue provision because there's no authority to waive on a suit-by-suit basis, then maybe the best interpretation of that provision is that it is a waiver."
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,774.654,777.773,"--I think not, Justice Kennedy."
1989.89-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,815.898,816.581,"Now, were these--"
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,816.581,817.098,xxx--
1989.89-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,817.098,820.85,"--I'm asking you a question, Mr. Lesser, if you will just stop for a moment."
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,820.85,822.652,--I'm sorry.
1989.89-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,822.652,826.771,Were these cases decided in the context of the Eleventh Amendment?
1989.89-386,0,31462,joseph_lesser,,826.771,828.539,"No, not directly, no."
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,1615.35,1618.802,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1989.89-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1831.758,1858.508,"Mr. Miller, how is it that some degree of independence from the state by the... this agency mean that the entity, the Port Authority, is still not ultimately controlled by the state, and operate as... as states' agency?"
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,1873.62,1878.589,"Well, it doesn't have any of the... the dressings of an agency."
1989.89-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1878.589,1883.309,"Well, do you think it's a political subdivision of the states, like a city or a county?"
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,1883.309,1883.759,It's been described--
1989.89-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1883.759,1884.792,Is that your position?
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,1884.792,1890.629,"--Well, it's been described in the... in the enabling statutes as a private corporation."
1989.89-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1926.402,1933.908,"Well, I suppose it doesn't matter whether the word is used, because this would be a Federal question."
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,1946.95,1947.502,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1955.422,1963.444,"Well, I'm not sure that application of the so-called six factors yields a crystal clear result here."
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,1970.265,1972.117,"--I don't think we have to look at six, Your Honor."
1989.89-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2026.351,2028.203,That sort of begs the question.
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2035.79,2036.809,--But it's not state money.
1989.89-386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.995,2083.088,"Well, what if... what if a state set up a... say... say Massachusetts set up an authority to... to develop the harbor there."
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2106.47,2119.296,"Well, Your Honor, without knowing some of the specific sections, et cetera... but I would say you'd, again, have to look at the... what I consider the most important factor in Tahoe, is the... what happens if there is a judgment?"
1989.89-386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.13,2127.617,"Well, I know, but you... I... I don't suppose you can sue a state in the Federal court for an injunction, can you?"
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2127.617,2128.268,No.
1989.89-386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2128.268,2138.674,"Well, in... in those cases there is nothing... the... a state is immune even though its treasury isn't in danger."
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2138.674,2141.626,"Well, that's handled in the statutes for the Port Authority."
1989.89-386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.053,2161.707,"Well, you're arguing waiver now."
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2161.707,2163.742,"Specific, yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2163.742,2175.716,"Let... let's assume the state creates a statewide police force, a state police, and... and... and... and it provides that the state... that this agency may be sued."
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2201.534,2213.072,"I would say that is not a state agency that falls within the parameters of the Tahoe case, which said, if there's an impact on the treasury we will consider it."
1989.89-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.072,2215.441,I... I know that.
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2217.309,2217.693,If--
1989.89-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.693,2227.749,"--And you think that simply because of the one feature, that the state's general funds are not available for judgments, therefore it is not a state agency?"
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2227.749,2230.517,"--I think that's the most workable feature, yes."
1989.89-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2234.005,2234.638,That... that's very risky.
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2237.79,2238.473,Well--
1989.89-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.473,2260.053,"That if... if a state creates what, in all other respects, is thoroughly a state agency, the mere fact that the... that the general state funds are not liable in any suit, although it makes it liable to suit up to the amount of its own... its own budget, that alone makes it a nonstate agency?"
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2260.053,2271.928,"--Well, is Your Honor saying in your question that the question of agency is somehow set out in... in... in... in its description of this police department?"
1989.89-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.046,2283.652,"No, I'm just saying that I never thought that the criterion... the exclusive criterion of whether a body is a state agency or not is whether it can render the state's treasury liable."
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2283.652,2286.854,"--I... I wouldn't say it is the exclusive factor, Your Honor."
1989.89-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2286.854,2289.306,"But that is what you just said before, I thought."
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2291.774,2305.684,"I'm saying that under the authority of Tahoe, looking at that factor, appeared to be the most important factor as far as that agency was concerned and as far as this one is concerned."
1989.89-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2305.684,2320.194,"Well, Mr. Miller, a number of states, I believe, certainly those with debt limits, have been following the practice of setting up separate state agencies to fund construction projects."
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2358.986,2365.906,"Well, Your Honor, I think if it's clear from looking at the agency that it is in fact an agency, then I don't think--"
1989.89-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2365.906,2369.275,"Well, but, liability of the state has shielded."
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2370.96,2374.078,--Yes.
1989.89-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.832,2432.2,You could say the same about the FCC here... here in Washington.
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2440.538,2444.192,--But they get... I believe the FCC gets some appropriations from Congress.
1989.89-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2449.227,2463.854,"And you think if the FCC were authorized to raise all the funds it needed by assessments of the people using its services, or by imposing a... a tax on television sets, or something, you think that would make the FCC not a Federal agency anymore?"
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2463.854,2464.422,"No, I don't."
1989.89-386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.902,2523.294,I take it you would... you would say that the Eleventh Amendment immunity is available if the Port Authority is deemed to be an agency of the state?
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2523.294,2526.329,Your Honor is not talking about the waiver issue now?
1989.89-386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.429,2527.846,No.
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2527.846,2530.781,xxx... yes.
1989.89-386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2530.781,2541.006,Even though... even though there is no risk to the state treasury?
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2541.006,2550.612,Yes.
1989.89-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2597.676,2616.72,"Do you think that the provisions having to do with suit and the venue section meet the standards set out in the Atascadero case for a clear, unmistakable waiver?"
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2616.72,2618.589,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1989.89-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2619.456,2620.439,How is that?
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2620.439,2629.564,"Well, there can be no doubt, for example, that when the say judicial district of the United States they mean the Federal courts."
1989.89-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2629.564,2637.801,"Yes, well, I suppose you heard Mr. Lesser's explanation of what he thought might have been intended by that provision."
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2637.801,2645.573,"Well, I thought I heard him say at one point in time that he would agree that it meant the Federal courts."
1989.89-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2645.573,2659.666,"The language meant the Federal courts, but he offered an explanation for why that language might have been inserted in there, that was something other than an intent to waive sovereign immunity."
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2659.666,2692.22,"Well, Your Honor, I can only answer that by saying if... if it's read in conjunction with the prior statute, and they were passed at the same time, 7101 and 7106 were passed at the same time, then you would have to conclude, I believe, that when they say you can sue us in any court for any lawsuit, and the only condition we will impose is it must be within a court, be it state or Federal, within the Port Authority district."
1989.89-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2759.013,2762.901,Do we have to regard that venue provision as a waiver?
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2788.616,2789.634,True.
1989.89-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2789.634,2793.002,Why can't one say that the venue provision doesn't have to be a waiver.
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2801.708,2802.175,I think--
1989.89-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2802.175,2805.41,In which case you wouldn't need the Atascadero level of... of certainty.
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2805.41,2806.81,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1989.89-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2822.771,2825.14,Do you agree with me you've got to stop calling it a waiver?
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2825.14,2825.757,Okay.
1989.89-386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.348,2871.752,Do you think it has to be the same... the same... have the same status in both states?
1989.89-386,1,39877,richard_w_miller,,2871.752,2874.388,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I don't follow the... your inquiry?"
1989.89-386,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2874.388,2878.608,"Well, are we talking here about New York?"
