2018.18-525,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.32,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 18-525, Fort Bend County versus Davis. Ms. Sinzdak."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,8.32,22.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Title VII's exhaustion requirement is satisfied, the power to address an employment discrimination claim shifts from the executive to the judicial branch."
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,46.6,58.28,"But the expert agency, unlike the examples that you give of agencies that have adjudicatory authority, the EEOC has no authority to adjudicate."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,94.72,124.24,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think the important question with respect to jurisdiction is whether the agency has been empowered to attempt to resolve a claim. I don't think whether the resolution -- the way that it resolves it, whether -- whether -- the way that it's been empowered to resolve it, whether it's adjudicatory or non-adversarial, I don't think that matters. What matters is whether Congress vested authority in the agency to attempt to resolve it. And I think, with respect to Title VII, it's correct, the agency is not using adversarial proceedings."
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,165.28,177.12,"How -- how -- it's also the case that if the EEOC does nothing within 180 days, you can go to court and -- and the agency has done absolutely nothing at all."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,177.12,179.2,That's correct.
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,185.24,195.04,"The Federal Tort Claims Act did have a question -- Federal Claim -- Tort Claims Act, you are suing the government, you suing the United States."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,202.88,205.84,"Oh, there -- there very much is in -- in two important ways."
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,218.64,219.16,Let's -- let's go back.
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,230.8,235.36,That -- that's correct. But the question is how narrowly to construe the waiver of sovereign immunity.
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,259.84,263.72,"Yes, but I thought that -- that Title VII waives that immunity."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,263.72,267.56,"It -- it waives the immunity, but, again, the question is how broad a waiver is there."
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,289.04,313.12,"Do you think that Congress meant that if you take a case, Title VII case, take it to a district court, take it to a court of appeals, and the defendant has said not one word about exhaustion, the defendant loses in district court, loses in the court of appeals and says, a-ha, there was no exhaustion, all bets are off, we win?"
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,313.12,328.56,"I think that is one effect of this being jurisdictional and, yes, Congress very much did say that this is a jurisdictional rule. But I think that that is focusing on one relatively rare instance rather than on the reasons that Congress would make a provision like this jurisdictional."
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,328.56,339.04,"What about the -- the notion that if Congress wants to make something jurisdictional, of course, it can, like it's made the amount in controversy jurisdictional in diversity cases."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,343.6,344.96,I -- I think that it did.
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,367.8,369.68,There are two separate sections.
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,383.92,386.96,So they are both in subsection (f).
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,420.8,426.4,How does that differ from a suit for copyright infringement may not be brought until the copyright is registered?
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,426.4,453.92,"Well, there, I don't think there was -- it wasn't in the same provision as the express jurisdictional grant. I also think, you know, we're not just looking at text in isolation. You have to look at text in context. And here we have this very -- this text linking explicitly to the jurisdictional provision, and it's part of an intricate scheme for statutory and judicial review. And this Court, in case after case, has said that when Congress sets out --"
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,453.92,458.16,"But it's not -- you just used the word ""review."" It's not judicial review."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,467.8,471.88,"Well, that's -- the court has used the term ""review"" to refer to what the agency does."
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,479.0,483.88,"But you used the word ""judicial review."" So it was the judiciary is reviewing something."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,487.64,489.0,"No, it's reviewing the actions."
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,495.84,498.64,It's adjudicating that claim de novo.
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,509.52,517.32,"Well, I'm not sure that that's how the court has been using it because it refers to administrative review and we all agree that the agency is acting in the first instance."
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,538.24,543.08,"Well, that's satisfied by making it mandatory."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,597.24,615.04,"I think that in John R. Sand, the Court recognized that jurisdictional rules don't function in that way and they don't function in that way because they are generally intended to vindicate system-related goals. And -- and it's very clear here that -- that titles having an exhaustion requirement is vindicating system-related goals."
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,632.08,655.88,"What do we do with one other facet of Title VII? Title VII is written for employees to state their grievances, and in many of these cases, these people are not represented at all or, if they are represented, it's not counsel of your quality. Is that a factor that should be taken into account?"
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,655.88,661.08,"I think that in enforcing the exhaustion requirement, courts have taken that into account."
2018.18-525,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,677.04,677.48,"Well, no."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,692.52,695.24,"That's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2018.18-525,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,722.6,738.28,"But you place some considerable reliance on 2000e-5(f)(3), the jurisdictional provision for Title VII, but what if that didn't exist, so that a plaintiff would have to rely solely on 1331? Would you have the same argument?"
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,738.28,763.52,"It would be a different argument, quite candidly, because we do have a textual link here between the exhaustion requirement and explicit grant of jurisdiction. But -- but we know that when Title VII was first enacted in 1964, this was it, because 2000e-5(f)(3) was it, because 1331 had this amount in controversy requirement, and so Congress created a special grant of jurisdiction."
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,785.88,786.72,But since it --
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,786.72,796.52,-- where the Court is looking at whether that general grant of jurisdiction under 1331 has been displaced by a specific remedial scheme and that's --
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,796.52,806.72,"When -- when Congress does that, as it did in Social Security Act, so we have 405 and it says 1331 is not available."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,812.48,813.88,I -- I don't think that's always true.
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,847.08,853.84,"Yes, 100 years when courts use expressions like mandatory and jurisdictional."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,880.36,881.52,"No, absolutely not."
2018.18-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,895.04,945.48,"Can you imagine any administrative scheme that would not be jurisdictional? You seem to imply that we were wrong in -- in Reed Elsevier and in Homer City because, in both of them, there were administrative processes and yet we didn't find their preconditions to be jurisdictional. So tell me, I think your -- it's a new rule, I have never seen us say it, if you have to exhaust, it's always jurisdictional if you don't? And why does Congress bother writing into statutes something like they did in Thunder Basin, where they said, if you don't raise something before the agency, the Court can't consider it? Why bother with that?"
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,945.48,945.56,Sure.
2018.18-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,945.56,947.0,That's what you're saying now.
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,947.0,949.04,"No, we're -- we're absolutely not saying that."
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,999.56,1007.88,"The NLRA is an adjudicatory body, and then it goes to a court of appeals that reviews the decision."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1023.2,1064.88,"So, Justice Ginsburg, the NLRA has been repeatedly looked to as the model for Title -- Title VII's remedial provisions. And, in fact, in Zipes, this Court held that the NLRA's timely filing requirement was not jurisdictional, and that was good evidence for why Title VII's timely filing requirement should be non-jurisdictional. Now that was -- you know, the NLRA scheme there was adjudicative, but the Court didn't think that difference was -- was significant. And it's not significant in this case either because what is important is that Congress empowered the agency, not the courts, to address the -- to address Title VII claims in the first instance."
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1064.88,1067.32,"But not to resolve it, not to resolve it."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1079.64,1097.24,"I don't think decision can be key, and that's because of this Court's decision in Elgin. In Elgin, the Court acknowledged that it was very possible that the agency had no authority to decide the constitutional claims at stake there. But, nonetheless, the Court held that it was a jurisdictional rule --"
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1097.24,1125.12,"But you had to go there first, even though you might have a constitutional question, and the court carefully explained that the court might -- the case might drop out on another ground and, therefore, the court would never have to get to the constitutional question. So, Social Security, you have to go before the agency first, you may be -- you may have a constitutional question, but it may be that you don't qualify because of one of the statutory grounds."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1133.16,1134.44,And -- and that's exactly right.
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1157.96,1165.48,"Not resolve any legal question, nothing, it -- it can only be -- has a conciliation role."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1181.92,1187.32,"There's de novo review of what the EEOC does decide, which is cause or no cause."
2018.18-525,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1204.52,1205.0,As a --
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1205.0,1206.4,-- exactly the funneling function.
2018.18-525,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1206.4,1214.92,"-- as a -- as a practical matter, that will still be true so long as defendants raise the argument that something has not been properly exhausted."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1238.88,1252.96,I think because the incentives of the -- that a defendant has aren't precisely aligned with the system-related goals that the exhaustion requirement is vindicating. And so there are going to be instances where defendants aren't raising the exhaustion requirement.
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1260.64,1269.76,Why would a defendant not want to raise an objection that results in dismissal of the case?
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1269.76,1281.4,"It won't always result -- well, it will result in dismissal of the case, but it may be that the -- the employee might be able to go back to the -- to the EEOC, exhaust, and then return to court. So, in that instance, of course --"
2018.18-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1281.4,1284.04,Isn't there a time problem with doing that?
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1284.04,1298.48,"There may or may not be. If this system is functioning effectively such that when, for example, a pro se litigant files a suit without having gone to the EEOC, that -- that it will be promptly dismissed, there's 180 days and there's equitable tolling."
2018.18-525,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1310.2,1313.16,"Well, but the EEOC procedure is likely to be a real waste of time."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1317.16,1318.44,At least five years.
2018.18-525,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1318.44,1318.76,Five years.
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1318.76,1319.16,"Although, actually --"
2018.18-525,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1319.16,1334.96,"And now -- and now you would have them -- assuming you can get through the time barriers, you would have them go back and say, well, let's go back to the EEOC and see if we can work this thing out. There have been -- there's been a lot of time and energy invested in trying to win as opposed to resolve it."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1338.84,1340.72,"Well, I think this is a marginal case."
2018.18-525,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1369.04,1383.4,"If it had passed this legislation after 2006, it seems to be about the time we adopted a much more focused understanding of jurisdictional, requiring a pretty clear statement, you really wouldn't have much of a case, would you?"
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1383.4,1384.92,I -- I don't think that's correct.
2018.18-525,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1420.32,1421.16,How do you distinguish --
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1421.16,1421.28,-- exclusive.
2018.18-525,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1421.28,1421.76,Sorry.
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1425.64,1428.12,EME Homer is about notice and comment review.
2018.18-525,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1429.04,1439.64,"But it's about a scheme designed to make sure that the claim or the issue -- I shouldn't say claim -- the issue is first raised to the agency, with the idea that the agency would then take that into account."
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1439.64,1458.16,"I think, in -- in this case and in all of the examples we've cited, what we're talking about in terms of administrative review provisions is individualized claim resolution provisions. So, once you have a claim, what do you -- where do you go? Do you need to go to the agency, or can you go directly to the courts? EME Homer wasn't about that."
2018.18-525,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1463.52,1463.84,So --
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1463.84,1464.6,-- at the point --
2018.18-525,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1464.6,1476.68,"So, when it is individualized, to pick up on Justice Sotomayor's question from earlier, are you saying that we should usually presume that Congress intended an administrative exhaustion scheme to be jurisdictional?"
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1476.68,1478.92,The question is congressional intent.
2018.18-525,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1481.52,1490.56,"But how -- how would we look at that? In a scheme -- individualized claim proceeding, administrative exhaustion requirement, that's all we know. What else do we need to know?"
2018.18-525,0,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,1490.56,1499.76,"Well, as the Court said in -- in Elgin, you look at the text, you look at the structure, and you look at the purposes. So you look at the text to see how intricate is this scheme and how comprehensive is it."
2018.18-525,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1544.96,1551.56,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Melkonian."
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1551.56,1570.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has held numerous times in Zipes and Arbaugh and in many other cases that statutory limitations are not jurisdictional, unless this -- unless Congress has said they are jurisdictional in a clear statement. That is meant to be a readily administrable bright-line rule."
2018.18-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1572.24,1574.8,"Well, the statute, of course, was passed before that."
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1574.8,1575.56,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.18-525,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1632.48,1633.36,That was Title VII.
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1633.36,1634.6,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2018.18-525,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1634.6,1636.24,Arbaugh was a Title VII case.
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1636.24,1645.24,"Arbaugh was a Title VII case, and then every single case other than Patchak was -- applied the clear statement rule to a statute that preexisted Arbaugh."
2018.18-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1645.24,1655.44,"Well, how does that make sense? I mean, the idea is -- of the clear statement rule is we're going to look for a clear statement because of this, starting now."
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1665.8,1694.84,"No, Your Honor, and that's where I come back to my first answer, which is that this is the way of discerning congressional intent in these very important cases where the question we're asking is, is this of the high level that it would have to be to be a jurisdictional status? So are we going to want to impose these kind of costs on the court and on the parties and litigants, and do we want to give Congress clear guidance on what they're supposed to be doing in the future when they're deciding what to do with statutes, whether to amend them or -- or whatever else?"
2018.18-525,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1694.84,1700.2,The reality is that I doubt Congress even thinks about or in the past has thought about this issue.
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1700.2,1701.44,"That's probably right, Your Honor."
2018.18-525,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1701.44,1708.44,And so in the absence of the clear statement rule is intended to give us guideposts of how to discern that.
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1708.44,1710.48,"I agree with that, Your Honor."
2018.18-525,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1710.48,1719.52,"And -- because if there's clear history, as there was in whether an appellate rule is jurisdictional or not, we follow the history."
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1719.52,1720.36,That's right.
2018.18-525,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1724.04,1725.28,But there's no history here.
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1725.28,1727.36,"There's absolutely no history here, Your Honor."
2018.18-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1776.84,1778.96,"Well, what about Elgin?"
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1778.96,1782.32,"Elgin, Your Honor, I think handles a very different set of circumstances."
2018.18-525,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1821.64,1821.92,Are --
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1821.92,1822.8,-- circumstances.
2018.18-525,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1822.8,1829.36,"Are you suggesting that if the EEOC did resolve these kinds of claims, that there would be a different answer?"
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1829.36,1855.92,"I -- I'm not saying that if it resolved it in the way of a normal exhaustion requirement, the way we were talking about in Woodford v. Ngo, but what I'm saying is that if you designed an EEOC structure that looked like Thunder Basin or Elgin, so that where, you know, you get counsel, you go to the court -- you go to the administrative agency, there's no district court jurisdiction at all at the first instance, then you get a judicial administrative record, you go up to court of appeal."
2018.18-525,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1860.12,1874.64,"Well, I guess what I'm asking is suppose that everything in this statutory structure is exactly the same, except that the EEOC had actually been given the ability to resolve claims rather than simply to assist in the mediation of claims."
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1874.64,1874.92,Right.
2018.18-525,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1891.52,1905.24,"Well, I -- I think they're arguing that even if there isn't one, that we should recognize one or create one, an -- an exception for administrative exhaustion schemes. And so can you just take that directly, why that would be a bad idea?"
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1905.24,1905.96,"Yes, Your Honor."
2018.18-525,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1966.36,1970.2,"But only for one party, not the defendant."
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1970.2,1970.92,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2018.18-525,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1970.92,1975.76,"You said it would be a burden on the parties, meaning a burden on the plaintiff?"
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,1975.76,1978.56,"It would be a burden on the plaintiff, yes, Your Honor."
2018.18-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2041.2,2041.32,Would --
2018.18-525,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2041.32,2041.68,Do you think that --
2018.18-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2041.68,2042.84,Go ahead.
2018.18-525,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2042.84,2052.8,"-- if it's -- if it's just a mandatory claims processing rule, do you think that a district court would nevertheless have discretion to raise it sua sponte?"
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,2052.8,2061.32,"I think so under Day v. McDonough, Your Honor, with the one caveat that it's -- it's different than Day v. McDonough in that that was just a time calculation."
2018.18-525,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2130.2,2139.92,"Do you have any idea what percentage of the charges filed with the EEOC are resolved through a conciliation and, therefore, never have to be litigated?"
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,2139.92,2141.32,"I don't have the exact number, Your Honor."
2018.18-525,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2154.48,2155.2,Under what?
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,2155.2,2166.84,"Twenty percent, Your Honor. So I think the incentives plaintiffs have are very strong for going to the EEOC. And --"
2018.18-525,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2166.84,2180.0,"Well, if it's even 20 percent, wouldn't it be important from the perspective of the courts to require the plaintiffs to do that? That's 20 percent or 15 percent fewer cases that have to be litigated?"
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,2180.0,2181.76,"It's absolutely important, Your Honor."
2018.18-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2243.24,2244.88,What -- what would that --
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,2244.88,2245.32,-- jeopardized.
2018.18-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2245.32,2247.88,What sort of empirical evidence are you -- are you looking for?
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,2247.88,2251.24,"It would be very hard to -- to find it, Your Honor."
2018.18-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2252.24,2252.6,I know.
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,2254.76,2255.04,Yup.
2018.18-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2255.04,2262.52,"-- and, look, there's no great crisis there, there's no great crisis there, but it's -- it's hard when you think about it to try to think about how that evidence would be compiled."
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,2262.52,2263.12,Absolutely.
2018.18-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2319.2,2322.4,You -- you've looked and there -- and you -- and there's not a single case like that?
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,2322.4,2330.28,"We haven't found one, and maybe I'm misremembering right now, but I don't think we found a case that is like what I'm describing."
2018.18-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2330.28,2334.72,"Well, I guess they -- probably most of them would be unreported in the first place, I would assume."
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,2334.72,2339.28,"Probably so, Your Honor, if they were -- if there was no charge and they were coming up to the court of appeals."
2018.18-525,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2339.28,2351.08,How many cases have you find like this one where there's been a finding by a circuit court that a party has basically waived the mandatory rule?
2018.18-525,1,63127,raffi_melkonian,,2351.08,2353.0,"It -- it's not that many, but there are some."
2018.18-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2399.48,2411.56,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bond."
2018.18-525,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2411.56,2417.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Arbaugh's bright-line rule resolves this case."
2018.18-525,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2555.92,2579.28,"Well, what if there were an exhaustion requirement but the -- the agency's decision -- but the -- the losing party before the agency could get a de novo lawsuit in district court? Under those circumstances, wouldn't it -- wouldn't the inference that Congress made that jurisdictional be a reasonable one?"
2018.18-525,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2579.28,2586.8,"Not on those -- on those facts standing alone, but Congress certainly could and in some statutes has made it jurisdictional through the language it's enacted."
2018.18-525,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2618.24,2619.68,Mr. Bond?
2018.18-525,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2619.68,2620.56,Mm-hmm?
2018.18-525,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2620.56,2640.08,"What do you say to the Chief Justice's concern that this is a statute that predates Arbaugh? Now, I know you're going to tell me immediately that we've done this before and applied Arbaugh retroactively to statutes preexisting Arbaugh. But besides that argument, what rationale do you think supports us doing so?"
2018.18-525,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2640.08,2642.36,So I would point to the rationale that Arbaugh gave.
2018.18-525,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2674.68,2683.2,"Even if we apply our interpretive presumptions and all judicial decisions retroactively, I'm mean that's -- that's our consistent rule or it's supposed to be, right?"
2018.18-525,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2683.2,2687.68,"We -- we certainly do apply them to existing statutes, as you do in the extraterritoriality context."
2018.18-525,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2687.68,2692.32,"Well, our decisions are normally retroactive in their application, not merely prospective."
2018.18-525,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2692.32,2693.16,Exactly right.
2018.18-525,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2768.08,2768.64,Why would we have --
2018.18-525,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2768.64,2769.0,-- in a way --
2018.18-525,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2769.0,2770.4,-- to get into this at all?
2018.18-525,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2770.4,2775.0,"No, we don't think you need to resolve 16(c), and we're happy for the Court not to address that here in case --"
2018.18-525,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2775.0,2775.68,This is a footnote --
2018.18-525,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2775.68,2775.8,-- where it's not presented --
2018.18-525,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2775.8,2776.8,-- reserving your argument?
2018.18-525,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2776.8,2777.16,Exactly.
2018.18-525,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2843.56,2848.04,At what point must a defendant raise this? In the answer?
2018.18-525,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2848.04,2857.36,"So we understand this to be a condition precedent that is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(c), which means it must be pleaded generally but must be denied with particularity."
2018.18-525,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2979.56,2983.48,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Ms. Sinzdak."
2018.18-525,3,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,2983.48,2984.28,Thank you.
2018.18-525,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3088.2,3106.28,"How many of those are cases like this one where there was a complaint -- she started out with a complaint of, I think, gender-based discrimination and retaliation, but then in the end the claim she wanted to put forward was a religion base, so it's not that she didn't file a charge."
2018.18-525,3,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,3129.04,3134.32,So we found eight cases where there just had been no trip to the EEOC at all.
2018.18-525,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3190.28,3190.96,But that was --
2018.18-525,3,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,3190.96,3191.88,-- attempted to --
2018.18-525,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3191.88,3214.24,"That was because they gave the agency the authority to do what ordinarily district courts do, that is, the agency was the tribunal of first instance. That's an entirely different pattern. I mean, the -- the NLRB, the Social Security Administration, they all act as tribunals of first instance --"
2018.18-525,3,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,3214.24,3214.76,No --
2018.18-525,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3214.76,3223.44,-- and then the review is appellate review. Here the EEOC is not acting as any kind of first instance forum.
2018.18-525,3,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,3223.44,3228.04,"Justice Ginsburg, in McNeil that -- it was a scenario exactly like this."
2018.18-525,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3235.12,3246.76,"Then we -- that was, again, the -- suing the government, it was under the Tort Claims Act, and the government can waive or not waive sovereign immunity, as it will."
2018.18-525,3,63126,colleen_e_roh_sinzdak,,3246.76,3253.88,"And -- and -- and Justice Ginsburg, 2000e-5 does apply to the government. If there are no further questions, I would ask this Court to reverse."
2018.18-525,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3254.48,3255.32,"Thank you, counsel."
