1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,39.851,40.367,Thank you Your Honor.
1974.73-1270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,282.788,283.611,Mr. Engel?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,283.611,285.109,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,285.109,296.729,I'm puzzled by this sentence at the bottom of page 11 of your petition in page 11?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,296.729,297.87,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,297.87,310.016,You state that the Court of Appeals by ruling directed to the contrary without supporting authority intentionally created a conflict in Court of Appeals' decisions.
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,319.573,320.205,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,371.898,375.412,They explicitly disagreed with the Fourth Circuit?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,375.412,375.945,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,375.945,376.787,That's what you --
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,376.787,377.158,Well --
1974.73-1270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,377.158,378.212,And consciously and deliberately --
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,378.212,381.478,"Well, actually what I'm saying is that they misinterpreted the Fourth Circuit."
1974.73-1270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,392.737,400.344,Your theory is that the question in each case is a factual question is the plaintiff an employee of the railroad --
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,400.344,402.182,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,403.977,406.646,And that there's not a conflict in law?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,406.646,407.428,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,435.174,445.073,"Well, if that's the case, is this an appropriate case for us to grant plenary review, and if there really isn't the kind of conflict that I got the impression that was from your petition?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,445.073,455.504,"Well, the Ninth Circuit decision as its stand now creates a conflict because they misinterpreted or misread in my judgment the Fourth Circuit opinion."
1974.73-1270,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,489.347,495.949,"Mr. Engel, I take that you are supporting then the findings and conclusions that Judge Zirpoli made?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,495.949,496.844,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1270,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,496.844,507.926,And what about this language in his conclusion that this -- the work being performed by Mr. Kelley involved a non-delegable duty of the Southern Pacific?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,510.829,511.395,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1270,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,553.697,560.367,You don't think that that is the -- the pivot the Ninth Circuit's disagreement and disaffection with District Courts?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,560.367,562.175,"Well, with the Ninth -- with the Ninth Circuit --"
1974.73-1270,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,562.175,565.274,"Perhaps you drew this, did you?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,565.274,565.814,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-1270,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,641.073,644.712,"Well, the Ninth Circuit certainly referred to that non-delegable language?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,644.712,647.893,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,647.893,648.65,Mr. Engel?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,648.65,649.824,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,649.824,653.749,I have not checked these other cases you mentioned.
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,681.704,683.169,"Well, there are combinations Your Honor."
1974.73-1270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,735.962,752.992,"May I ask while I interrupted you, whether it is permissible under California law or under the Federal Act for an injured employee to receive both workman's compensation benefits or and FELA benefits?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,752.992,753.769,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1270,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,782.087,785.657,Would he be entitled to retain both benefits?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,785.657,804.482,"Well, while this is not within the preview of this appeal, I would anticipate that in any event this Court rules in favor of petitioner that what will happen is Southern Pacific will then stop the workman's compensation benefits and we will litigate that issue as to whether or not, that's appropriate or not."
1974.73-1270,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,804.482,808.984,I thought the workman's compensation came from Pacific?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,808.984,809.902,Well --
1974.73-1270,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,809.902,811.425,"Granted it's wholly on so, but it's --"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,811.425,812.005,I'm sorry.
1974.73-1270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,821.775,824.895,Because no right of subrogation?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,824.895,825.981,There is not in this case.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,828.323,833.831,"But would there be a right of what, a credit to any against any --"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,833.831,845.5,"Well, I think it's going to be complex Your Honor because that is a state right under state statute, and the rights under the FELA are not state oriented by federal oriented, and the question --"
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,845.5,851.705,"Well, I'm mere;y asking whether there be a double recovery here and I take that this is what Justice Powell is concerned about?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,851.705,852.074,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,881.634,901.265,"Would you agree that the District Court was in its mixed finding about the non-delegable duty holding that a railroad cannot under any circumstances engage an independent contractor, totally unrelated to it."
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,911.38,923.304,"Well, the impact that I find in that finding is that he was characterizing the work that was being done by Mr. Kelley as being performing in the services of the railroad."
1974.73-1270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,956.893,963.199,"Well, you said every person, I'll Limit that to a person who is unloading the car?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,963.199,963.597,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,963.597,972.798,"Hasn't the district judge said that, unloading is a function of the common carrier of the railroad and can't be passed on anybody else?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,972.798,974.148,"No, I don't think so Your Honor."
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,999.227,1000.989,The fact finding what happen?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1000.989,1002.37,Yes -- no but no yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1003.36,1004.763,By finding for it?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1004.763,1012.603,"No, what I'm saying in this case that is true, but it doesn't necessarily have to be in the next person who is working on a tri-level railroad car and falls off."
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1032.403,1035.964,But I notice that Court of Appeals did cite Sinkler.
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1038.175,1044.536,"Well, Sinkler was a case involving determination of the defendant class as opposed to the plaintiff class."
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1055.379,1058.777,"Well, you had an independent employer there as you do here?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1058.777,1059.326,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1059.326,1060.556,There it was Belt railroad --
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1060.556,1060.998,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1060.998,1065.146,And it was performing what we characterized as an operational activity --
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1065.146,1065.315,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1065.315,1071.255,"-- of the respondent railroad which was sued. Well, in light of finding [Inaudible] this situation?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1071.255,1074.764,"Well, because Sinkler dealt with in determining the defendant."
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1091.546,1093.884,And there we held -- that's right.
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1102.382,1103.219,That's right.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1103.219,1107.824,"I see and in this instance, what we have is a negligence of his employer?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1107.824,1108.352,Correct.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1108.352,1108.807,Right.
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1109.259,1110.724,We're going back the other way.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1110.724,1111.204,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1111.204,1115.009,And but there is a similarity in that both cases turn on.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1118.717,1122.103,Whether it was part of the operational activities of the respondent railroad?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1122.103,1122.631,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1122.631,1139.649,"And I would suppose that for finding for here, it doesn't seem to have been challenged in the Court of Appeals saying that, what was done here was in the regular course of its business, that is of a Southern Pacific, pursuant to its contractual responsibilities to the shipper and its tariff response."
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1139.649,1140.898,Correct.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1140.898,1145.923,"So that in any event, the operation was within the operational activities of Southern Pacific?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1145.923,1146.233,Let's say it was so found.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1146.233,1147.672,I think we [Inaudible] with that finding.
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1147.672,1151.668,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-1270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1151.668,1163.25,"In other words, having been paid for it for the unloading operation Southern Pacific would not be heard by the district judge to say that wasn't part of their employment?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1163.25,1164.016,That's correct.
1974.73-1270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1206.164,1209.943,"What page is that on in your -- I take it, it's in the appendix."
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1209.943,1213.545,"The appendix, yes Your Honor."
1974.73-1270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1223.435,1230.764,"And now, unless I don't read my Roman numerals correct, I haven't got that many pages in your appendix at least to your brief."
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1230.764,1231.448,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1974.73-1270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1233.344,1240.86,"Well, --"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1240.86,1242.928,I do believe it's attached to the brief Your Honor.
1974.73-1270,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1244.386,1252.425,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1252.425,1253.804,In the absence of any further --
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1253.804,1260.44,"May I just to ask you Mr. Engel, suppose this employer had not been wholly owned by Southern Pacific?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1260.44,1261.365,I don't' that would make difference.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1261.365,1262.104,Make any difference.
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1262.104,1264.254,No.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1264.254,1274.082,"So, it all has to turn on the fact that the -- that this employer, he was performing in the central operational activity of the railroad?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1274.082,1275.621,"Well, this particular individual."
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1278.694,1279.154,Right.
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1280.343,1280.642,Right.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1291.95,1312.326,"So, I take it if you were right, an engine that broke down and instead of one of the Southern Pacific's mechanics repairing it, Southern Pacific had hired a plumbing company and a plumber employed by that company came and repaired the boiler or the locomotive and was injured in the process."
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1314.863,1317.026,"I would say he could, but not necessarily."
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1319.521,1321.554,But a fact finding could have been made.
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1321.554,1322.042,"Yes, and --"
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1322.042,1325.835,That it was for that purposes and an employee of the railroad?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1325.835,1326.955,Correct.
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1329.216,1332.174,"What cases that we had that approach that in this Court, any?"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1332.174,1340.209,"Well, there's one that's very similar to that, where Westinghouse sold an engine to a railroad and the --"
1974.73-1270,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1340.209,1342.257,Which one is that?
1974.73-1270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1347.471,1353.759,The Court of Appeals thought it was whole -- your approach would be wholly inconsistent with the case of this Court?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1353.759,1354.928,The Ninth Circuit did.
1974.73-1270,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1354.928,1355.278,Federal?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1355.278,1356.309,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1360.569,1365.283,"Well, and you have another Court of Appeals pretty much on your side --"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1365.283,1365.416,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1365.416,1366.697,The Fourth Circuit.
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1366.697,1377.085,"And the Ninth Circuit is saying that Fourth Circuit created a new theory and we're saying that that's not accurate, and the evidence of that is the Tenth Circuit harmonized both districts didn't have any problems."
1974.73-1270,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1377.085,1382.528,Well you certainly are relying on more than one factor as I think you just suggested here?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1382.528,1383.192,Yes.
1974.73-1270,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1383.192,1387.489,"Including among other things, the longevity on the job of Mr. Kelley --"
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1387.489,1387.967,Correct.
1974.73-1270,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1387.967,1392.477,-- for doing this kind of thing over a long period?
1974.73-1270,0,39152,r_jay_engel,,1392.477,1396.735,He was also injured while he was just getting the automobile's prepared to load.
1974.73-1270,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1419.943,1423.439,"Well, I take it you are relying specifically on Baker, are you not?"

1974.73-1270,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1634.973,1635.767,I have it.
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1635.767,1636.481,I'd like to point one --

1974.73-1270,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1645.324,1651.554,I thought there where some aspects of evidence that he was subject to direction of S.P. employees.

1974.73-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.517,1731.099,"But why doesn't it -- I do not understand that your responsibility was there, doesn't mean also the right was there?"
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1731.099,1731.618,No.
1974.73-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.233,1734.139,I wish you would.
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1734.139,1737.271,"Alright, sir."
1974.73-1270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1779.491,1789.034,"Well, to take you hypothetical, I suppose it's possible that Judge Zirpoli would have found that those -- would not found it those were non-delegable duties."
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1808.813,1820.058,"We have a responsibility in control Mr. Chief Justice to see that the job got done, that was to see that railroad cars got -- became unloaded under the tariff."
1974.73-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.243,1849.295,"Well, there's something in your favor that district judge carefully avoided in so many words finding that this gentleman was an employee of the Southern Pacific?"
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1849.295,1854.288,The best thing in this case is the findings of the district judge for the Southern Pacific Company.
1974.73-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.692,1875.018,"Wait a minute, he found what?"
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1875.018,1875.343,He therefore --
1974.73-1270,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1875.343,1876.275,You misspoke yourself.
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1876.275,1877.19,I misspoke myself.
1974.73-1270,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1879.028,1881.64,Destroyed it [Attempt to Laughter]
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1881.64,1885.411,-- an employee of the Pacific Motor Trucking Company.
1974.73-1270,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1902.668,1903.515,May I suggest.
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1905.904,1906.729,No sir.
1974.73-1270,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1906.729,1912.733,"And we set up the operational activities concept as something peculiar to the FELA, didn't we?"
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1912.733,1913.122,Yes sir.
1974.73-1270,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1914.788,1920.52,I'm not sure a delegable and non-delegable are really appropriate in that context?
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1920.52,1922.681,There are two concepts so that I think it's important.
1974.73-1270,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2019.288,2022.673,That was because of the special history of the FELA and its purpose?
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2022.673,2023.168,Yes.
1974.73-1270,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2073.659,2082.062,"Now, it requires that the railroad itself direct and supervise and detail and plan and everything else the activities of the employee of the --"
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2082.062,2083.382,Which they did not do in this case.
1974.73-1270,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2083.382,2088.165,"Well, that's unless fact finding aid is to the contrary?"
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2088.165,2094.525,"The other thing -- the other class is the class of carriers, employers into the act."
1974.73-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2113.991,2118.531,"Mr. Corrigan, could I ask you -- well, I guess it just over purely mechanical question."
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2124.079,2125.075,I can explain that.
1974.73-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2125.075,2127.928,One is 28 and 29 and the others 161.
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2133.4,2135.893,The findings in the low number pages --
1974.73-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2135.893,2137.895,Page 28 and 29?
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2137.895,2141.076,-- are the findings as signed by the Court.
1974.73-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2157.955,2158.076,So that --
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2158.076,2159.071,He doesn't work for railroad.
1974.73-1270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2159.071,2163.068,What then the findings at 161 of the appendix weren't ever a signed by the District Court?
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2163.068,2163.54,"No, sir."
1974.73-1270,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2164.769,2178.286,"I notice two and that is, defendant Southern Pacific binds through agreement with Pacific had the right to exercise control over the details of the work being performed by the plaintiff at the time the accident occurred?"
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2178.286,2179.472,That was the proposed findings.
1974.73-1270,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2179.472,2186.344,"Yeah, that's what I say that's one that was rejected, unless somebody didn't -- fact finding aid which was signed."
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2186.344,2189.815,Yes sir.
1974.73-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2191.165,2201.335,In Sinkler where the railroad's employees was hurt in the process of switching the operations carried on by the Belt Railroad --
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2201.335,2201.985,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.985,2204.422,-- and independent contractor.
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2219.063,2222.449,"Well, you picked a very unusual fact situation."
1974.73-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2227.633,2236.314,"I know, but I know -- but, it would have been the FELA -- the railroad would have been liable -- one railroad would have been liable."
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2237.924,2241.882,"Well, both railroads, if --"
1974.73-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2241.882,2242.841,Which --
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2242.841,2244.9,Both railroad -- here's what would happen.
1974.73-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.7,2249.49,"Oh, I understand that."
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2250.086,2250.715,Alright.
1974.73-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.022,2251.869,How about the other railroad?
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2251.869,2270.342,"The other railroad would be responsible because it gave up an operational activity to the Belt Railroad and because it gave up an operational activity to the Belt Railroad, it cannot escape the consequences action, to its own employees Mr. Justice White."
1974.73-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2270.342,2274.205,"Well, how about to the Belt Railroad support?"
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2275.264,2284.27,"Well, the Missouri Pacific under those facts would be liable to the Belt Railroad's employees who are injured because the Belt Railroad's employees were not under their control."
1974.73-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2293.787,2304.354,"Even though for purposes, they act the fellow employee doctrine reached the Belt Railway in Sinkler?"
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2304.354,2307.086,"I'm sorry, sir."
1974.73-1270,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.086,2314.68,"Well, the Belt Railway for some purposes is held identical with the other railroad?"
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2314.68,2321.08,Only for purposes -- only be -- and I was about to get to that and I think I can explain it this way Mr. Justice White.
1974.73-1270,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2321.08,2323.083,"Oh, that was an interpretation of the word agent."
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2323.71,2326.581,That's the next thing I want to come to that's very important.

1974.73-1270,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2453.886,2456.142,Is there a prospect of the double --
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2456.142,2456.732,What's that sir?
1974.73-1270,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2456.732,2460.796,"If there were a reversal here, would there be a prospect of the double recovery?"
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2460.796,2467.962,"Well, I'm sure the Pacific Motor Trucking Company would -- you've asked a question for which I can't find any legal authority one way or another."
1974.73-1270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2467.962,2471.228,Your friend said he hope so and he was then tried the thing how it evolved?
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2471.228,2477.681,"And I'm sure the Pacific Motor Trucking Company would work Your Honor on the opposite, for the opposite result."
1974.73-1270,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2675.993,2692.468,"Mr. Corrigan, if you prevail here, I suppose you think it that the Ninth Circuit opinion does not open the way to railroads avoiding FELA liability by contracting out various things such as maintenance and the like?"

1974.73-1270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2743.893,2745.471,But some part of the act then.
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2745.471,2745.781,Yes.
1974.73-1270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2913.551,2928.468,"And I don't know of Mr. Engel are there any -- Mr. Corrigan, whether there are any Pullman cars left anymore, but a Pullman car is typically a railroad function, is it not?"
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2928.468,2931.784,"Well, this Court -- this Court said no and --"
1974.73-1270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2931.784,2936.062,"Well, they didn't say it wasn't the railroad function."
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2936.062,2949.804,"But what they said -- what this Court said in Robinson versus Baltimore Ohio in 1915, that there are many things that happen on the railroad that are not really railroading in the sense that Congress intended in the Federal Employers' Liability Act."
1974.73-1270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2949.804,2951.8,"Well, let me change my question."
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2954.657,2960.124,"It's a common carrier function for railroad to pull a Pullman car and they are still Pullman cars, yes sir."
1974.73-1270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2960.124,2963.023,And the car looks from the outside much like all the cars?
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2963.023,2963.167,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2963.167,2970.403,"But the court held, the Pullman car employees were not if I recall it correctly, where not employees of the railroad."
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2970.403,2973.634,"Yes sir, and didn't come under the Act."
1974.73-1270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2973.634,2976.075,And more important did not come under the Act?
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2976.075,2976.299,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2976.299,2984.766,But it would have been entirely appropriate would it not for Congress to have put Pullman car employees under the Act since they are pulled by the same engine?
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2984.766,2985.663,"That's -- yes, sir."
1974.73-1270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3210.667,3222.671,Was there anything in the Edwards case which I see you how reason to be familiar with that indicated that the Pacific Fruit Express was owned by one or a combination of railroads?
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3222.671,3230.979,It was on 50% by the Southern Pacific Transportation Company and 50% by the Union Pacific Railroad Company.
1974.73-1270,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3232.129,3233.395,"You argued it, didn't you?"
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3233.395,3233.868,"Yes, sir."
1974.73-1270,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3233.868,3234.911,That's what I like this suit?
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3234.911,3239.185,"Yes, I like that case, judge, Your Honor. [Attempt to Laughter] I'm sorry."
1974.73-1270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3239.185,3240.604,We apparently lost the dissenting opinions in that case.
1974.73-1270,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3242.55,3249.233,"Your Honor, it was [Attempt to Laughter] There's one other thing."
1974.73-1270,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3263.461,3264.763,Thank you Mr. Corrigan.
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3267.725,3270.626,"Briefly, Your Honors."
1974.73-1270,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3296.382,3300.529,"No, but he did reject your fact finding too, didn't he?"
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3300.529,3302.629,"Well, there were some that he did reject Your Honor."
1974.73-1270,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3302.629,3306.83,"Oh I mean, that's the one would seems to me have some relevance here."
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3312.284,3312.618,Yes.
1974.73-1270,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3330.284,3344.43,Doesn't -- that didn't quite a strong argument as it would be if he had not been presented with a -- an explicit finding about employment and rejected it or at least failed to adopt it.
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3344.43,3349.598,"Well Your Honor, he rejected my use of putting “employee” in quotes as a conclusion of law."
1974.73-1270,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3349.598,3355.534,You could have just taken the quotation marks out if you wanted to find that you -- your man was an employee?
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3355.534,3370.804,"And what he did though Your Honor is that change the language of my conclusion of law and added a fact that I or fact -- a conclusion of fact that I had not proposed, and that was his proposed or his finding number 9, which specific and I had not offered that."
1974.73-1270,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3380.23,3383.158,He never said that he was an employee?
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3383.158,3384.004,"No, Your Honor and because --"
1974.73-1270,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3384.004,3385.861,"So, he rejected that?"
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3385.861,3391.175,"He rejected my conclusion of law where the term employee was used, yes."
1974.73-1270,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3391.175,3394.709,"And that's it, the word that's used in the statute?"
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3394.709,3395.483,Yes.
1974.73-1270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3476.397,3485.486,"But -- Mr. Engel, your -- their conclusion of law you proposed at 163 was that the plaintiff was an employee of the defendant?"
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3485.486,3486.873,"In quotes, yes."
1974.73-1270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3486.873,3500.232,"The conclusion that Judge Zirpoli reached, the conclusion of law, on page 30 of the appendix, is really quite a different reasoning process, isn't it than yours is relying on Baker versus Texas in Pacific?"
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3500.232,3509.696,"Well, I don't think so Your Honor because Baker versus Texas, it said it's a factual determination depending on what the work that was being performed at the time of a given injury."
1974.73-1270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3519.742,3524.944,"But that's unwilling to say that he that -- your man was an employee of Southern Pacific, Judge Zirpoli was?"
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3524.944,3526.404,That's correct.
1974.73-1270,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3560.173,3567.622,But didn't he go through that process and then include like the Act requires that this man was an employee of Southern Pacific?
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3567.622,3570.145,"Well, why he chose to characterize it by the nature of --"
1974.73-1270,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3570.145,3572.414,Better than reject you finding.
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3572.414,3573.868,"Well Your Honor, I don't know."
1974.73-1270,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3576.658,3583.968,"Well, I suppose that's -- you have it an award in favor of your man that some place in it if finding that he was before the trial."
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3583.968,3590.602,"Well he is certainly, we have to assume that the judge is cognizant of what the statute reads and he has cited the statute in his conclusions of law."
1974.73-1270,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3590.602,3591.97,"He did make an award, didn't he?"
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3591.97,3592.458,Yes.
1974.73-1270,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3592.458,3592.982,Alright.
1974.73-1270,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3593.077,3594.187,Was it dollar award?
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3594.187,3595.237,Yes.
1974.73-1270,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3595.237,3605.914,"And the difference is in the Smith case, the Court of Appeals explicitly said that the plaintiff there was not an employee and then they went ahead and said nonetheless, he is covered by the Act."
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3605.914,3607.66,"Well, that's how Southern Pacific characterizes --"
1974.73-1270,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3607.66,3611.202,"Well, I just read the opinion myself and I would think that it would be helpful to you?"
1974.73-1270,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3611.202,3612.671,"I would think so, too."
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3612.671,3627.226,What I'm saying is that what Smith said and what the District Court here said is that depending on the type of work that the person was doing as in Smith that he does fall within the FELA and Smith recognized that --
1974.73-1270,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3627.226,3628.933,"Well, to fall within the FELA --"
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3628.933,3629.025,Yes.
1974.73-1270,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3629.025,3632.558,-- everybody agrees to chapter the “employee”.
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3632.558,3642.884,And there is no --the history of having employees of independent contractors covered by the FELA is not a new concept and that's what they wish to abolish.
1974.73-1270,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3642.884,3652.679,Is it of any significance at all or relevance that Kelley has never recognized himself has an employee of the railroad?
1974.73-1270,2,39152,r_jay_engel,,3652.679,3668.93,"Well, the Restatement sets down some 13 factors anyone of which can be controlling and no one of which is controlling and one them is that what the parties understand the relationship whether he thinks regarding who he thinks is employed by or who they think is their employee."
1974.73-1270,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3690.223,3690.888,Thank you gentlemen.
