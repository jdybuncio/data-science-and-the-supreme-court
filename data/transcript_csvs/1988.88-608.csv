1988.88-608,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.778,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-608, Independent Federation of of Flight Attendants v. Anne B. Zipes."
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,9.778,16.222,Thank you.
1988.88-608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,581.91,598.273,"Mr. Fehr, does it make any difference under your equitable theory if an intervenor comes in and substantially, by virtue of the intervention, prolongs the litigation and delays relief to the plaintiffs in the case?"
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,601.766,603.128,I don't think so.
1988.88-608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,611.315,618.448,But I thought you were urging some equitable discretion on the part of the trial court in awarding fees.
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,618.448,619.219,"Well, I think--"
1988.88-608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,619.219,628.215,"Even if you're asserting the intervenor's own rights, are there circumstances which might justify the award of fees?"
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,640.814,657.517,"--Well, if the intervenor is extending... I don't what you mean by deliberately... but if the intervenor is only extending the litigation in order to have its claim litigated, I don't think that's an equitable basis upon which to subject that intervenor to an almost automatic award of attorney's fees."
1988.88-608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,671.795,674.649,"Well, maybe it's a weak claim but not frivolous."
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,674.649,680.891,"--It's an awfully difficult judgment to draw, as the government indicated in its amicus brief."
1988.88-608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,680.891,685.556,Should there be discretion in the district court to consider those factors?
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,685.556,689.927,"Perhaps there should be some discretion, but I don't think any such discretion was exercised here."
1988.88-608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,689.927,691.84,They--
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,710.495,711.254,"Well, that's--"
1988.88-608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,711.254,717.529,Do you think that that intervenor could be treated like a defendant for attorney's fees?
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,717.529,723.114,"--In essence, I think you're posing the facts of the Charles case which is pending on certiorari."
1988.88-608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,747.2,765.163,"Well, but you must have a position, I assume, on my proposition, which is that the intervenor is permitted lawfully to intervene but not to assert any right of its own as such."
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,765.163,777.134,"I can see drawing a distinction between individuals that have a right to intervene and permissive intervention where an individual is just assisting the state, though that person's rights are not affected."
1988.88-608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,810.395,814.848,Opposing... you are opposing in this case the plaintiffs in a lawsuit?
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,814.848,821.032,--We were opposing only the grant of seniority to the plaintiffs because of the effect we believe that would have upon our members.
1988.88-608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.032,826.668,So you sought to defeat a claim that the plaintiffs had been making throughout the lawsuit.
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,826.668,831.088,We sought to defeat their attempt to get seniority through the settlement.
1988.88-608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,831.088,837.623,"And up... up to a point, TWA was making the same claim, wasn't it?"
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,837.623,840.325,Certainly.
1988.88-608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.785,841.016,Until they settled.
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,841.016,843.129,--was saying that the plaintiffs were entitled to no relief.
1988.88-608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,844.258,844.429,And so--
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,844.429,845.62,--settled--
1988.88-608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,845.62,847.503,--why shouldn't we treat you as a defendant.
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,847.503,848.012,--Because--
1988.88-608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,848.012,849.594,Like the TWA?
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,849.594,852.867,"--Because we didn't do anything wrong, Justice White."
1988.88-608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,852.867,853.367,Uh-huh.
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,853.367,855.288,And... there's something--
1988.88-608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.288,860.651,"Well, that may... that may be so, but you sought to defeat these plaintiffs' claim and you lost."
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,860.651,866.107,--But there's something fundamentally wrong here where both back pay and seniority--
1988.88-608,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,866.107,866.625,Right.
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,866.625,871.79,--are ordinarily awarded to successful plaintiffs absent compelling equitable reasons to the contrary.
1988.88-608,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.471,897.508,IFFA took no position on the claim of the female flight attendants against TWA that they'd been unlawfully discriminated against?
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,897.508,900.33,"No, we did not."
1988.88-608,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,906.717,908.55,If the remedy of discrimination were found?
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,908.55,910.182,--Right.
1988.88-608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,915.967,919.808,"Now, presumably you weren't bound by the settlement agreement?"
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,928.244,933.51,"Well, I think that's arguable, depending upon the Martin decision that's pending, if I understand what's going on there."
1988.88-608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,933.51,936.842,Would it be your position that you could do that?
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,936.842,940.512,"I haven't really studied that question, and there was really--"
1988.88-608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,940.512,944.827,But what if that were the situation and you then... the union filed a separate suit?
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,954.514,956.687,--Only because the union was a plaintiff in this--
1988.88-608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,956.687,956.827,Right.
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,956.827,957.757,"--instance, it is different for plaintiffs?"
1988.88-608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,957.757,958.358,Right.
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,958.358,962.451,"I suppose that is arguably true, and we pointed that out in our briefs."
1988.88-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.907,995.386,"We would certainly rather, you would think, favor a rule that would induce you to come in as soon as possible and get the whole thing resolved in one fell swoop, right?"
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,995.386,995.687,I would certainly agree with that.
1988.88-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.687,996.037,Yeah.
1988.88-608,0,41322,steven_a_fehr,,996.037,1010.397,"In Teamsters, the Court talked about remedial proceedings which involve imprecision and approximation, and the delicate task of adjusting the interest between the discriminatees and the legitimate expectations of the incumbents."
1988.88-608,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1388.81,1391.172,"Thank you, Mr. Fehr."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1392.705,1395.824,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1489.673,1500.492,"But, Mr. Hartunian, certainly the Christiansburg decision suggests that the term ""prevailing party"" may be read one way in one case and another way in another, depending on the circumstances."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1500.492,1500.672,Indeed.
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1508.528,1510.859,Whether you will get... the standard for awarding--
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1510.859,1510.99,--Yes.
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1510.99,1511.851,--an attorney's fee.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1511.851,1512.041,Yes.
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1550.638,1551.938,That's reasonable enough.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1556.542,1557.293,Indeed.
1988.88-608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1615.99,1624.764,"Yeah, but, of course, this Court has read a limitation into that statute as far as limiting the award of attorney's fees to prevailing defendants."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1624.764,1626.774,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1626.774,1630.076,"So, you can't just rely on the literal language of the statute, it seems to me."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1630.076,1635.68,There... we're relying on the literal language of the statute to the extent of really a different point.
1988.88-608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1642.525,1643.667,Let me ask you this.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1663.408,1667.643,"There would... there would be attorney's fees to the same extent, as far as I'm concerned."
1988.88-608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1667.643,1668.544,Assuming it's not frivolous.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1668.544,1677.489,"Yes, assuming it's not frivolous, I would say that the result ought to be not whether a party is named as a plaintiff under the federal rules or a defendant or--"
1988.88-608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1677.489,1684.442,"But the result, in fact, under existing precedence would be no attorney's fees in that situation?"
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1684.442,1688.526,--I don't think that the union could even bring a case like that because I think it would be unfounded.
1988.88-608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1688.526,1688.936,"Well, let's assume it could."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1703.785,1710.56,I have to picture such a case as involving exactly the same issues in exactly the same kind of proceeding that we had in this case.
1988.88-608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1731.916,1734.888,Can you cite any case that would have so determined?
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1734.888,1737.953,--The statute says that in any proceeding--
1988.88-608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1737.953,1740.792,Can you cite any case that has interpreted the statute that way?
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1740.792,1755.701,"--I don't believe that any case has ever occurred in which a union became a plaintiff under the federal rules and sued some victim of Title VII, asserting that the benefits about to be given to them exceeded what the statute authorized."
1988.88-608,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1789.206,1790.796,But you wouldn't have to pay the fees.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1790.796,1792.967,We wouldn't have to pay fees.
1988.88-608,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1802.745,1804.715,"Well, then we're back to where we started."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1814.194,1821.089,"--Well, what... Justice Kennedy, what I'm saying is that the statute says that attorney's fees are awarded as part of the costs."
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.941,1875.986,"But isn't... Mr. Hartunian, isn't there a provision even in the standard cost statute that costs shall be awarded as a matter of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs?"
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1875.986,1877.909,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1877.909,1879.389,So there's discretion even in that area.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1879.389,1883.172,"Absolutely there is discretion, and we don't say there is not discretion."
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1920.357,1929.123,Do you... Do you feel that the Seventh Circuit recognized this as a matter where the district court had discretion to award or not award fees against the union?
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1931.674,1936.218,"Oh, the district court not only thought it had discretion, but the district court exercised it."
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1964.46,1972.217,"But did he take... did the district court take into consideration, as a special factor, that this was an intervenor and not a defendant?"
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1972.217,1974.657,--He... no.
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1982.372,1994.831,"So then you say, oh, sure, the court has discretion, but it should not make any special allowance for the fact that the intervenor... that it was an intervenor here rather than a defendant, or that the intervenor had not violated the law?"
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,1994.831,1995.302,--That's right.
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.812,2068.483,I don't think they go quite that far.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2073.368,2075.489,"Yes, that's... Justice Scalia, that's right."
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2100.736,2115.637,Is there any support for the proposition that you cannot impose fees upon an intervenor whose intervention has in no way prolonged the suit or caused any additional expenses?
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2115.637,2119.34,"Well, of course, this case is on in which they did prolong it."
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.34,2119.661,I understand it.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2145.309,2146.621,I don't even think you need to.
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2147.913,2148.253,Okay.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2148.253,2152.707,"--of the fee-shifting, statute that it's only when fees are incurred that there be anything awarded--"
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.707,2154.959,"Oh, expenses have been incurred in the suit."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2162.746,2168.752,"--Well, then I don't see how a plaintiff could complain or could... could ask for any fee award under those circumstances."
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.752,2168.781,He could... well--
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2168.781,2170.793,"And I think the answer is, yes, I agree entirely."
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.793,2173.755,--Can a court split the fee award between the defendant and the intervenor?
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2176.517,2181.93,I'm trying to imagine a set of... I understand the concept.
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2183.621,2184.502,"Well, you'd say no, I think."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2197.602,2197.782,--Right.
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2197.782,2202.817,"So, you have to acknowledge that there is room under this statute to have some absolutes."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2206.28,2225.46,"I... I think the answer to the question whether the marginal costs imposed by an intervenor should be taken into account, or where the marginal extra costs imposed by the intervenor are zero, namely that it would have been the same amount of effort and work by the plaintiff irrespective of the intervenor's presence."
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2234.656,2234.887,But why is that?
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2250.74,2258.324,"Because in that instance, Justice Scalia, in the hypothetical we just talked about, the plaintiff did not prevail against the intervenor."
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2266.311,2266.571,Why not?
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2272.586,2276.74,The... the intervenor made the same argument that the defendant did?
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2276.74,2276.9,The same argument.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2277.08,2278.713,So he just uttered redundant things?
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.713,2278.943,Yes.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2279.795,2285.217,"Well, if they literally both occupied the same position--"
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.217,2287.12,You'd award the fee against both of them?
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2287.54,2288.67,--I might very well.
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2321.604,2323.237,One of them was guilty of a violation of law--
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2323.237,2323.387,--Yes.
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2323.387,2324.378,--and the other one wasn't.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2326.969,2329.333,Because Congress made no such distinction.
1988.88-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2331.346,2342.686,"--The question is whether Congress meant to exclude the courts from taking that distinction into account within the word may, whether that's one of the discretionary factors the courts can consider."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2342.686,2357.054,"Well, since the court... since Congress used the language it did, without bringing about any special exemptions, I think it follows from that that Congress cannot be taken to have intended any blunderbuss categorical exemption."
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2385.525,2392.64,"Well, certainly, in Newman v. Piggy Park, the Court interpreted the statute somewhat differently than it was written."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2405.291,2409.493,"In so doing, this Court was being faithful to Congress' expressed intentions."
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2409.493,2412.685,"Well, it certainly wasn't necessarily being faithful to the statutory language."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2412.685,2419.401,In a sense it was because the question of discretion is always one in which this Court sets standards.
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2419.401,2429.566,"Well, then... okay, then if the question of discretion is always one in which this Court sets standards, why the standard in Piggy Park but not the standard in this case?"
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2429.566,2435.96,"The standard being sought in this case is hardly a standard, but rather a categorical exemption."
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.111,2440.514,It certainly... it's no more categorical than the rule in Newman v. Piggy Park.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2440.514,2443.457,"--Yes, it is."
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2467.674,2478.132,"Well, what... what if we tailor that a little bit and said, just like in Newman v. Piggy Park, that ordinarily in a situation like that you would not award a fee against the defendant?"
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2479.611,2483.374,--Not at all because that doesn't meet with with Congress' approval.
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2484.826,2488.049,"Well, Congress never said what we said in Piggy Park."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2488.049,2489.04,"Yes, they did."
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2489.962,2492.022,Congress in this statute did not say it.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2492.022,2492.993,Not in the statute.
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2493.544,2493.774,No.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2493.774,2508.577,"But, Mr. Chief Justice, what Congress intended was very clear, as was gleaned from... as Piggy Park gleaned from the Congressional expression, that under ordinary circumstances a plaintiff should get its fees because of the underlying Congressional purpose."
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2513.929,2517.952,--simply read something into the statute that was not on the face of the statute?
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2517.952,2519.212,I agree with that.
1988.88-608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2530.488,2533.77,"Well, Mr. Hartunian, there is only one wrongdoer here, isn't there?"
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2533.77,2536.283,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1988.88-608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2537.354,2545.321,And the problem wouldn't have existed but for the rules that TWA adopted here.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2545.321,2546.413,"Yes, that's correct."
1988.88-608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2546.413,2555.389,"And, surely, the discretion of the district court should extend, and ordinarily would extend to take that into account, I would think."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2555.389,2569.249,"In order to take into account the fact that the entire lawsuit was made necessary only because of the wrong of TWA, and laying the blame at TWA's feet for everything that happened thereafter, has some logical appeal to it."
1988.88-608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2582.326,2587.923,"Well, if you... if you reserved, perhaps, some room for discretion nonetheless."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2600.332,2611.738,"Justice O'Connor, it makes sense to require a defendant to pay a plaintiff's fees for all of the litigation that a defendant can reasonably anticipate at the moment it commits the wrong."
1988.88-608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2638.248,2652.947,"Well, but I would... I would think it would be completely foreseeable by the employer that a union would want to, or feel it had to, defend the seniority rights of... of the non-class plaintiffs here."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2654.259,2654.8,--I agree with that.
1988.88-608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2654.8,2657.231,--was completely foreseeable at the outset.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2657.231,2657.421,I agree with that.
1988.88-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2873.475,2876.597,Have... could you have brought the union in the case?
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2876.597,2877.298,--Could we have?
1988.88-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.298,2877.599,Yes.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2877.599,2883.305,"We had no... we had no complaint against the union, Justice White."
1988.88-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2883.305,2889.979,"Well, you knew that... you certainly knew... I thought said a while ago that the union would probably defend the seniority."
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2889.979,2898.544,"Oh, we... oh, Justice White, when the settlement was entered into... and, by the way, the settlement did not purport to give any retroactive seniority--"
1988.88-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2898.544,2898.875,Yes.
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2898.875,2902.208,--we invited... we went before the court and said as we--
1988.88-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2902.208,2902.348,How do you invite?
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2903.369,2903.549,--Yes.
1988.88-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2903.549,2904.5,But could you have made them a party?
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2904.5,2907.472,"Well, I don't see where the distinction is important."
1988.88-608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2921.523,2922.455,"Well, what if you... what if you had tried?"
1988.88-608,1,16178,aram_a_hartunian,,2934.893,2940.99,--If we had thought it necessary... and we didn't... we would have served them with a summons and made them a defendant.
1988.88-608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3033.708,3038.039,"--Thank you, Mr. Hartunian."
1988.88-608,2,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3039.612,3040.721,I do.
1988.88-608,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3082.849,3088.085,"Mr. Fehr, how does... I'm not sure this... this works, but I think it works."
1988.88-608,2,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3114.924,3119.757,I'm not sure I totally understand the question--
1988.88-608,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3119.757,3120.869,Or does it--
1988.88-608,2,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3120.869,3121.039,--but I would think--
1988.88-608,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3121.039,3124.211,--get all the fees against TWA who wanted to get out of this--
1988.88-608,2,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3124.211,3124.351,--I think--
1988.88-608,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3124.351,3124.872,--thing by pleading guilty?
1988.88-608,2,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3124.872,3135.33,"--wherever possible, it is appropriate to shift the requirement for fees to the wrongdoer, which is the party who injured the plaintiffs and the party who injured the innocent third parties only slightly less directly."
1988.88-608,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3135.33,3136.562,"Yeah, but TWA says, ""I'm guilty""."
1988.88-608,2,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3138.194,3138.993,"Well, I think--"
1988.88-608,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3138.993,3139.143,"But the union says,"
1988.88-608,2,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3143.638,3152.426,"--But TWA could certainly stipulate to facts which would demonstrate its guilt, and the union would be limited into objecting to whatever its legally cognizable interests were."
1988.88-608,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3156.519,3163.866,"But, yet, the union could argue, even if TWA decides not to, that there's no violation of the statute."
1988.88-608,2,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3163.866,3166.297,I suppose so.
1988.88-608,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3166.297,3176.803,"And there... there, certainly their equitable position is regarding an award of fee... in that situation... would be somewhat less appealing than one where... which has not prolonged the litigation on... on the merit."
1988.88-608,2,41322,steven_a_fehr,,3176.803,3177.735,Sure.
1988.88-608,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3373.765,3376.799,"Thank you, Mr. Fehr."
