1974.74-363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.086,"We'll hear arguments next in United States against Reliable Transfer, 74-363."
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,37.708,40.821,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,613.163,616.201,Was there any damage to light or was it just to the tanker?
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,616.201,619.997,I think there was no damage to the light.
1974.74-363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,932.372,944.721,"Well, doesn't the divided damages rule at least make it easier to settle these cases so there is less judicial time taken up with trying to figure out whether you are 65% at fault or 35% at fault?"
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,944.721,950.136,"That was a point which was discussed at some length, I recall in the briefs filed in San Jacinto."
1974.74-363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1044.906,1047.425,They're unfair because of the rule.
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1047.425,1050.311,"That's right, that's right."
1974.74-363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1312.701,1322.243,I suppose all we could decide in this case if we followed your suggestion is that 75:25 fault means 75:25 division of damage.
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1322.243,1323.378,"That's right, that's --"
1974.74-363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1323.378,1324.911,We wouldn't write a statute I suppose?
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1324.911,1330.369,"No, that's right, and that's precisely what we are asking for."
1974.74-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.317,1531.318,"[Inaudible] automatically mean that in addition to overruling the divided damage, equal division of damages rule in cases of mutual fault, does it also mean that imposing the rule of proportional damages or division of damages in accordance with fault or the alternative is – I suppose to say will just – or rules of contributory negligence?"
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1531.318,1534.583,"Well of course that, this Court could do that."
1974.74-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.837,1544.899,"Well just overruling the, overruling the Harrisburg wouldn't get you to the --"
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1544.899,1547.62,The Schooner Catherine – the Schooner Catherine.
1974.74-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1547.62,1548.054,That's right.
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1548.054,1555.32,"Yes, no, that's right, simply overruling the Schooner Catherine would not get us where we feel we should be in this case."
1974.74-363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1565.513,1570.453,"Except with the law of admiralty generally, in personal injury and death cases it has been one of --"
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1570.453,1571.064,Apportioning fault --
1974.74-363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1571.064,1572.015,Apportioning the fault.
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1572.015,1572.41,"Yes, that's right."
1974.74-363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1572.41,1576.147,The law of contributory negligence is unknown to the law of admiralty.
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1576.147,1577.857,"Yes, that is correct, yes --"
1974.74-363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1577.857,1589.42,"Is there any difference, maybe like, you would like this Court to say the rule henceforth shall be that which was agreed upon by convention of 1912, not yet ratified by the [Inaudible]"
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1589.42,1590.632,"That's right, essentially what we were asking you --"
1974.74-363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1590.632,1594.155,"You want to put us on parity with the other major maritime, is it that --?"
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1594.155,1605.756,"That is correct, we are asking that this Court move away from the rule of divided damages in light of the movement of the rest of the world, and the problems which that has occasioned, not --"
1974.74-363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1605.756,1610.763,Specifically the type of rule as it's now stated in the 1912 convention.
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1610.763,1611.02,"Yes, that's correct --"
1974.74-363,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1611.02,1612.398,"In that section you gave us, is it correct?"
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1612.398,1614.093,"Yes, the first paragraph of Article 4."
1974.74-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1614.093,1619.798,[Inaudible]
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1619.798,1621.007,"Yes, that is correct."
1974.74-363,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1621.007,1623.968,Plus the rest of American admiralty law?
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1623.968,1627.596,"Yes, that is right, and I want to emphasize at that point."
1974.74-363,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1654.248,1661.841,"Mr. Rupp, the government in the courts below relied also on the doctrine of last cleared chance."
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1664.381,1665.085,"No, we are not."
1974.74-363,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1678.937,1681.603,"There is good deal of equity in it though, isn't there?"
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1681.603,1684.786,There may well be.
1974.74-363,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1684.786,1705.25,"Mr. Rupp, I couldn't hear Mr. Justice Powell's question, and I hope this isn't really repetitive, is the government's position here consistent in your estimation with trend toward no fault insurance?"
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1705.25,1715.004,"Well, I am not as conversion as no fault insurance as I might be, I think probably not."
1974.74-363,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1751.773,1764.164,"I notice there are no amicus briefs filed, does this indicate in your view that the insurance industry is not very concerned about the present state of affairs?"
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1764.164,1766.205,It does indeed.
1974.74-363,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1808.029,1811.079,That's why you say there are no real support there?
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1811.079,1819.782,"No real support for -- oh, for opposition. Perhaps they were prepared to rely on us.[Attempt to Laughter]"
1974.74-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.782,1826.854,Is that something [Inaudible]
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1826.854,1836.737,"I think not, we attempted to set that out as clearly as we could and in some detail in our brief."
1974.74-363,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.622,1854.257,[Inaudible]
1974.74-363,0,32657,john_p_rupp,,1854.257,1858.613,"No, there is absolutely not – yes --"
1974.74-363,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1858.613,1860.35,Thank you Mr. Rupp.
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,1863.142,1868.205,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-363,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1889.888,1892.802,You don't think it's just legislative inertia?
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,1892.802,1898.702,"I doubt it very much, because Congress has been very active in legislating in this area, the admiralty."
1974.74-363,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1993.112,2002.147,"Well, you would agree I think, that in some cases, it's more readily done than in others?"
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2002.147,2019.016,"Yes, and in those cases where it's evident that one is very slightly at fault, then you don't give him a recovery, and you don't hold him liable, I should say don't hold him liable."
1974.74-363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2180.22,2184.007,You think 50-50 is unjust to those?
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2184.007,2208.653,"In a case like this, where the negligence was entirely the government's or well whoever it may be, in such a case, ot the entire damage would be borne by the person who is less negligent, and that was the determination of several cases by this Court, where they held the violation of the duty cast upon the violator, was the complete responsibility for the consequences."
1974.74-363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2208.653,2211.59,Do you still want to get off with 50%?
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2212.917,2214.045,"No, I am not."
1974.74-363,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2220.178,2221.614,[Voice Overlap] cross-petitioner here?
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2221.614,2234.754,"We couldn't have been a cross-petitioner here, because I don't think under Rule 19, we could have responsively petitioned this Court to consider this case on determination of who is more liable than the other."
1974.74-363,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2244.437,2249.782,"Mr. Mintz, did I understand you to say that the fault was entirely that of the Coast Guard?"
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2249.782,2251.062,Yes.
1974.74-363,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2251.062,2252.986,"The district judge found to the contrary, didn't he?"
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2252.986,2254.204,"No, he didn't."
1974.74-363,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2254.204,2254.811,But he said --
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2254.811,2256.331,He is inconsistent.
1974.74-363,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2266.185,2271.475,You think this is a conclusion that fault of the vessel was more egregious than the fault of the Coast Guard?
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2271.475,2280.742,"Yes, I think it is where the evidentiary finding is, that but-for the fault of the government, this would not have happened, that his evidentiary finding."
1974.74-363,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2280.742,2282.957,Where is it?
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2282.957,2286.146,"In this decision, repeated twice."
1974.74-363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2300.355,2311.676,"Any time you have a finding of negligence plus approximate cause on the part of two parties to an accident, they are both responsible to a degree, I think?"
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2311.676,2325.783,"But what I am saying Your Honor is that where the judge determines, that for the negligence of the government, there would have been no accident, then there is no causative negligence on the part of the one who has been hurt."
1974.74-363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2325.783,2327.544,I just don't follow you on that at all.
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2334.742,2339.504,"No, because the master's fault was occasioned by the absence of the light."
1974.74-363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2359.191,2374.986,"But that's kind of a but-for causation type of thing, that even though it's a fairly minor fault, that you can say, that but-for the government's fault, it wouldn't have happened, even though your man was very far field from normal care after he acted on his own?"
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2374.986,2378.343,But why was he where he was?
1974.74-363,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.932,2393.21,"But that but-for type of causation as a final conclusion has been rejected in almost every branch of jurisprudence, hasn't it?"
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2393.21,2405.346,"Well, I am not -- I don't know that at all, and I don't see that if you say that's not a finding of facts, I think 75 and 25 are not findings of fact either."
1974.74-363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2405.346,2409.273,Then I read from the Court of Appeals opinion.
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2423.383,2424.315,"Yes, I am --"
1974.74-363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2424.315,2428.175,You will say that's the finding of the court that you were right?
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2428.175,2440.081,"No, if -- [Voice Overlap] No, the court was saying [Voice Overlap] I rely on the finding of Judge Judd that but for the negligence of the government, this accident would not have happened."
1974.74-363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2440.081,2440.992,Which the Court of Appeals --
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2440.992,2444.257,"And the Court of Appeals said, yes, a matter of commonsense."
1974.74-363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2444.257,2449.218,Where is this [Inaudible] I find --
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2449.218,2449.461,It's there on --
1974.74-363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2449.461,2451.323,This is the other one.
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2451.323,2453.058,The Court found as the Court of Appeals.
1974.74-363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2475.945,2479.033,It's in the next paragraph after saying which is its privilege.
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2479.033,2480.072,That's correct.
1974.74-363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2493.126,2495.656,What was he talking about there?
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2502.553,2505.535,"Well, I don't know what he is talking about the Last clear chance."
1974.74-363,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2505.535,2509.89,Further down in the paragraph you will see it.
1974.74-363,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2519.751,2528.575,There's general inconsistency in the judge's findings and statements?
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2528.575,2529.522,Is there any inconsistency?
1974.74-363,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2529.522,2530.608,"In general, inconsistency."
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2530.608,2533.861,"I think there is, I think there is, that now --"
1974.74-363,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2533.861,2534.95,[Inaudible]
1974.74-363,1,19654,copal_mintz,,2534.95,2537.817,"It does sir, it does."
1974.74-363,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2909.667,2910.264,Thank you Gentlemen.
