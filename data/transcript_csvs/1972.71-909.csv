1972.71-909,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.84,We'll hear arguments next in number 71-909 Environment Protection Agency against Mink.
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,38.977,43.073,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-909,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,442.832,446.899,Tell me again the difference between Top Secret and Secret?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,446.899,449.022,It is a different in degree.
1972.71-909,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,465.289,469.474,Is that the best you can do?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,469.474,481.276,Both Executive Orders spell out in its clear languages as available to the drafts matters which were vital to national defense that the latest Executive Order mentions (Vice Overlap)
1972.71-909,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,481.276,484.656,I am not saying that (Voice Overlap) I just think you can do any better.
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,488.707,499.208,"Well it purports to me the criteria, the alleged criteria said on page 49 of your brief, Top Secret as (a) secret is (b) --"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,499.208,501.001,And then there is confidential (Voice Overlap).
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,501.001,502.209,Confidential is (c) and they (Voice Overlap).
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,502.209,518.418,"It is just a matter of degree and the most secret and sensitive data falls into the Top Secret category, but once a document which contains vital defense information has been classified, all material in a particular document is protected under exemption one."
1972.71-909,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,518.418,527.898,Would it be reasonable to assume that in most classified documents there are sentences and paragraphs and parts that are completely innocuous?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,527.898,531.256,There may well be.
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,588.392,603.131,"What significance would you give to the provisions of this legislation that provide for a de novo hearing in a District Court and put the burden of proof on the government agency, any at all?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,603.131,606.955,The significance is very considerable under some of the exemptions of Act.
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,607.532,612.323,"With the respect to this when you say ex parte affidavit, that's the end of it?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,612.323,615.542,Congress has said that the matter is exempt in a meaningful --
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,615.542,616.718,I know it hasn't said anything about it.
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,616.718,623.237,If it is classified pursuant to an Executive Order dealing with the national defense information.
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,623.237,627.109,"And here we have an ex parte affidavit, am I right?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,627.109,627.739,That is right.
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,627.739,634.964,No opportunity for our a court to determine whether not to even this was stamped Secret or the Top Secret?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,634.964,689.52,"But absolutely no reason from the affidavit itself in the surrounding circumstances to question the assertions in the affidavit itself and the circumstances of the test, here we're dealing with a weapon's test in the atomic field, in an area in which it is known not that only our technological lead in the military field is vital to our national defense but also with an area which is well known because of the treaty obligations, because of the international -- the sensitivity of the international community on these matters where it is well known that there are foreign policy repercussions and the Irwin affidavit places those documents plainly in the sixth that the to which exemption one applies squarely with an a core area of the interest that Congress intended to protect and remain privileged."
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,689.52,701.09,"So do I understand then that your answer to my question is that with respect to category one, this language just we should be wholly be disregarded that the --?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,701.09,702.179,"No, not entirely."
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,702.179,710.186,That the burden is not on the government agency and that the Court has no business determining the matter de novo despite what Congress has enacted?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,710.186,723.039,"The Court may properly impose a burden on the government to supply an affidavit which lays out, that describes the documents and which lays out the surrounding circumstances."
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,737.01,742.152,"Normally that's not the way a Court operates is it, to take x- part of the affidavit to say that is the end of it."
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,745.338,748.542,It surely is in this area.
1972.71-909,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,772.589,780.725,"Well, I have big problem with you showing that it has military significance except your word that it is?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,780.725,795.721,"I do not see how anyone could doubt that the yield, the methods, the scientific technology involved -- the testing of atomic weapons involves the most vital and sensitive matters to our national security."
1972.71-909,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,806.202,811.02,"Well, does the affidavit say that's the only thing that is in this document?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,811.02,819.053,"No it does not, but it says that the documents were prepared to (Voice Overlap) president and that they contain classified and secret information."
1972.71-909,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,819.053,826.872,Which they say would be injurious to the national welfare which the government said?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,826.872,827.815,That is correct.
1972.71-909,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,827.815,829.939,Well how do we test that?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,829.939,834.806,The same way that you test a claim of the privileged against self incrimination.
1972.71-909,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,853.245,853.547,Are you willing to --
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,853.547,861.273,-- as to why an apparently innocuous question mainly to the discovery of a clue to information that maybe incriminated.
1972.71-909,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,861.273,869.302,"Please Mr. Cramton, do not put your government's position on the same level as a defendant pleading the Fifth Amendment, please."
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,869.302,871.083,"I do, I think under our constitutional scheme."
1972.71-909,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,871.083,872.556,"Well, that's the way you don't put it --"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,872.556,881.957,"-- the operation of the office of President just as the operation of the Supreme Court of the United States in the judiciary, just as the operation of the Congress is an extremely important --"
1972.71-909,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,881.957,887.93,(Inaudible)
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,887.93,895.937,The limited role of the Courts in passing upon classification determinations of the executive branch is well established in prior decisions.
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,899.458,901.525,Are there any constitutional issues involved here?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,903.53,913.018,It is purely a matter of statute except that you have to act and interpret the statute as the Court always does in the light of the constitutional backdrop.
1972.71-909,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,968.765,976.495,I thought that the inquiry that the District Court was supposed to make was a limited one under B (1)?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,976.495,982.836,He is supposed to determine whether portions of the documents maybe safely revealed to the public.
1972.71-909,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,996.309,1014.879,"I did not think that -- well maybe you know more about the case than I do, but I thought that a lot of things, collateral documents went under the big umbrella because they were merely related not because it's been separately designated as secret by the executive?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1014.879,1021.123,"The government does not contest that part of the case, the decision below that deals with classification by association."
1972.71-909,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1038.528,1044.473,You have no claim then of it -- no objection to their treatment under B (1)?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1046.526,1053.513,"What's under B (1), I --?"
1972.71-909,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1053.513,1070.832,"The Court of Appeals said that on page 27 of the Appendix, the first full paragraph, such documents are not entitled to the secrecy exemption by subdivision B (1) solely by virtue of their association as separately classified?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1070.832,1071.241,That's right.
1972.71-909,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1074.537,1076.2,"Though, though your --"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1076.2,1083.167,"The executive order requires documents to be classified on a basis of the information, they contend."
1972.71-909,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1083.167,1090.129,The only other thing that as I recall that they passed on was sub Article under B (5)?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1090.129,1095.198,"No, no we do claim that the exemption one is applicable here."
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1136.224,1148.423,Congress apparently did think the District Courts had the ability to do it because it said in such a case the court shall determine no matter de novo and the burden is on the agency to sustain its action.
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1155.387,1166.747,That has to be interpreted in the past history and in light of dealing with military or state secrets which is the correlative evidentiary privilege that has existed and which this Court construed in the Reynolds case --
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1166.747,1167.133,And what --?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1167.133,1172.939,"-- in which the Court said, the Court should not make an in camera investigation, even in chambers (Voice Overlap)"
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1172.939,1175.286,"Did it have the statute, was it in construing the statute?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1175.286,1176.07,No it was not.
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1176.07,1180.003,"But where -- that's what we have here is the statutory language, and what does it mean?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1180.003,1191.86,But it was adopted in the background and light and the legislative history is very clear that what Congress was doing was not asking the Courts to second guess the classification determinations of the Federal government.
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1191.86,1194.242,"Well, what does this language mean in your submission?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1194.242,1203.918,It means under exemption one is to whether or not at the most the classification or determination made by the executive is not arbitrary or capricious.
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1213.911,1218.556,There has been no cross examination of anybody?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1218.556,1219.067,No there is not.
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1219.067,1223.971,Normally that's what happens in a District Court and there is no indication here (Voice Overlap) which it has a more limited in function?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1223.971,1236.234,Even the respondents do not content that the advisory process is going to be fully operated here and the high government officials are going to be asked to testify and the cross examination is to the exact content of this document.
1972.71-909,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1260.383,1262.083,How should we construe the de novo then here?
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1262.083,1263.764,Yes.
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1263.764,1282.49,It means that the Court should decide on the basis of the information that satisfies it that the exemption is applicable and here the government’s affidavit and the surrounding circumstances do provide information which show that military secrets and foreign policy secrets are involved here (Voice Overlap)
1972.71-909,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1282.49,1286.401,What did the district judge do when that was presented to him?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1286.401,1294.101,He accepted that contention and he did not examine the documents and respondents have appealed.
1972.71-909,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1294.101,1295.449,Mr. Cramton?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1295.449,1296.339,Sir.
1972.71-909,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1296.339,1311.804,"I am looking at page 46 of your brief which sets forth the Freedom of Information Act, subsection B thereof."
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1337.167,1357.84,"It says, it does not apply to matter, is that specifically required by Executive order and I think that falls clearly within the language of this case (Voice Overlap) an exemption despite arguably seems to me with give rise to somewhat more discretion on the Court because it refers in its own language to the procedures used by the Courts in civil litigation on discovery."
1972.71-909,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1357.84,1358.245,Okay.
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1367.818,1381.359,"I think it applies to the entire Act, but it has to be read in light of the language of the preferred exemptions and desire of Congress to protect certain material from public disclosure?"
1972.71-909,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1381.359,1392.478,"Well, I have read these provision as meaning that if it dell within number one of B, that was the end of the matter and no one (Voice Overlap)."
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1392.478,1393.74,That is the government's view.
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1395.43,1396.646,Who is to determine whether it falls within 1?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1396.646,1405.782,We do concede that the government by affidavit has and surrounding circumstances has to make a showing that at least you are in the area of state secrets.
1972.71-909,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1430.308,1431.4,And at the same time --
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1431.4,1437.443,(Voice Overlap) the interest you're trying to protect in the process of showing whether or not the privilege is applicable.
1972.71-909,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1437.443,1445.923,And on the hand or the government can say this whole that is involved in Atomic Energy research and then that would be it?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1445.923,1448.945,No the Court can require more than that and you know more than that.
1972.71-909,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1451.102,1453.143,How much more in your --
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1453.143,1467.041,Is the documents prepared by Dr. Kissinger and the National Security Council and so on. You know a great deal more and you know that all of the information that relates to environmental matters which bushel baskets of it has already been made public.
1972.71-909,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1481.193,1495.643,"But suppose you get into B (5), the inter agency documents you find a split among the experts as to whether or not this is relevant to the military aspect to the problem or not?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1495.643,1513.164,Well exemption 5 is designed to protect the decisional deliberative process of government itself and make sure that deciders get candid and frank advice just as this Court needs it among itself and with its personnel.
1972.71-909,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1664.662,1671.35,"And if I remember the Reynolds case correctly the government had the choice, was put to the choice by the Court."
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1689.003,1693.248,"Mr. Chief Justice if I may correct you, I think that it is not."
1972.71-909,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1719.403,1728.351,"Yes, but my point is that government have the choice of either, wasn't the government required then to submit in terms of liability?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1728.351,1750.655,"The Court actually went on and held that with the since the Tort Claims Act had waved the liability of the United States only under such conditions as it is send to but you could not penalize the government where it was defendant on the Tort Claims Act, but in the civil litigation, in the criminal prosecution situation were the same question arises that is the result that usually reached."
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1771.613,1782.52,"Mr. -- General Cramton, as I thought in advancement in this case and we were faced here with the matter of construction of a statute and only that."
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1809.923,1812.946,"Yes, it's Mr. Justice 5, it may require part two."
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1815.598,1817.245,Of the whole Act?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1817.245,1818.041,If I might clarify --
1972.71-909,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1818.041,1819.73,Section means the entire Act?
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1819.73,1830.409,"That's right, and if I may clarify your comment, constitutional questions is involved here only in the sense that they provide a backdrop for the interpretation of the statute."
1972.71-909,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1853.64,1864.363,"And now one other question if I may, the -- going to the last line in the Act, this Section is not authority to withhold information from Congress."
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1877.301,1878.262,That is right.
1972.71-909,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1917.565,1921.661,"Well, when a member of Congress comes into the court, he comes in just as in the other citizen?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1921.661,1922.337,That is right.
1972.71-909,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1924.841,1927.9,"This is not an action authorized by some committee, is it?"
1972.71-909,0,38926,roger_c_cramton,,1927.9,1931.918,No the Congress is not involved in any institutional capacity.
1972.71-909,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1946.47,1948.705,Mr. Clark.
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,1948.705,1953.673,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-909,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2405.493,2430.343,"I thought it was considered, the Court of Appeals might have done and goes certainly considerably beyond the language of the exemption and be one it is not, which would seem, at least on the face of the literal words that the Court should limit its inquiry to determining whether these matters were specifically required by Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of the National defense or foreign policy."
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2433.563,2435.257,"No, I wouldn't --"
1972.71-909,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2435.257,2437.366,I have accurately read the Executive.
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2437.366,2441.243,"Well, I think the key to it though is the Court of Appeals’ opinion."
1972.71-909,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2488.329,2489.953,"Well that’s what the language seems to say, isn't it?"
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2489.953,2491.703,"No, I think not, I think when it said (Voice Overlap)"
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2491.703,2494.479,What does it mean if it does not mean that Mr. Clark?
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2494.479,2505.686,"Well, I think first the Act clearly gives jurisdiction to the Court to enjoin a government agency from refusing to disclose, it requires (Voice Overlap)"
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2505.686,2506.919,As a general proposition?
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2506.919,2507.787,"As a general proposition, yeah."
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2507.787,2511.333,"But then this is a specific exception, is it not? (Voice Overlap)"
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2511.333,2513.333,-- There are nine specific exceptions.
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2513.333,2515.933,"Well, we are only concerned now about one."
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2515.933,2517.275,"Well, 1 and 5 are both (Voice Overlap)."
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2517.275,2519.162,One primarily.
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2525.027,2530.264,I think it can only mean one thing and I really cannot believe that the government would content otherwise.
1972.71-909,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2581.371,2586.403,"But under that language, what are the limits of the Courts’ decision and that was my question."
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2600.015,2602.185,There were -- there are several things that should be said (Voice Overlap)
1972.71-909,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2602.185,2605.245,I think that's what the language seems on its face to say --
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2605.245,2609.454,I think not necessarily matters does not mean all of an entire document.
1972.71-909,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2660.51,2666.118,"Perhaps, the government has conceded more than it needed to do under this language?"
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2687.45,2689.134,"I really, I really think not."
1972.71-909,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2730.414,2737.354,"What regular word weigh in your argument as I understand that on the adverb specifically, don't you?"
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2737.354,2738.508,"Yes, I do."
1972.71-909,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2806.662,2820.221,"You referred this on constitutional cases with you, -- am I wrong in thinking that the only issue in this case is the meaning of a statute enacted by the Congress of the United States that there are no constitutional issues here at all, am I wrong about that?"
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2820.221,2829.846,I think that there are clearly constitutional issues in those parts of the case that the Court of Appeals specifically declined to pass on by a way of summary disposition.
1972.71-909,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2874.964,2883.719,"And I am not wrong, as I understand what you have said in understanding that this is a matter of the construction of an act of Congress, is that what we have?"
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2883.719,2886.584,"I think it's a matter of proper judicial administration, that's right."
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2916.542,2938.182,"But doesn't the new Executive Order now meet that problem of a new Executive Order that you have just referred to, Mr. Clark that was obviously intended to give more flexibility to go through a document and if there is a lot of material that's perfectly innocuous as there is bound to be in any classified document that, that can be severed out."
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,2953.429,2971.942,"Well, I think that the new Executive Order, if implemented as I assume, it will be, will narrow the range of review that the Court will have to make, but I think ultimately that when it comes before the Court, it comes before the Court very infrequently."
1972.71-909,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3003.39,3007.959,"Are you suggesting Mr. Clark that perhaps, this whole case in this Court is premature?"
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3007.959,3012.87,"Well I am, we opposed the cert."
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3013.259,3014.638,On that ground?
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3014.638,3014.815,"Your Honor, we --"
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3014.815,3015.348,On prematurity --
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3015.348,3028.233,"We -- this was a summary disposition and we opposed it as being something that -- we didn't get all the -- we wanted below either, but we saw in our reason to counter petition because we thought our opportunity, it was still viable in the Court below."
1972.71-909,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3042.903,3048.258,"If we dismiss this as improvidently granted that would leave that judgment of course to stand undisturbed, wouldn't it?"
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3048.258,3063.931,"But I think both the -- we know the problems in judicial administration here and I think both the Court of Appeals and the District Court are entitled to hear review on what -- I don't think you should go, it's my judgment of sound judicial administration beyond what the Court of Appeals did."
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3135.201,3155.658,"Mr. Clark, I realize that subdivision 6 is not relevant in this case on page 46 paragraph 6, I think you would call it under B, but suppose the personnel and medical file of some individual were involved and there were some matter which he did not want disclosed."
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3170.772,3180.14,"Well, at the very least, there would be a judicial responsibility to look and see if this is just a medical file or if it is a file that says medical on it, and it's got all the kind of matter in it."
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3180.14,3207.839,"But what if there is an affidavit of the commander of let us say one of the military hospitals that all the documents inside of this file relate to the diagnosis and treatment of the named subject and there is no matter here except that and it is of the utmost privacy, some such statement, then is a district judge under this Act to look at and see if the doctors telling the truth or (Voice Overlap)"
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3207.839,3209.129,I think that is absolutely yes.
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3220.852,3229.491,"But the Act is here now, it's passed and I still have difficulty in getting away from the language this Section does not apply."
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3229.491,3237.914,"By the very nature of that, we haven't to that -- this Section is not, but it says which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy."
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3252.329,3258.951,"Well, I am not raising this question in terms of getting this information in a lawsuit involving some injuries."
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3275.861,3284.683,(Voice Overlap) I think the test is whether it would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and I think that’s a judicial test to be made under the Act by the judiciary.
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3286.307,3294.841,"Then B, this Section does not applied, doesn't have very much meaning?"
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3294.841,3295.764,I think it has meaning.
1972.71-909,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3334.225,3340.341,"Mr. Clark, doesn't this get us right back to the questions that Justice Stewart has been asking?"
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3384.617,3386.262,Well I see it a little different.
1972.71-909,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3429.027,3434.159,"Well, I suppose Mr. Clark one of the key is here is in Section 3 anyway, isn’t it?"
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3467.102,3469.37,"That’s my understanding of it, yes Your Honor."
1972.71-909,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3469.37,3469.898,And then in --
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3469.898,3473.383,I think they have to look at the papers to do that very frequently.
1972.71-909,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3473.383,3486.037,"But -- and the determination of whether something is improperly withheld, I guess, is this what the next sentence means; in such a case, the Court shall determine the matter de novo and the burden is on the agency to sustain its status?"
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3486.037,3514.473,"It's the only meaning that I can read out of it, I think in connection with Justice Blackmun's question that there are two steps to number one but I don't think those were steps were considered or adjudicated by the Court below or should be by this Court, but I think first, it determines whether it was specifically required and second, whether it was clearly erroneous, at least that would be the standard that I proposed but the Court of Appeals didn't feel it necessary and I think wisely so to determine that test at that time."
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3514.473,3522.921,"Mr. Clark, turning to number three, there are two of these which have a qualification that the other paragraphs do not have."
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3545.353,3546.049,"No, I think (Voice Overlap)"
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3546.049,3553.39,What inquiry would the district judge make on a matter if it's specifically exempt from disclosure by a statute?
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3553.39,3563.326,"Well I think the analogy here would be, if the executive came in and said here is the statute Your Honor and cites the statute, therefore you can’t look at this matter."
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3564.758,3571.533,But if suppose the statute had said that all medical records of any military hospital shall be exempt from disclosure?
1972.71-909,1,38940,ramsey_clark,,3571.533,3578.953,Then I think the judge would have to look and see whether there is anything in the file or the military records or medical records from military hospital.
1972.71-909,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3612.268,3614.196,Thank you gentlemen.
