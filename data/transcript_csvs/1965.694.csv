1965.694,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,29.042,"Number 694, Perry versus Commercial Loan Company -- Commerce Loan Company."
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,45.442,52.409,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,349.619,354.022,And what was the -- what was the prior bankruptcy?
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,354.022,363.004,The prior bankruptcy was a straight bankruptcy filed about four and a half years prior to the wage earner petition.
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,407.434,418.258,There's no -- there's nothing in this case then that raises issue whether a prior wage earner's plan would bar a subsequent one?
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,418.258,418.475,"Well, --"
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,418.475,422.626,Whether a straight or prior straight bankruptcy was filed?
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,422.626,425.793,Whether you could file two successive wage earner plans?
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,425.793,426.013,Is that the --
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,426.013,427.358,-- in six years.
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,431.36,432.428,It doesn't involve here.
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,432.428,433.953,That's not involved here.
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,433.953,435.4,An earlier straight bankruptcy?
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,435.4,437.432,Earlier straight bankruptcy.
1965.694,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,854.091,855.167,You have to what?
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,855.167,860.255,"You have to renew our old balance, our old -- the balance that you discharged in bankruptcy."
1965.694,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,864.732,866.035,This is after the discharge?
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,866.035,873.642,"That's after -- it may not even be after the discharge, maybe after his first meeting with creditors, but generally, it's after discharge."
1965.694,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,876.286,878.653,What was it in this case?
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,878.653,884.062,"In this case, I don't say that's happened in this case."
1965.694,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,884.062,885.95,"Well, how is pertinent then?"
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,885.95,891.72,It's pertinent because I'm explaining to the Court that we're not just considering Perry case.
1965.694,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1123.656,1134.618,"And is that relevant here, because as I understand your statement of the facts, the event in question here was the discharge in bankruptcy?"
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,1134.618,1135.832,Yes.
1965.694,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1135.832,1144.821,"And so, is the second part of that sentence that you just read relevant here?"
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,1144.821,1147.689,"I think it's relevant, Your Honor, yes."
1965.694,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1264.743,1270.826,Where is it printed in your brief?
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,1270.826,1279.05,You will find Section 602 printed in the appellee's brief at page 3.
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1576.537,1580.949,"What the -- was this plan, that was filed, simply for an extension?"
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,1580.949,1582.309,That is right Your Honor.
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1582.309,1592.508,"Well now, if he paid up -- he paid up in accordance with the plan, is he required to get a discharge?"
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,1592.508,1598.207,"Well, the discharge section is ambiguous."
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1601.127,1617.84,"Because if this isn't the kind of a discharge the Act is talking about, why this section -- this doesn't apply at all because it talks about -- committed an act which would bar the discharge of this particular bankrupt."
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,1617.84,1618.813,That's true.
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.198,1623.934,He wasn't -- wouldn't get a discharge at all while this section is holding him up?
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,1623.934,1626.491,He gets a discharge.
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.254,1646.874,"Well, he gets discharge in a sense that he might have paid up all the debts within the plan, but somebody forgot to file within the times provided by 57 or something."
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,1646.874,1648.259,"Well, the wording --"
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1670.289,1671.938,"Oh, “Provided for under the plan”?"
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,1671.938,1672.843,Yes.
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.843,1675.572,How about -- how about other cases?
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,1675.572,1676.073,"Well, --"
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1676.073,1677.953,How about a fellow who didn't file?
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,1677.953,1680.885,"If he didn't file, he's still would be discharged."
1965.694,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.055,1706.319,Thank you.
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,1706.319,1710.182,"What little time I have left, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve for rebuttal."
1965.694,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1710.182,1711.422,You may.
1965.694,0,39435,robert_j_harris,,1711.422,1711.743,Thank you.
1965.694,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1711.743,1715.051,Mr. Smith.
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,1715.051,1724.095,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2118.822,2121.688,Is the composition planned in the record?
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2121.688,2122.397,Sir?
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2122.397,2125.596,Is the composition plan in the record?
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2125.596,2128.09,"This -- oh, the composition plan in this record?"
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2128.09,2128.739,Yes.
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2128.739,2129.039,"No, sir."
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2132.325,2133.751,But there was a plan which the --
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2133.751,2134.491,"Oh, yes."
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2135.642,2137.243,An extension plan was in it?
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2137.243,2137.857,"Yes, sir."
1965.694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.296,2204.746,"Well, would you say that you're position -- from your position, it necessarily follows that if you filed a bank -- a petition under Chapter XIII just by way of extension and paid up in full according to the plan in 1960, and then in 1964, you filed another identical petition for an extension that that such petition --"
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2204.746,2205.504,This law --
1965.694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.504,2206.445,-- should be dismissed?
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2206.445,2208.411,This law bars it.
1965.694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2210.362,2214.174,And you would disagree then with the Tenth Circuit?
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2214.174,2221.778,"Yes, sir, positively."
1965.694,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2374.546,2379.454,"Mr. Smith, can't you just tell us what the case holds without reading it in entirety please --"
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2379.454,2388.365,"Well, the case holds exactly the same thing that the Sixth Circuit held, the case before here."
1965.694,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2388.365,2389.044,Yes.
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2389.044,2393.123,And the Sixth Circuit cites this very case.
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2437.487,2440.797,"What do you think about the provision that says, “Not inconsistent with?”"
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2446.162,2450.292,"Well, that's the statute, Your Honor."
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2450.292,2453.974,Not inconsistent with this claim?
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2453.974,2469.749,"Well, I don't know just exactly what to -- what this section means, but I can put -- I can tell you without reading the decision, you might read the dissenting opinion by Judge Hickenlooper in the Sixth Circuit."
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2487.027,2490.3,Was this a plan to pay this debt in full?
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2490.3,2490.866,What Judge?
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2490.866,2491.8,All the debt?
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2491.8,2505.752,"Your Honor, please sir, regardless what Mr. Harris says in connection with paying the full, he could pay -- the debtor could present plan in 60 days or six months."
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2515.958,2524.795,What I'm asking is did he agree in this plan to pay all of the debts in full?
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2524.795,2527.763,"Well no, he didn't make such agreement as that Your Honor."
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2534.035,2539.469,"But did he agree to pay if extended, in full?"
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2539.469,2540.17,"No, sir."
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2545.074,2547.183,I understood him to say that he did?
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2547.183,2552.075,"Well, regardless of what he did or what he -- he couldn't make such an agreement."
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2552.075,2552.321,Well --
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2552.321,2558.496,"-- because it might be, that I don't know what the plan was -- the Court didn't determined whether or not this was feasible or not feasible."
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2563.055,2571.385,What it says is 100% payment upon acceptance of the plan for secured creditors.
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2571.385,2571.651,"Well, that's --"
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2571.651,2577.238,"That should be dealt with severely for any terms, but only upon written acceptance of the plan."
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2577.238,2589.207,"That would determine -- be determined by judge as to the number of people who accepted the plan and carried over the -- whether or not it would pay off over the period of time, within three years."
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2597.325,2606.87,"Well it provides for payment in full to the secured creditors, what does it provide with the reference to the unsecured creditors?"
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2606.87,2607.366,The same.
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2613.55,2616.032,Doesn't everybody get his money under this plan if he goes through --
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2616.032,2618.052,"Not necessarily, not always Your Honor."
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2618.052,2619.552,Who would not get it?
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2619.552,2630.046,"As I say, it might be that the three-year period that the plan that he had submitted would take longer than three years to pay out."
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2630.046,2636.973,"Suppose, it took three years as it provided here, would everybody get his money?"
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2641.056,2642.366,I don't know whether it would or not.
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2642.366,2642.758,What?
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2642.758,2643.807,I just don't know Your Honor.
1965.694,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2646.078,2651.908,"You don't know whether the plan would be worked out successfully, but it contemplates full payment, doesn't it?"
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2651.908,2652.655,"It contemplates it, yes."
1965.694,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2652.655,2653.017,Yes.
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2653.017,2654.399,"That's the answer, Your Honor."
1965.694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2654.399,2657.189,"There can be a discharge upon less than full payment, are they not?"
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2657.189,2658.255,Absolutely.
1965.694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2658.255,2659.467,Under an extension agreement.
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2659.467,2659.549,Absolutely.
1965.694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2659.549,2668.789,"Then if it turns out within a period or after a period three years, that there is inability to make full payment, there then can be a discharge?"
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2668.789,2670.224,"Exactly, correct sir."
1965.694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2670.224,2675.674,Even under an extension plan that's originally contemplated a full payment and the statute --
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2675.674,2678.978,Unless (Voice Overlap) with discharge within six years previously --
1965.694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2678.978,2679.352,"Oh, yeah."
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2683.222,2683.948,Any further question?
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2683.948,2707.158,"Well, the point there I assume, there might possibly be a difference payment in full -- I'm not saying it would, payment in full and payment in part when he asked for his discharge, suppose it was carried out exactly as contemplated, would it pay all the debtors 100% in full, creditors a 100% in full?"
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2707.158,2709.282,"Well, this is a new proceeding Your Honor."
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2726.769,2734.611,"And you're talking about what has been done, the statute -- this plan proposes, doesn't it?"
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2734.611,2734.729,He propose --
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2734.729,2736.518,It does not make any difference?
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2736.518,2738.583,I guess he proposed it on his own fashion.
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2751.201,2762.59,"Suppose he had determined -- suppose he had determined it was feasible and Pure Loan Company had not filed this objection, would they have been paid in full if the plan was carried out?"
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2762.59,2769.837,"Your Honor, it was the duty of the referee the very moment that he discover -- that he discover --"
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2769.837,2770.389,I understand that.
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2770.389,2771.207,-- what my motion rather was.
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2771.207,2784.925,"I understand that but suppose you had not been there and that you had not filed, does it propose that it would be paid out as full, a 100% on the dollar, that was his plan?"
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2784.925,2785.887,According to his (Voice Overlap) --
1965.694,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2785.887,2787.397,It may not make any difference --
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2787.397,2793.25,"The proposition might be there, but the fulfillment of it maybe something else."
1965.694,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2793.25,2798.316,"But if does in fact paid the money, he doesn't get the discharge, does it?"
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2799.909,2801.005,That's right he would not.
1965.694,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2801.005,2802.185,[Inaudible]
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2802.185,2808.133,Also his petition would be dismissed for lack of -- of the plan.
1965.694,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2808.133,2809.566,Why?
1965.694,1,40432,r_howard_smith,,2809.566,2810.205,Sorry?
