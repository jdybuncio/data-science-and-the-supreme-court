1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.344,"We will hear arguments next in 73-898, Goss against Lopez."
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,30.761,34.516,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,399.075,402.098,"By that you mean between the teachers and the students, I assume?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,402.098,403.142,Yes.
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,410.966,417.132,"Members of the school board, for example, don't have anything directly to do with the students day by day, do they?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,417.132,434.87,"Not on a day-by-day basis, but I think, this all works into the very process of formulating what type of academic discipline is going to take place in the particular school."
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,526.31,529.427,Did the district court issue an injunction hearing?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,529.427,532.178,No injunction was issued in this particular case.
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,542.094,543.379,And you're appealing?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,543.379,548.298,And we're appealing.
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,548.298,553.794,Do we have jurisdiction up here?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,553.794,555.34,"I believe, you do."
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.816,558.576,Did it have a jurisdiction limit?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,558.576,559.066,"Yes, we did."
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,559.066,566.498,In this case but there wasn't any -- my brother White certainly raise this --
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,566.498,568.93,Was an injunction denied?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,568.93,570.044,No injunction --
1974.73-898,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,570.044,570.897,But here -- but you won?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,570.897,571.452,Is not --
1974.73-898,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,571.452,574.335,You won on the injunction issue?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,574.335,577.245,"No, there was really no orderly hearing on an injunction at any point."
1974.73-898,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,577.245,577.493,"Well, I know but --"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,577.493,579.723,The Court left that kind of as I believe in --
1974.73-898,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,579.723,582.395,"But our jurisdiction, isn't this a direct appeal?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,582.395,583.421,It is a direct appeal under the statute.
1974.73-898,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,583.421,588.135,Does that jurisdiction depend on the grant or denial of an injunction in the lower court?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,588.135,589.695,I don't think so.
1974.73-898,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,589.695,592.012,"I think, it does."
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,592.012,593.254,Explicit in the statute.
1974.73-898,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,593.254,594.954,Was an injunction paid for?
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,594.954,598.388,"An injunction, both a temporary and permanent injunction was paid --"
1974.73-898,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,598.388,604.903,"That was denied, that injunction was denied but you're the winner on that issue?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,604.903,605.431,"Well, yeah."
1974.73-898,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,608.125,610.903,You won and you opposed the injunction?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,610.903,612.022,We opposed the injunction from the --
1974.73-898,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,612.022,617.284,"And you won on, on the injunction part of it, you lost on the invalidity?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,617.284,621.281,If the Court says -- I won from the standpoint that the Court did not grant one.
1974.73-898,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,621.281,628.644,"Well, is there an injunction requiring both the cancellation of the record -- of the suspension records that it requires?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,628.644,630.734,The Court required us to expunge from the records of --
1974.73-898,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,630.734,631.613,"Well, was that an injunction?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,631.613,632.773,Yes.
1974.73-898,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,632.773,634.212,"You lost on that, didn't you?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,634.212,638.693,"Yes, that's what I was getting to."
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,646.249,648.984,"It's an injunction, however it was labeled, isn't it?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,648.984,653.188,"Well, what I was trying to say was that the Court did not specifically label it an injunction that they --"
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,653.188,653.43,But it --
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,653.43,658.025,-- did require us to expunge from the records of these people involved in this class action.
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,658.025,664.229,Did the Court require the school to adopt this system that they outlined?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,664.229,674.599,"Yes, they set up the system that they found would be a proper type of system to utilize where a temporary suspension was going to take place."
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.599,693.605,"Well, a little while ago you stated like I thought that no injunction was issued, that no injunction was denied, now I take it you do feel that there was at least an injunction under whatever label, whatever guides it possessed so that you’re changing the position a little bit you have to, don’t you, in order to begin --?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,693.605,712.581,"Well, I'm saying there's not a label attached to, but the Court did mandate us in a sense to expunge from the records of these people involved -- any reference to a suspension arising out of this period of time, which gave rise to litigation in that sense that you need an injunction."
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,712.581,714.143,You view it as the injunction I think?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,714.143,714.684,Pardon?
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,714.684,718.64,I say I think you have to take this position to be here?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,718.64,725.609,I wholeheartedly agree that in that sense I view it a as mandate to the Board of Education and the principles involved.
1974.73-898,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,725.609,743.117,"Well, at page 19 of the judgment before us, next to the last paragraph is, it is ordered that the defendants delete all reference to the suspension and disciplinary transfers of plaintiffs from the records of the Columbus Public School, is that an injunction?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,743.117,745.454,I would view that as a -- an injunctive type --
1974.73-898,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,745.454,747.36,For the purposes of our appellate jurisdiction.
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,747.36,749.249,For the purposes of your jurisdiction.
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,749.249,762.705,"And by inference, the court has restricted the freedom of the school district to handle suspensions the way they formerly handled them, by imposing affirmative requirements?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,762.705,763.82,Yes Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-898,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,804.959,822.343,"Mr. Bustin, would you tell us a little bit about the purpose for which these records are maintained, are they made available, for example, to some future potential employer here or they maintain only for internal use of the school system?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,822.343,851.392,"In the record of this cause, in the deposition of the Superintendent of schools it was taken, it was explained that these records are not made generally available to everyone and that when an employer, for example, calls in and wants information about the student, he is given basic information pertaining to whether his grades, in whether or not he graduated from the school, that the records are not open for ready examination."
1974.73-898,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,865.915,882.335,"Suppose a pupil had been suspended, say, for three days when he was a freshman in high school and he later applied to a college and his high school transcript was sent to the college, would that three-day suspension appear on the record?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,882.335,894.951,"In this particular record, looking at the transcripts, it could show, yes, if that whole format, folder, if you will, that they utilized was sent to the college."
1974.73-898,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,894.951,897.076,Do you known what they do send as a matter of fact?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,897.076,914.308,"As I believe the Superintendent's testimony was more in the nature of trying to provide grades and grades from schooling process and all grades in the psychological test, that type of information, and as other is requested."
1974.73-898,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,914.308,916.738,Does that appear in the appendix?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,916.738,921.561,"Yes, it appears in the Appendix, in the testimony of Superintendent Ellis."
1974.73-898,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,921.561,922.672,Right.
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,922.672,928.03,Would that be binding on the new Superintendent?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,931.712,937.086,This was the policy of the Columbus School District.
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,937.086,939.852,I thought the clause was of that Superintendent?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,939.852,940.549,No it was not --
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,940.549,941.191,That's the way I read it.
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,941.191,948.605,"No, it was not the policy -- explained as being the policy of that Superintendent, it was a policy of the district."
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,948.757,949.39,Where is it?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,949.39,950.061,-- what they did in the district.
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,950.061,952.732,Where is it in the rules and regulations of the district?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,952.732,955.91,It is not written down as such.
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,955.91,968.771,Is there any prohibition in any document that prevents anybody from circulating that record with material on it?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,968.771,979.63,"The regulations explained to the principals and the teachers, the process was that the records would not be circulated, would not be open for a ready examination."
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,979.63,984.596,"You used the word “regulation,” where is that regulation?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,984.596,991.053,It is in the -- the only regulation I can point to is the -- in the administrative guide so to speak when they talk about it --
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,991.053,997.179,Where is that in the record?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,997.179,1017.073,"When they talk in the -- I believe, that's in Volume 3 around page 280, it's where this administrative guide is discussed, that and the Superintendent's testimony."
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1017.073,1020.682,Where is it that says that it shall not be circulated?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1020.682,1027.44,I can’t say that this record -- I can’t say that this record candidly says in writing that it will not be circulated.
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1044.544,1049.627,That's just his -- that applies as long as he's there.
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1053.945,1058.416,"I think, the Board -- no, I think the Columbus Board of Education would have to do that."
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1058.416,1061.957,"Well, where is the Columbus Board of Education's regulation, that says that?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1061.957,1064.369,"It's not in writing, in this particular record."
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1064.369,1069.16,"Well, that's -- is there anything other than writing that's going to help us?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1078.128,1083.609,"No, Your Honor, not in the posture of the record as it appears before this Court."
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1125.803,1129.755,What experience do you have in evaluating school records?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1129.755,1131.431,"I have no individual experience, I think."
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1131.431,1132.759,I didn't think so.
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1132.759,1146.043,Is there anything in the Court's opinion that says yeh or neh about what maybe done with the transcript of the student’s record now under the holding of the three-judge court?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1146.043,1159.023,"No, Your Honor, the three-judge court, all they did was required us or mandate us to expunge these references to the disciplinary transfers and suspensions from their records."
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1159.023,1159.555,But the school may --
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1159.555,1160.361,They went no further than that.
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1160.361,1163.798,The school may suspend for three-days without a hearing in the future.
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1163.798,1164.77,That's right.
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1164.77,1172.051,"And if that is placed on the record, it will go in whatever manner it has previously gone, is that a fair assumption?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1172.051,1181.225,"If as Mr. Justice Marshall said, the record is made readily available to any employer and he does, in fact, see that, yes, it would be there."
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1181.225,1187.932,"In other words, this opinion didn't touch -- the opinion of the three-judge court didn't touch on that issue one way or the other?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1187.932,1191.194,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1191.194,1206.514,"Mr. Bustin, under the existing statute, what if a principal wanted to suspend a student for 15 days?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1206.514,1212.018,"Under the statute, before it was declared unconstitutional, he would not have that authority."
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1212.051,1223.203,"He has no authority apparently, it's an odd statute that apparently he has no authority, with or without a hearing, to suspend a student longer than ten days, isn't that it?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1223.203,1224.102,"Well, as I view the statute --"
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1224.102,1224.8,He is --
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1224.8,1229.576,--as a restrictive statute and has been so viewed in Ohio as a restrictive statute.
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1235.441,1239.153,"Can he suspend a student for 11 days with or without a hearing, apparently?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1239.153,1242.212,"That as I read the statute and interpret it, yes."
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1248.968,1259.453,Had no choice except between a suspension of ten days or less and expulsion?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1259.453,1260.815,Under that statute.
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1260.815,1264.573,"Well, and you think there is any power other than the statute?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1264.573,1273.449,"No, I view the statute as a restrictive statute which I think the legislature sought to draw down his authority."
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1292.45,1303.214,"And as perhaps you know the next case, as I remember at least the suspension was until the end of the school year and that just couldn't -- there would be no power to do that on Ohio?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1306.403,1315.048,The expulsion is not defined as a definition in the code that sets up the common school system.
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1315.048,1323.371,"I suppose, you could have expulsion for 20 days, could you?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1323.371,1327.135,I could be -- I think a legislature could categorize expulsion.
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1327.135,1329.647,"It hasn't defined expulsion at all, has it?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1329.647,1331.555,Not that I can find in this particular--
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1331.555,1337.267,"How do you understand the meaning of the word “expulsion,” does it mean, permanently out of school, forever?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1337.267,1344.752,"Well, even in the sense of the Ohio situation, I don't even think they view expulsion as being permanently out of the school or forever."
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1344.752,1344.9,What does it mean?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1344.9,1355.91,"It's the way the statute reads, it's a removal from the school for the remainder of the school term which may even be 30 days."
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1356.778,1361.884,"Has there been any laws on this, any limitations on this expulsion?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1361.884,1393.858,"I've been able to find -- I've searched hard to find any Ohio cases which have directly taken up this particular statute and the closest thing I can come to in any sense was a case in State Fleetwood in 20 Ohio appellate Second, but that was not to the constitutional nature of the statute itself, it just has not been treated in that context by Ohio Courts."
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1393.858,1408.763,"Would it be correct to or incorrect to say that the difference between the three-judge federal court and the Ohio statute is the difference between ten days and three-days on this suspension, is there --?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1408.763,1423.088,"They seem to be going off as I view it, the only way I can view it is the difference between three and ten days that they seem to view three day as okay, but a period of ten days as violating Due Process."
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1423.088,1425.909,Do you make the same argument for a hundred?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1425.909,1427.643,For a hundred?
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.08,1433.363,"A hundred days, a hundred day suspension?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1433.363,1451.905,"Under my analysis, in this particular case as I've set forth in my brief, while expulsion is not involved in this case, I would have to say that a right of liberty of property would not be involved where the person --"
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.905,1454.045,But it would be in an expulsion?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1454.045,1456.22,"No, Your Honor, I do not believe so, under my analysis."
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.22,1458.479,So it would not be involved in a hundred days either?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1458.479,1460.436,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1460.436,1463.056,You feel that you have to protect that?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1463.056,1501.822,"I feel that the position in light of the Roth case, for example, and also the Cafeteria Workers case follows that the student who is removed from the process, as you used for a hundred days, is in no worse position than the non-tenure teacher who is only told that he is non-renewed, but where this district does not say to every other district in Ohio, for example, don't bother with this child, stops and closes every door to him and I see student in your hundred-day situation being in much the same posture."
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1501.822,1513.868,"You wouldn't think that -- well, in your face as then I gather, this just wouldn't be a question of a pre-suspension hearing, it would be a hearing at all?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1522.093,1532.077,"As I've analyzed the constitution in this sense, I believe that I would have to answer a yes to that."
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1532.077,1536.07,And then what if you're wrong about that?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1538.572,1541.361,And it seems to me that --
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1541.361,1544.348,What about this case?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1544.348,1559.184,It seems to me that we're down to in that posture drawing lines and I raised any question of where will we stop and I can come back to my situation of -- do we go to a hearing process where a person is receiving a grade or something of that similar nature.
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.184,1559.679,Right.
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1559.679,1571.052,"Well, if you were trying to defend a 100-day statute, you would have some additional problems of showing that that did not totally disrupt the student's school progress for that year, would you not?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1576.986,1577.721,Yes and I might have --
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1577.721,1586.344,"Suspension for a hundred days is certainly going to pretty well cut him off for the school year unless some substitute teaching is provided, is that not so?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1586.344,1587.337,"Yes, in my --"
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1587.337,1595.244,But ten days you say is -- the difference between ten days and three days is merely a matter of judgment in drawing a line.
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1595.244,1609.979,"I believe, it fits in to the doctrine of the Ohio discipline inculcating self-disciplinary respect for a 30 days as part and parcel of the process and I think a legislature that does this, a legislature as it has done here with this statute, it doesn't seem to--"
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1609.979,1623.588,"You seem to make that argument, one argument along these lines negatively by pointing out as I recall it that all of these students did just as well or better after they came back to school, is that correct, as I read your brief?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1623.588,1636.362,"As I read the record and have analyzed the record, I believe that the record does not disclose that the particular suspensions involved in this case really had any effect on the outcome of their proceeding through the process."
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1637.721,1642.582,"Why make them go a 180 days, why not let them go 170?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1642.582,1645.685,I believe that should be a question for the state legislature to decide whether they want to?
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1645.685,1649.667,Have the children wasted their time for those ten days?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1649.667,1661.596,"No, they could very well use their time in some other pursuit, for example, they might have received training in a vocational endeavor or maybe working with somebody in the outside."
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1666.043,1669.732,Or perhaps their parents might require them to stay home and study?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1669.732,1672.5,They could very well do that.
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1672.5,1675.77,"Those are things we can't really speculate about, are they?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1675.77,1678.723,"No, I don't think you can engage in that kind of speculation."
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1678.723,1681.878,Could you live with three-day rule?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1681.878,1683.438,"No, Your Honor, I cannot."
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1686.011,1692.624,How would it disrupt the school system with the three-day as compared to ten-day?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1692.624,1693.891,I believe it disrupts the very --
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1693.891,1698.322,"I understand you to say, the only argument is between three and ten?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1698.322,1708.538,"I believe it disrupts the very process I've been talking about and the relationship I've been talking about, that the school system seeks to foster."
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1720.969,1726.449,"Well, doesn't the present rule say that if you give them 11 days you have to give them here?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1726.449,1727.32,No it doesn't.
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1727.32,1728.173,What does it say?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1728.173,1732.185,It doesn't -- it says you can't go beyond the ten days.
1974.73-898,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.185,1733.225,"Well, all that statute here --"
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1733.225,1735.293,Without a hearing --
1974.73-898,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1735.293,1744.62,"All that statute says, Mr. Bustin, the Superintendent can suspend for more than days, it doesn't limit the School Board's power, does it?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1744.62,1751.733,"No, it doesn't limit, the School Board in Ohio is a political subdivision, if you will."
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1751.733,1752.042,"Well, then maybe --"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1752.042,1755.243,It hasn't taken the power away from them.
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1755.243,1785.111,"Maybe a suspension beyond ten days becomes an expulsion, I'm talking now about the very last sentence of the statute that says that no pupil shall be suspended or expelled from any school beyond the current semester, which implies at least as a negative inference that an expulsion could be for a period beyond ten days, but never beyond the end of the current semester?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1785.111,1799.726,"I think, to me an expulsion characterizes something where the district or school says to pupil, in essence, we want to remove you from the school on a permanent type basis."
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1799.726,1806.309,"Well, except the last sentence of the statute certainly doesn't imply a permanent basis?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1806.309,1806.541,No.
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1806.541,1810.788,It's maximum beyond the current semester?
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1810.788,1814.382,"Well, you can't do it in more than ten days."
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1814.382,1815.926,"No, not more than ten days."
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1815.926,1823.854,"And the seven days is so important to you, and I'm asking why?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1823.854,1834.016,I think it's important to the system in the relationship that the district tries to establish in that system.
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1835.99,1839.33,"But specifically, why?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1844.214,1847.749,"Specifically, because I think the --"
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1847.749,1849.211,You like it?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1849.211,1849.577,Pardon?
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1849.577,1850.991,You like it?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1850.991,1867.446,"Not because I like it, I think it's because the legislature wants to have the principal and his relationship with the student, have a broad range of authority here -- limited authority protect not only --"
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1867.446,1867.873,What about five --
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1867.873,1869.461,-- few individuals but the entire school as a whole.
1974.73-898,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1869.461,1875.445,What about five days and you don't have to end up nine?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1875.445,1883.234,"I don't think that -- I think, it's this type of line drawing that we're engaging in gets into this type of problem."
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1889.962,1915.398,"Mr. Bustin, in the number of the states, they have statutes which limit the right to strike except after a ten days notice, they call it colloquially at least the cooling off period, but in your view that there's some cooling off process involved in the ten days that would not be provided in a three-day period?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1915.398,1916.055,"Well, it --"
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1916.055,1918.772,Or at least that that was the judgment of the legislature?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,1918.772,1941.559,"You could be looking at it in the face of this record and say that in a sense, because here the principal that is portrayed in the testimony of the principal Fulton, when he handed out the suspension, he was trying to restore order so that the vast bulk of students could get on with the process of day-to-day learning."
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1972.351,1976.963,"Well, where in this opinion do you find the three-day business?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,2002.534,2015.778,"It gets down to, I believe here, Your Honor, gets down around starting on page from 60 over to 64 --"
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2015.778,2016.146,Where?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,2016.146,2028.523,"In the back, yeah, and on page 63, it gets into in more detail."
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2028.523,2033.861,"Well I think Mr. Justice Blackmun had questioned you, he was trying to profound you counsel?"
1974.73-898,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2033.861,2037.485,"I think, the time is passing Mr. Chief Justice, we'll let it go."
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2037.485,2050.116,"Well, I have one further question, if I may, assuming there is a three-day holding here, there was no cross-petition first, there was no cross-appeal."
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,2064.563,2078.981,"Well, I view this decision, entire decision as being open to review by this Court, I think they probably could argue that the District Court was wrong in drawing its line to three days and possibly should be one or even less than that."
1974.73-898,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2078.981,2080.838,Thank you.
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.838,2094.78,"Could I acknowledge, people with (Inaudible) that they can -- has events to new rules and regulations promulgated in there and are they effective?"
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,2094.78,2110.642,"There is a new procedure that the -- let's say a new procedure, new guidelines, if you will, that the Board sat down -- it's contained on page 25 of the jurisdictional statement."
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.642,2112.716,Are they effective now?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,2112.716,2114.787,They are in effect.
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.349,2116.129,But it's --
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,2116.129,2125.077,-- it's an operational procedure that the principals are told how they will operate under the particular statute.
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.077,2133.183,Were those that passed the muster under the district court’s opinion?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,2133.183,2134.043,I'm not at all sure.
1974.73-898,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.072,2142.871,So you just don't know whether they would have satisfied the district court or not?
1974.73-898,0,42416,thomas_a_bustin,,2142.871,2148.469,"I can't really say it, it sloughed them off in a footnote as --"
1974.73-898,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2148.469,2155.076,Thank you.
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2157.47,2160.159,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2214.275,2222.868,"In other words, you don't read the opinion to say that a suspension without a hearing for three days is constitutionally valid?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2222.868,2224.739,"That is correct, Your Honor, that the Court --"
1974.73-898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2224.739,2225.17,I think the --
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2225.17,2232.586,-- did not engage in the line drawing that seemed to appear in Mr. Bustin's argument.
1974.73-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2253.361,2262.185,What that means that the discretion in the first instance rests with the principal under this opinion for 72 hours?
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2262.185,2263.417,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2263.417,2278.519,"What if we said -- decide to slice it a little differently and say six days, not ten days as the statute required and not three as the district court, but six, would you think there’d be any basis for that?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2278.519,2285.111,"Your Honor, as I understand the lower court's opinion and this would be certainly the position that we would urge."
1974.73-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2306.715,2310.401,Who is going to determine that when and with what consequences?
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2310.401,2323.558,"Your Honor, obviously, there has to be great reliance upon a good faith of school administrators and then there's at some point or other, it does boil down to them."
1974.73-898,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2383.877,2405.377,"Mr. Roos, if the procedures, guidelines, whatever you call it at pages 25 to 29, the factor as I understand it as so it says here July 10, 1973 had been operative at the time this case arose, would you be here?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2405.377,2406.632,"I think, we would Your Honor."
1974.73-898,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2408.658,2409.517,How can you be for sure --
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2409.517,2411.6,"Your Honor, excuse me."
1974.73-898,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2450.264,2452.615,And the gist of it is?
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2452.615,2465.382,"The gist of it is, Your Honor, they really didn't know what they meant and the gist of it is that they were leaving everything up to the principal to determine whether there would be any sort of meaningful protections."
1974.73-898,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2465.382,2474.648,"How do they base them, I mean they do seem to require prior notice and hearing, don't they?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2474.648,2483.126,"Might I read just to give you a sense of how these things were adopted, question, under this plan was --"
1974.73-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2483.126,2484.638,From where are you reading?
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2484.638,2488.125,"Excuse me, from the Appendix of 171, Your Honor."
1974.73-898,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2488.125,2489.333,Volume 2?
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2489.333,2490.785,Volume 2.
1974.73-898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2523.195,2530.491,"And I'm sorry, I missed the earlier part, these guidelines are something that's developed since the decision in this case?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2530.491,2536.614,"They were developed a week before the decision, Your Honor, and presented to the Court on the day of the trial."
1974.73-898,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2536.614,2537.533,Okay.
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2552.477,2553.799,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-898,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2553.799,2567.438,"So the teacher, the principal, for example, could not send a student home for the last hour of a day if the student had misbehaved or been disruptive?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2567.438,2582.204,"Your Honor, we might make something for the rest of the day, it's a severance from the school for the rest of the day, might be something different from -- it might be in the nature, in fact, of a cooling off period."
1974.73-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2584.598,2585.259,But would it --
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2585.259,2590.567,-- so that it might be something different from a severance for several days.
1974.73-898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2590.567,2596.409,"It used to work the other day, either way, you have to stay a little longer at school?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2596.409,2597.509,"Well, Your Honor, we're not certain in --"
1974.73-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2597.509,2604.568,I'm interested in your slicing that day off.
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2619.78,2620.351,"Your Honor, --"
1974.73-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2620.351,2622.299,-- get your point.
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2622.299,2661.861,"It's generally our position that a severance from the school system, putting the child out of the school system as opposed to punishments that might happen internally within the school system or the one-hour, two-hour, end-of-the-day sort of thing, something that is as final and as abrupt as saying you shall not come back tomorrow or for ten days, has the potential of creating serious disruptions in the educational progress of the student and also has some of the stigmatizing consequences that were alluded to before."
1974.73-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2673.459,2682.048,"Mr. Roos, do you claim it's a denial of a property interest or a liberty interest that your clients were going to suffer?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2682.048,2704.604,"Your Honor, it's our position that both the property interest and a liberty interest are implicated. Under this Court’s rulings in Roth, Sindermann, Bell versus Burson, the statutory entitlement cases, this Court has held that a well-established statutory entitlement creates a property interest."
1974.73-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2719.048,2723.919,Do you say a student has a property right then to continue in the school system?
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2723.919,2730.391,"Oh, I think that under this Court's decision, Your Honor, I don't see how there can be any question of that."
1974.73-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2730.391,2739.989,"Well, why didn't the teacher in Roth then have a property interest to continue in as a teacher?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2739.989,2765.523,"As I understand it Your Honor, in Roth, the sense was if the teacher had had tenure under state law, that there had, in fact been a statutory entitlement to continue in employment or something other than a statutory entitlement and understanding as in Sindermann, then there would have been a protected interest and if there had been an invasion, which obviously a fire and would be --"
1974.73-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2765.523,2776.632,Does Ohio law give the student the same sort of a tenure year right to attend school as the statute did in Roth for tenured teachers?
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2776.632,2779.751,"Well, I don't think that there’s any question Your Honor."
1974.73-898,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2786.807,2789.171,Don't you have the compulsory attendance law in Ohio?
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2789.171,2793.925,"We have a compulsory attendance law Your Honor, but further than that, there’s a constitutional --"
1974.73-898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2793.925,2794.329,But then?
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2794.329,2801.735,-- there's a constitutional provision that requires that the -- that public schools be established.
1974.73-898,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2819.75,2843.978,"Mr. Roos, under your submission, is the age of the child or the grade of the pupil relevant in any situation or putting it differently, as I recall, the ages of these appellees range let's say from 13 to 19, does the age make any difference?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2850.703,2852.431,In terms of the right to a prior hearing --
1974.73-898,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2852.431,2852.582,Yes.
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2852.582,2853.994,-- or the right to hearing Your Honor?
1974.73-898,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2853.994,2854.959,"Yes, yes."
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2854.959,2858.151,I don't think so.
1974.73-898,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2901.5,2917.783,"May I ask you this, is it your view that or does the record support the view that a one-day suspension of a sixth grade child would adversely affect the performance of that child in that grade?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2917.783,2922.536,"Your Honor, the record does support that it could adversely affect the child."
1974.73-898,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2922.536,2925.67,That's somebody’s speculation or is there any demonstration of it?
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2925.67,2934.342,There's ample uncontroverted testimony of the sorts of harms that can and do occur in a suspension.
1974.73-898,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2934.342,2936.005,For one day?
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2936.005,2938.244,Any suspension Your Honor.
1974.73-898,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2954.502,2956.137,Volume two?
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,2956.137,2959.596,"Yes, volume two of the Appendix."
1974.73-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2998.19,3014.902,"And of course, aren't there a good many areas in which peremptory action is allowed which involved stigmatizing and no prior hearing and no notice is given if there is probable cause?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,3014.902,3017.667,There maybe some situations of that sort Your Honor.
1974.73-898,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3018.765,3019.759,"Arrests, for example?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,3019.759,3024.143,"Arrest, I know that this court has mentioned."
1974.73-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3038.675,3045.394,Very often people are arrested in situations where there is no emergency.
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,3045.394,3047.145,"Well, that is so Your Honor."
1974.73-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3047.145,3050.711,Sometimes with a warrant and sometimes without a warrant.
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,3050.711,3051.209,I suppose that --
1974.73-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3051.209,3054.436,"There's no notice in advance, is there?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,3054.436,3079.735,"I suppose that that often is the case Your Honor, but we would submit that that there's no reason whatsoever, there is no reason advanced by our opponents and there’s no reason that we can conjure up for not holding some form of protection to ensure that the sorts of harms that we have set out in our brief and which are well-documented in the record will not occur."
1974.73-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3079.735,3090.623,"What about the adverse effect on the other students and their rights to a quiet classroom, to orderly procedures, to --"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,3090.623,3090.818,No --
1974.73-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3090.818,3093.586,-- all the things that teachers and parents desire?
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,3093.586,3118.346,"No question Your Honor that we believe that a disruptive classroom is not a desirable situation, that is why we urged the lower court to adopt the emergency suspension procedure, absent the sort of emergency that is provided for by the lower court decision and which is commonly provided for and adopted in regulations that are voluntarily adopted."
1974.73-898,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3135.457,3142.448,"In your position, is that the constitution compels every school board to adopt this sort of procedure?"
1974.73-898,1,38284,peter_d_roos,,3142.448,3144.959,That is correct Your Honor.
1974.73-898,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3211.157,3218.179,"Very well and I think your time is entirely consumed, Mr. Bustin, thank you gentlemen."
