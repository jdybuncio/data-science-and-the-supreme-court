2002.01-1806,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.617,"We'll hear argument next in Number 01-1806, Lisa Madigan, Attorney General of Illinois, versus Telemarketing Associates."
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,21.095,23.932,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,50.915,51.596,What about--
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,51.596,52.728,--displace these principles.
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,52.728,55.321,--What about 25 percent going to the charitable purpose?
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,55.321,63.259,"25 percent may or may not be a misrepresentation, depending upon what the public was told about the ultimate purpose of--"
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,63.259,75.0,"The public's told, you know, I'm... I'm soliciting for X charity, would you... would you give money, please, for X charity--"
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,75.0,75.872,--If the public--
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,75.872,77.388,--to help children in Cambodia.
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,77.388,78.679,--Well--
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,78.679,82.338,"25 percent of the money actually goes to that purpose, 25 percent."
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,82.338,87.05,--If the public reasonably understands that significantly more than that amount goes to that purpose--
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,87.05,87.422,I... I--
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,87.422,90.309,--then it would be a misrepresentation to rely upon--
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,90.309,90.917,--What do we--
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,90.917,91.539,--that assumption--
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,91.539,96.922,--public opinion poll as to whether the public reasonably understood it was going to be more than 25 percent?
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,96.922,104.679,"--Assumptions form a fundamental part of human communication, assumptions about the meaning of language, assumptions... assumptions about events and conditions."
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,121.843,122.426,Sure.
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,122.426,124.417,--assumption about what that language means.
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.417,150.72,"That was misleading, but it is not misleading to say, I'm going to... this money is going to go to this charitable cause when, in fact, you acknowledge many charities have to pay substantial amounts, substantial percentages in order to, in order to get organizations to solicit for them, and who... who is to say that the 25 percent is too much."
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,152.127,153.014,I think that--
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.014,166.518,"You're just going to give that to a jury and leave the fundraising to be liable criminally or not, depending upon whether this jury thinks that 25 percent is too little to go, or... I... I just... I'm not comfortable with that at all."
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,166.518,171.223,--I... I think the Court needs to distinguish between two different types of circumstances.
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,193.572,198.881,It would still be a misrepresentation even if they had good reasons for... for giving the fundraiser 90 percent of the money.
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,198.881,199.326,--And--
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,199.326,201.115,"It would still be a misrepresentation, wouldn't it?"
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,201.115,211.978,"--And that's my point, that the First Amendment should not displace that principle where misrepresentations are determined based upon whether the defendant made a material representation of fact, and it's... i is no different from--"
2002.01-1806,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.978,221.155,"Well, would this prosecution have been brought if the fee, if the amount given to the charity had been more substantial?"
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,221.155,228.786,"--There's a substantial likelihood, or there's less likelihood that such a prosecution would bought, been brought, because--"
2002.01-1806,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,228.786,236.378,How would anyone know when the Attorney General would be likely to charge them?
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,236.378,244.522,"--I think really the ultimate question is not whether they're going to know whether the Attorney General is going to bring the case, but whether they've committed fraud."
2002.01-1806,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.527,255.043,"Is... is there an intent requirement, an intent to defraud requirement under the Illinois law?"
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,255.043,281.836,"--As to what we've alleged for common law fraud, yes, there is, and we've made that allegation as... with respect to all of the statutory antifraud counts as well, and to the extent that there is a concern about the uncertainty as to whether a specific statement may be a misrepresentation, depending upon the inability to predict exactly what the public may know, then certainly there's no such objection if the defendant, it can be proved knew that they were creating a false impression."
2002.01-1806,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.836,291.47,But one of your affidavits says that one of the solicitees expressly asked and was told that 90 percent or more goes to the vets.
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,294.829,305.166,"Yes, it is, but our position goes further, which is that there is no constitutional value in intentional half-truths or artificial, contrived ways of stating something that may be literally true--"
2002.01-1806,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,305.166,315.522,"No, but the concern that we have is that there's no... there is no way to predict in advance what is going to be treated or what is going to be found as the half-truth."
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,419.509,434.412,"--I would agree that if that were the conclusion as to what would occur in... in... if the law that we advocate were permitted, then the Court would effectively be forced to reevaluate the validity of its precedents, and we are not--"
2002.01-1806,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,434.412,435.187,And maybe we should.
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,437.201,470.663,"--But in this case we are not urging the Court to do so, but it is our... our premise that the... that that conclusion does not necessarily follow, and it has not been established in this case. Ultimately, these speakers know how much is going to be used for various purposes, or they certainly have the ability to know that, and they are the masters of their own speech, and to suggest that they have no ability to know what the public is going to believe, or be led to believe when they make specific representations about seeking money for charity I think is somewhat unrealistic."
2002.01-1806,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,470.663,473.738,"--Okay, let's assume that it's unrealistic in this particular case."
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,487.581,497.111,"But I think that the... the question then becomes whether the Court should displace common law fraud principles, which already provide a measure of breathing room for that type of uncertainty."
2002.01-1806,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,497.916,514.618,"I suppose the breathing room is that there has to be a false statement, a misrepresentation, let's assume with knowledge of its falsity, which is relied upon by the... by the listener, that there's some... has to be damage and so forth."
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,519.361,521.184,--No.
2002.01-1806,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,541.276,547.641,"What would the instruction, though, to the jury be under the Illinois law?"
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,550.691,558.702,"--The State would have to prove that there were a material misrepresentation of fact, leaving aside for a moment the intent requirement."
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.868,611.698,"Well, what... what you say would be very impressive and would eliminate my problems if you were willing to go further and say, whenever you say, I'm raising money for Vietnamese orphans, oh, 100 percent of the money you collect is understood by the public to be going to Vietnamese orphans, but you're not willing to say that."
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,611.698,612.852,"No, because that's not reasonable."
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.089,614.568,Because that's not reasonable.
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,614.568,615.648,--It's not reasonable for the public to assume--
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,615.648,615.88,25 percent.
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,615.88,617.825,--The... there is no--
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,617.825,618.624,So... so the--
2002.01-1806,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,618.624,620.98,--So it has a reasonable understanding.
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,620.98,621.24,--what does... what does the judge instruct the jury?
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,633.342,640.365,"--It's what the Government proves that the donating public understood based upon what they were told, what they were reasonably led to believe."
2002.01-1806,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,677.199,682.264,"Look at all... think of all of the... of the green, dark green briefs."
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,729.649,730.222,Well--
2002.01-1806,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,730.222,737.951,"Now, suppose in your case the defendant proved that he was within one of those examples."
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,773.5,807.076,"I... I think there are two basic answers to your question, Justice Breyer, and one is that the reasonableness of the manner in which the expenditures are made is not a proper subject of the Government's paternalistic bureaucratic oversight to second-guess that judgment, and I think the Court made that clear both in Munson and more specifically in Riley, and we are not arguing that the... whether the... the plaintiff's fraud claim for actual specific misrepresentations turns... they will win or lose, depending upon whether there is some reasonableness element to the manner of the expenditures--"
2002.01-1806,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,807.076,820.234,"No, well, if you're saying that they lose, the telemarketer, even if all the money is being used to help the charity, then I agree with the thrust of the questions that have gone before."
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,820.234,821.377,--Well--
2002.01-1806,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,821.377,825.632,I don't see how you can possibly prosecute people for fraud where there is no fraud--
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,825.632,826.886,--But that leads to--
2002.01-1806,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,826.886,829.541,--and... and that would seem to me a case where there is no fraud.
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,829.541,832.409,--That leads to the second point that I was going to make.
2002.01-1806,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,832.409,833.986,"And it's a charity, too, so there's a First Amendment right."
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,833.986,835.737,"And I don't dispute that, but--"
2002.01-1806,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.737,839.641,"Why... why is there no fraud, just because the charge is reasonable?"
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,869.065,871.882,--That is my answer to the second part of Justice Breyer's question.
2002.01-1806,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,871.882,872.204,All right.
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,889.178,889.83,"No, I--"
2002.01-1806,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,889.83,900.288,Or you intend to convict the... the organization that is simply trying to inform women about the importance of self-examination for cancer.
2002.01-1806,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,900.288,901.533,Is that the answer?
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,901.533,902.377,"--No, it is not."
2002.01-1806,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,902.377,904.436,"Okay, then... then why don't you elaborate on your answer."
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,904.436,906.116,Let me deal with the Nature Conservancy first.
2002.01-1806,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,956.213,956.928,"Counsel, let me ask you this."
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,969.249,971.677,"--It... yes, because it was a trifling amount--"
2002.01-1806,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,971.677,975.278,Is that... is that how you bill the material misrepresentation?
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,975.278,981.31,"--Well, materiality doesn't always have to rise to the level that there will only be a trifling amount that would go to the charity, but there was a significant--"
2002.01-1806,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,981.31,981.85,But in this case?
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,981.85,982.351,--Yes.
2002.01-1806,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,982.351,992.397,"And your... the respondent's brief says, well, the Governor had a charity ball, and just 17 percent--"
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,992.397,993.444,"Well, I... I don't--"
2002.01-1806,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,993.444,994.902,--was kept and no prosecution.
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,994.902,999.455,--I'd rather not use my time to try and explain the misleading--
2002.01-1806,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,999.455,1000.228,Uh-huh.
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,1000.228,1000.935,--impression given by that example.
2002.01-1806,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1020.99,1023.051,"Do you want to reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Huszagh?"
2002.01-1806,0,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,1023.051,1023.712,"--Yes, I would."
2002.01-1806,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.103,1026.838,"Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you."
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1026.838,1040.906,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1806,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1090.572,1093.823,"But isn't that essentially, Mr. Clement, what is happening here?"
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1122.288,1137.593,"--I think that the fundraising costs are part of the analysis of the fraud action, but I wouldn't have read Riley as making that factor wholly immaterial, and I think the important thing is that in the calls in this case, they weren't just saying, we're here to raise money for Vietnam vets."
2002.01-1806,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.192,1148.042,"Well, that's fine."
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1166.995,1168.798,"Well, two responses, Your Honor."
2002.01-1806,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1181.453,1182.991,"We do have to write an opinion though, you know."
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1182.991,1183.876,--Absolutely.
2002.01-1806,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.876,1184.492,Okay.
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1184.492,1202.616,"So let me bring you to the second part of the question, which is, I think there are problems when you have a situation where the only thing that is said is, we're here to raise money for charity, but I think in reality, you have to give... you have to trust juries in common law fraud actions a little bit to take into account the broad nature of the representations that are made."
2002.01-1806,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.595,1224.722,Would you be able to show to the jury how reasonable it is for this particular fundraiser to... to retain 85 percent?
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1224.722,1226.309,I... I think so.
2002.01-1806,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1226.309,1226.809,Why?
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1226.809,1227.015,If every--
2002.01-1806,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1227.015,1227.33,Why?
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1233.031,1235.415,--Because there are other elements of a common law fraud action.
2002.01-1806,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.371,1241.806,How does that go to materiality?
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1243.389,1265.942,"--Because if every single person raising money has had these astronomical fundraising costs, which of course is not true, but if that were true, then a... an individual donor who recognized that might well not have any reasonable reliance on the representations that money is going to charity, because no... no charity, apparently, can get any money to the actual services that money is being raised, but that's not true."
2002.01-1806,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1295.181,1301.589,"Okay, but let's take... let's take the cases, leaving aside the specific misrepresentations here, let's take the case that we've got."
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1311.988,1313.713,"--I... I think that's right, but I... I would say--"
2002.01-1806,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1313.713,1314.143,Okay.
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1314.143,1317.163,--that part of the evidence I'd like to put before the jury on intent to deceive--
2002.01-1806,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1317.163,1317.787,May I ask--
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1317.787,1318.994,--is when a donor asks that question--
2002.01-1806,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1318.994,1319.86,--But the donor--
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1331.485,1337.694,"--I'm reliably informed that this particular proceeding would go as a bench trial, which I think would provide even further protection for free speech."
2002.01-1806,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1337.694,1338.002,Yes.
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1338.002,1357.013,"I think that... my answer is in terms of the jury because I do think that the... the decision that this Court announces is going to affect jury trials as well, but what I'm saying is, I'd like to get before the jury the fact that when these particular fundraisers were asked the question, well, where does the money go, at least the record suggests that they flatly misrepresented where the money--"
2002.01-1806,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1357.013,1404.014,"You... you bet, and that's... that's what you've got in this case, but as Justice Scalia said, we've got to write the opinion, and... and if we consider the case in which there were not these quite specific misrepresentations, all you've got is silence about the percentage, and a statement that the object of the charity is Vietnamese orphans or whatever it may be, it seems to me that when you start getting below the 85/25, you get into an area in which the... the result is a dice throw, and if that is the case, the only way the charitable fundraiser can protect himself, with the greatest good faith in the world, is to disclose the percentage, and if that's what we are going to require in fact, then we better face the fact that we're going to have to retreat from... from what we've already held."
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1405.877,1410.442,"--Well, I would say first that we wouldn't have any objection if you wanted to retreat from what you said in Riley."
2002.01-1806,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1411.169,1411.717,You wouldn't mind.
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1411.717,1412.898,But... but--
2002.01-1806,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1412.898,1412.898,"But isn't that what... that's what we've got to do, isn't it?"
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1412.898,1439.949,"--No, that is not what you have to do, and I think the important thing is the type of hypo of just all they do is call up and say, I'm here to raise money for charity, what that hypothetical tends to do is force the analysis into the single variable analysis that's reflected in broad prophylactic rules, and the answer in these cases, and I think what the opinion should suggest, is that the context does matter terribly, so to take some of the questions--"
2002.01-1806,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1439.949,1440.282,Okay--
2002.01-1806,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1440.282,1462.876,"--that concern Justice Breyer, if I could, when he's worried about the start-up charity, well, if a start-up charity says, hi, we're a start-up charity, we are trying to raise money for a new cause, and here's what we hope to do with the money, that's very different than if a start-up charity picks up the phone and says, we're a start-up charity, and we're going... if you give us money, we're going to help this particular child in this foreign country."
2002.01-1806,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.557,1627.147,"--Thank you, Mr. Clement."

2002.01-1806,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.644,1692.916,"Well now, I don't read the record quite that way, Mr. Copilevitz."
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,1713.786,1715.163,"No, I'm not, Your Honor."
2002.01-1806,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1758.843,1759.698,"Well, what if--"
2002.01-1806,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1759.698,1800.596,"--Why... why is it that if... if we assume that the donors would not have given the money had this statement been made, that that is not a large part of showing a misrepresentation, I mean, I assume people wouldn't buy automobiles or toasters if they knew that the manufacturer was getting 95 percent of... of the cost and there was... only 5 percent went into raw materials, so there's always some problems here, but let's suppose that 95 percent, 100 percent of the donors would not have given the money if they had known the facts."
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,1806.892,1811.405,"Well, you're dealing with the lesser of two evils."
2002.01-1806,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1825.323,1830.665,"Well, why isn't it material if... if the money would not have been given had the... had the fact been disclosed?"
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,1830.665,1832.815,--The percentage doesn't--
2002.01-1806,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1832.815,1836.337,That doesn't... isn't that another way of saying the person is acting under a misimpression?
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,1836.337,1850.938,"--No, because the whole concept is built on the only return the nonprofit received is the net dollars, and as this Court recognized in Riley, there is a wide range of values that the organization receives from the appeal itself."
2002.01-1806,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.938,1865.728,"Mr. Copilevitz, it seems to me you have to respond to Justice Kennedy, no, that it doesn't constitute fraud simply to refuse to tell somebody something which, if he knew, he would not have made the contribution."
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,1885.583,1886.368,No.
2002.01-1806,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.368,1892.131,"Certainly you don't have to tell someone everything which, if he knew, would make a difference."
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,1893.438,1894.614,I agree.
2002.01-1806,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1894.614,1906.582,"But if you ask a question and you give a false answer, the two examples were given... I was struck by another... one of the affidavits' comments."
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,1922.667,1924.959,Is it tax deductible?
2002.01-1806,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1925.376,1929.57,Is the 100 percent tax deductible when 80 percent goes to the fundraiser?
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,1929.57,1933.101,That presume... the answer to your question is yes.
2002.01-1806,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1985.469,2017.068,"May I ask a question that's not entirely hypothetical? Suppose Congress, trying to get a handle on fundraising operations that are really operating to line the pockets of the fundraiser, rather than for the benefit of the charity, would say, if more than 40 percent of what is collected goes to the fundraiser, then the donor will get a tax deduction only for the amount that actually goes to the charity."
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,2040.767,2041.114,Yes.
2002.01-1806,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2073.777,2102.648,"I'm... I'm sorry, I don't... that may be the purpose of the organization, so that's for the charitable purpose, to spread the word about drunk driving, but the example that I gave you is, the fundraiser says, you're not a very appealing charity. If you want us to raise money for you, we're going to charge a great deal, and you get... you'll get something, where if you were doing it on your own, you'd get nothing."
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,2114.519,2122.254,--You presume that the contract is made at arm's length in the marketplace.
2002.01-1806,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2129.036,2135.856,"Well, I... we presume that just as some charities pay too much for fundraisers, some of them may pay too much for their corporate offices."
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,2157.516,2163.701,And the charity may have all manners of expense that may be relevant to one donor but not be relevant to another.
2002.01-1806,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2163.701,2174.399,"Mr. Copilevitz, a moment ago you said that in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois there was a statement that the defendants had made no affirmative representation."
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,2186.643,2202.123,"It appears in page 348 of the opinion, and I quote: Further, VietNow has never expressed dissatisfaction with the fundraising services provided by the defendants, and there is no allegation that defendants made affirmative misstatements to potential donors."
2002.01-1806,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2202.123,2223.4,"What about the allegation in paragraph 63, from 1987 through the present, in conducting their charitable solicitations, the donors made representations which induced the donors to contribute funds for charitable purposes by representing that the funds they contributed would go to charitable purposes."
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,2230.203,2232.973,But the affidavits were inherently unreliable.
2002.01-1806,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2233.575,2237.799,"No, no, I'm saying, in terms of whether there is an allegation in the complaint."
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,2237.799,2245.089,--It's not... those... those affidavits are incorporated for the sole purpose of demonstrating that there was not a disclosure of the fee paid.
2002.01-1806,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2256.477,2256.963,I'm not understanding.
2002.01-1806,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2256.963,2257.395,No.
2002.01-1806,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2257.395,2292.67,"I thought that the question is simply whether they've alleged that there were specific affirmative representations, and the status, I gather from the SG's brief and what I've just read, is that they allege there were representations, and then they attached affidavits which have in them, and there's a footnote in the SG's brief that list the affidavits, statements as to particular affirmative representations, and... and therefore, I want to know is that, if that issue isn't in the case, fine, but... but I'm somewhat puzzled as to why it isn't."
2002.01-1806,2,35578,m_errol_copilevitz,,2292.67,2294.161,--It's not in the case.
2002.01-1806,3,39419,richard_s_huszagh,,3261.613,3266.24,I'd like to first correct two clarifications in the record.
2002.01-1806,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3456.208,3456.779,"Thank you, Mr. Huszagh."
