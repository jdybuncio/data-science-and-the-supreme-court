1967.29,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,14.14,"The next case is number 29, Sanford Zwickler, Appellant, versus Aaron E. Koota as District Attorney of the County of Kings."
1967.29,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,17.668,22.709,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1804.949,1809.595,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2005.323,2007.199,Are you arguing here that --
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2007.199,2036.88,"No, I just wanted to give the Court -- in approaching the question whether the District Court, the three-judge Court, properly decided the question of whether the appellant should be relegated to the State Court, I consider it important to set forth to this Court the nature of the statute that we're dealing with."
1967.29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2120.653,2122.49,"Well, I take it, if he has his name on it, then --"
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2122.49,2123.467,He has his name on it.
1967.29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2123.467,2127.349,"He can't -- he can't get involved with the statute, can he?"
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2127.349,2131.223,"No, he's not prohibiting the statute."
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.376,2213.812,Departure from what?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2213.812,2223.67,From this respect for federalism which was set forth not only in Dombrowski case but in many prior cases.
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2258.325,2265.045,"Well, why should that take with it the question of the constitutionality of the law?"
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2287.546,2287.66,No.
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2287.66,2289.38,But you would make the same argument --
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2289.38,2289.69,We'd make --
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.69,2289.909,Wouldn't you?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2289.909,2293.188,"-- the same argument because, in essence, the --"
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2293.188,2293.29,"Well, you don't need to talk about --"
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2293.29,2294.569,Whether you label the --
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.569,2296.364,You don't need to talk about an injunction then.
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2296.478,2297.256,"Yes, well --"
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.256,2298.735,-- deciding a federal question.
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2298.735,2317.923,"Yes, whether you label it an injunction or not, it would be in a nature of a similar relief because he would be seeking a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional and that the District Attorney or the law offices of New York State could not properly prosecute him."
1967.29,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2445.234,2454.054,"Mr. Hirshowitz, did you in the three-judge court urged abstention?"
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2454.054,2466.187,What the -- what our office urged before the three-judge Court was that the statute was valid against the challenge made by the appellant.
1967.29,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2504.672,2509.447,"You have no objection to the three-judge Court passing on the constitutionality, did you?"
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2509.447,2512.185,The three-judge Court did not pass on the Constitution.
1967.29,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2512.185,2523.302,"My question was, did the Attorney General's Office have any objection to this three-judge Court passing on the constitutionality of this statute --"
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2523.302,2523.478,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.29,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2523.478,2525.058,At that time?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2525.058,2527.898,"Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall, we did."
1967.29,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2527.898,2528.94,Why?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2528.94,2559.808,"Because we urged the Court that, under the principle of the annunciated in the Dombrowski case to which I refer, under the respect for the State Courts, the principle of federalism should be maintained in this case and that the appellant should be relegated to the State Courts, that there were no special circumstances which justify --"
1967.29,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2559.808,2568.17,"Do you agree that it's -- this is an important issue -- the statute raised an important issue that should be decided, do you agree on that?"
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2568.17,2592.436,"Well, it's important in the sense 36 states have the -- have similar statutes, so has Congress pass such a statute, but it's not important that we felt all the while and we feel today that this was the -- this was an action where the appellant and his counsel simply decided they wanted a test case."
1967.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2734.428,2740.923,Is there any animation in what you said about the way the case was contrived that --
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2740.923,2741.392,"No, sir."
1967.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2741.392,2745.211,That this is not an actual case for controversy?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2745.211,2763.19,"I don't want any reflection on my adversary who is a distinguished friend of mine, but I believe that this is a contrived controversy in this sense that the appellant deliberately brought about his arrest in order to set up a test case."
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3018.844,3023.734,You say it -- do you say that the statute is perfectly clear on its face --
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3023.734,3023.879,"Yes, sir."
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3023.879,3032.134,"-- perfectly straightforward, there's not much room for construing the statute in any particular regard."
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3032.134,3036.808,"We say it's not necessary to construe the statute because we say, on its face, it is--"
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.808,3037.787,But the constitutional question --
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3037.787,3038.846,-- it is constitutional.
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3038.846,3043.046,Constitutional question is right -- staring you right in the face then where--
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3043.046,3043.287,Yeah.
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3043.287,3045.725,In whatever port you take it.
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3045.725,3047.149,That's our position.
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3064.849,3089.609,"To rule -- I gather, your rule on abstention would be that, automatically, in any case where the constitutionality in the state statute is questioned in a Federal Court, the Federal Court should abstain and let the State Court decide it unless there are some special circumstances which indicate that it ought to be decided in Federal Court."
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3090.221,3098.503,"Mr. Justice White, I think, as I read the cases, that's the principle that's annunciated."
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3106.34,3110.23,Do you -- do you think this is -- is this your reading of Dombrowski?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3110.23,3111.162,"Yes, sir."
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3111.785,3122.119,Do you think that you -- this applies not only to issuing the injunction but to deciding the basic question at all?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3122.119,3134.53,"Well, the case that we have -- the issue was one in which the appellant is seeking an injunction against the -- what he alleges as a threatened criminal prosecution."
1967.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3289.511,3292.897,Can you satisfy this statute?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3304.172,3306.758,"I didn't hear that, Your Honor."
1967.29,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3306.758,3316.33,Can you satisfy this statute merely by printing the name of the company that did the physical act of printing up the circular?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3316.33,3316.641,No.
1967.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3413.957,3430.699,"Mr. Hirshowitz, on the question of relief, I understood Mr. Redfield to say that, in the event, we believe that the Court below should not have abstained, that the constitutional question is here and we should decide it here."
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3431.99,3457.359,"Well, of course, under the fundamental principles, if the District Court was wrong, and we believe the contention that it was wrong is not tenable then the thing this Court should do is send it back to the District Court as it has done in a numerable other cases, like the reapportionment cases, for it to make the decision."
1967.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3457.359,3460.19,You don't believe the issue is here before us now.
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3460.19,3461.269,"No, sir."
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3461.269,3470.461,Is there any issue here of any kind except the constitutionality of the statute when the -- if the case should be put to trial?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3478.402,3487.285,"Well, as I say, it -- if the judge -- Circuit Judge Kaufman and Judge Sovath didn't pass on the merits at all, I --"
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3487.285,3489.566,What -- what issue would they have to pass on?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3489.566,3509.888,"They would have to pass on the question of whether the -- in an action for an injunction against threatened criminal prosecution, under the principles annunciated in the Dombrowski case and some prior cases, whether the Federal Court should dismiss the complaint and relegate the plaintiff, the appellant is --"
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3509.888,3515.497,"Assume that that judgment is reversed, the dismissal is reversed, and it is sent back for trial."
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3518.338,3518.608,The --
1967.29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3518.608,3520.267,The three-judge -- the constitutionality is --
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3520.267,3531.019,"The Court would pass on the -- I assume, the Court would pass on the question of whether the statute is unconstitutional on its face."
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3657.124,3663.464,"But your question is basic, is the Act constitutional, isn't it?"
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3663.464,3664.731,"Well, that's the --"
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3664.731,3665.52,That's the basic issue.
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3665.52,3670.697,"But the statute -- Mr. Justice Black, the statute has been on the books --"
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3670.697,3672.425,I didn't ask you that.
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3682.768,3685.794,"But, before that, you have the preliminary question of procedure it's--"
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3685.794,3688.619,Well I -- forget procedure for a moment.
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3690.758,3706.118,"Well, if you eliminate the question of procedure and assume that the appellant has-- that there's a justifiable controversy and that he's entitled to relief if the statute is unconstitutional, then, sure, the --"
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3706.118,3707.221,That's the basic issue in question.
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3707.221,3708.464,"Sure, that's the question."
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3708.464,3709.616,And that's all?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3709.616,3711.692,"Yes, that would be the issue, and I'm not --"
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3711.692,3720.23,Why should there be effort made by procedural devices or anything else to prevent the trial of that issue so that that issue could be determined?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3720.23,3751.852,"Well, as I understand it, Mr. Justice Black, there this is a question that has been engaged in discussion in this Court in a number of cases that I have read and, as I gather in my humble way and as the two judges of the three-judge Court concluded, this Court has held that it will respect the principle of federalism in the type of action that we have before us unless there are special circumstances which dictate otherwise and --"
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3751.852,3759.992,But the real basic question here is the constitutionality under the federal constitution of this Act.
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3761.519,3761.958,That would be --
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3761.958,3763.974,Under the federal constitution?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3763.974,3766.3,"Yes, sir, Your Honor."
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3770.502,3771.354,That's right.
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3771.354,3771.648,And -- and --
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3771.648,3774.448,The procedure's suggestion has been made from time to time.
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3774.448,3814.069,"The -- the point at which the appellant is trying to push this Court is that, following Dembrowski which said the special circumstances, they're trying to push this Court to say what you have suggested, Mr. Justice Black, that there should not be any limitations at all, that if you present the matter to the Court showing a -- as you said, a federal constitution or provision or state statute, a challenge on the ground of the First Amendment, that the Federal Court should take jurisdiction without --"
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3814.069,3817.908,"There must be many occasions, many occasions."
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3840.555,3840.756,No.
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3845.312,3847.604,Constitutionality under the Act.
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3847.604,3858.268,"There's -- there's an elemen t-- this is a highly emotional issue, the literature issued in the campaign on the eve of a presidential election --"
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3858.268,3859.21,"Well, that's the merit."
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3859.21,3859.413,Yes.
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3866.798,3869.436,Is that a state question or a federal question?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3869.436,3872.213,"Well, the State Courts may have --"
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3872.213,3874.995,Is that a state question or a federal question?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3874.995,3875.436,It's a federal question.
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3875.436,3877.062,You have to basically decide.
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3877.062,3883.938,"It's a federal question, but the State Courts may have a better awareness of the nuances because the --"
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3883.938,3885.496,What nuances?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3885.496,3889.272,The legislative history was developed in the state.
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3936.123,3939.139,Does it have anything to do with the constitutionality of the Act?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3939.139,3974.197,"It may not but the result, as I understand it, in constitutional law, the result many times is determined by the background and in the Talley case, Mr. Justice Black, which I think you wrote the opinion you pointed out, that there was no legislative history which justify the particular identification requirement in the circulars, but I think the states would have a better appreciation of all that --"
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3974.197,3975.86,What did that case hold?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3975.86,3976.708,What?
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3976.708,3978.25,What did that case hold?
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3978.25,3995.705,"The Talley case, I think against California, was a case in which the city ordinance was enacted which forbid the distribution of any circulars or pamphlets there without any restriction of any kind and --"
1967.29,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3995.705,3997.884,"Well, what about -- anonymous?"
1967.29,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3997.884,3999.413,"Anonymous, yes."
1967.29,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4037.036,4038.042,Mr. Redfield.
1967.29,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,4038.042,4042.822,"I just want to take a few minutes to controvert some remarks made here, Your Honor."
1967.29,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4043.944,4045.008,Is that very few?
1967.29,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,4045.008,4047.871,"Very few, I have about four."
1967.29,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4177.236,4178.6,Where is the pamphlet?
1967.29,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,4178.6,4181.203,That he -- he has it.
1967.29,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4196.052,4198.566,You mean that's not -- he did not sign it?
1967.29,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,4198.566,4202.283,"No, he didn't sign it."
1967.29,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4236.412,4242.043,Very well.
