1983.82-2120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.648,We will hear arguments first this morning in Smith against Robinson.
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,13.0,18.073,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-2120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,274.672,284.848,"Mr. Larson, you say that your clients prevailed throughout the litigation on their due process claim."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,289.83,302.91,"The characterization of Judge Campbell's opinion... or in the opinion, is that we ultimately prevailed as a matter of the Education for all Handicapped Children Act."
1983.82-2120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,316.468,323.012,What is the difference between prevailing through the course of the litigation and ultimately prevailing?
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,325.924,332.278,"No, I was saying that there is no question on this record whatsoever, Justice Rehnquist, about the fact that the plaintiffs prevailed."
1983.82-2120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,334.149,337.401,"Well, but the Court of Appeals seems to have held otherwise."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,337.401,338.192,"--Oh, no."
1983.82-2120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,348.2,353.663,"Well, I think the Court of Appeals agreed that the plaintiff prevailed without a doubt."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,359.146,362.288,"--But that is belied by the record, Your Honor."
1983.82-2120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,362.288,369.154,"But then you're arguing about a question of fact, really, where the Court of Appeals is against you, and we ordinarily don't review questions of fact."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,369.154,379.82,"Justice Rehnquist, it doesn't matter with regard to the statutory threshold that plaintiffs must meet through Hensley v. Eckerhart how plaintiffs happened to prevail here."
1983.82-2120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,396.042,413.412,"Well, but I don't suppose anyone disputes that, but I think what the First Circuit says is you prevailed on the EAHCA count; that's an all-embracing statutory claim that really covers everything you could have gotten on your constitutional counts, and since that doesn't provide for attorney's fees you can't get them."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,413.412,424.78,--The First Circuit's decision on the fee issue is different from the First Circuit's decision on defendant's appeal on their motion to dismiss.
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,450.486,462.745,"Mr. Larson, did not the district court, after the decision of the state supreme court, say that you had prevailed as a result of the state decision?"
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,462.745,465.957,The district court--
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,465.957,466.438,It did?
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,466.438,471.47,--in its final order on the merits held that we had obtained the objective of our lawsuit.
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,471.47,473.35,That you'd obtained all the relief you sought--
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,473.35,474.271,That's correct.
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,474.271,475.841,--as a result of the state decision.
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,475.841,476.763,That's correct.
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,476.763,486.841,And was it not after that decision was made by the district court that you filed your second amendment and alleged a 1983 action?
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,486.841,488.321,"No, that's not correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,488.321,489.913,When did you first file that?
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,489.913,499.801,"The second amended complaint was filed after the summer of 1980, the June 1980 decision by the Rhode Island Supreme Court."
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,499.801,500.291,That was after--
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,500.291,502.973,That was one year before the final order on the merits.
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,502.973,507.127,--But it was after the decision of the supreme court of the state.
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,507.127,516.523,"That's correct, and that nonetheless related back to... I mean, it was a motion to file a second amended complaint, which was granted and which relates back."
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,516.523,521.679,"But the point is, hadn't you obtained all the relief you sought before you filed your amended complaint?"
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,521.679,523.569,Not necessarily.
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,563.237,569.768,But was there a substantial issue left after the decision of the state supreme court?
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,569.768,594.225,"The matter of compliance, yes, plus there was also the matter that on this record in this case the state hearing officer decision was still on the record in this case, and that plaintiffs had a right to have that decision basically stricken or recognized as not controlling, and that is indeed something that happened in the final order."
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,594.225,612.527,"On the same point, I also fail to understand what happened and why there was a year's worth of litigation after the state supreme court issued its ruling, which furnished the only basis for the ultimate ruling in the federal court."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,612.527,616.29,"It's true, Justice O'Connor, that a year in time passed."
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,661.271,663.982,"On what, the fee?"
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,663.982,668.615,"Well, basically the Petitioners wanted a ruling on federal law."
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,683.553,689.149,You made two different types of due process claims during the course of the litigation.
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,689.149,690.268,That's correct.
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,690.268,696.323,"One was against a local school committee, and that was the basis of the original--"
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,696.323,696.784,"Well, but that was also against the--"
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,696.784,699.084,"--injunction, I guess, the preliminary injunction."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,699.084,704.426,"--Yes, an injunction which was continued also against the state after the state was brought in."
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,704.426,713.242,"Yes, but that was really a complaint concerning the termination of funding pending resolution of the dispute against the school committee."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,713.242,714.123,"Well, no."
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,717.336,720.818,The funding for the child's education.
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,720.818,721.489,That's correct.
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,721.489,723.219,All right.
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,733.398,739.332,"It was a Gibson v. Berryhill type claim, challenging the bias in the process itself, yes."
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,739.332,741.543,And no relief was granted under that claim.
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,741.543,742.284,That's correct.
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,754.542,760.534,"Well, but didn't the terms of the preliminary injunction run only against the school committee?"
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,760.534,762.536,"Initially, yes."
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,770.872,776.065,"Well, but the terms of the injunction did not run against these Respondents, did it?"
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,776.065,781.41,"As state actors, acting in cooperation with the local defendants--"
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,781.41,784.429,"Well, did it or not, in terms of the words of the preliminary injunction?"
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,784.429,787.852,"--In the words of the preliminary injunction, it's only against the school board."
1983.82-2120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,787.852,788.252,Thank you.
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,795.247,795.758,Yes.
1983.82-2120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,795.758,796.757,--Is that what you meant?
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,796.757,797.999,It was the--
1983.82-2120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,797.999,799.248,Could you answer the question?
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,799.248,800.13,--Yes.
1983.82-2120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,823.446,825.679,I don't think you're answering my question.
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,833.492,834.542,"--Yes, it was."
1983.82-2120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,834.542,836.474,--to run against the state defendants as well.
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,836.474,837.614,"Well, the state defendants--"
1983.82-2120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,837.614,839.136,"Now, is that true or not?"
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,840.125,844.84,"--As Justice O'Connor pointed out, it did not name the state in the injunction."
1983.82-2120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,844.84,847.431,So it never did run in terms against the state defendants?
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,847.431,851.825,In that they were co-actors responsible in this litigation--
1983.82-2120,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,851.825,853.034,Were they named in the injunction?
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,853.034,854.066,--No.
1983.82-2120,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,854.066,862.754,"Mr. Larson, could I bring you back to something you started off with, and that was your reference to Maher against Gagne."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,862.754,863.844,Correct.
1983.82-2120,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,863.844,868.258,"The First Circuit mentioned it once in its opinion, as I recall."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,868.258,869.627,That's correct.
1983.82-2120,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,869.627,873.14,"Just once, and sort of by a passing way."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,878.432,879.713,I certainly think--
1983.82-2120,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,879.713,881.173,Maybe I should ask your opponent that question.
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,881.173,884.406,"--Well, I certainly do believe they overlooked it."
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,902.979,915.779,"Well, if we thought that was error and vacated the opinion and sent it back, would it be open in remand for the application of the Hensley principles announced last term?"
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,915.779,921.802,"The Hensley principles, even pre-Hensley, were applied by the district court."
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,922.841,923.693,"Well, it doesn't appear to have been."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,923.693,933.019,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, you referred to the fact that the substantive due process claim with regard to the Gibson v. Berryhill issue was not one on which claims prevailed."
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,968.752,979.078,"Mr. Larson, I'm afraid we've not given you much time to argue the case, but the point that I asked you about before is central to my own understanding of the case."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,993.338,994.129,That's correct.
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,994.129,1002.363,--did you ask the district court on your return to it to give you any relief that the state supreme court had not given you?
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1002.363,1008.407,There was a motion filed with regard to the due process claim involving the lack--
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1008.407,1009.108,When you say a motion--
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1009.108,1009.759,--of impartiality--
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1009.759,1020.936,"--a motion filed, was this in your complaint that had already been filed some time before, or did you... what did you request specifically when you went back?"
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1020.936,1033.986,--We requested that the hearing process itself be declared violative of due process because of interested persons acting as hearing officers.
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1044.241,1049.426,"The district court, though, still said that you had won everything you ever sought?"
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1049.426,1054.538,There is no question that the major issue in this case was Tommy's education.
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1068.527,1076.973,"And you did not file your 1983 claim until after, according to the district court, you had won everything the plaintiff sought?"
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1076.973,1079.333,"No, the 1983 claim was the first claim in the case."
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1079.333,1081.026,"Yes, but you've been paid for that work."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1081.026,1083.306,No.
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1106.966,1112.96,"Well, why was it necessary, then, for you to amend your complaint, the second amended complaint?"
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1112.96,1122.275,"The first amended complaint added the Education for All Handicapped Children Act claim, because that had then become an effective federal law."
1983.82-2120,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1125.545,1132.08,And when did you add the Section 1988 claim?
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1132.08,1137.944,The Section 1988 claim was in the first amended complaint and also in the second amended complaint.
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1179.141,1207.969,"On that point, Mr. Larson, the Court didn't discuss, and I don't believe the briefs do, cases such as Brown against the GSA and Pryzer versus Rodriquez, where this Court has said that a detailed comprehensive statute precludes remedies under the broader 1983 type claim."
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1213.174,1216.206,We believe that those cases are inapposite.
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1216.206,1217.007,Why?
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1217.007,1219.877,The First Circuit here applied Middlesex County.
1983.82-2120,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1267.409,1286.662,"Can't you define legislative intent by the fact that the Congress has enacted a very specific, detailed plan for these education for the handicapped provisions, and refer to that instead of 1983?"
1983.82-2120,0,22659,e_richard_larson,,1286.662,1287.093,--No.
1983.82-2120,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1550.524,1557.769,Mr. Avila.
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,1557.769,1560.881,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.82-2120,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1580.393,1582.716,You mentioned travel of the case.
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,1584.737,1588.189,"--That's I think common in the First Circuit, too."
1983.82-2120,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1590.45,1592.932,We've come across it in one other case.
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,1592.932,1597.686,"I was not aware that it was an unusual expression, Your Honor."
1983.82-2120,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1600.048,1604.328,"You never find it in California, anyway."
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,1604.328,1622.471,"In this case, long before the Commissioner of Education became involved in it, what happened was the local school committee agreed that the child concerned should be placed at Bradley Psychiatric Hospital, and so the school committee did that."
1983.82-2120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1906.669,1908.839,As a matter of state law?
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,1908.839,1910.87,"--As a matter of state law, Your Honor."
1983.82-2120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2015.771,2017.811,May I go back to the beginning again?
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2029.428,2037.095,"The funds were about to be withdrawn, and I don't know, we don't know, what the results would have been."
1983.82-2120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2037.095,2038.264,But the allegation is--
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2038.264,2039.746,But the local school committee had withdrawn the funds.
1983.82-2120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2039.746,2043.289,"--But the allegation in the complaint was was that there was a risk the child would be transferred, wasn't that right?"
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2043.289,2044.861,"Well, I think the--"
1983.82-2120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.861,2046.321,At least the funds were going to be withdrawn?
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2046.321,2049.012,"--The funds were going to be withdrawn, which would terminate that placement."
1983.82-2120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.507,2054.566,"Well, I understand."
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2059.561,2061.691,"Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly what he did."
1983.82-2120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.691,2064.623,"And that action rested entirely on federal law, did it not?"
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2064.623,2066.025,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-2120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2087.087,2095.275,But at least the theory of the complaint was that the failure to follow the correct procedures violated due process and therefore there was a 1983 claim.
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2095.275,2097.025,--Enough to keep the--
1983.82-2120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2097.025,2101.499,"Well, that's really the only claim in the original complaint."
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2101.499,2104.728,"--That's the only, that procedural due process was being violated."
1983.82-2120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2104.728,2106.71,Was the only claim in the original complaint.
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2106.71,2108.931,As I understand the original complaint.
1983.82-2120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2108.931,2111.964,And that is what maintained the status quo.
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2114.425,2116.696,"Exactly, Your Honor, and that's what happened."
1983.82-2120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2121.811,2127.855,"If at least there's a colorable argument that it was based on 1983, why doesn't that support a fee award?"
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2127.855,2138.993,"--Your Honor, that might well, as the First Circuit indicated, might... I'm not conceding the point... might support a fee award against the school committee."
1983.82-2120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2172.105,2189.065,"Mr. Avila, why did the Court of Appeals not address the Maher versus Gagne type approach and talk about the substantiality of the constitutional claim and the meritorious nature of the statutory claim under 504?"
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2189.065,2198.04,"Well, I think, Your Honor, they do mention that decision, and why they did not... why they did not follow it is simply this."
1983.82-2120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2230.341,2238.506,"Well, my question was just why you think the Court of Appeals didn't come to grips with the test--"
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2238.506,2239.538,"--I think they did come to grips with it, Your Honor."
1983.82-2120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2270.497,2276.213,"--Well, do you think that is consistent with the approach in Maher versus Gagne in all respects?"
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2276.213,2285.266,"I think it is, Your Honor, when you're dealing with a case where in our judgment the constitutional claims are really the same, they're consubstantial."
1983.82-2120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2310.564,2330.627,"Well, if there's no repeal of 1983 by implication, in effect, for these purposes and the two avenues of relief are open, then you have to determine the substantiality of the 1983 claim, I guess, if that's your position."
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2330.627,2332.418,"Well, I think there are two positions there."
1983.82-2120,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2349.748,2354.213,Under a Brown versus GSA type of approach?
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2354.213,2359.486,--That sort of left it that this Act was obviously meant... it prescribes things that are never going to be prescribed constitutionally.
1983.82-2120,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2379.638,2392.447,"Well, I didn't think the Court of Appeals held that there wouldn't be a 1983 action, or it didn't hold that this Act precluded any parallel remedies anywhere else."
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2400.952,2420.477,"Well, what they were saying is that the only reason why these constitutional claims were added from the Commissioner's perspective was sort of transparently, I would suggest, for the purpose of getting attorney's fees."
1983.82-2120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2632.904,2639.599,Would that argument suggest that it was error for the district court to certify the question it did to the Rhode Island Supreme Court?
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2639.599,2643.711,"I would be... well, that might be true."
1983.82-2120,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2653.238,2657.061,"In retrospect, it seems you were quite wrong, doesn't it, under Pennhurst?"
1983.82-2120,1,23514,forrest_l_avila,,2657.061,2663.666,"Well, Pennhurst was... could have been, could be wrong."
1983.82-2120,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2678.656,2679.154,Very well.
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2680.636,2682.357,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-2120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2753.473,2756.705,Weren't you obliged to allege them in the original complaint?
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2756.705,2762.189,--The 504 claim could have been alleged in the original complaint.
1983.82-2120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2762.189,2763.14,"Well, weren't you obliged to do it?"
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2763.14,2765.091,"No, we were not obliged to do it."
1983.82-2120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2765.091,2767.842,You mean you should hold one of them back?
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2767.842,2771.926,"There was no intentional holding back, Your Honor."
1983.82-2120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2771.926,2773.526,For sandbagging purposes?
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2773.526,2775.098,"No, this was no sandbagging, Your Honor."
1983.82-2120,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2775.098,2777.189,For fee purposes?
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2777.189,2778.36,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-2120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2893.676,2895.145,"But Mr. Larson, how can you say there is no Pennhurst issue?"
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2901.522,2902.922,--There is no--
1983.82-2120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2902.922,2906.555,Why isn't that directly... isn't that exactly what Pennhurst prohibits?
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2906.555,2909.527,--no federal court interpretation whatsoever of the state law.
1983.82-2120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2913.26,2918.222,"Well, I know it was done on defendants' application, but it doesn't mean it's consistent with Pennhurst, does it?"
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2918.222,2929.97,"Pennhurst for Eleventh Amendment purposes, as I understand Pennhurst, bars a federal court order based upon state law, an injunctive order requiring state officials to comply with state law."
1983.82-2120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.8,2934.434,"Well, I thought--"
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2934.434,2940.378,"Jurisdiction was alleged solely on our 1983, 504, and '75 Education Act."
1983.82-2120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2940.378,2947.151,"--Well, I thought earlier in the argument it was developed that all of the relief was based entirely on state law, as you eventually got through."
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2948.113,2951.886,Plaintiffs obtained the objectives sought in this lawsuit.
1983.82-2120,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2951.886,2955.078,"Against state defendants, based on the state law, in a federal court."
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2955.078,2958.418,As a result of a state court ruling--
1983.82-2120,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2958.418,2966.174,But the Court of Appeals said that the relief really rested on a federal statute.
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2966.174,2968.335,"--In their second opinion, yes, they did."
1983.82-2120,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2968.335,2980.823,"And so they interpreted, reinterpreted the whole run of events and said that it was under the Education for the Handicapped Act."
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2980.823,2988.197,"The State of Rhode Island decision, because it starts out with several paragraphs discussing the federal law--"
1983.82-2120,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2988.197,2996.842,Could you tell me in a word why you think you're entitled to fees for the state administrative proceedings?
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,2996.842,3011.562,--It gets into an interpretation of this Court's decision in New York Gaslight versus Carey as to whether or not there has to be a mandatory exhaustion proceeding or whether fees are also available--
1983.82-2120,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3011.562,3018.197,"Yes, but the mandatory exhaustion proceeding is under a statute that doesn't provide for fees."
1983.82-2120,2,22659,e_richard_larson,,3018.197,3021.019,--That issue is not before this Court.
