1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,41.637,"We will hear arguments next in 74-6593, Gardner against Florida."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,46.323,48.887,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,119.596,128.81,"What was the basis of a trial judge’s determination, was it not the nature of the crime which --"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,128.81,130.46,One problem --
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,130.46,140.736,Where would the district judge find out the facts to become fully aware of the facts that would motivate his decision there?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,140.736,143.356,"Your Honor, that’s really the crucial problem of the case."
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,145.707,151.959,"Well, where do you normally find out what are the facts of the case, in the courtroom, is it not?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,151.959,159.164,"As to the facts of the incident as opposed to the individualized considerations of the defendant, it would be from the trial."
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,171.908,174.474,You have no idea what was not disclosed?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,174.474,187.915,"Your Honor, the State has recently about three weeks ago as an appendix to its brief reproduced what purports to be a fact simile, the confidential portion of the pre-sentence investigation which is something that we have not seen until now."
1976.74-6593,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,191.288,197.9,"Mr. Livingston, I wonder if you would lift that microphone up a little bit or -- it’s hard for me to hear you over here."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,198.461,200.027,Thank you Mr. Justice.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,200.027,202.096,And where do you say that is in the --
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,202.096,206.494,It’s appendix A to the Appellee’s brief Mr. Justice Brennan.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,206.494,207.74,Yes.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,207.74,210.708,And this is after this Court grant certiorari.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,210.708,222.823,"Well now, perhaps, are you going to address any of this as information that you might have tested and you had it at the time of sentences there?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,222.823,225.614,"Yes sir, with your permission I’m going in to that right now."
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,262.918,270.991,"Well, my question was though, are there content, is the content here, had you had it at the -- been given to you at the time the sentencing (Voice Overlap)"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,270.991,271.524,"Yes, there are --"
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,271.524,274.46,"That you might have introduced evidence to contest, that’s my question?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,274.46,275.144,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,275.144,277.083,"I see, are you -- you could tell us what that is?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,277.083,277.757,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,277.757,278.855,Alright.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,278.855,301.24,"Obviously, Mr. Justice Brennan, this is then arguendo because we’re not assuming is proper before the Court, we’re not admitting but there are at least three factors that are significant here and a false law jury one, in the information that was disclosed, petitioner and his counsel, there was information, he had a series of assault charges, all of which were dismissed, were now frost."
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,326.789,327.981,You’ve lost me there.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,327.981,329.14,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,329.14,336.61,"You are addressing your comment to the pre-sentence report, are you?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,336.61,337.929,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,337.929,346.924,"Well, would the officer making that pre-sentence report not to be familiar with the evidence in the case?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,346.924,351.246,"Your Honor, it would not be the evidence in the case so much as background of the individual."
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,351.246,351.701,Well --
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,351.701,352.297,And --
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,352.297,368.231,"But you are addressing yourself to his lack of capacity to make some of these observations but by this time, the case has been tried and the jury has returned its verdict and its public knowledge as to what went on."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,368.231,387.812,"I’m sorry Mr. Chief Justice Burger, if I let you strained, but we’re not contesting the actual incident for which petitioner was convicted but rather probation officer was referring to other instance going back to 1960 or something which we do not admit occurred."
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,394.757,402.342,"Well, now, for example, I’m looking at page 57, I’d like to get clear what you’re suggesting to?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,416.408,417.27,No sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,417.27,438.011,"And what you’re saying here is that here at length, this confidential report discusses an incident at Fort Myers and lines up with the -- he broke into a trailer and noticed the colored man sitting in the front parlor with no clothes on and his wife in the backroom with a white band apparently fighting or arguing."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,451.043,452.526,I didn’t represent petitioner at trial.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,453.958,456.322,I’m speaking of the sentencing hearing.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,456.322,456.775,Pardon?
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,456.775,457.958,At the sentencing hearing.(Voice Overlap).
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,463.213,469.396,I think he was entitled to notice that something that was going to go before the judge and then to have with the consultation of his counsel.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,478.168,480.118,Which is that now?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,480.118,483.422,And that would be the end of the first paragraph.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,493.246,494.79,"Now, this is on the victim, the (Voice Overlap), that’s the first wife."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,494.79,496.417,"Correct, that is the victim."
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,497.663,505.609,"And in other words that he had a record of at least three times beating on the same woman for whose killing he was convicted, is that right?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,505.609,505.977,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,511.432,513.647,And that was not in evidence at the trail.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,513.647,515.394,No sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,515.394,518.07,Or before the jury that was determining sentencing.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,518.07,520.792,No sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,520.792,525.75,"Of course that was, -- it would have been an evidence, it would hardly have been helpful to your employer."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,525.75,529.398,No sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,536.227,548.92,"But would that have been admissible under the new Florida capital punishment law at the sentencing proceedings before the jury, after the conviction?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,548.92,553.409,I believe it would've been admissible under Florida statute 921.41.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,560.457,565.926,But we simply can't (Inaudible) -- would the state had to produce witnesses at the sentencing proceeding?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,565.926,566.499,The Florida --
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,566.499,567.106,Isn’t that right?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,567.106,573.019,The Florida statute does provide that the state can use hearsay testimony in sentencing proceeding.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,573.019,578.592,"No, my question is, could they have used this report, would that be enough or would there had to be some --"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,578.592,583.253,"Well, what they would've had to done is precisely what was not done here Mr. Justice Brennan."
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,583.898,586.485,"That’s what I’m trying to get at, what would they have had to do?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,586.485,587.014,Okay.
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,610.292,629.693,Do you suggest that there is anything in this report which was not disclosed at the time of the sentencing hearing which would have tended exculpate and to persuade someone that the death sentence should not be imposed?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,629.693,640.007,"Well, Your Honor, I think, if I may turn that just a little bit and that goes to what appears to be the state's position, it's all harmless error anyway regardless."
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,640.99,647.176,Wouldn’t it be harmless if there was exculpatory evidence here which you might have exploited.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,647.176,647.438,No sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,669.852,679.4,It’s your view that the -- that there is no way of determining what the judge had in his mind when he imposed the death sentence.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,679.4,683.34,I think that we are forced to speculate and that takes out a harmless error rule under Chapman.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,688.877,691.887,"Now, the jury had voted for death."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,698.795,699.29,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,705.175,714.255,"Well, I’m putting out the other way, I gather you think it's significant, the jury voted only for life and it’s the judge who voted death after having seen this and not disposing it."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,714.255,714.524,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,715.875,718.055,"Petitioner said voted, he imposed with that sentence."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,718.055,718.214,He rejected --
1976.74-6593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,718.214,723.442,At what point in the Florida Courts did you raise this point?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,723.442,728.217,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it was first raised before the state Supreme Court."
1976.74-6593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,728.217,729.51,"On your appeal, from what?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,731.366,731.943,No sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,737.163,740.58,So you made it in your opening brief in the Supreme Court of Florida?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,740.58,742.394,It was mentioned but not with the exactness.
1976.74-6593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,747.986,752.011,"But this is the per curiam opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida, it doesn’t even deal with it."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,752.011,757.923,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the per curiam opinion in the State of Florida does not deal with any issue advanced by Appellant in that court."
1976.74-6593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,764.368,772.319,But it's your contention anyway that you adequately raised it in the Supreme Court of Florida so that under Florida procedure they would have to consider it?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,776.101,785.171,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, their practice is in capital cases to consider errors even if not contemporaneously objected to at the trial level."
1976.74-6593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,795.056,801.529,"So any error that you adequately raised in your brief, they must consider under Florida practice."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,801.529,802.646,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,812.14,817.284,When did you first know that the court had relied on this?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,817.284,832.873,"Your Honor, the court's statement at the time of sentencing was -- I have furnished to counsel or has counsel for the state received the portion of the PSI report to which they are entitled."
1976.74-6593,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,838.654,840.379,It’s out of the case now?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,840.379,849.368,"So presumably, they could figure out that if they were only receiving portion of it that it -- there was a portion that wasn’t been given to him."
1976.74-6593,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,849.368,854.077,"Well, when did you know -- when did you first know that there was some --"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,854.077,861.797,"We did not know for sure and -- excuse me, we still do not know for sure, Mr. Justice White, if there is in fact a written confidential portion, the pre-sentence in this case."
1976.74-6593,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,861.797,865.823,"Well, how did you know – you’re claiming that he did rely on something though."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,865.823,868.467,"We are claiming that he stayed in this findings of fact, he considered it."
1976.74-6593,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,868.467,878.51,But did you have any opportunity after that to present your question to the trial court or was the only place you could take your point to the Supreme Court.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,878.51,880.232,State Supreme Court.
1976.74-6593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,880.232,883.615,You couldn’t have made a motion for a new trial?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,883.615,888.093,"Yes, defense counsel could have it, it was not done."
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,888.093,891.669,"But suppose you prevail, what happens to this case?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,891.669,900.504,"Well, if we prevail, it seems to us, there are at least three possible things that could happen on remand, one would be simply to send it back to the state’s Supreme Court and say consider it now."
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,900.504,901.624,For a re-sentence.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,901.624,901.954,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,932.738,935.608,When they will say re-institute or redetermine?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,935.608,936.626,Re-institute.
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,937.463,944.849,"Well, you’re assuming this conclusion all of it in advance, when you say re-institute the sentence."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,965.198,974.884,"Your Honor, I hesitate to do so, I know, this court hesitates to do so, but I think, given the gravity of the decision he has already made is beyond any human being to say, Oops!"
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,990.033,994.141,A new sentencing procedure before the sentencing jury.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,994.141,995.059,Correct Your Honor and that --
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,995.059,1000.856,In which this total information would go to that jury.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1000.856,1003.443,"If the judge intends to use and consider it, yes sir."
1976.74-6593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1003.443,1010.721,"But you don’t claim there was any defect in the sentencing proceeding before the jury, do you?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1010.721,1012.052,No sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1012.052,1015.922,Then why should there be any sentencing proceeding?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1015.922,1024.633,Because we think that -- the Florida procedure seems to be something of a hybrid.
1976.74-6593,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1048.92,1054.014,Do you agree that the least you can get out of this is life?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1054.014,1055.34,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1055.34,1056.391,Well --
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1056.391,1057.54,In the case in its present posture.
1976.74-6593,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1057.54,1062.604,So why do you want to upset the life verdict that the jury gave you?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1064.582,1067.531,I don't.
1976.74-6593,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1067.531,1071.709,"Well, what’s the purpose of getting to the judge so they can give death?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1071.709,1071.877,Oh!
1976.74-6593,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1080.659,1090.029,Why don’t you take the position that jury was okay because the jury didn’t have this information?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1100.158,1100.421,"Yes, I see that --"
1976.74-6593,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1100.421,1103.966,I thought that's what you were saying when you started out but now you have changed.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1103.966,1116.048,"I think my difficulty is that on remand we would submit, petitioner submits that the proper solution would be to give to a different and he would have to have the benefit of that information and perhaps it could be done by stipulation by a case stated --"
1976.74-6593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1116.048,1125.005,Did this Court ever in a state proceeding said that if a case would have to go back for retrial or re-sentencing before a different judge.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1136.256,1143.302,"Not to my knowledge Mr. Justice Rehnquist, yet we would point out, this is a capital case under the post Furman, post Woodson, post Proffitt procedures --"
1976.74-6593,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1143.302,1145.054,So what?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1145.054,1154.642,"Well, because this point is extremely a significant decision has to be made with the utmost regard for procedural regularity."
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1174.408,1174.711,The matter is --
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1174.711,1175.036,What we don’t --
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1175.036,1177.575,-- proposed by this report?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1177.575,1185.59,"No, Sir, but what we are getting to is that what -- how this report might have actually used and again would force a speculation."
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1185.59,1201.394,"Could you not have demonstrated to the sentencing jury all the information which is in this report, about his lifelong drinking habits, his tendency to violence."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1201.394,1205.696,"Well, the problem with the drinking and violence is that these things could cut those ways."
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1207.995,1215.66,"It cuts syndicate – it cuts not both ways if you want to go back to that sentencing jury, it cuts only one way."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1229.911,1230.073,"Well, Your Honor --"
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1230.073,1232.275,It's a possibility.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1232.275,1242.876,"When I was talking the use of the information in the confidential portion of PSI, I was attempting to address the issue of how the judge might have used it since we’re forcing to speculating."
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1270.214,1272.922,Let me understand how this Florida procedure works.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1279.263,1279.94,Correct.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1279.94,1283.189,And that's an adversary hearing of course is --
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1283.189,1283.94,Correct.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1283.94,1288.412,"Now, then, after -- then the jury goes out and it return it's recommendation."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1288.412,1289.241,Correct.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1289.241,1293.915,And then what’s the proceeding before the judge after the jury’s recommendation of life?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1293.915,1294.374,Right.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1306.148,1307.718,Was there any hearing of any kind?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1307.718,1308.279,No sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1325.443,1336.95,"Well, suppose when they asked counsel, do you have anything to say, counsel, well, what you’ve given us, I would like to offer some evidence opposed to as much as you have given us."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1336.95,1337.398,"Well, the --"
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1337.398,1339.351,Would he have done that?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1339.351,1344.149,"Well, I think we’ve enforced speculating in the difficulty ruling Mr. Justice Brennan is, that he was no given --"
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1344.149,1349.296,"No, but there is a Florida procedure call for that before the judge actually imposed a sentence."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1357.955,1363.536,The Florida procedure allows locution immediately prior to the imposition of sentence.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1363.536,1364.687,"No, but how about a [Laughter] --"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1364.687,1369.275,"But there’s no clear step in the statute that says, you have a separate opportunity for argument at the time of the judge’s decision."
1976.74-6593,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1369.275,1377.855,So at least there is no adversary hearing before the judge mandated by the Florida statute.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1377.855,1378.041,Subsequent to --
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1378.041,1384.218,The Florida (Voice Overlap) does not require or even give an adversary hearing before the judge.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1384.218,1389.751,"Subsequent to the return of the jury’s advisory verdict, correct sir."
1976.74-6593,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1389.751,1404.029,"So that insofar as the judge’s function is concerned, it's just as in likely the more traditional states where judge does the sentencing except that he does have a jury recommendation."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1404.029,1408.055,He does have a jury recommendation in a line of cases decided subsequent to the sentencing.
1976.74-6593,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.055,1408.897,"Well, he has the record."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1409.92,1415.18,He has a written record and in a line of cases decided by the state Supreme Court subsequent to the petitioner’s case.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1421.399,1422.791,"Well, that’s the point, isn’t it?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1488.336,1489.141,"Yes sir, it was."
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1490.133,1496.954,Do the Supreme Court of Florida have the confidential -- even the Supreme Court of Florida have the confidential part of this pre-sentence investigation?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1496.954,1497.477,No sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1497.688,1500.239,The dissenting opinion has suggested -- he didn’t --
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1500.239,1500.487,It did not --
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1500.487,1502.586,How could it be possibly reveal the sentence then?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1502.586,1503.557,Correct.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1531.352,1542.959,Wasn’t it implicit in the Florida law that at least thought understood in upholding that all of this would be open and above board both from the trial court and in the appellate court.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1542.959,1543.31,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1553.101,1583.633,"When you came to the point that the jury had returned this recommendation and you were before the judge, before the final stage, was there any evidence tendered on behalf of the sentence to convicted man or profited in any way to enlarge the showing to the judge as to why he should accept the jury’s recommendation."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1583.633,1585.1,"No, Mr. Chief Justice furthermore there was --"
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1585.1,1588.094,"Well, wasn’t that the occasions for it?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1588.094,1594.303,"If petitioner and his counsel had known what was in the confidential protion of PSI, it very well might have been."
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1603.39,1612.458,"Mr. Livingston, a little while ago, you said that the jury must have found some mitigating circumstances, can you enlighten me as to what those possibly were?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1612.458,1619.285,"Yes Sir, they were instructed pursuant to Florida statute 921.41 to the mitigating circumstances provided by that statute."
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1624.273,1625.26,"Under extreme, what?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1625.26,1632.942,"Mental or emotional disturbance or to his capacity to recognize criminality, conform his conduct to it was substantially impaired."
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1632.942,1635.455,Did you argue this to the jury?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1635.455,1639.186,I believe it was argued in effect based on the drinking.
1976.74-6593,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1653.926,1656.896,And those arguments of course were available to the Court.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1656.896,1658.537,Certainly.
1976.74-6593,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1658.537,1665.39,"Mr. Livingston, before you conclude, I would like you to complete your answer to a question that what asked very early in the argument."
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1680.714,1680.911,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1686.089,1687.214,And what was that again counsel?
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1687.214,1690.007,There is also a claim in the confidential portion.
1976.74-6593,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1703.136,1712.756,Also that he assaulted his first wife two more times in the 1970 and 1972 on page 58.
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1712.756,1713.106,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1718.282,1720.495,Would you like to know whether those are (Voice Overlap).
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1720.495,1720.954,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1734.239,1742.856,"And you said you want to know that in order to persuade the judge that it isn’t true, that’d be one approach, would it not?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1742.856,1748.498,"That would be one approach Mr. Chief Justice or to fashion an argument as in Herring v. New York, you needed --"
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1748.498,1759.532,"Or you say that it is true and that this shows this is a lifelong pattern of conduct which is in your view a reason why the death sentence should not be, I suppose you could play that --"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1759.532,1763.88,Correct Mr. Chief Justice and we claim that we need to know before the decision is made.
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1766.052,1786.695,"Well, then utmost your remedy would be a remand to the district judge to do what you now say he should've done at the time or his -- your client’s then counsel should have done had he known these things and go through the process again, is that right?"
1976.74-6593,0,19472,charles_h_livingston,,1786.695,1793.925,We think the constitution under pending of our argument be required to at least go back to the point of the jury’s verdict and then forward.
1976.74-6593,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1804.214,1809.411,Mr. Allbritton.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1809.411,1813.665,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1981.226,1990.232,"Isn’t it correct that as a matter of Florida law only a portion of the pre-sentence report is disclosable or do I misunderstand, I’m not --"
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1990.232,1997.203,You misunderstand the rule provides that a trial judge may disclose all of it.
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.203,1997.78,I see.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,1997.78,2000.833,If he so deems fit.
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2016.372,2022.622,"Now, doesn’t the Florida practice require the Supreme Court to search the record for all possible material error."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2022.622,2024.671,They searched everything they had down there.
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2024.671,2031.077,And is the procedure they followed in this case consistent with their later description of the procedure in the Tedder case.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2031.077,2032.434,"Yes sir, I think so."
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2032.434,2038.472,"Can it be consistent if they did not look at the same material that the trial judge relied on, on their own initiative?(Voice Overlap)"
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2038.472,2041.396,I don’t think that it can because it was not made an issue.
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2041.791,2048.527,But I thought you just said that they have a duty independently to investigate every potential issue that’s material.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2050.614,2051.645,They do in the --
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.645,2056.456,And why is the absence of a requests of any materiality though.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2056.456,2061.908,"Well, it is because they just didn’t have it in front of them justice."
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2066.183,2079.242,"But if they knew as they did, that the trial judge relied on something not before them, didn’t the Tedder opinion indicate that they would've independently made an effort to find out what was the basis for his decision of death row than life."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2079.242,2080.656,"No, I think that’s --"
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2080.656,2082.789,Isn't that what Tedder in substance says.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2082.789,2083.422,Yes it is.
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2087.847,2092.962,"Well, if they read the dissenting opinion, they knew that the trial relied on something that they did not have before them."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2092.962,2095.022,And that was the first time it was brought up.
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2095.022,2097.931,But does that matter under Tedder?
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2097.931,2098.318,No sir.
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2142.572,2148.382,"Well, why shouldn’t the Supreme Court of Florida look at it?"
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2148.382,2154.525,"They can justice -- if its made a part of the record on appeal, they can."
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2154.525,2169.212,"Well, you don’t suggest that the point wasn’t made in the Florida Supreme Court that the trial judge had relied on material that had not been disclosed."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2174.555,2177.845,I deny that emphatically.
1976.74-6593,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2180.171,2186.224,"But you say it was not raised -- it was not raised by the parties but it was raised by the dissenting justices, was it not?"
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2186.224,2191.42,It was commented on by Justice Ervin in his dissenting opinion.
1976.74-6593,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2191.42,2196.332,"Is this wrong, I’m reading from page 26 from the petitioner’s brief."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2218.999,2228.401,That Your Honor has to do not with the failure of the trial judge to disclose the confidential aspect of the PSI.
1976.74-6593,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2244.257,2252.161,"Well, his brief goes on and then gives much more details about it."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2252.332,2271.734,"Well, I know it does and in the brief that he filed into the Supreme Court of Florida, he mentions but not in the context that it was error for the trial judge not to disclose and particularly so, when it had not been requested by the defense counsel."
1976.74-6593,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2271.734,2275.926,"It must have been bad, the --- how did the dissenting judges find out about it?"
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2275.926,2276.885,I beg your pardon sir?
1976.74-6593,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2276.885,2280.779,How did the dissenting justices find out that this was a point in the case.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2281.836,2288.633,Because it was mentioned in the brief of appellant filed in the Florida Supreme Court.
1976.74-6593,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2301.614,2303.956,"Well, I know Mr. Allbritton."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2322.048,2326.223,I believe sir that all they could review is what's before them.
1976.74-6593,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2326.223,2329.671,"Well, I’m asking you, in light of what Tedder held."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2329.671,2330.821,Yes.
1976.74-6593,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2330.821,2340.421,As it's the responsibility of the Supreme Court under the new Florida statute.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2340.421,2353.006,That’s a hard one to answer because it's hard to say that they have a duty to go into matters that is not before them that no point has been raised as to this at all.
1976.74-6593,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2353.006,2353.132,No.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2358.628,2359.785,"No, I don’t sir."
1976.74-6593,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2360.31,2363.764,The dissenting justices --
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2363.764,2374.718,He pointed it out but even he did not say that it was error because the trial judge failed or refused to disclose the confidential aspect of it.
1976.74-6593,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2380.49,2412.576,"Well, isn’t that possible that since this is an evolving area of the law, both at the level of this court and in the states, by virtue of these recent holdings that the Tedder opinion cited after the court passed on this case, the Florida court indicates some enlarging of their view of the matter of what they should consider."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2412.576,2415.882,That could well be.
1976.74-6593,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2416.973,2446.041,"If the case were to go back, in your view, should it go back to the Supreme Court and I emphasize the “if” to go back to the Supreme Court of Florida for their reconsideration taking into account the material now in the record or do you think it should go back to the sentencing judge?"
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2446.041,2475.294,"Well, if that terrible event occurs then I think it should go back to the Supreme Court of Florida with directions to review the confidential portion of the PSI in order to determine whether or not there was manners and things in there that should have been disclosed to the defendant and his attorney so that the same could be rebutted."
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2491.423,2506.804,"Well, this Court upheld the Florida statute on the representations of Florida through its Attorney General and through its Supreme Court and through its legislature that this would be an open and above board proceeding and now we get to this case and there wasn’t one."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2515.195,2517.385,"Well, it is discretionary."
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2519.383,2521.089,"Under your Florida rule, yes."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2521.089,2527.028,What's wrong with that? You have a federal rule that’s comparable to it.
1976.74-6593,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2545.392,2560.94,"That rule however, federal level has not been considered or litigated in connection with the imposition of a death sentence under the new federal statutes however."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2560.94,2561.991,"No, that’s true."
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2574.324,2602.13,"It says the dissenter has certainly raised this, couldn’t it -- it could hardly had been clear on what he said, we have no means of determining on review what role such confidential information played in the trial judges’ sentence and thus I would overturn appellant’s death sentence on the basis of this fundamental error alone and Mr. Justice Boyd joined that and certainly I would suppose the other justices of your court read the dissenting opinions that are filed."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2604.009,2606.748,They saw it and evidently didn’t agree with it at all.
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2606.748,2607.727,"Didn’t say a word about it, didn’t they?"
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2607.727,2609.686,And they didn’t say a word about it.
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2619.151,2622.037,"(Voice Overlap) when his client was sentenced to death, did he?"
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2622.037,2641.764,"Well, he might have been happy about that but he thought that he had a fair trial or else he would've enunciated the procedure to have the PSI set up to the Florida Supreme Court which he didn’t do."
1976.74-6593,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2649.622,2652.575,"Well, you have a lot of time yet."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2652.575,2653.294,I do?
1976.74-6593,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2653.294,2654.682,"Please, you have 30 minutes."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2654.682,2660.449,Alright sir.
1976.74-6593,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2747.861,2766.175,"Can you think of any reason counsel why, if a motion had been made before the sentencing judge on behalf of the defendant to produce the entire pre-sentence report."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2769.471,2770.796,Absolutely not.
1976.74-6593,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2780.357,2786.159,Is there anything in the record to indicate why he did not do that on his own motion?
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2786.159,2788.609,I don’t know why he didn’t do it.
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2812.334,2817.414,Did the trial judge indicate publicly that he’d relied other pre-sentence investigation at all.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2817.414,2819.74,"Yes, he did, the whole thing."
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2835.761,2847.627,"Well, in general, how about the statement that the subject, it spent time in the brig, in the military, now that’s not in the public portion of the PSI and how did he know that the judge had that before him."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2852.739,2857.632,"Well, if he said it to the probation officer, it must be accurate then."
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2857.632,2858.943,"Well, but how do we know he said."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2868.717,2870.752,No sir.
1976.74-6593,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2888.538,2899.963,We’ll resume there at 1 o’clock counsel.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2902.482,2907.194,"Yes I do Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2988.245,2990.186,Where did this court say that?
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2990.186,2991.585,Woodson v. North Carolina.
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2991.585,2994.178,Did that involve a pre-sentence investigation or discretion of the sentencing judge?
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2994.178,2996.487,It involves the statute.
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2996.487,2999.413,"That involved a jury, didn’t it?"
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,2999.413,3001.112,"It involved the statute too, I know, the jury, yes."
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3001.112,3008.077,Didn’t it involve the sentencing by the jury and the -- you don’t give a confidential pre-sentence investigation to a jury.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3008.077,3008.542,No.
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3008.542,3010.627,"That is evidence on open court, isn’t it?"
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3010.627,3011.205,"Yes, that’s true."
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3011.205,3015.868,"That was the system, statutory system at issue in the Woodson case, wasn’t it?"
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3015.868,3019.134,"Whatever kind it was, still the judge has to have it."
1976.74-6593,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3019.134,3020.296,"Well, --"
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3020.296,3020.92,Excuse me.
1976.74-6593,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3020.92,3026.15,But suppose that’s what the court said through Mr. Black in Williams against New York.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3026.15,3026.617,Yes it is.
1976.74-6593,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3026.617,3030.564,I thought you were quoting from Williams against New York.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3030.564,3033.205,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3249.592,3259.17,"Is it not correct that in the Williams case, the out of court information which the judge received was disclosed to the defendant and its counsel in open court."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3259.17,3259.845,No sir.
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3260.904,3267.337,The only issue in that case as I read it was the question of confrontation of the out of court sources of evidence.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3267.337,3287.318,"Well, Justice Stevens, I didn’t read it the same you did it because the way I read the case, it was not disclosed to the defendant or his attorney and they claim before this court that that constituted a denial of due process and this court said, absolutely not."
1976.74-6593,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.414,3394.36,"Suppose the trial judge in arriving at his sentence, looked at a pre-sentence report and then said in his findings, I find the following aggravating circumstance and proceeds to find an aggravating circumstance and then says based upon the pre-sentence report."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3394.36,3400.77,"Well, in the case that we are thinking about now, the judge read all of the pre-sentence report and -- (Voice Overlap)."
1976.74-6593,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3400.77,3402.722,He read the presentence report.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3410.317,3411.484,I beg your pardon sir.
1976.74-6593,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3414.263,3418.79,"I know, but let’s supposed the case -- let’s suppose -- I said that suppose a case --"
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3418.79,3439.147,"Well, if we’re going to suppose that then, trial counsel, if he knows his way in and out of the court is going to require that the confidential part be disclosed and if refuses to do that, he can have it put in to transcript on the record on appeal --"
1976.74-6593,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3439.147,3461.107,Isn't perhaps your strongest point here that the judge guided by the statute found an aggravating circumstance based upon the evidence before the jury namely that the crime was especially heinous and found that there were no mitigating circumstances.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3461.428,3463.252,That’s right.
1976.74-6593,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3497.011,3501.005,"That’s not uniform, there are some that do not follow that rule."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3501.005,3502.099,"Well, there are some people -- yes, sir."
1976.74-6593,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3502.099,3508.233,There are some federal courts where the pre-sentence report is filed in the clerk’s office.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3508.233,3525.448,"That’s true but I think I speak for the majority that they regard the decision to disclose or not as discretionary with the trial judge and when he doesn’t disclose, it does not constitute a denial of due process."
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3526.365,3535.37,"Mr. Allbritton before you do, one of the reasons for not disclosure is to protect informants from possible retaliation by the defendants or things of that nature."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3539.525,3540.202,Yes.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3540.202,3545.194,When he is to be executed by judicial due process or --
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3545.194,3545.574,I think it does.
1976.74-6593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3545.574,3547.809,How can he retaliate after this all takes place.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3547.809,3549.828,"Yes, yes."
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3603.039,3613.349,"Did you indicate earlier, General Allbritton that you didn’t understand that the sentencing judge relied on the presentence report."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3613.349,3616.23,Not expressly no -- he relied that among other things Mr. Justice Stewart.
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3616.23,3621.922,"It seems to be very expressed, I’m looking at page a 138 of the appendix, you’re familiar with that I gather."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3621.922,3623.197,"Yes, sir."
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3623.197,3659.75,"Which he says two different times -- he says, first of all he received the presentence investigative report, on the said defendant by -- and received by the state defendant’s attorney of a copy of that portion there after which they are entitled and then he says and after carefully considering and waiting, waiving and reviewing the factual information contained in the said pre-sentence investigation, the undersigned concludes and determines that aggravating circumstances exist to whip itemized as under any sentences the defendant to death."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3661.838,3663.778,"Not in total, no sir."
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3670.203,3673.143,"No, but he suggested, that was in total think, Mr. Allbritton."
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3674.955,3676.59,"Yes, he did take it."
1976.74-6593,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3679.368,3682.511,You made it very expressly clear that he did so.
1976.74-6593,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3682.511,3683.695,Your time is up Mr. Allbritton.
1976.74-6593,1,43802,wallace_e_allbritton,,3683.695,3685.29,Thank you.
1976.74-6593,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3685.29,3686.027,Thank you.
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3688.012,3688.721,"Yes Your Honor, may it please the Court."
1976.74-6593,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3688.721,3690.328,You have a minute left.
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3690.328,3691.089,Thank you.
1976.74-6593,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3691.821,3693.379,One minute.
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3693.379,3698.467,"As to Williams, Mr. Justice Stevens is exactly correct, that was the confrontation case."
1976.74-6593,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3730.889,3742.84,"Could I ask you, how could the pre-sentence report have influenced or affected the judge's finding that there was the aggravating circumstance of an especially atrocious crime."
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3742.84,3746.403,He could've affected it by knocking out the mitigating circumstances in which the jury --
1976.74-6593,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3746.403,3750.52,"I am getting to that, how about the aggravating circumstance?"
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3750.52,3753.324,That circumstance was in open court before both judge and jury.
1976.74-6593,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3753.324,3763.013,So that you put that aside but do you think the pre-sentence report might be relevant to the establishing a mitigating circumstance.
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3763.013,3766.277,Or to the disregarding and mitigating circumstance which necessarily must have been --
1976.74-6593,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3766.277,3770.4,I know but he found there were no mitigating circumstance.
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3770.4,3772.251,Correct.
1976.74-6593,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3780.545,3790.498,"Suppose he had no pre-sentence investigation at all and he had disagreed with the jury, he wouldn’t have any complaint then or you’ll have a complaint but not this one."
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3790.498,3798.331,"That would not be found upon the confidential report -- the undisclosed, unjustified, unexplained nondisclosure, the confidential portion, no sir, it would not be."
1976.74-6593,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3798.331,3808.384,Or do you think there might be something in the pre-sentence report affected his judgment about their being a mitigating circumstance present or not.
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3808.384,3821.528,"Sir, I believe that we’re being pushed into speculating as to what effect did his decision making process at this crucial stage and then by being forced to speculate takes out harmless error in any event."
1976.74-6593,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3829.977,3837.155,Are you familiar with the Florida Supreme Court decisions in the Songer against State and Swan against State.
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3837.155,3838.394,Yes sir.
1976.74-6593,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3838.394,3852.128,"Both of which were cited and presently approved in the one of the opinions in Proffitt and each of which approved the use of a presentence investigation report by the sentencing judge under the Florida system, didn’t they?"
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3852.128,3856.494,"That’s correct Mr. Justice Stewart, neither of which addressed the confidential problem however."
1976.74-6593,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3856.494,3864.828,Was it clear in each of those cases that there had been a disclosure to the defendant or his counsel of the contents of the pre-sentence investigation.
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3864.828,3871.567,"In Songer, I am certain there was a disclosure of the non confidential portion but not the confidential portion."
1976.74-6593,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3874.953,3884.927,"Both of those decisions were implicitly approved, weren’t they in the footnote number 9, in one of the opinions in Proffitt."
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3884.927,3886.728,Correct.
1976.74-6593,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3886.728,3893.988,"Well, Signer expressly states that he receive a copy of the PSI and it doesn’t differentiate between the non confidential and the confidential part, yes."
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3893.988,3896.143,That’s correct.
1976.74-6593,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3896.143,3898.006,"Well, then you are mistaken."
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3898.006,3898.852,On what point sir?
1976.74-6593,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3898.852,3904.067,In saying that they -- there was not a disclosure of the confidential portion of it in Songer.
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3904.067,3904.858,No sir.
1976.74-6593,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3920.813,3929.217,"Of course in Songer or Swan, in one of the cases at least the Florida Supreme Court set aside the death sentence."
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3929.217,3930.296,Had the Swan --
1976.74-6593,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3930.296,3932.257,Swan.
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3932.257,3934.162,Songer is still under the sentence of death.
1976.74-6593,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3934.162,3946.736,I think you said in your opening argument that -- were these case back before the jury you would object to the submission of the pre-sentence report to the jury.
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3949.452,3960.988,My understanding at the time of -- that point in the argument Mr. Chief Justice was the information as to the guilt deciding phase of the trial as being collateral incidence relevant to a crime.
1976.74-6593,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3970.165,3976.877,"At that point, the guilt has been determined by the jury, why would that be excludable?"
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,3976.877,3982.335,"No sir, what I was about was -- if there is an effort to it, introduce it at the guilt determination."
1976.74-6593,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3983.863,4009.509,"We were talking in your opening argument about the possibility of the case being before the sentencing jury after the determination of guilt and I understood you to say that if the case by some chance should get into that posture by virtue of any remand, you would object to the introduction of the report, at that stage, in the sentencing process?"
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,4009.509,4016.452,"Well, my answer may not be responsive, my understanding at the time of making that answer was related to the first half of the trial, it didn’t involve here."
1976.74-6593,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4033.241,4040.271,"Well, if it went to the sentencing jury, you surely would have a copy of it."
1976.74-6593,2,19472,charles_h_livingston,,4044.024,4051.805,"Well, one would think the due process clause and the Sixth Amendment would keep it from going to the judge without going through us either under the circumstances of this case."
1976.74-6593,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4052.567,4053.182,Thank you gentlemen.
