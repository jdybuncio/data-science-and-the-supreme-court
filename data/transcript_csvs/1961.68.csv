1961.68,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,7.267,"James Francis Hill, Petitioner, versus United States."
1961.68,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,12.291,24.157,"If the Court please, the petitioner in this case is seeking relief from an illegal sentence imposed by a Federal District Court on June 4, 1954."
1961.68,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,879.961,887.488,"Under the rules, it's optional, is it not, whether a judge allows for a pre-sentence investigation for this probation?"
1961.68,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,887.488,888.008,That is right.
1961.68,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,897.122,899.837,"Was there one in this case, do you know Mr. Reitz?"
1961.68,0,19919,curtis_r_reitz,,899.837,904.047,"I believe there was Your Honor, although I don't think it appeared in the record."
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2209.068,2213.852,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.68,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2445.934,2448.418,Would your objection go to Rule 35 (2)?
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2448.418,2454.529,"Yes, we object to them being raised under all three."
1961.68,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2454.529,2458.765,"And that was -- the mode in Green was Rule 35, wasn't it?"
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2458.765,2461.833,That's right Your Honor.
1961.68,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2461.833,2466.299,So you're really asking us to reconsider Green.
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2466.299,2467.166,No.
1961.68,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2478.985,2481.359,We entertained the --
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2481.359,2499.231,"Yes, entertained under Rule 35 motion but we understand the holding in that case to be that as the record was too ambiguous to show that the (Inaudible) concept --"
1961.68,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2499.231,2510.697,"Well there certainly isn't anything in those opinions, any of the three of them or four of them, I don't how many they were, we don't think this could be raised only by appeal, isn't it?"
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2510.697,2529.536,"Well, there is an implication if I might say so Your Honor that raising these questions years after sentencing, did present certain questions, certain difficulties."
1961.68,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2529.536,2550.344,"Your point is I suppose that since in Green, we -- the majority of the Court found, four members of the Court found that there was no merit on the -- in the claim made that if the Court did have not to reach whether or not that claim to be raised in the Rule 35 motion."
1961.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2550.344,2552.802,It wasn't discussed was it Ms. Cooper.
1961.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2552.802,2553.788,It wasn't discussed.
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2553.788,2553.859,No.
1961.68,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2553.859,2554.862,It wasn't reached.
1961.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2554.862,2561.508,And it was discussed on the assumption that even assuming that the sentence is illegal.
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2561.508,2562.121,That is right.
1961.68,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2754.994,2780.522,Excuse my interruption again but I assume on my recollection of Green that nothing was mentioned about the propriety of the use of Rule 35 procedure but I see now in the footnote of Justice Frankfurter's opinion that he addresses himself to the propriety of Rule 35 on other aspects of this case.
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2785.602,2786.104,Yes.
1961.68,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2786.104,2795.331,"He properly said in his footnote that Rule 35 does (Inaudible) but rather is limited to challenging, involved the legality of the sentence itself."
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2812.995,2826.608,When Your Honor -- perhaps I should start at this point and tell you why we think Rule 35 does not apply here.
1961.68,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2826.608,2839.876,Of course we have had arguments in the Court as to whether Rule 35 as opposed to considering under 2255 where it's proper to raise those things sua sponte I think.
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,2839.876,2859.967,"Your Honor, we start off with the propositions certainly that we think as to scope, Rule 35 is narrower in this sense that there were few questions that should be raised under it."
1961.68,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3201.832,3211.175,"In this particular case, the judge Dyer acquired an extraordinarily familiarity for this particular defendant, had he not?"
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3211.175,3211.533,Yes.
1961.68,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3212.418,3218.29,In case of the history of his having been declared first incompetent to stand trial and so on and so forth.
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3218.29,3219.652,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1961.68,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3220.49,3222.907,"Is Judge Dyer retired now, do you know?"
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3222.907,3227.804,"I am sorry, I do not know if he is."
1961.68,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3227.804,3231.253,"Judge Taylor, I know Judge Robert Taylor has been handling these both --"
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3231.253,3233.725,"Yes, he is, Your Honor."
1961.68,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3233.725,3237.788,Does the judge have a pre-sentence report to this case Ms. Cooper?
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3237.788,3252.201,"I am in kind to think he did Your Honor and as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out he had been dealing with this for years and years and as his remarks in the record would indicate, he was very, very familiar with the facts of the case."
1961.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3260.551,3272.204,"I should think Ms. Cooper, from what appears on page 18 General Davis, I don't know, some of the generals, General Mead and General Davis --"
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3272.204,3273.739,General Mead.
1961.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3273.739,3285.633,General Davis says â€œI think it has been developed in the proof the character of this defendant and the other crime which he has committed that those matters must have been before the Court.
1961.68,1,29725,julia_p_cooper,,3285.633,3296.333,That is correct sir.
1961.68,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3488.492,3491.101,Very well.
