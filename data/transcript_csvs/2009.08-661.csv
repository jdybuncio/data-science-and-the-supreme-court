2009.08-661,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.341,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-661, American Needle v. The National Football League."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,7.246,9.87,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-661,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,93.928,107.374,"But there was no joint venture with respect to the television rights, meaning there was no separate activity, other than the televising of the shows at issue."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,119.649,129.929,"No, I don't -- I don't think so, because what we are asking about here is -- is the question of whether or not the agreement of the teams involves a plurality of actors."
2009.08-661,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,198.463,203.958,Did that cover everything that the NFLA does?
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,221.966,233.348,"Certainly everything in the -- that is challenged in this case, because this involves a restriction on the activities of the venturers themselves."
2009.08-661,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,248.424,250.218,Changes in the -- in the rule apply?
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,258.867,261.929,"Yes, it is concerted activity."
2009.08-661,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,264.428,266.913,"Well, how -- you know the litigation system."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,267.552,288.605,"Well, I think we know the following, Justice Kennedy: That under this Court's rule of reason's jurisprudence, a plaintiff has to be able to plead an identifiable anticompetitive effect in a market in which the defendant plausibly has market power, and the -- the plaintiff also has to be one who can--"
2009.08-661,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,288.605,295.012,"Well, my -- my hypothetical: Two or three teams which aren't particularly popular in the league are hurt by the rule change."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,325.982,329.854,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, let me answer your question in two parts."
2009.08-661,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,396.716,400.385,"Well, let me give you another example that you mention in your brief."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,419.361,426.496,"Justice Alito, if I -- I may not have gotten all of your question, but let me answer it in two parts."
2009.08-661,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,463.794,467.511,"Well, what if one of the team wants -- one of the teams wants to play additional games--"
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,467.511,468.275,--Well--
2009.08-661,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,468.275,470.256,--against a rival team where they will get more money?
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,470.256,499.479,"--What I -- what I was going to jump right to is: If in addition to changing the league schedule, the team owners in concert agreed to prohibit the teams of the National Football League from -- from playing any other games -- doing an exhibition game in Japan, the Redskins and the Giants playing another game -- that might show a market-wide reduction in output."
2009.08-661,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,533.588,538.088,They couldn't -- they couldn't stop that team from joining another league?
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,560.982,571.792,"--What I'm saying is, first of all, it would plainly be concerted activity on the part of the team owners because they would have entered into a horizontal restraint on the activity of the venturers."
2009.08-661,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,612.978,618.145,"Counsel, it seems to me -- your last few answers seem to me to beg the question."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,638.497,641.465,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you are exactly right, and the real--"
2009.08-661,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,641.465,642.62,That you have been begging the question?
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,646.133,654.506,"--Well, let me try to address Justice Sotomayor's subsequent question in the context of the way you are posing the question, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-661,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.349,0.0,Can I interrupt with this question?
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,698.172,703.714,"It -- absolutely, as the plaintiff in the case, Justice Stevens, that -- we do."
2009.08-661,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,706.041,711.446,"I understand it isn't, but it is part of your burden to say this is not a procompetitive agreement."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,711.446,712.242,Absolutely.
2009.08-661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,713.104,713.853,But not -- not here.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,713.853,715.459,"--In the -- I'm sorry, Justice?"
2009.08-661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,715.459,716.008,Not here.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,716.008,718.676,"I -- I don't have to argue -- I mean, I don't think I have to argue in this Court."
2009.08-661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.865,725.048,"If -- if we find for you and it goes back, then you would -- you would bear that burden."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,725.048,725.438,--That's correct.
2009.08-661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.032,763.344,How does it work?
2009.08-661,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,763.344,778.494,"But what if he -- what if he further concluded that the agreement had the overall effect of stimulating additional -- it was procompetitive in that it would equalize the economic strength of the teams, and therefore made them all better competitors on the playing field?"
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,780.069,782.471,"I'm sorry, Justice Stevens, I'm not quite sure."
2009.08-661,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,787.42,0.0,Right.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,804.77,819.419,"--Well, let me explain what they've done, and I will then explain why it does have a -- identifiable anticompetitive effects, which certainly satisfy the pleading standards for a rule of reason claim."
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,850.782,856.827,"But I thought -- I thought -- as I read your complaint, almost every word of it had to do with pro -- per se violations."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,858.5,861.417,--The per se violation was dismissed and--
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,861.417,861.76,You forget -- just yes or no.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,862.228,863.179,--is not before the Court.
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,863.179,874.157,"Now, I've suddenly heard you talk -- the only thing left I could see was where you say by their agreement to grant an exclusive license to Reebok, they unreasonably restrained trade in the markets."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,876.002,876.954,"No, no."
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,878.483,881.123,What other paragraph do you want me to focus on?
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,881.123,886.197,"--Well, what I would point you to is the statement -- I mean, if--"
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,886.197,888.275,"No, I'm interested in the complaint at the moment."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,888.275,892.677,--What the complaint talks about is the granting of an exclusive license here.
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,892.677,892.927,Yes.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,893.223,894.799,But the exclusivity as to--
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,894.799,895.111,Fine.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,918.883,919.866,--The ability to compete.
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,920.007,920.147,Yes.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,938.826,941.73,I understand the -- the point.
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,941.73,944.573,But you are going to go back and prove that actually there is competition between the--
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,944.573,945.762,I understand the point you are making.
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,946.839,947.01,--Yes.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,948.133,948.948,--In part.
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,968.671,970.59,They have very small allowances at three years old.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,978.291,979.398,"Well, but the other point I would make is--"
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,979.398,979.554,--Yes.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,979.554,983.381,--that's just showing that each team has substantial market power.
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,983.381,983.615,Yes.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,983.615,984.663,"And again, they--"
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,984.663,991.753,But I'm trying to look -- what I'm trying to get in my mind is what specific restraint you are focusing on.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1026.72,1028.19,--Not quite.
2009.08-661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.19,1031.219,"Mr. Nager, do I have to figure this out here?"
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1031.609,1032.42,No.
2009.08-661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1032.42,1033.434,--Is this issue before us here?
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1043.539,1045.068,"You're -- that is the only issue, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-661,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1045.068,1046.178,"Well, why am I worrying about this other stuff?"
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1046.178,1049.146,Because Counsel has an obligation to respond to questions.
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1051.802,1052.488,I find--
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1052.488,1053.331,I appreciate Your Honor--
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1053.331,1054.473,--I find it easier--
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1054.473,1055.144,--You'd be a good blocker.
2009.08-661,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1055.144,1057.718,--to think about the case if I know what's going on.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1066.918,1069.043,"Thank you, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-661,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1069.043,1077.632,"Well, but it seems to me what we are doing is exploring the consequences of completely discarding the unitary theory."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1077.632,1078.35,"Well, we're not--"
2009.08-661,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1078.35,1083.941,"And so -- and the earlier questions, it seemed to me, were helpful."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1106.575,1107.558,--The answer to--
2009.08-661,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1107.558,1113.337,"And -- and it's a difficult area, but I would like -- and -- but I would like some guidance."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1113.337,1125.424,"--Well, the guidance I would give you, Justice Kennedy, is that as Justice Scalia says, the only question before the Court is whether or not these agreements constitute concerted activity."
2009.08-661,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1134.546,1139.218,"Mr. Nager, I think you answered my question originally: Yes, everything."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1150.932,1152.761,That -- that is correct.
2009.08-661,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1156.555,1167.613,"One -- one concern in the litigation is, you know, if it doesn't come under the Sherman Act at all, they go home after the case is dismissed on the -- on the pleadings."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1187.399,1188.086,"--Well, no."
2009.08-661,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1219.918,1229.616,"Counsel, could you articulate for me as succinctly as possible the extent to which your position departs from the position of the Solicitor General?"
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1229.616,1241.392,The Solicitor General's position is correct insofar as it criticizes the Seventh Circuit's reasoning.
2009.08-661,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1265.48,1274.147,"Well, I would have thought it is just the transfer of the inefficiency and lack of clarity from the -- the first question to the rule of reason."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1283.128,1322.564,"Well, I understand your point, Mr. Chief Justice: That to the extent that rule of reason inquiries are not as refined as they need to be, since the Solicitor General's concerted conduct inquiry includes rule of reason inquiries -- indeed, on its effective merger standard, it says it has to survive a rule of reason analysis or somehow be waived, or you would have to do it as part of the concerted conduct inquiry -- so that there is no doubt to the extent that -- that the rule of reason is a continuing project of this Court, we would be transferring some of that project into the concerted conduct inquiry."
2009.08-661,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1331.202,1342.588,"Well, I -- I thought the purpose of their submission was to respond to some of the questions we've seen, like scheduling, like what the rules are going to be about -- about the game."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1355.175,1366.328,"Well, I think the answer is, you should -- you should use English language and doctrine to address the issue that you are actually trying to address, rather than call it something else."
2009.08-661,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1417.708,1421.74,"And as I understand your position, that could be the result in this case."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1427.032,1436.699,"In terms of what this Court -- obviously, on my client's behalf, I have to vigorously state to the Court we think we have a bona fide, serious rule of reason claim -- but yes, Justice Stevens--"
2009.08-661,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1436.699,1445.511,And one thing I wondered about the record: There is discussion in the briefs about the fact that the teams share the revenues from these -- these sales.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1453.334,1458.958,"--Well, I -- I didn't handle the case below, so I don't quite know how it got into the record."
2009.08-661,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1476.731,1491.475,"Would -- wouldn't that -- that affidavit support the conclusion that this is basically a procompetitive agreement because it tends to make competition stronger on the playing field, and therefore, that's a sufficient defense under the rule of reason, and that's the end of the ball game?"
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1491.475,1492.348,--I -- I think not.
2009.08-661,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.362,1502.113,"Yes, but you are not just competing."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1502.113,1503.579,--That is the very thing the case challenges.
2009.08-661,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1503.579,1513.169,"But with regard to sales of the paraphernalia and so forth that you have here, you are not just competing among the members of the League; you are competing in a market that includes all sports paraphernalia."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1513.169,1521.803,"No, our market was alleged and held not to be legally invalid by the district court, to be NFL-logoed hats and apparel."
2009.08-661,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1521.803,1527.629,That assumes there is no competition between the sales of those logos and the sales of other sports logos.
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1527.629,1528.881,"Well, that -- that's correct."
2009.08-661,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1555.322,1572.862,"Counsel, you -- the Solicitor General is asking us to remand under his new test to find out whether you are challenging the joint venture or challenging simply the licensing to one individual or one entity."
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1575.424,1577.609,"Well, the -- the answer is--"
2009.08-661,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1577.609,1578.688,Meaning -- I don't--
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1578.688,1597.756,--I understood -- that the American Needle said in the court below that what it was challenging was the grant of an exclusive license to NFLP that prohibited the individual team competition and it limited all competition in the market in blanket licenses.
2009.08-661,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1634.241,1641.629,Is your point that your client wasn't hurt until they dealt exclusively with one manufacturer?
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1641.629,1642.736,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-661,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1642.736,1644.862,So you have nothing -- you had no damages before?
2009.08-661,0,25826,glen_d_nager,,1644.862,1645.658,Before.
2009.08-661,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1645.658,1646.859,"Thank you, Mr. Nager."
2009.08-661,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1659.869,1662.477,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1720.969,1724.81,And then the question I have -- I now understand this much better in light of that.
2009.08-661,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1768.98,1770.182,--I guess we would say two things.
2009.08-661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1778.473,1780.005,"No, we wouldn't say per se."
2009.08-661,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1803.495,1841.73,"I guess my point is that if, for instance, a disappointed bidder for the paper supply conduct -- contract challenged this as a Section 1 violation and said the commissioner's decision to go to Staples rather than Office Depot was unreasonable because Office Depot was offering a better product at a lower price -- there are certainly decisions that the commissioner could make with respect to procurement of supplies or the setting of wage levels that would be unreasonable in a business judgment sense, in that they wouldn't effectively carry on the mission of the organization, but they wouldn't be unreasonable in the -- the Section 1 sense."
2009.08-661,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1848.008,1862.722,"Well, look, your second criteria opens it up to attack in precisely the same way that my use of rule of reason does, because they are going to have to show it doesn't significantly affect actual or potential competition."
2009.08-661,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1884.882,1900.66,"--Well -- well, in Dagher, for instance, the Court was dealing with a situation that's in some ways analogous to the one that you have here; that is, a joint venture in which entities that were economic competitors in some aspects of their businesses joined forces with respect to other aspects."
2009.08-661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1938.704,1940.077,"May I ask you this question, Mr. Stewart?"
2009.08-661,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1955.791,1963.894,"--I think the Section -- the question of whether Section 1 applied would not be any different; that is, the central Section 1--"
2009.08-661,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1963.894,1968.734,"So the fact that this is an exclusive agreement is kind of a red herring in this case, isn't it?"
2009.08-661,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1968.734,1988.554,"--It -- it may not be a red herring with respect to the ultimate resolution of the case; that is, if the court on -- the lower court, on remand, if the case were remanded, applied rule of reason analysis, the -- the precise nature of the contract might bear on whether the restraint was reasonable, but it wouldn't bear on the question of whether concerted activity was involved; that is, what--"
2009.08-661,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1988.554,1990.036,I don't -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-661,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1991.066,2011.448,"--I guess my point was, once -- once the teams decided that they would -- rather than each negotiating individually, either with a single licensee or with multiple licensees, once they decided they would negotiate as a collective and that any potential licensee had to go to the collective rather than to the individual teams, that's the central Section 1 issue."
2009.08-661,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2021.099,2039.015,"So under your -- following of your paper case, are you saying that if the teams delegated to the commissioner the authority to decide whether we are going to enter -- whether the League is going to enter into one contract on logo products or let each team decide, that would be all right?"
2009.08-661,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2039.015,2047.04,"That would -- that initial delegation of authority would be subject to a Section 1 challenge, because that would be concerted action in the same way that the Court in Dagher said--"
2009.08-661,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2047.04,2052.212,"Well, why isn't the decision to order paper from one company rather than another subject to Section 1 challenge?"
2009.08-661,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2052.212,2056.96,--Because that -- that occurs after the point at which the commissioner has been vested with that authority.
2009.08-661,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2074.512,2075.089,Why is that?
2009.08-661,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2081.773,2084.46,--This only applies to carrying out the ordinary business of the League.
2009.08-661,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2091.927,2108.746,"Could it -- using your example, could you tell me what the different questions would be under the single control theory you are proposing and a rule of reason application in its normal course?"
2009.08-661,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2118.194,2126.426,"--I guess under our theory, we would first ask, as to an entity like this, which is entity that is compete in some respects--"
2009.08-661,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2126.426,2128.785,Let's not go into this case.
2009.08-661,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2131.098,2144.824,--I think we would ask first: Is -- is the commissioner acting as a single entity when he exercises delegated authority in making a business judgment about which supplier to buy paper or what the wages should be?
2009.08-661,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2152.088,2176.312,"Well, how does that stop any group of competitors from coming in and saying: Gee, I want to sell my gas; I'm going to let this single commissioner decide how much my gas will sell for, and if he chooses to sell it at the same price to everybody, both gas products, that's okay?"
2009.08-661,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2177.751,2195.572,"--Well, if you get -- if a single business is deciding whether to buy paper from one supplier or from several, that wouldn't be subject to Section 1 review, because the decision of the single business might affect the welfare of the competitors, but it wouldn't be concerted action."
2009.08-661,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2237.679,2240.725,"No, no, no, no, because they are not part of the broader concerted entity."
2009.08-661,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2250.876,2254.795,--I think that follows logically from the position that this is one entity.
2009.08-661,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2273.476,2274.506,"Thank you, Counsel."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2281.456,2284.532,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-661,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2325.22,2331.53,"Well, do we have to ask what was the intent at the beginning, as kind of an originalism thing?"
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2359.779,2372.069,"Your Honor, we know here that at least as of 1963, when NFL Properties was formed, that there was a single entity formed, a single entity to produce and promote NFL Football."
2009.08-661,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2386.797,2391.668,"Well, do you take issue with my question that this is a relevant inquiry?"
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2398.385,2400.791,--I'm not suggesting that the original agreement is sacrosanct.
2009.08-661,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2488.893,2490.843,May -- may I ask you to go back just one step?
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2526.048,2528.859,"--Well, I -- I don't disagree with that, Your Honor."
2009.08-661,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2574.584,2575.083,Excuse me.
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2588.935,2599.88,"--The record, Your Honor, says -- reflects that there was very little exploitation of intellectual property of the franchises prior to the creation of NFL Properties."
2009.08-661,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2599.88,2603.878,"But there was some, and that was done by the individual teams?"
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2603.878,2607.597,"It was done, and it was done -- I mean, that's sort of an historic artifact."
2009.08-661,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2616.06,2623.82,"The problem, as I see, for you in this case is that the basic conclusion is in the court of appeals, where it says:"
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2688.368,2710.873,"The reason we know that this is not your typical joint venture is because Copperweld established a standard that said that what Section 1 is intended to regulate is not matters of form, not general market conditions, but rather the sudden joining together of independent sources of economic power."
2009.08-661,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2710.873,2712.651,"Fine, but that's the conclusion here."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2730.644,2739.0,"--But, Your Honor, we know that they are not independent sources of economic power, because none of them can produce the product of the venture on their own."
2009.08-661,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2744.265,2745.731,"Well, can't it ask someone to do that."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2747.572,2748.118,--That's right.
2009.08-661,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2748.118,2748.757,What does the game have to do with this?
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2758.706,2770.092,"Your Honor, if -- if this were a venture designed to go out and license or manufacture or distribute caps, you would be right."
2009.08-661,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2789.441,2790.892,Was this a summary judgment motion?
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2790.892,2791.176,Yes.
2009.08-661,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2791.988,2793.251,"Well, the stated purpose is to promote the game."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2804.045,2804.513,I--
2009.08-661,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2804.513,2808.23,"Now, it promotes the game if the money from the sale goes to the whole group, I suppose."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2823.035,2831.86,"--Your Honor, I would agree with you 100 percent that the purpose of the licensing is to make money, but not necessarily to make money through the royalties."
2009.08-661,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2844.744,2849.369,"Well, I suppose that -- that could -- that issue could be tried."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2849.369,2849.728,And--
2009.08-661,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2849.728,2852.586,But I don't -- I don't think so.
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2866.222,2869.315,"--In the abstract that's a triable issue, Your Honor, but not here."
2009.08-661,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2932.831,2948.654,What decision could the sports teams make that would be subject to the antitrust scrutiny under your definition of the permissible range of the joint venture activities?
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2962.712,2970.224,"--Your Honor, my view is that the -- the NFL clubs are not separate sources of independent power."
2009.08-661,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2974.598,2986.09,"So the answer to my question is, there is -- you are seeking through this ruling what you haven't gotten from Congress: An absolute bar to an antitrust claim."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2986.09,2987.747,"--No, Your Honor, that's not right."
2009.08-661,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2987.747,2989.467,So -- so answer my question.
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,2990.169,2996.166,The answer to your question is this: With regard to Section 1 claims -- let's put aside Section 2 claims.
2009.08-661,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3079.741,3099.094,"But now the question is: Are you basing that on economic-related data about the pros and the cons of, you know, the economic harms of stopping them from competing, versus the economic benefits of allowing them to act as a separate -- as a single entity?"
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3148.976,3150.836,"--That's not my position, Your Honor."
2009.08-661,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3150.836,3151.273,All right.
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3152.973,3161.876,"My position is based on the intended scope of the Sherman Act, Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which this Court, in Copperweld, made clear."
2009.08-661,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3174.186,3174.56,That's--
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3174.56,3175.793,That's not this case.
2009.08-661,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3175.793,3178.636,"--Well, I wouldn't read -- can you read Copperweld as follows?"
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3243.89,3251.654,The analysis is not correct because there has been no challenge to venture formation here.
2009.08-661,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3266.616,3280.565,"There is a -- very definitely a joint venture here to play football, but there isn't a joint venture to build houses and there isn't a joint venture obviously in sight to promote."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3302.477,3310.506,"Justice Breyer, I agree with you that there is a difference, an important difference, between venture and nonventure activity."
2009.08-661,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3318.016,3330.529,"Well, it would be if they tried to do it, but there, they would be attacked on the ground that under the rule of reason, they do not have the justification such that the antitrust law would allow them to do it."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3330.529,3330.903,Well--
2009.08-661,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3330.903,3335.26,And they are saying: And promoting is precisely the same.
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3344.146,3364.779,"--Your Honor, the ancillary restraints doctrine would enable the court, in the circumstance that you describe, to categorize the decision to build housing as a non-venture activity -- a non-venture decision, and therefore, it would be evaluated independently of the considerations that apply to the venturers' objective."
2009.08-661,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3373.79,3379.741,"Well, you -- you certainly could -- they certainly could, theoretically, each club could sell it's own logo."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3379.741,3385.505,"--Each -- of course, each club could sell it's own logo, Your Honor, but the clubs have decided that the most effective--"
2009.08-661,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3385.505,3388.251,"They have decided not to do it that way, but it could be done."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3388.251,3388.8,--Forgive me.
2009.08-661,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3400.884,3410.255,"Yes, but maybe they also collectively decide the best way to make money and finance -- attendance and so forth, all agree on a housing program that they all jointly sponsor."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3410.255,3413.6,"--Well, Your Honor, that -- I respectfully suggest that doesn't--"
2009.08-661,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3413.6,3416.974,It would be the most effective way to -- to raise the money to pay these players who make so much money.
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3416.974,3423.673,"--Well, that doesn't -- there is a plausibility standard that really has to be applied in terms of the arguments at issue."
2009.08-661,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3423.673,3435.309,"Well, if it's a plausibility standard at the threshold inquiry, there is a range of things, and I guess your -- your friend on the other side is just saying selling logos is closer to selling houses than it is to playing football."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3435.309,3439.416,"Well, but there is a difference here, Your Honor, because there is a record."
2009.08-661,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3476.637,3488.71,"So if there is a factual -- if there is a factual dispute about whether a particular activity of the League is designed to promote the game or is designed simply to make more money, than that is the sort of thing that goes to trial?"
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3488.71,3493.442,"--Well, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't put it in terms of make more money because I have agreed with Justice Scalia--"
2009.08-661,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3493.442,3495.439,"Or do something else, do something other than promote the game."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3495.439,3500.813,"--If -- Your Honor, just as in Dagher -- in Dagher, the issue was how to price the product."
2009.08-661,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3656.236,3669.276,"--The -- if the reasonableness of this decision, that T-shirts promotes the game, is so self-evident, then why wouldn't the rule of reason control completely?"
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3669.276,3671.401,"Well, Your Honor, I don't have--"
2009.08-661,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3671.401,3684.851,"Why do we need to even go to the single-entity question when, by your own answer, it is undisputed, so abundantly clear, so reasonable--"
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3684.851,3686.411,--The answer--
2009.08-661,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3686.411,3692.065,"--what's the need to -- to label it single entity, as opposed to label it what it is, reasonable?"
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3692.065,3696.671,"--The answer, Your Honor, is inherent in the rule of reason."
2009.08-661,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3717.384,3722.739,But it's a single purpose -- and I certainly sympathize with that argument.
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3784.526,3793.023,"--But, Your Honor, I would agree with almost everything that you said, but we are not dealing here with independent sources of economic power."
2009.08-661,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3797.678,3799.83,"But they own the trademarks, so they could."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3799.83,3802.159,"They do, but the trademarks don't have any value."
2009.08-661,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3823.165,3825.368,So let's call it an NFL supermarket.
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3905.913,3907.725,"--But, Your Honor, this case is the perfect example."
2009.08-661,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3949.49,3955.939,"Well, you -- you say that the -- that the trademarks have no value apart from the -- from the game."
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3980.366,3988.375,"Well, I -- I certainly agree with your -- your premise, Your Honor, that they are worthless apart from -- except there is some residual value, I don't -- I don't--"
2009.08-661,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3988.375,3988.531,Yeah.
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,3988.531,3991.214,--I don't dispute -- dispute that.
2009.08-661,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3998.182,4000.823,"Oh, okay, you--"
2009.08-661,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4000.823,4005.928,So we don't even ask the question whether under the rule of reason such a thing is reasonable or justified?
2009.08-661,2,25690,gregg_h_levy,,4005.928,4006.789,Your Honor--
