2000.00-347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.107,"We'll hear argument on Number 00-347, The Wharf Limited, et al., v. United International Holdings."
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,13.048,18.044,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,70.223,73.938,It depends on what you consider the security to be in this case.
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,73.938,77.653,"In part that is true, Your Honor, but I think not solely."
2000.00-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,86.281,88.965,But first about what the security is.
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,88.965,89.625,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,89.625,98.624,"And what the Respondents say, and what the court below believed is that the security here was an option."
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,102.422,103.537,That is correct.
2000.00-347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,158.15,160.091,"Mr. Dodyk, how far do you take that?"
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,173.837,180.319,"Well, certainly Your Honor, I'm not saying then oral statement cannot constitute a misrepresentation."
2000.00-347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,228.677,234.993,"Are you saying, Mr. Dodyk, that there can't be any oral options as a matter of Federal securities law?"
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,234.993,252.1,"Your Honor, I think as a matter of Federal securities law, as I read the Blue Chips Stamps case, that a conversation which a person asserts via an oral option should not, under the doctrine of that case, be accepted as a security."
2000.00-347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,252.1,255.632,"Well, that would certainly take it beyond the holding of the case."
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,255.632,256.913,There is no question about that.
2000.00-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,314.582,320.237,But that isn't the issue here... whether the plaintiff purchased or not.
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,344.386,372.333,"Well, I'm not sure that Your Honor is correct in saying that there's no question as to whether or not there was a purchase of an option here in a contractually binding sense, because as Your Honor is aware, it certainly is our position that the court, the district court, failed to properly instruct the jury with respect to the statute of fraud."
2000.00-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.333,375.222,It's quite a different question in Blue Chip.
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,403.169,410.394,"I don't think it's simpler, Your Honor, in the sense in which Blue Chip Stamps saw a difficulty, if I could explain."
2000.00-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.394,411.137,Okay.
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,411.137,428.598,"It's not simpler for the following reasons, What was the core, as I understand it, of Blue Chips Stamps' concern was that you'll get someone who attempts to establish standing to bring a Section 10(b) action based on an oral assertion of what it is they would have done."
2000.00-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,443.376,446.06,"It's not a description of would have, could have, should have."
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,473.53,474.933,"--I think it is, if I may."
2000.00-347,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,564.923,569.464,"Well, you've raised... it seems to me in your last point you've raised two points."
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,637.535,660.297,"Well, I think where the subjunctive gets in... and perhaps it's not a subjunctive as such... what I'm saying to you is that the nature of the jury's conclusion in this particular case, I think, should not be relevant to the determination which the Court is making, if my construction of the Blue Chip Stamps case is accurate."
2000.00-347,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,660.297,670.411,"Well, your construction... I thought your construction is that yes, Blue Chip Stamps, as Justice Scalia put it, is a would have, should have case, and this is a would have, should have case."
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,671.83,677.841,"No it's not... I'm not saying... I think it's a would have, should have case in many regards, Your Honor, in many regards."
2000.00-347,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,702.816,709.503,Then I think you in essence are saying that they cannot be the oral creation of the security within the meaning of the Act.
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,709.503,710.041,That's what I am saying.
2000.00-347,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,710.041,710.041,Yeah.
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,710.041,710.124,That's right.
2000.00-347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,730.269,735.57,There's a statute that lists a whole bunch of things that constitute a security; one of them is an option.
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,740.588,759.702,"--Well, Your Honor, as to that I would suggest that if you look at Section 3810 that all of the elements of a security there as defined are elements which are ordinarily written instruments... common stock, bonds, notes."
2000.00-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,769.816,789.135,Do you think that Blue Chip would have come out differently if there were a writing from the president of the purchaser to his mother saying we intend to purchase this stock of this corporation next week.
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,811.509,817.619,--I'm not saying that that... I can't tell you what element alone would have sufficed for the conclusion.
2000.00-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,817.619,820.797,"You think a letter might have done the job, if--"
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,821.623,820.797,"No, I don't."
2000.00-347,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.283,822.821,"--I don't think it would have, either."
2000.00-347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,822.821,830.168,I think it has very little to do with the writing and much more to do with the inherent ineffability of future intentions.
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,830.168,831.942,"Well, that is certainly true."
2000.00-347,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,831.942,845.112,"If that is true, then you have to admit that Blue Chip doesn't stand for the proposition that you can't have an orally created security, and that we are, as Justice Scalia started out by saying, going to have to go beyond Blue Chip to hold your way here."
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,845.112,872.438,"Well, I'm not suggesting that the Blue Chip Stamps opinion governs the facts of this case, but I would point out to Your Honor is that two circuit courts have interpreted Blue Chip Stamps to bar standing to a plaintiff who sought to assert... satisfied the purchase requirement and sought to assert standing on the basis of an oral agreement to purchase securities."
2000.00-347,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,872.438,872.638,Why--
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,872.638,874.296,In the Kagen case... the Kagen case--
2000.00-347,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,874.296,874.833,--Yes?
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,874.833,890.643,"--in the Seventh Circuit, and the Pelletier case in the Eleventh Circuit both held that, and those are, to my understanding, the only reasoned interpretations of Blue Chip Stamps since that case was decided with respect to this particular issue."
2000.00-347,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,890.643,892.007,Let me ask you this question.
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,926.763,929.464,"Well, Your Honor, I would say a couple of things about that."
2000.00-347,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,985.424,994.917,"So you're saying there could be an oral contract, and there could be the oral creation of a security, but that the act of exercise cannot be oral."
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,994.917,995.743,"--No, I'm not saying that."
2000.00-347,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,995.743,996.858,I thought that's what you just said.
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,996.858,996.924,"No, no, no."
2000.00-347,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,996.924,997.058,I'm sorry.
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,997.058,1020.263,"No, what I was saying was that where for purposes of construing the Federal statute, irrespective of the statute of fraud, that the rule is a Federal rule, and the rule should be that where the event which is said to satisfy the purchase of a security requirement is wholly oral, that that should be insufficient for very much the same reasons as the underlay of the Blue Chip Stamps requirement."
2000.00-347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1020.718,1022.204,"Mr. Dodyk, may I ask?"
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,1028.907,1029.55,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.00-347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1029.55,1031.575,This is a case with one Federal claim.
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,1085.295,1092.504,"Well, let me speak to that if I may, and also it comes back to the second part of Justice Souter's question."
2000.00-347,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1206.106,1215.931,"Then one might say, if we accepted everything you said, that the Federal claim would fail on a 12(b)(6)."
2000.00-347,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,1246.23,1259.605,"Well, Your Honor, if I understand where we're at at this point, and that is, what is the... what should be the consequence of a decision in this case?"
2000.00-347,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1331.474,1333.992,"What's the reasoning, Mr. Dodyk?"
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1811.749,1820.023,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.00-347,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1840.356,1841.925,I have one question.
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1859.386,1860.501,Thank you.
2000.00-347,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1860.501,1867.354,--And I thought there was some agreement from Petitioner's counsel that that was in fact the theory of the case.
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1870.698,1875.982,It was both a purchase and a separate attempt to exercise.
2000.00-347,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1875.982,1877.468,When was it exercised in here?
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1877.468,1888.614,"In the spring of 1993, after Wharf got the cable franchise from the broadcast authorities."
2000.00-347,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1888.614,1889.169,"Okay, so the option was--"
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1889.169,1899.993,"Wharf had conducted a public offering, raised the money, called Mr. Ing and sought to exercise the option."
2000.00-347,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1899.993,1907.644,--So the option was not exercised in your view immediately after October 8 when the additional services were performed.
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1907.644,1908.387,It could not be.
2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.76,1966.387,"Mr. Cohen, I must say I just marvel at the bon homme or the old fashioned nature of your client to gamble all of this money on an oral handshake deal."
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1968.511,1968.966,They do.
2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.166,1971.672,"I mean, how much money was involved in this deal?"
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1971.672,1988.39,"Well, the cost of providing the services with which we purchased the option was about a million dollars out of pocket, but it was the time of people who were investors in these businesses."
2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.39,1992.643,"You know, I wouldn't even buy an automobile without a written contract."
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,1992.643,1994.584,"Well, there was a good deal of testimony at trial--"
2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.584,1998.382,I'm not sure that we ought to protect this kind of recklessness.
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2006.472,2021.127,"--It was a handshake deal that had been preceded by a written reference to an option in the bid that Wharf submitted to the broadcast authority, that language was pulled at the last minute."
2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.526,2037.845,"We have over a million lawyers in this country, and one of the main things they do is to make sure that people make things easy by putting it in writing."
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2037.845,2045.07,"And UIH would have been well advised to come out of that meeting, call its lawyer and say how do we document this?"
2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.944,2057.225,You went ahead before the documentation was prepared.
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2057.225,2058.34,"--Yes, because Wharf--"
2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2058.34,2061.849,"And I'm making a serious point here, I'm just not saying your client was foolish."
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2078.856,2096.855,"--The kind of person you're talking about is a person who is a victim of an unscrupulous securities salesman who calls up and says I've got an oil company here, and I've got some shares to sell you, and fails to say there isn't any oil and says give me your credit card number, or send me a check and I'll send you a certificate."
2000.00-347,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2096.855,2111.921,"Unlike those typical securities situations, what worries me about this case is the pizza man says, Smith, my customer told me over the phone that if I got the pizza there on time he'd give me fifty shares of his stock."
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2114.688,2119.889,You have a fraud if there--
2000.00-347,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2119.889,2120.92,"No, in my example."
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2120.92,2121.664,--If--
2000.00-347,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2121.664,2122.49,In my example.
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2137.267,2138.753,--I think yes.
2000.00-347,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2138.753,2138.753,Yes?
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2138.753,2139.141,"Yes, because I think--"
2000.00-347,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2139.141,2141.082,I thought you'd say no to that one.
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2141.182,2142.856,"--No, because I think there is a contract."
2000.00-347,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2145.168,2159.74,"--You're saying then that any kind... any time a person claims that somebody sold them a share of stock, or promised to sell them a share of stock orally, that becomes a Federal securities case."
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2161.698,2168.945,"Any time someone has a provable, enforceable contract to buy a share of stock--"
2000.00-347,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2168.945,2181.743,"We're saying the same thing, and I guess the argument against that would be that the securities statute doesn't intend to have every oral contract for selling some stock to become a securities fraud case."
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2191.736,2200.652,"--Justice Breyer, what we have here is not merely an executory contract to purchase some stock."
2000.00-347,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2208.537,2214.936,"--I know, but I'm trying to get at the policy that would underlie my concession exactly right."
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2227.939,2228.039,--He hasn't--
2000.00-347,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2228.039,2232.126,He has promised to sell me fifty shares of stock.
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2232.126,2240.299,--He hasn't been defrauded out of anything except perhaps driving fast to deliver the pizza.
2000.00-347,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2260.527,2264.902,"You're missing my question, and I won't pursue it except to add what I thought you'd answer."
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2313.943,2318.956,"--Well, let me say this about the policy."
2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2414.253,2415.079,Okay.
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2415.079,2416.377,So that policy has been addressed.
2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.377,2432.518,Somewhere in that long sentence you made the point that in Blue Chip there was no solid written evidence as you say there was in your case.
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2441.246,2442.715,No.
2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2445.687,2445.753,Right.
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2446.125,2446.375,The statute requires a purchaser--
2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.375,2450.295,"--Okay, what difference does it make if you have written evidence?"

2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2456.76,2459.871,--The difference is that we have a completed purchase.
2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2461.895,2467.673,"Well, that's fine, but the evidence makes up... the evidence, or the existence of written evidence or not makes no difference."

2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2497.644,2503.671,"Well, first, of course, it was valid under the Colorado securities--"
2000.00-347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2503.671,2506.56,Could you get to the answer?
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2506.56,2508.584,"--No, I don't think you would be--"
2000.00-347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2508.584,2509.039,You can't get to the answer?
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2509.039,2511.722,--I don't think it would be a death knell.
2000.00-347,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2513.58,2521.603,"Then even though we're invalid under Colorado statute of frauds, it could proceed under the Federal Securities Act?"
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2521.603,2542.491,"I think the sale of a security that is an invalid security that is represented to be a security is sufficient under Blue Chip to support a 10(b)(5) claim, whether the security is enforceable or not, and I think the majority of the courts of appeals have agreed with that."

2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2585.299,2589.674,--The promise... that promise is not an option on my view.
2000.00-347,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2599.334,2599.5,A promise.
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2599.5,2599.683,That's what we have here.

2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2607.468,2608.499,Yes.
2000.00-347,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2608.499,2608.871,All right.

2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2675.433,2678.117,And is that below the State's statute of frauds amount?

2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.001,2695.744,"That's the answer, then."
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2695.744,2716.632,And at the time there was a statute of frauds which was determined not to apply because of the... because of Wharf's... because of UIH's completed performance of its obligations.

2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2812.65,2818.306,"Yes, I think whether the resulting contract fits the definition of a security is, of course, a question of Federal law."

2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2828.42,2829.246,What if I disagree with that?
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2829.246,2829.618,--matter of State law.
2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2829.618,2837.131,"I mean, it seems to me performance takes a contract out of the statute where you have a bilateral contract."

2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2893.563,2894.306,"--Yes, there was."
2000.00-347,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2910.819,2914.74,And you could have been sued if you didn't do that?

2000.00-347,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2916.597,2917.795,That is not an option.
2000.00-347,1,20683,deputy_solicitor_general_louis_r_cohen,,2931.541,2932.822,It wasn't an if.

2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3050.182,3050.554,--The seller of the option.
2000.00-347,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3050.554,3051.547,Would you rephrase that?
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3051.547,3060.007,Which here is Wharf Cable... sold the stock option which was the right to purchase... excuse me.
2000.00-347,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3060.007,3064.755,It was not an agreement to be performed?
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3066.712,3068.098,A sale took place.
2000.00-347,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3084.529,3096.046,"You say what happened was that Wharf said I give you an option today, and in return you must, in the future, perform certain services."

2000.00-347,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3106.903,3116.851,And you think that the Respondent here could have been sued for breach of contract if the Respondent did not perform those services?
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3121.392,3127.131,"Under the understanding that there was a sale for a promise, yes."
2000.00-347,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3128.867,3132.377,"Yes, that would follow, but you think that that was the reality?"
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3143.106,3145.707,"I don't think it makes any difference, Your Honor."
2000.00-347,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3145.707,3147.731,I think it does for the statute of fraud purpose.
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3147.731,3152.477,"Well, there was performance of the promise which would take it out of the statute of frauds."
2000.00-347,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3180.341,3200.486,"Well, I think it is important, and you agree with the counsel for the Respondent that this was a bilateral contract in which they could have been sued if they did not provide the necessary services, and those services were sufficiently specific to have a contract that was not illusory in the trial courts, and the jury so found?"
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3200.486,3215.264,What the jury found was that they entered into a contract selling them an option for... to purchase ten percent of the stock.
2000.00-347,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3237.638,3247.958,"I think the concern, Mr. Roberts, is that we not sweep in under the Securities Act a lot of breach of contract suits."
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3247.958,3255.554,"Yes, Your Honor, and you don't do that, because in order for there to be a 10(b)(5) violation, there must be a misrepresentation."
2000.00-347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3258.748,3260.317,That was exactly why I asked.
2000.00-347,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3260.317,3260.606,"Yes, it's easily--"

2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3304.611,3306.18,"It's not sufficient, Your Honor."
2000.00-347,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3318.978,3329.902,"He is here... he is here defending the case which proves he never intended from day one to follow his oral thing and, besides, I remember his saying that once."
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3329.902,3333.839,"--That would be insufficient to meet that burden, Your Honor."
2000.00-347,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3413.848,3418.967,"Do you agree that the statute, in effect, looks to State law on the question of statute of frauds issues?"
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3418.967,3423.425,"No, I don't, Your Honor."
2000.00-347,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3430.484,3438.469,"So there is either a standard implied in the statute itself, or there is no... a requirement implied in the statute itself, or there is no requirement, period."
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3438.469,3440.143,--There is no requirement.
2000.00-347,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3457.278,3461.691,Whether or not something is a contract... does that depend on State law?

2000.00-347,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3471.366,3473.663,Is there a court authority for that?
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3473.663,3488.812,--There's court authority for the fact that purchasers... parties to an oral contract to purchase are purchasers of securities.
2000.00-347,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3488.812,3491.207,They say notwithstanding State law?
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3491.207,3494.262,Notwithstanding State law?
2000.00-347,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3494.262,3495.998,"State contract law, not statute of frauds."
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3495.998,3526.091,"No, they don't specifically address notwithstanding State law, but in the court of appeals case that comes to mind, the Threadgill case from the D.C. Circuit, the district court had said that there was no purchase or sale because the contract had not been performed, fully performed, and the court of appeals reversed and said that the Act defines contract to include... the Act defines purchase, excuse me, to include any contract to purchase."
2000.00-347,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3526.091,3529.268,"Yes, but that leaves open the question of what a contract is."
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3533.15,3535.462,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2000.00-347,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3539.632,3556.722,"Well, it would open the doors of the Securities Act, presumably, to claims that State law would not recognize and that in itself might be a good reason, if we knew nothing else, to say that the question of contractual formation is a State law question."
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3556.722,3560.065,"--First, you don't have to address that issue here because there is a--"
2000.00-347,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3560.065,3573.151,"Well, but we may... we may get very close to it if we have to address what the source of any writing requirement or the dispensation of any writing requirement is."
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3581.779,3586.98,"--I don't think that you should look to State law for any of these questions, Your Honor."

2000.00-347,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3593.667,3595.979,"Surely that's a question of State law, isn't it?"
2000.00-347,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3595.979,3602.749,"--Whether it's a sale under State law is a question of State law, whether it's a sale for purposes of the Securities Act is a question of Federal law."
2000.00-347,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3607.95,3613.606,But to say it wouldn't serve the purposes of Section 10(b) isn't the final answer on a case like this.
