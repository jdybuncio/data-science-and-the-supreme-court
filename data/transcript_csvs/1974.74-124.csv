1974.74-124,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.675,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 74-124, Blue Chip Stamps and others against Manor Drug Stores."
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,18.04,22.554,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.207,858.656,"Mr. Kreps, --"
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,858.656,858.746,Yes Mr. Justice White.
1974.74-124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.746,864.955,Does the Court of Appeals reject the --
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,864.955,876.558,"In our view, Mr. Justice White and in the view of Judge Hufstedler in dissent, the Court of Appeals did reject the Birnbaum rule because the --"
1974.74-124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,876.558,877.686,It didn't say it did.
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,893.888,896.59,That's correct Mr. Justice White.
1974.74-124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.59,905.86,"-- taking on the word beneath you to say that here's another Court of Appeals that embrace the Birnbaum rule, this didn't apply to this one."
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,905.86,914.326,The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Mr. Justice White analytically rejected the Birnbaum rule because --
1974.74-124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,914.326,928.581,"Do you want us to -- do you want us to say that where he -- that this case opposes one way or another the validity of the Birnbaum rule, just forget about the rational of the Court of Appeals and go right to the -- to what you think is the heart of the matter, the Birnbaum rule."
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,928.581,933.97,That's correct Mr. Justice White and that is the position of the SEC and with --
1974.74-124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.97,935.505,"Not all, right?"
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,935.505,959.708,That we agreed that there are particular and that is right in this case Mr. Justice White but we also think the majority of the panel below did not expressly reject the Birnbaum rule and name because it recognize that another panel of the Ninth Circuit in the Mount Clemens case had already expressly accepted the Birnbaum rule.
1974.74-124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,962.841,973.855,"Do you think we had a -- do you think we had a considered discussion by a Court of Appeals, namely the Ninth Circuit as to whether the Birnbaum rule ought to continue?"
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,978.725,979.703,Yes Mr. Justice White.
1974.74-124,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,983.398,984.486,Not in this case?
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,984.486,988.069,"Not in this case, the majority did not."
1974.74-124,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1005.724,1021.3,Does not a Court of Appeals including the Ninth Circuit normally not permit to one panel of the Court and three judges to overrule the holdings of another panel especially if they are recent?
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,1021.3,1040.355,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I think that was the problem majority of the panel was faced with in our case and I think majority's decision and their seizing on this concept of functional equivalent is a classic law school textbook example of hard facts making bad law."
1974.74-124,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1040.355,1051.897,"But are you suggesting that what they did was do indirectly that is overruled, that's earlier panel decision without saying so by indirection."
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,1051.897,1053.484,"Yes, Mr. Justice Burger."
1974.74-124,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1103.344,1117.636,"Mr. Kreps, I noticed that neither you nor your opponent seem to have cited Justice Stewart's opinion for the Court last year in the Amtrak case where the Court held that provision of one type of civil remedy excluded another."
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,1127.521,1150.747,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I concur that it is in so particularly on the -- another issue that is attempted to be raised by the SEC at the last minute and that is whether there is a private remedy under Section 17 of the 1933 Act other than is set forth in Section 12 (2) of the 1933 Act."
1974.74-124,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1181.376,1190.057,"It never -- it never or my mistake, it has --has it ever been explicitly accepted by this Court?"
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,1190.057,1196.398,It has never been explicitly accepted in the sense that the standing of the plaintiff was an issue.
1974.74-124,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1211.582,1214.826,"Borak draw something else, did it?"
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,1215.772,1221.141,"Yes, that did not involve that issue here."
1974.74-124,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1221.78,1229.554,"Apparently, the court -- we denied certain in -- the Court did in Birnbaum itself, is it not in 52?"
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,1229.554,1230.51,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1974.74-124,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1230.51,1241.373,"And then the Seventh Circuit rejected it in iscent in last June or May perhaps last October, we denied cert there, didn't we?"
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,1241.373,1245.762,You denied cert with three justices voting to grant cert.
1974.74-124,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1251.071,1262.335,"If I'm not mistaken that was not a final judgment that not that that goes to the jurisdiction into the Court but it might have, I mean, in other words, the defendants might still have prevailed in that case if I --"
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,1262.335,1262.632,That's --
1974.74-124,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1262.632,1263.73,If I remember correctly.
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,1263.73,1265.237,That's correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1974.74-124,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1265.237,1270.315,You know where the Congress has ever been asked to address this question?
1974.74-124,0,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,1270.315,1297.126,"No, I do not Mr. Justice Brennan, it certainly should be and we did not intend to urge before the Court this morning that it overruled the lower courts in recognizing a judicially and private -- implied private right for damages under Section 10 but certainly that could be a legitimate issue before this Court."
1974.74-124,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1501.4,1504.56,Very well Mr. Kreps.
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1513.75,1519.848,Mr. Chief Justice and may the Court please.
1974.74-124,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1614.752,1632.291,But how do you distinguish that situation in the language of the rule from the situation that your opposing counsel was posing to the Court and what is it in Rule 10b-5 that would -- if we allow this would prevent the many other suitors who are not precisely in your situation?
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1632.291,1642.142,"I should preface that by saying that I have seated 10 of my minutes to the counsel for SEC, he is going for the homerun and I am going for the base hit."
1974.74-124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.376,1689.739,"It is a construction of the statute that the courts have been engaged in, this is not some judicial policy, it's a construction of the -- of the federal statute."
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1689.739,1690.797,That's correct.
1974.74-124,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1719.547,1720.979,What's so harsh about it?
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1725.997,1737.08,"Well, in the situation where you would have a case such as ours, I think that it's presented by the anomaly of the situation."
1974.74-124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1810.433,1813.335,"You think it can be limited in that category, do you?"
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1813.335,1814.383,"I do, Your Honor."
1974.74-124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.162,1893.065,What if he disagreed with you in a rational distinction and that -- and that it's a Birnbaum rule was to be followed you must lose this case?
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1899.672,1900.578,"Well, --"
1974.74-124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.578,1908.302,Should we reach the issue of overruling Birnbaum or not accepting Birnbaum or rejecting it or should be remanded in Ninth Circuit.
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1908.302,1926.797,"Well, I think first, if this Court feels that our case as presented in the amended complaint does not fall within one of the exceptions or is not an exception in and out of itself because its peculiarity, then I think the Court has to reach the whole Birnbaum rule on whether or not it's valid."
1974.74-124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1926.797,1934.532,"Wouldn't we have -- why wouldn't we remand under the Ninth Circuit if it ever considered attention, the Birnbaum rule assumption?"
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1936.626,1939.109,"Not in this case it has not, has not."
1974.74-124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1939.109,1941.682,But the Court of Appeals has done it on the previous case.
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1941.682,1942.548,It did do so.
1974.74-124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1944.844,1946.02,And the Seventh Circuit is --
1974.74-124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.02,1948.912,That's hard to believe.
1974.74-124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1948.912,1954.391,Done it -- done it another case and we have the benefit of their thinking on the other side.
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1954.391,1954.816,Is and has --
1974.74-124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1954.816,1958.6,All things in canvas in the Courts of Appeals including this one.
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1958.6,1964.888,There are I believe three or four circuits that have not directly reached the Birnbaum issue but --
1974.74-124,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1964.888,1985.581,"But Mr. Ryan, it think that if Judge Hufstedler is right, Mount Clemens, they did adopt, that panel did adopt the Third Circuit Rule, then the practice of the Chief Justice suggested earlier, I would suppose that we did what my brother White suggest would result automatically would it not in this panel following Mount Clemens?"
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1985.581,1995.71,"If -- if this Court found that this present case did not come within one of the exception, then you would go back and I would think that the Court would follow Mount Clemens."
1974.74-124,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1995.71,1997.095,I take that that argues ---
1974.74-124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.095,1999.211,Unless it was going Birnbaum?
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,1999.211,2000.237,Pardon?
1974.74-124,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2000.237,2003.668,Unless they went on Birnbaum?
1974.74-124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2003.668,2019.562,"This Court has on occasion when there was a conflict in panels in the Circuit and the Circuit certified the cases with doubtful question remanded and said in effect resolved your own conflicts first, is it not?"
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2019.562,2022.205,It has.
1974.74-124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2022.205,2028.73,But you say there is no conflict between what the panel did in Mount Clemens and what the panel did in this case?
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2028.73,2028.918,I --
1974.74-124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2028.918,2034.635,"The panel in Mount Clemens were apparently thought so or at least had some doubt about it, did they not?"
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2034.635,2041.03,"They had some doubt about it but again, the petition for rehearing en banc was denied."
1974.74-124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2041.03,2042.537,What was the vote on that denial?
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2042.537,2044.034,There were five dissenting.
1974.74-124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2048.954,2049.531,65
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2049.531,2051.725,65.
1974.74-124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2051.725,2056.103,You have a litigation pending in the state courts haven you on this same basic claim?
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2056.103,2057.69,"No, we had that."
1974.74-124,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2057.69,2058.389,You had too?
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2058.389,2062.021,Yes.
1974.74-124,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2062.021,2072.005,"Mr. Ryan, on that same point, do you consider your state remedy inadequate and if so, in what respect?"
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2072.005,2075.938,"Well, for two reasons, I consider it inadequate."
1974.74-124,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2085.165,2086.768,Why would that be so?
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2092.962,2137.273,"It's fraud that we alleged in the final analysis, however, the test as I understand it under the Securities Exchange Act is that the plaintiff is not required to bring in each and every one of the offerees and have him sit on the stand and say but for the fraud of the defendants, I definitely would have purchased the stock, as I understand it, it's a lesser burden of proof, that is that the misstatement on the fraud of the defendant in a particular 10b case have influenced or would have influenced his decision; whereas, under the state securities law and common law fraud, he would have to go through the normal elements of a fraud case to show actual reliance."
1974.74-124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2137.273,2152.792,"Do you think that this kind of situation lends itself to a class action when the proof under this Ninth Circuit holding, the proof in each case would be likely to vary a great deal?"
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2152.792,2169.83,"Well, again, Chief Justice, I feel that that as the rules on proof under 10b-5 actions that the decision of the investor was influenced or would have been influenced."
1974.74-124,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2199.871,2214.718,"Well, can a plaintiff in a 10b-5 action even though he may never have read the prospectus simply take the stand and say, if I had read it, it would have influenced me against buying and that brings him within the class that is entitled to recover?"
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2214.718,2216.361,"No, I do not think it goes that far."
1974.74-124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2227.145,2238.778,"You indicated earlier did you that if he'd read about it in the newspaper, the Wall Street Journal for example, would that be enough even if he'd not seen the prospectus?"
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2238.778,2243.656,You're speaking of the persons that are in this selective class that I represent.
1974.74-124,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2391.167,2406.024,"Mr. Ryan, lets assume for the moment that no offering had been made at all as they have been required by the consent decree, would your clients have had a cause of action?"
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2408.21,2410.044,If no offering had been made?
1974.74-124,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2410.044,2411.302,None.
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2425.603,2433.523,I would like to be able to distinguish the Control Data Corporation case and the like but I don't think it can be and I don't think it's in this case.
1974.74-124,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2479.785,2487.734,So you had no right under the decree and no contractual right to have a chance to buy these securities?
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2487.734,2490.827,"Well, I'm not saying that we didn't have a contractual right."
1974.74-124,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2491.745,2492.823,But what was it?
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2492.823,2500.778,"Well, as the Ninth Circuit stressed, it was a functional equivalent of a contract to purchase these shares."
1974.74-124,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2511.498,2516.389,"No, we have to say that the functional equivalent it to say it's not a context, isn't it?"
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2516.389,2518.593,You mean by the very fact you distinguished it from a contract.
1974.74-124,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2518.593,2522.902,"-- should be treated as if there were one although in fact there is none, isn't that it?"
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2522.902,2523.691,I think so.
1974.74-124,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2523.691,2528.689,Yes.
1974.74-124,1,32697,james_e_ryan,,2528.689,2531.528,I have nothing further.
1974.74-124,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2531.528,2537.514,Very well.
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2538.292,2542.504,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please."
1974.74-124,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2624.848,2640.128,"Well, as stated, the way you just stated that broadly and that would mean and I guess you're going to argue that the broad issue that Mr. Kreps submitted to us is here."
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2640.128,2648.604,"I certainly think it is, it's an issue that the Seventh Circuit has said we will not adopt this doctrine."
1974.74-124,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2658.294,2659.851,And presented by this case?
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2659.851,2703.846,"And I think it is presented by this case because at least it is arguable with respect to the exemption that the court drew whether or not that is a valid exemption, and as we point out in our brief, there is probably just as much litigation now as to what is exempt under the so called Birnbaum Purchase and Seller Doctrine, as to whether or not the doctrine should be applicable."
1974.74-124,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2703.846,2706.758,But what is the Ninth Circuit's Rule on it?
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2706.758,2708.455,"Well, the Ninth Circuit --"
1974.74-124,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2708.455,2710.07,As of now.
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2710.07,2720.445,The Ninth Circuit is -- rule is that they believe this purchaser-seller limitation is applicable.
1974.74-124,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2803.199,2804.704,So you have one?
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2809.303,2814.95,That the Court relied solely on this purchaser-seller doctrine in Mount Clemens.
1974.74-124,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2814.95,2819.309,"I'm asking you, do you say that Mount Clemens they followed it?"
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2819.309,2821.495,Yes Your Honor and I think they should know --
1974.74-124,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2821.495,2823.599,And in this case -- and in this case you walked around it?
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2823.599,2825.603,"This case, they walked around it."
1974.74-124,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2825.603,2828.72,So what is the rule of the Ninth Circuit?
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2830.262,2842.033,"Well, as in many of the other Circuits, the Ninth Circuit says we subscribe to the Birnbaum rule but we find exceptions in this case and in that case and in the other case."
1974.74-124,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2842.033,2845.564,We subscribed to the Birnbaum rule when we want to?
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2845.564,2847.798,Precisely.
1974.74-124,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2847.798,2856.721,"Mr. Ferber, is it a fair statement to say that the Birnbaum principle was submitted to the District Court and decided in this case?"
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2856.721,2859.296,"Yes, I believe so Your Honor."
1974.74-124,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2859.296,2869.343,To you I think it would say that the exception purportedly carved out by the Ninth Circuit really can't withstand analysis?
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2869.343,2870.112,"Well, I --"
1974.74-124,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.112,2880.732,"To the amendment that what's really -- if you're going to have the Birnbaum rule, the result reached below shouldn't have been reached?"
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2880.732,2884.183,I just can't accept that we're going to have the Birnbaum rule.
1974.74-124,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2893.884,2898.603,"In other words, both the rule and exception are fictions in your approach?"
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2898.603,2904.24,"I think the rule is basically -- well, its arbitrary, I don't know that I can say it's a fiction."
1974.74-124,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2911.073,2915.482,"Let me say that if you don't believe in a rule, well then you think any exception to it is fine."
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2915.482,2916.688,"Well, I suppose that's right."
1974.74-124,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2916.688,2919.111,Yes.
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,2919.111,2923.492,But let me say this.
1974.74-124,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3041.789,3046.707,"Mr. Ferber, has the commission ever asked the Congress to do anything about the Birnbaum rule?"
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3046.707,3050.51,"Well, we don't think this Court has never acted on the Birnbaum rule."
1974.74-124,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3052.407,3053.832,-- that wasn't my question.
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3053.832,3058.064,"Well, no, Your Honor, I mean, I was perhaps jumping ahead."
1974.74-124,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3058.064,3058.601,Yes.
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3058.601,3061.334,What I am saying is we're --
1974.74-124,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3061.334,3063.597,"After all, it's been around for 23 years now."
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3063.597,3065.075,It's been around and there had been except --
1974.74-124,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3065.075,3068.077,And has the commission been as restive as it is now under it?
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3068.077,3078.869,"Well, we have filed briefs in a great many of the Court of Appeals urging that the so-called rule not be accepted and --"
1974.74-124,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3078.869,3081.681,"Well, is that a reason not to go to Congress, was it?"
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3081.681,3098.519,"Well, in part, this Court only -- a few -- about two or three years ago in Affiliated Ute and the Superintendent of Insurance was the first that this Court had made clear that there is a private cause of action under Rule 10b-5."
1974.74-124,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3113.95,3120.494,"Well, I gather, if we sustain the Birnbaum rule and the commissioner will go to Congress and ask him to overrule it."
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3120.494,3124.085,I would think that that is certainly a possibility.
1974.74-124,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3124.085,3133.708,Can you almost wait until this Court has acted or have you sometimes gone to Congress with recommendations on the basis of Court of Appeals holding?
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3133.708,3142.336,I don't recall any instance where we have an interpretation of the Court of Appeals going to Congress but I don't want to say Your Honor that we never have.
1974.74-124,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3142.336,3147.132,"Well, it's been around for a long time in Second Circuit and that's where an awful lot of these transactions take place."
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3147.132,3163.928,"That's true but the Second Circuit has been punching more holes in the rule than almost any of the other Circuits so that there are in many instances, for example, it was the Second Circuit that said that it doesn't stop an injunction, private person can enjoin."
1974.74-124,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3163.928,3165.972,You and Mr. Ryan seem to disagree a little bit.
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3182.24,3183.658,"No, no Your Honor."
1974.74-124,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3210.912,3211.331,13.
1974.74-124,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3211.331,3211.719,13.
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3211.719,3212.498,13 is it?
1974.74-124,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3218.863,3225.478,"Well, the notation is that the five judges authorized the publication of their names."
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3232.87,3239.79,"I'm sorry Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that had not occurred to me, I suppose it is possible."
1974.74-124,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3241.784,3259.236,"I suppose your position would be that it's not uncommon for Courts of Appeals or other courts, intermediate courts to evolve exceptions to rules over a period time and that sometimes the exception finally swallow up the rule."
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3259.236,3259.815,That's right.
1974.74-124,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3259.815,3264.086,But you now say that this exception doesn't swallow up the entire rule.
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3264.086,3270.226,It certainly does not and it leaves this completely arbitrary rule on the books.
1974.74-124,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3270.226,3272.24,Is there square conflict in the circuits?
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3272.24,3272.947,There is a square conflict --
1974.74-124,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3272.947,3279.861,Probably I don't get it because the Seventh Circuit has explicitly declined to follow the Birnbaum rule.
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3279.861,3280.749,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1974.74-124,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3280.749,3293.459,"And whether this Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit can be said to have done more less the same thing, in fact or not done it is rather unimportant because other Courts of Appeals have said we do follow the Birnbaum rule."
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3293.459,3294.437,That's right.
1974.74-124,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3366.875,3370.286,Your time is expired unless you just want to set us --
1974.74-124,2,20824,david_ferber,,3370.286,3390.518,"I just wanted to say that this Court in the case Borak case stated that were rights under the Securities Exchange Act have been invaded, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done."
1974.74-124,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3390.518,3395.546,"Mr. Kreps, you have six minutes left."
1974.74-124,3,16326,allyn_o_kreps,,3395.546,3399.935,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-124,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3637.699,3638.487,Thank you Mr. Kreps.
