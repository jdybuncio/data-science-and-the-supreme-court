1978.78-5072,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,16.907,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Davis -- Shirley Davis against Passman.
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,22.142,25.925,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-5072,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,112.764,118.052,Do you mean as secretary that's the way he described her?
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,118.052,139.604,The title of the petition -- of the position Mr. Justice Blackmun was deputy administrative assistant but it is the functions of the job that are in question here and no one has ever contended that the petitioner did anything other than secretarial functions.
1978.78-5072,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,154.949,165.29,Do you think it would make a difference if her task were secretarial exclusively or administrative assistant at least impart?
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,165.29,173.337,It might make a difference Mr. Justice when we get to the question of the operation of the Speech or Debate Clause.
1978.78-5072,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,226.164,228.228,What was her salary is that in the review?
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,228.228,231.309,That is in the record Mr. Justice White.
1978.78-5072,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,235.109,241.567,"That sounds like a little some other than a low level clerical employee, doesn't it?"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,241.567,272.403,"It sounds like it Your Honor but one when consults the report of the clerk of the house for that period in time, it's quite clear that some 75 other representatives had secretaries, personal secretaries, executive secretaries, all making that kind of salary and indeed there are other cases where members employed persons called secretaries who made more than the administrative assistant that they also employ."
1978.78-5072,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,272.403,274.053,"When was this, 1970?"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,274.053,274.497,4.
1978.78-5072,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,274.497,275.188,4.
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,275.188,280.002,She was employed from February through July in 1974.
1978.78-5072,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,280.002,287.579,"The salary may be fixed by each individual member of the House in Senate without any standards, is that not so?"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,287.579,289.577,That is true Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.78-5072,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,289.577,300.943,"In some cases they level it off and divide the work among several people and another cases they have a very high salary of secretary, is that --"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,300.943,310.499,My understanding is that they are allotted a maximum of 18 slots which can be filled at their discretion and with salaries at their discretion.
1978.78-5072,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,310.499,319.398,"Well, they're not allotted 18 positions and X thousands of dollars and they may spread the salaries as they wish, is that not?"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,319.398,322.868,That is correct.
1978.78-5072,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,487.704,500.907,"Counsel, some of us were in dissent in Bivens and do you think that blocks us in and makes us necessarily unsympathetic to your posture here?"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,500.907,510.27,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I'd be delighted if the dissents Bivens were persuaded by the cause of action should be applied under the facts of this case."
1978.78-5072,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,540.382,551.358,"You know, we do try to be individually consistent and what I'm asking is, is there any escape for those of us who were in dissent in Bivens?"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,551.358,554.587,I would suggest one Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1978.78-5072,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,615.342,625.569,"Yes, but you just made reference to a number of cases in this area whether the courts had gone in your favor."
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,628.142,631.973,There's extensive litigation in the area.
1978.78-5072,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,631.973,666.774,"Doesn't some of your answer to Mr. Justice Blackmun cut the other way in the sense that although the statute is on the books the general kind of hortatory statute, Congress is quite carefully considered whether it wanted to make its members subject to say Title VI, the way the Executive Branch members are or whether it wanted to subject its members to any particular strictures in their hiring and firing and they simply have not done it."
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,670.581,692.998,"Our argument Mr. Chief Justice -- Mr. Justice Rehnquist, pardon me, is that Congress cannot mandate no remedy for violations of constitutional rights and indeed in this case it is never suggested that there should be no juridical remedy for this kind of violation."
1978.78-5072,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,714.788,725.748,"Well, that proposition may be entirely some but it doesn't seem to me that it's really makes your case a stronger one than Bivens as you suggested to Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,725.748,731.247,"In Bivens, there was no congressional policy stated in the area."
1978.78-5072,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,864.447,869.85,Your reliance is on the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment?
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,869.85,870.424,"That's correct, Mr. Justice White."
1978.78-5072,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,870.424,871.692,Exclusively?
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,871.692,873.034,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-5072,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,873.034,878.619,Is it your view that the Equal Protection Clause even of the Fourteenth Amendment confers personal rights?
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,885.043,893.012,I don't think that the analysis would be different under the Fourth Amendment as under the Fifth Amendment in the implication --
1978.78-5072,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.012,895.016,"Well, there are really provisions of the Constitution."
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,920.807,935.293,That is true Mr. Justice White but many classifications or at least several have been deemed to this Court to rise to the level of being constitutionally safeguarded and thus subject to the equal protections scrutiny.
1978.78-5072,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,935.293,947.946,"Invidiously discriminatory classifications but they -- there's nothing in Equal Protection Clause that confers personal rights by contrast to those provisions of the Constitution, examples to which I gave you."
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,947.946,962.334,What the courts have held however and indeed this is the constitutional jurisprudence which has come down from Marbury against Madison is that when constitutional rights are invaded as opposed to other kinds of rights to federal courts --
1978.78-5072,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,962.334,979.618,"Well, whose constitutional rights -- the Equal Protection Clause just requires a state in the Fourteenth Amendment or insofar as it's component of the Fifth Amendment requires the federal government to grant everybody equal protection of the laws."
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,985.782,988.084,I believe the very purpose of the Bill of Rights --
1978.78-5072,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,988.084,999.391,We have a personal right of the exercise of free speech against governmental interference or the one has a personal right if brought to trial in a criminal court to the assistance of counsel and so on.
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1009.862,1014.112,"Indeed, you're going to the heart of the case Mr. Justice Stewart in suggesting --"
1978.78-5072,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1014.112,1014.123,I do.
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1014.123,1029.488,"-- that constitutional rights, must be implied or remedies for them from the Constitution because without that implication of the cause of action those rights would be reduced to meaningless rhetoric."
1978.78-5072,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1038.154,1040.15,May I ask you a question?
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1051.465,1063.481,"Again, I think the answer Mr. Justice Powell is yes as regards the cause of action aspect of the case before you this morning."
1978.78-5072,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1086.016,1093.173,Do you think if Georgette Powell were relieved do you have a cause of action against the President?
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1093.173,1103.869,I'm frank to say that if he were relieved for reasons which were invidiously discriminatory then the answer would have to be yes.
1978.78-5072,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1103.869,1117.628,"If the President had written to him that he preferred to have a talented woman in his position and complimented him only as Congressman Passman did that would be fairly analogous, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1117.628,1119.231,Yes sir.
1978.78-5072,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1123.915,1126.337,How about Pacific Tel. & Tel.
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1151.651,1153.574,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I apologize."
1978.78-5072,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1157.826,1195.259,"You were saying that you know you can't have a right without a remedy in that sort of thing, how about the case of Pacific Telephone and Telegraph versus, I think it was, Fuller decided about 1910 where this Court said that although the constitution does say every state shall be guaranteed to republican form of government nonetheless, the people on Oregon who were challenging the referendum provision were told that cause of action -- that provision simply isn't judicially enforceable."
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1195.259,1210.939,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I confess it's not a case that I'm familiar with and can't speculate upon it on those facts but I would suggest that in the context of the Bill of Rights guarantee that Bivens would be the law of the case at this moment in time."
1978.78-5072,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1210.939,1214.506,"Certainly, Bivens is a lot later than that one."
1978.78-5072,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1214.506,1222.357,"Ms. Shtasel let me add some variation, hypothetical; it's a variation of Mr. Justice Powell's question."
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1260.073,1267.488,I think in that context Mr. Chief Justice other kinds of balancing factors come into play.
1978.78-5072,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1313.45,1334.354,"Well, counsel if it -- I suppose if to say that -- that I suppose you could say that there would be a Fifth Amendment cause of action and still say that a cause of action hasn't been stated."
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1353.224,1365.452,"To be sure Mr. Justice White, what we are talking about at that point is trial issues and proof issues rather than as statement of a cause of action in the federal court system."
1978.78-5072,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1365.452,1376.806,"If my question was explicitly, what if there is a cause of action, would there it not to whether he might win or lose it?"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1376.806,1380.845,In that context Mr. Chief Justice I have to answer yes.
1978.78-5072,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1380.845,1389.804,"May I ask another question, what does Title VII provide with respect to staff personnel in the White House?"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1389.804,1397.571,Under Title VII members of the Executive Branch staff are covered.
1978.78-5072,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1407.889,1411.686,No exceptions with respect to White House personnel?
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1411.686,1415.118,None on its face Mr. Justice Powell.
1978.78-5072,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1415.118,1418.783,No separation of powers problem?
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1418.783,1423.635,The Congress in its wisdom did not exempt those particular staff people.
1978.78-5072,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1423.635,1424.324,Yes.
1978.78-5072,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1424.324,1442.56,"Well, in the president presumably signed the Bill, is there -- is Title VII applied the Executive Branch applicable only that their competitive service or is it applied to anyone who will -- gets a pay check from the federal government?"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1442.56,1458.689,"Title VII in the Executive Branch context applies to members of the civil service which have been defined under the appropriate statute to mean appointees of the executive, legislative and judicial branches."
1978.78-5072,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1467.971,1478.986,"Well, then but the competitive service I would assume is probably doesn't cover top White House employees or the Secretary of the Treasury or people like that."
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1478.986,1482.261,They are not expressly exempted from the operation of the competitive (Voice Overlap).
1978.78-5072,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1482.261,1488.404,"Well, but certainly many employees of the Executive Branch are expressly exempted aren't they, is the military exempted?"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1488.404,1490.227,The military is not exempted.
1978.78-5072,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1490.227,1493.315,Is the cabinet officer an employee?
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1497.18,1499.175,He is appointed however.
1978.78-5072,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1499.175,1500.904,"Well, he's not an employee."
1978.78-5072,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1508.992,1517.707,He's permission recites that he serves at the pleasure of the president -- I think with all presidential appointees.
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1517.707,1532.428,"In that case Mr. Chief Justice, the question might be resolved by operation of separation of powers doctrine which would confer a textual commitment to another branch of the federal government."
1978.78-5072,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1569.773,1573.783,"This wasn't decided by the en banc court, was it?"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1573.783,1575.06,"No, sir."
1978.78-5072,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.653,1691.958,"Well, why would it be any worst to fire a secretary on a basis of sex discrimination than an administrative assistant who have policymaking responsibilities?"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1691.958,1698.471,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, our position is that the Court need not go so far in this particular case."
1978.78-5072,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1707.681,1708.64,(Voice Overlap)
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1708.64,1717.975,There are two ways or two means of analysis that I suggest would be appropriate in devising limiting principles for the operation of the clause.
1978.78-5072,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1757.9,1761.758,Is it employee of the federal government?
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1768.915,1780.688,The checks are issued from the House of Representatives Treasury but the statute is clear that that members of Congress has ultimate hiring and firing responsibilities (Voice Overlap).
1978.78-5072,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1780.688,1782.727,"As an agent of the federal government, correct?"
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1782.727,1783.664,That's correct.
1978.78-5072,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1783.664,1785.482,Which is the employer?
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1785.482,1789.444,"That's right, which is exactly why this runs us to Fifth Amendment violation."
1978.78-5072,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1789.444,1790.003,Right.
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1791.81,1792.106,That's correct.
1978.78-5072,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.106,1822.834,"Well, under your second line of analysis I presume that if in my annual search for law works if I were to interview women and find women or woman who felt that some of my votes in cases involving women weren't all that satisfactory to earn and felt she would have some difficulty working from me for that reason and she could prove that I didn't hire her for that reason, she would have an action against me."
1978.78-5072,0,42135,sana_f_shtasel,,1822.834,1826.168,I think not Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1978.78-5072,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1855.887,1861.091,Mr. Gear.
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1861.091,1864.983,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-5072,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1939.783,1943.368,How are those -- how is that phrase to find in those statistics?
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1943.368,1943.784,It's --
1978.78-5072,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1943.784,1944.88,Civil Right's filings?
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1944.88,1948.561,It apparently covers our employment cases.
1978.78-5072,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1952.282,1957.608,I. e. under statutes like the Civil Rights Act of 1964?
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1957.608,1959.43,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-5072,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1959.43,1964.436,That is not surprising that there are more such occasions after the passage of that act than they were before us.
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1964.436,1965.67,I agree with you sir.
1978.78-5072,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1966.342,1970.104,"And it's true where we are talking mostly, they can file a lawsuit."
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1970.104,1970.42,That's right.
1978.78-5072,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1970.42,1972.052,The important being is the women?
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1972.052,1977.419,That's true sir but we feel that if cause of action is -- excuse me sir?
1978.78-5072,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1977.419,1983.541,Even this precisely one of the arguments that Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Blackmun made in dissent in Bivens.
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1983.541,1985.205,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.78-5072,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1993.611,1997.037,"Well, outside of this one, how many others do you have in this flood?"
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,1997.037,1998.113,I beg your pardon sir?
1978.78-5072,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1998.113,2003.207,"Outside of this case, how many others do you have in this flood you're talking about?"
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2003.207,2010.816,"Well, sir, every Circuit Court has considered the Bivens type cases and they're moving up to you sir."
1978.78-5072,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2010.816,2012.221,How many 11 Circuit Courts?
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2015.33,2016.736,"Well, I don't know the exact number sir."
1978.78-5072,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2016.736,2017.991,I thought that you did.
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2017.991,2022.24,Alright.
1978.78-5072,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2048.527,2056.884,"Mr. Gear, will the same argument apply to enforcing Section 1983 against state officials?"
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2056.884,2058.324,"I think so sir, yes."
1978.78-5072,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.757,2091.697,"Well, the petitioner in this case is not an employee of former Congressman Passman."
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2093.733,2098.562,"Well, that of course is the Fifth Amendment connection of the case (Voice Overlap)."
1978.78-5072,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2098.562,2100.498,That's exactly right.
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2103.126,2107.756,But Congressman or I don't know you have to ask the plaintiff on that sir.
1978.78-5072,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.606,2182.87,Are you suggesting that there never should be a cause of action under the Fifth Amendment until or unless Congress indicates that there should be some kind of cause of action?
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2182.87,2196.718,I'm suggesting there should be no cause of action against Congress until Congress suggest that sir because we have separation of power principles involved here which is in another of the special factor we believe should counsel hesitation in this case.
1978.78-5072,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2207.401,2210.151,You don't think the Fourth Amendment apply to Congress?
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2210.151,2211.192,"I don't think so, sir."
1978.78-5072,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2211.192,2211.686,You don't?
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2211.686,2212.878,"I don't think so, sir."
1978.78-5072,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2212.878,2215.391,Does any part of the Constitution apply to the Congress?
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2215.391,2216.414,"May I say this, sir."
1978.78-5072,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2247.131,2252.394,Why shouldn't Speech or Debate Clause take care of all of your concerns in this regard?
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2252.394,2254.287,"Well, Your Honor we believe it does."
1978.78-5072,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.31,2272.95,"Well, I know but suppose we disagreed with you on that of course there is an area to which this Speech or Debate Clause applies and that why would -- whatever area that is why wouldn't that be inadequate answer to your separation powers or --"
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2272.95,2276.47,Or Speech or Debate Clause in separation of powers principle of the same (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-5072,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2276.47,2284.09,"No, it certainly wouldn't protect Speech or Debate Clause certainly protects Congress against invasions why either --"
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2284.09,2290.39,Exactly right Your Honor and this again is another special factor in this case which is the most unusual case I believe.
1978.78-5072,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2295.958,2327.564,"Suppose counsel that there is a federal statute that I thought was preventing me from engaging in some activities and the federal government was threatening to enforce it against me, at least there was a case of controversy and I went into a federal court and filed the complaint saying that asking for declaratory adjustment to the statute was unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment either Due Process Clause or the equal protection component."
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2332.803,2334.483,I think you'd have a cause of action to do that.
1978.78-5072,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.483,2335.711,Under the Fifth Amendment?
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2335.711,2339.558,"Yes, to declare such a statute."
1978.78-5072,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.558,2341.705,"Well, where would I get my cause of action?"
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2343.699,2345.915,"Well, I believe it would be sir."
1978.78-5072,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.915,2348.948,And you think that would lie all right.
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2348.948,2362.91,I think that would lie all right but I think that you get into separation of power situations here that even if the Court were to expand Bivens to other Fifth Amendment actions what I'm saying that in this case separation of power considerations prohibit the (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-5072,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.91,2380.626,"Oh, yes but in my example there would be no federal statute that extended the cause of action to me to sue the Executive Branch and yet you say I can go into the Court and have that Court enjoin the Executive Branch?"
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2380.626,2382.996,"Well, I may have misunderstood your question, Your Honor."
1978.78-5072,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2389.795,2392.905,"(Voice Overlap) well, that's a different point."
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2392.905,2393.456,"Well, --"
1978.78-5072,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2393.456,2397.637,And who would be the defendant be in my brother White's hypothetical case?
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2397.637,2399.337,The Executive (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-5072,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.337,2402.809,The people enforcing the statute?
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2402.809,2408.053,"Your Honor, I do want to get into the Speech or Debate Clause considerations here, if I may."
1978.78-5072,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2510.157,2510.964,Mr. Gear.
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2510.964,2511.496,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-5072,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2511.496,2528.714,"I know its water over the dam, but it's all what it worried me, and just frankly when the Speech and Debate Clause was adopted, how many people do you think have found and filed those intended that to apply to?"
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2530.48,2540.103,"Numerically, I -- well, numerically at that time that the legislator did not have the immense staffs that they had today."
1978.78-5072,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2540.103,2541.73,"Immense staff, did they?"
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2541.73,2542.685,I would assume that's correct.
1978.78-5072,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2548.254,2551.374,In that day up until now it require a lot of work.
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2551.374,2551.787,That's right.
1978.78-5072,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2644.806,2650.527,"Well, there are some Congressmen here who think otherwise, which they filed a new amicus brief on the other side."
1978.78-5072,1,16089,a_richard_gear,,2650.527,2670.71,"That's true, Your Honor but we feel that their interests really are concern more on the fair employment practices aspects of the society problems today than they are on the true separation of powers problem which I think accord this, if you understand me on that."
1978.78-5072,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2750.533,2751.493,Very well Mr. Gear.
