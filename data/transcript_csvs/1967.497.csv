1967.497,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,27.869,"Number 497, Josephine Hanner, petitioner versus Cecil Demarcus et al."
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,29.842,31.859,May it please the Court.
1967.497,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,113.544,116.223,"He had of course full notice of that, did she?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,116.223,123.994,"She was a party to the case, it was part of a judgment of which she was a party to the case she obviously had notice of it."
1967.497,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,123.994,135.999,The judgment was given him and award to him of $5500.00 with authority to execute upon that judgment in accordance with the statutes sets the judgment to be paid within about 60 days?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,135.999,139.208,60 days was time that set by the trial court.
1967.497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,280.428,283.133,Was this -- did you say there was posting on the property?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,283.133,284.698,Not on the property itself.
1967.497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,284.698,285.621,Is that required?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,285.621,287.392,It is not required.
1967.497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,287.392,296.162,"And is this -- this system you described is not in characteristic in state execution and in foresales, does it?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,296.162,298.03,"This is the system, statutory system."
1967.497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,301.221,305.978,And not only in Arizona?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,305.978,307.36,Pardon me?
1967.497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,307.36,309.095,"This isn't just peculiar to Arizona, isn't it?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,309.095,309.712,No.
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,425.742,428.751,Could there been a stay of this execution?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,428.751,434.106,It is probable that a supersedeas bond could have been issued and a stay issue.
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,440.657,443.355,"Well, I mean in so far as is this word, isn't it?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,443.355,446.053,"There could've been stay, a stay of execution could've been issued."
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,446.053,449.262,Is there a reason why one wasn't sought?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,449.262,457.833,"There are two reasons, I believe.One is that she states she was advised by Mr. Demarcus and he wasn't going to do anything, that her lawyer was seeing him daily."
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,462.044,466.028,Did you say that her lawyer and Mr. Demarcus shared an office together?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,466.028,482.386,"They are in the same building and as the affidavit submitted and even the deposition note they saw each other quite often, that's about a six-story office building there are maybe 40 offices in it and quite a fact Mr. Demarcus was the choice of Mrs. Hanner's former counsel to be the special master, they knew each other."
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,482.386,487.45,Is there anything to indicate whether the lawyer knew that he was about to levy this execution?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,487.45,494.583,The evidence says on the affidavit of Mr. Levy is that he did not in fact know that he was as surprised as Mrs. Hanner.
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,494.583,499.95,Was that contested by counsel to the other side?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,499.95,512.947,"There are no affidavits of that, no as a matter of fact it is not that neither Mrs. Hanner nor her counsel were ever advised and that there was certainly opportunity to advise them that these steps were being taken."
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,522.376,525.271,Has that appeal ever been decided by the Supreme Court of Arizona?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,525.271,525.894,Yes.
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,545.879,547.153,So --
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,547.153,550.676,So we do not challenge now that the entire fee is doomed.
1967.497,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,610.358,618.865,Who paid the taxes from the time of the execution up to the hearing or whatever it was?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,618.865,625.414,"Up to the time of the filing of a quiet title action, 1962 she did, Mr. Hanner so far as we know."
1967.497,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,632.318,633.961,Your client paid the taxes up to six --
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,633.961,639.519,Up until the initiation of a quiet title action which in effect to deprived her with the property.
1967.497,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,639.519,650.078,"Well, if the execution was valid, would not the other side have been required to pay the taxes?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,650.078,653.161,"In theory, that should've happen that way but in practice it did not --"
1967.497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.161,659.584,Yes but the trade -- a deed does an issue immediately after the sale I would suppose that a period to redemption as to around that --
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,659.584,662.469,Six months had applied and that expires to bring him up until (Voice Overlap) --
1967.497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,662.469,668.357,As soon as the deed issued and was recorded then the tax collected -- to be collected from another person.
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,668.357,670.329,If they took notice of the change of property (Voice Overlap) --
1967.497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,670.329,672.557,Which they do.
1967.497,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,672.557,676.538,May I ask you what is your standard question?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,676.538,695.844,We believe that the Fourteenth Amendment is directed to the preservation of property rights as well as individual rights and that this question was raised all the way through the proceedings that this Court has previously held that property may not be taken without due process and that notice is essential.
1967.497,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,697.102,705.166,As I understand your chief objection up to date have been -- have failed to follow state law.
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,705.166,705.324,Yes.
1967.497,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,705.324,709.086,And the way they executed this levy.
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,709.086,710.777,Yes.
1967.497,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,710.777,718.963,"Well, are you arguing that failure to follow state law constitutes the violation of due process?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,718.963,720.58,Of course we believe it can.
1967.497,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,726.5,733.148,"Well, she wouldn't have lost the property as I understand you if they had evaded state law."
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,733.148,734.991,Yes.
1967.497,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,734.991,757.667,Are you -- if you present the case here it presents a question that I think it's not been here before whether it's a violation of due process for litigants to fail of a court -- state court to fail to follow a state law?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,757.667,762.056,I'm not sure I understand the question but in other words (Voice Overlap) state court fails --
1967.497,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,762.056,768.659,Your basic argument is statute of Arizona required certain things done.
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,768.659,769.498,Yes.
1967.497,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,769.498,778.057,"In order or to be illegal, these things were not done as required by state law."
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,786.719,789.256,"Yes, essentially that is our major position."
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,789.256,790.986,If I don't understand that.
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,835.331,835.937,"No, it did not --"
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,835.937,836.183,(Voice Overlap)
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,836.183,839.839,-- the position that the statute was unconstitutional for failure to provide notice.
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,839.839,843.469,What is your position on that on the federal issue?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,846.839,847.55,Yes.
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,854.1,866.7,"Well, maybe so but so far as we're concerned we have to accept it that under Arizona law and no notice was required, is that right?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,866.7,873.458,You said that this method is either -- he denied that this method is either vague or lacking in the protections guarantee by the due process.
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,873.458,875.795,"Well, what does this mean?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,895.69,900.259,We are not taking the position that Rule 53 (a) requires any particular special notice.
1967.497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,900.259,942.745,"Well, you -- the question when you present here however in your paper, in your petition for certiorari, in your brief is whether or not it's the violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to permit execution without notice and I thought that was a question we have whether the state procedure doesn't require a separate notice when you execute after judgment and addition to notice the suit itself whether that's constitutional because state court didn't decide that notice was required and that this was just have to make that notice just said notice wasn't required at all."
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,942.745,944.377,Instead that notice (Voice Overlap) --
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,944.377,955.397,(Voice Overlap) I don't suppose if notice is required that be a quite an argument that this wasn't whatever done here was notice.
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,955.397,956.859,I think we have a problem in that.
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,963.25,964.922,But we can't -- we can't be concerned.
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,971.651,971.726,No.
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,971.726,987.808,"You concluded by, aren't we and don't you have to argue this case on the premise that the holding of the Supreme Court that no notice was required at all under any circumstances, did or did not violate the requirements of due process."
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,987.808,988.877,That is what we are holding.
1967.497,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1031.502,1065.101,"Really, our question of course is -- has to be exclusively the federal question and it really doesn't make very much difference, does it, whether your argument is that to the extent that the Arizona Supreme Court said that the statute permitted this then to that extent the statute is unconstitutional in -- as applied to this case and if the statute doesn't permit it that still doesn't change the constitutional question."
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1073.713,1074.449,That is our case.
1967.497,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1074.449,1079.339,-- whether or not that was authorized by the Arizona statute is not very important.
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1079.339,1080.244,"Not essentially in other words, --"
1967.497,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1080.244,1086.923,"Not at all, to our -- to our issue here which the federal constitutional issue."
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1086.923,1111.397,"If the Supreme Court of Arizona in saying that no notice is required meant to include everything, every form of execution not just an execution under Rule 53 (a) then we think that they are clearly wrong and that their position is just not only in contravention of our own statutes but of the Constitution of the United States and we do not believe that this has been seriously disputed by the respondent in this case."
1967.497,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1131.886,1136.667,"Precisely, what happens under your Arizona procedures?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1142.725,1146.996,Takes a piece of paper from his office and goes to the county recorder's office and that's it.
1967.497,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1146.996,1151.383,And that is general procedure not only under 53 (a).
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1151.383,1154.753,That would be general procedure under any writ of special execution in any case.
1967.497,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1154.753,1163.298,And then the county recorder or whatever it is records that execution has been levied on such and such a property.
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1163.298,1164.072,Yes.
1967.497,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1164.072,1168.84,And what happens next to what are the rights?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1168.84,1173.175,The sheriff is required to notice the property for sale.
1967.497,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1173.175,1175.664,"Now, what -- how does he notice of this?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1181.132,1186.204,Posting at the county court house and a publication in a newspaper.
1967.497,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1186.204,1189.68,But nothing is served on the owner?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1189.68,1190.519,No.
1967.497,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1190.519,1196.763,And then the sheriff sale takes place and then somebody buys in the property.
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1196.763,1198.711,Anybody (Inaudible).
1967.497,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1198.711,1203.864,"And then there's a period of redemption, is there?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1203.864,1205.738,"Generally six months, there are exceptions in our cases."
1967.497,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1205.738,1215.667,And is there any provision for notification to the owner or former owner at that time?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1215.667,1217.701,There is none.
1967.497,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1217.701,1222.833,And that he is just supposed to get notice from the publication.
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1222.833,1224.178,"Yes, if they happen to see him."
1967.497,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1224.178,1232.472,Is this procedure different from the procedure prevailing another states?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1232.472,1234.064,Not essentially.
1967.497,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1234.064,1236.433,"That's where it works all over, isn't it?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1236.433,1244.643,In many states except some require posting on the property and some may have special notice provisions but generally this is --
1967.497,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1244.643,1265.78,I thought -- I thought you contended that under your statute the judgment that are -- have the right to point out the kind of property that he wanted sold first and that it was a duty of the sheriff to sell personal property first.
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1265.78,1266.158,Yes.
1967.497,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1266.158,1272.929,"And that there was personal property in this case, there was no -- it was not sold first --"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1272.929,1273.184,Yes.
1967.497,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1273.184,1296.937,-- and also that the judgment there was not notified so that he had any choice to pick a piece of property that he wanted sold first and that the master picked the piece of property that was worth conservatively four times the amount of his debt.
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1296.937,1297.485,Yes.
1967.497,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1297.485,1298.932,"-- or his claim, is that right?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1298.932,1300.068,Yes.
1967.497,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1300.068,1313.516,"Well, how under your statute is the judgment that are notified supposed to be notified so he can make a selection of the kinds of property that he want sold first?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1313.516,1323.523,"Obviously, the sheriff has to come in contact with him somehow or other before the writ of execution and the levy is filed with the county recorder's office."
1967.497,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1323.523,1325.501,Does the statute say so?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1325.501,1338.212,"No, it does not say how or why or when but it says he has the right to point out to the sheriff the property that he desires to be levied upon."
1967.497,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1398.145,1399.465,There was personal property here?
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1399.465,1400.53,There was personal property.
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1421.786,1425.986,"Well, what do you do with this holding of your Supreme Court?"
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1434.542,1438.491,That they are just completely wrong.
1967.497,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.491,1439.75,"Well then, maybe but --"
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1439.75,1442.305,Maybe but they just didn't know.
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1442.305,1443.489,They did not analyzed --
1967.497,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1443.489,1469.765,"No, but the point is Mr. Haggerty, how -- you've been arguing that they didn't execute properly, they should've executed against personal property but your Supreme Court tells us and that's why a holding that I suggest concludes us that this plaintiff did everything that the statutes of Arizona require them to do and affirm to summary judgment and among the other things they said was, he did not have to give a notice before he execute."
1967.497,0,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,1480.029,1494.773,"Basically, it ignored it and the wealth of other matters were brought up they just never considered and that if they say -- if a statute provides X, Y and Z and if the Court says, they did that and they took care of that but the record shows in fact they did not."
1967.497,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1529.633,1533.45,Mr. Johnson.
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,1533.45,1536.643,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1643.375,1650.866,"Well, let me get this -- let me get this straight."
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,1659.609,1663.025,"According to the Encyclopedia Press case, Mr. Justice White."
1967.497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1663.025,1672.993,"If it was constitutionally required you don't contend, do you, that the notice given in this case was sufficient?"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,1672.993,1684.758,"Again, if it please the Court, that issue has been raised in a context in which I believe I can demonstrate to the Court that it does not exist."
1967.497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1689.462,1702.426,"What if the Constitution required notice of sale as well as of the original suit, the notice was given here wasn't sufficient, was it under Schroeder cases and like that."
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,1702.426,1707.376,"But, if Your Honor please, the reason it wasn't sufficient according to the --"
1967.497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1707.376,1709.533,"Well, are you saying yes but or --"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,1709.533,1709.912,It was not --
1967.497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1709.912,1710.873,-- no but?
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,1710.873,1713.154,No Your Honor I would agree with the Court.
1967.497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.154,1713.944,"Well, that's all I'm --"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,1713.944,1718.432,"I would agree with Your Honor that it is not sufficient, no."
1967.497,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1868.363,1890.259,"Well, do you agree with that -- with the contention that's the way the statute properly construe works that is to say sheriff is advised to levy execution and then that statute means that the sheriff has to go to the debtor and sell on which property should I levy execution."
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,1890.259,1891.779,"Indeed, I do Mr. Justice Fortas."
1967.497,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1891.779,1897.024,That's the way it should work and then it didn't happen in this case.
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,1897.024,1905.731,There is no record I submit Your Honor upon which it might be suggested that it did not happen in the following sense.
1967.497,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1911.964,1936.739,"Well, I'm not -- I'm not interested in that at the moment but as I understand it then what you're saying is that petitioner has not presented to this Court a constitutional issue that petitioner has urged upon this Court that petitioner's rights were violated because petitioner did not received notice."
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,1961.44,1964.48,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1967.497,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1987.854,1996.122,"Well, what did you -- I gather looking at your objection of the motion for rehearing what did you mean -- what does this mean?"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2022.958,2024.818,No Your Honor.
1967.497,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2180.247,2180.937,"Well, let's see."
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2211.383,2212.595,Climate Control versus Hill.
1967.497,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2212.595,2213.865,Climate Control.
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2227.216,2230.501,That is my interpretation Mr. Justice Brennan.
1967.497,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2230.501,2234.344,Are you suggesting them it's an adequate state ground here that --
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2234.344,2234.783,Indeed.
1967.497,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2234.783,2238.422,-- disposes of under your authority we have to deal with this constitutional levy?
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2238.422,2240.398,"Well, I am indeed Your Honor."
1967.497,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2287.447,2304.877,"Well, if I understand your point cuts a little deeper than that, you're saying that this is an objection that should've been made, point that should've made at the trial stage and the action of quiet title so that you can then make a record, isn't that right?"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2304.877,2305.634,Precisely.
1967.497,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2305.634,2320.055,"And you're saying that it wasn't made until the petition for rehearing in the appellate court and there is no record of what actually happened whether the sheriff did or did not notified the debtor, is that your point?"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2320.055,2322.296,Precisely Mr. Justice Fortas.
1967.497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2426.39,2432.388,"Mr. Johnson, what about the affidavit of Mrs. Hanner?"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2432.388,2433.622,Mrs. Hanner's affidavit --
1967.497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2433.622,2438.709,She says quite concessive that she received no notice --
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2438.709,2440.225,From the Sheriff either indeed.
1967.497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2440.225,2441.12,From the sheriff.
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2441.12,2444.584,I agree with that Mr. Justice Marshall however --
1967.497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2444.584,2450.761,"Or is it your point that her counsel never mentioned a particular case, is that your point?"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2450.761,2461.13,"Well, my point if the Court please is that an affidavit of fact has no legal context in the absence of its being considered by the Court."
1967.497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.13,2465.385,"Well, this is filed, it says -- wasn't this file with the Court?"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2465.385,2466.482,"Yes, if the Court please."
1967.497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2466.482,2471.254,Was it ever any counter affidavit filed with the Court?
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2471.254,2476.014,"To controvert that particular point, I would say no, Your Honor."
1967.497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2476.014,2478.206,So this was before the Court?
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2478.206,2478.562,The factual --
1967.497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2478.562,2479.889,All of the courts?
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2479.889,2480.177,"Indeed it was, Your Honor."
1967.497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2508.684,2510.956,This affidavit was in both those courts?
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2510.956,2515.163,It was indeed Your Honor but it was never placed in to a legal context by counsel.
1967.497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2519.634,2521.061,"Well, then I'm right."
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2523.701,2524.791,"Right, Your Honor."
1967.497,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2524.791,2549.675,"Well, what you're really saying as I understand it is that the counsel never said that the -- has a defense to the action of quiet title that the levy of execution was unlawful because as shown by this affidavit the sheriff failed to notify the judgment debtor, is that your point?"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2549.675,2551.153,"Yes, Your Honor, that is my point."
1967.497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.911,2635.966,"Well, what if they didn't though, don't you still if that Encyclopedia case is good law about whether or not -- no notice is required for execution?"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2650.917,2652.041,"Absolutely, --"
1967.497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2652.041,2656.713,Even if the state law required actual notice and it was ignored?
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2656.713,2658.271,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1967.497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.573,2674.385,"(Voice Overlap) maybe it was on his way to being overruled, didn't it?"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2674.385,2678.504,I have that feeling if the Court please.
1967.497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2679.885,2685.136,That's why you're spending so much time on the argument that anyway the issue wasn't here.
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2685.136,2687.992,That is precisely correct if the Court please.
1967.497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2712.769,2721.623,"But I take it you also agree, and I'll go back to the question awhile ago that if notice is required here what was given was insufficient?"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2721.623,2729.683,If notice under Schroeder is required and will be required under --
1967.497,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.683,2731.179,Executions.
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2731.179,2738.38,"-- post judgment execution upon real property than the actual notice given in this case, I would suppose is not adequate."
1967.497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2934.621,2945.978,Wouldn't be helpful to use adjectives that are in the record than just stating an adjective that are not in the record?
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2945.978,2948.986,"Well, perhaps Your Honor I apologize."
1967.497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2948.986,2950.006,"No, I'm --"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2950.006,2954.075,But what adjective -- to what adjective does Your Honor refer?
1967.497,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2954.075,2956.526,"Well, you said you were thinking of one."
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,2961.374,2968.053,"Well, it was the feeling, if the Court please, of the Supreme Court of Arizona."
1967.497,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3015.247,3019.37,To do what?
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,3019.37,3049.524,"To state for example of that Mr. Demarcus was proceeding fairly, that the execution was reasonable under the circumstances that he was exercising the precise right which was granted him by statute that he executed upon the only property, only property reasonable under the circumstances of this case, I believe these are the only separate property upon which it was reasonable execute."
1967.497,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3063.54,3071.823,Did the Court -- did that the Court hold that there was no other property that it could be levied on?
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,3071.823,3078.168,The Court was never Mr. Chief Justice never faced with the allegation that real property existed.
1967.497,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3078.168,3094.202,"No, well, I understood I just understood you said a few moments ago that the Court determined that this was some most reasonable property to take and so forth and you say that it wasn't raised but what were they doing with it or what were they making that decision on?"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,3094.202,3099.331,"They were talking about the value of the property, if the Court please, in that context."
1967.497,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3248.596,3263.777,Would that mean that if we consider the case is properly here that you're entitled to lose?
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,3263.777,3266.302,That's a difficult case to answer Mr. Chief Justice because --
1967.497,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3266.302,3271.923,"Well, I thought you would answer it in that way."
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,3274.251,3311.302,"If the case is properly here and if in the context in which it is here this Court can extend Hanover and state that my client should have sent a simple letter within the context in which this constitutional issue is presented and considering but that is not petitioner's argument even remotely that his argument is that the state laws which provide actual notice were not complied with it if within this context the Court can imply -- can apply Hanover then I should lose the case, yes Mr. Chief Justice."
1967.497,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3311.302,3311.903,Very well.
1967.497,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3311.903,3316.006,"Well, we would have to overrule the Encyclopedia Press case virtually, wouldn't we?"
1967.497,1,37159,n_pike_johnson_jr,,3316.006,3318.456,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, you would."
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3436.987,3438.311,May it please the Court.
1967.497,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3464.853,3467.82,"Well, there was a judgment in his favor, wasn't there?"
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3467.82,3468.854,"Yes, but he is not --"
1967.497,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3468.854,3476.722,"Doesn't Encyclopedia hold that constitutionally there's no notice of execution required if he have notice for judgment, isn't that what it holds?"
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3476.722,3479.087,It holds that there is no further notice required.
1967.497,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3479.087,3483.451,"Right, if you -- the Constitution doesn't require further notice if he have notice to the judgment."
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3483.451,3483.78,No.
1967.497,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3487.363,3491.918,"Well, I don't know what's a fair Fourteenth Amendment?"
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3491.918,3494.749,"Well, I mean no state statute."
1967.497,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3502.395,3505.036,"Well, if you're not that I must say (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3505.036,3514.294,They are saying that we have a state procedure which has added to the rights which a litigant in an Arizona Court may expect to achieve.
1967.497,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3526.394,3530.228,"Well, is your --"
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3530.228,3530.603,We have a higher (Voice Overlap) --
1967.497,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3530.603,3543.238,(Voice Overlap) Is there an equal protection argument under the Fourteenth Amendment that Arizona accords people generally all of the people for these rights that you tell us about which are --
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3543.238,3543.625,Yes.
1967.497,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3543.625,3547.721,-- more than what the constitution or otherwise require but that by denying and discriminating (Voice Overlap) --
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3547.721,3548.242,In this particular case.
1967.497,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3548.242,3553.186,"You in this case has denied you equal protection of the law under Fourteenth Amendment, is that your argument?"
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3553.186,3570.415,"Yes and when we have a higher we (Voice Overlap) everyone must follow at least within the State of Arizona that we have established a procedure to which all must adhere and with this it's been violated, her rights have been violated and this Court may take notice of it."
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3578.943,3579.867,"Well, the first time you may --"
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3579.867,3583.072,"In the event a new theory, then perhaps you are too late."
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3583.072,3612.7,"Do you agree that the first time that the point was made below was on the motion for rehearing, that is the point to which I'm referring being that the execution should be set aside for failure of the sheriff to discuss with the judgment debtor or as the judgment debtor about which prompt should be levied on first."
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3612.7,3618.458,"In the Superior Court, it was brought to the attention of the Superior Court that no notice was ever given."
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3618.458,3619.338,But did -- where is the --
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3619.338,3620.13,And they tried to argue (Voice Overlap) --
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3620.13,3623.893,Was a legal argument made or was not?
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3623.893,3625.362,Not in those precise words.
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3625.362,3632.793,"Well, when you say it was brought to the attention of the Superior Court, do you mean otherwise and by the narration and the affidavit?"
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3632.793,3645.148,"Principally by the answer itself which was filed in the action, it's part of the answer, it's part of the affidavit and reply to the motion for summary judgment, it's part of the motion for a new trial in the Superior Court, it's a very brief record."
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3651.351,3655.54,"Well, then you are contending (Voice Overlap) before it was made the trial."
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3655.54,3657.537,Sufficiently to call to the attention of the Court.
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3663.748,3671.947,I don't know what that means when you put that way without looking at the record myself again and satisfy myself.
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3705.875,3706.967,Yes.
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3706.967,3712.877,Is that your whole submission that that was the vice in this proceeding?
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3712.877,3717.193,"Not entirely, the fact that he was an officer of the court and acting under the court's seal as a special state action."
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3717.193,3720.827,"Alright, first then next that he was an officer of the court --"
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3720.827,3721.387,Yes sir.
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3721.387,3723.523,-- is there anything else?
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3723.523,3725.269,"No, basically those are (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3725.269,3734.488,(Voice Overlap) is the statute providing before the levy of execution without notice.
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3734.488,3735.216,Yes.
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3735.216,3736.635,You're not attacking that?
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3736.635,3740.245,"Yes, we are attacking the levy without notice."
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3740.245,3747.206,"No, you're not -- are you attacking the constitutionality of the statute 53 (a)?"
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3747.206,3749.346,No.
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3749.346,3760.996,"Or what you're attacking is the failure of the sheriff to follow the procedure specified in Arizona's execution statute, is that right?"
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3760.996,3766.37,"Yes, we believe anything under 53 (a) can be adequate state grounds, it's not that basic."
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3766.37,3777.582,"So, you're not attacking 53 (a), it's a failure to give notice or to notify the judgment debtor as provided in Arizona's execution statutes?"
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3777.582,3778.355,That is the heart of our case.
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3778.355,3793.277,And the second point is that that was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment because the judgment creditor was an officer of the court.
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3793.277,3797.037,"This, we feel as an added much more narrow grounds (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.497,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3797.037,3799.288,And that's your case?
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3799.288,3801.855,That is basically our case.T
1967.497,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3802.245,3804.295,May I ask you a few?
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3804.295,3804.977,Pardon me?
1967.497,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3804.977,3832.27,"Are you saying that when the state passes law which gives certain protection to the party, the Due Process Clause requires that if we decide this case, we decide it according the law, so that means that they should observe state law on all cases and not just on some, is that it?"
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3832.27,3861.083,"Well, it comes a point I suppose when the violation of a particular state is sufficient gravity to say that due process has been violated but basically yes that when the state establishes a denominator it must adhere to it however low or high the common denominator maybe and that the violation of that is for that citizen the violation the due process and which this Court may take notice and may not because the grounds may not be serious but it is a possibility and it can so act."
1967.497,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3861.083,3869.621,Have you raised the equal protection issue any place?
1967.497,2,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,3869.621,3870.911,"No, not in those terms."
1967.497,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3891.874,3895.254,"Very well, Mr. Haggerty."
