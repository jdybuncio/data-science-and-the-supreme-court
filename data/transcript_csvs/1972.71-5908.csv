1972.71-5908,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,35.593,"We'll hear arguments next in 71-5908, Chambers against Mississippi."
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,36.922,40.121,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-5908,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,226.554,234.271,"Mr. Westen, does the record show what has happened to Gable McDonald then?"
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,234.271,251.159,"Gable McDonald had a preliminary hearing, one month after he signed his written confession for justice of the peace who after a few days of deliberation, dismissed the charges against him."
1972.71-5908,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,316.841,322.715,Was there any evidence offered that McDonald ever owned a gun like this?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,322.715,336.559,"Yes, the record showed that he had purchased before the shooting a 9-shot .22-caliber pistol and that he purchased shortly after the shooting, a second .22 caliber pistol."
1972.71-5908,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,336.559,342.41,At what stage in the process of the proposed impeachment was that evidence offered?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,342.41,348.591,That was offered as part of the defendant's affirmative case.
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,495.538,497.522,Was the written confession introduced?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,497.522,498.291,"Yes, it was."
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,498.411,501.206,On what ground?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,501.206,502.228,It was introduced--
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,502.228,504.635,(Inaudible)
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,504.635,518.655,"I think if the state hadn't made a hearsay objection, it would have probably been sustained, but they did not and hearsay is only excluded on motion, on objection in Mississippi."
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,519.559,524.294,He was subjected to cross-examination on his repudiation?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,528.449,540.63,"The state interrogated him about the truth of his confession, but Chambers was denied the right to cross-examine him following the state's examination about his repudiation."
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,540.63,543.793,All (Inaudible)
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,543.793,545.467,That's right.
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.467,546.438,And --
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,546.438,547.441,He knew at that point.
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,547.441,549.008,Then introduced him?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,549.008,552.402,"That's right, and the state made no objection."
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,569.396,579.248,And -- so the Chamber said that he called him stand and said this showed him the copy (Inaudible) is this your confession?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,579.248,579.752,That's right.
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,579.752,581.632,"He had signed it, it is your signature?"
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,581.632,582.944,Yes.
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,582.944,597.165,"And the next question might have been did you also admit that you killed Liberty, do you also admit that to anybody else?"
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,597.165,602.938,"He might have asked that question, but he had very good reasons for not asking it."
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,605.602,608.925,"No, but let's assume he had asked."
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,618.946,625.48,"Certainly and I think if he had asked that question, it would have been admitted but there were reasons."
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,625.48,631.819,"And McDonald might have said, yes, I did tell so and so and I killed the Liberty."
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,631.819,637.181,He might -- but he most likely would have denied it for these reasons.
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.181,639.71,Let's assume he had denied it
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,639.71,657.177,"If he had denied it, which is what Chambers expected because McDonalds on preliminary hearing, he had already denied talking to anyone else about the shooting or having confessed to anyone else before his written confession."
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.682,677.028,"It would have been tough, he would have been in better shape than he is now --"
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,677.028,678.983,That's a question perhaps a trial strategy --
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.983,680.835,That's what this case is all about.
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,680.835,691.61,"But, I think it would have been madness to ask a witness for an answer that could not be impeached."
1972.71-5908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,711.915,731.021,"Mr. Westen, if the conclusion of the McDonald's cross-examination by the state, your client's counsel asked leave to cross-examine was denied, but then he didn't even make any effort to put any questions on what would we call redirect, I suppose."
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,737.325,741.911,There are two answers of that.
1972.71-5908,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,802.327,807.258,"Under the law of Mississippi in those conditions, if you asked a question, would he bound by the answer?"
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,807.258,810.523,"He would have been, and that is what he had been told from the outset of trial."
1972.71-5908,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,810.523,811.703,"Well, isn't that the answer?"
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,811.703,814.439,That is our answer.
1972.71-5908,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,814.439,823.996,"Your position is that he was a hostile witness inherently, and that he should have the privilege of treating him that way from the outset."
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,825.7,828.915,That's what was argued in the state court.
1972.71-5908,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,858.703,861.012,Was McDonald ever indicted?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,861.012,871.374,"No, he was not, And I should say that at the point where the justice of the peace dismissed charges against McDonald, the only evidence they had against McDonald was his sworn confession."
1972.71-5908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,879.011,882.079,Was the eyewitness called at Chambers trial?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,882.079,882.849,"Yes, he was."
1972.71-5908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,882.849,887.431,And did he testify that he had seen McDonald rather than Chamber shoot the --
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,887.431,900.211,"Yes, he did."
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.332,991.298,"Was your position that he should be able to call witness to testify as to an exculpatory confession, wholly aside from impeaching him?"
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,991.298,992.218,"That's right, that's --"
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,992.218,1005.79,"I mean, just as a general proposition even if McDonald never has been called at all, he should have been able to call the policeman and who would testify as to and out of court confession by some third party."
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1006.532,1009.206,"That is our position, but I should expand on it."
1972.71-5908,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1023.692,1032.844,Mr. Westen did you -- what you felt you should be committed to do was to produce the men to whom the all confessions were made?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1032.844,1034.204,That's right.
1972.71-5908,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1034.204,1041.005,Not some policemen to testify that Chambers had admitted to them?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1041.005,1048.759,We submit that we should have been permitted to put on the stand Sam Hardin and Berkley Turner to testify --
1972.71-5908,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1048.759,1050.815,Ones to whom alleged oral --
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1050.815,1055.65,"That's right, to recite McDonald's out-of-court confessions."
1972.71-5908,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1055.65,1055.865,Yes.
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.865,1059.162,Even though McDonald (Inaudible)
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1059.162,1079.839,"No, because we think that, that's one reason why Mississippi is incapable in this case of making a showing -- of showing a reason for withholding the confession, the presence of McDonald, renders his out-of-court confession, sufficiently reliable."
1972.71-5908,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1092.658,1099.113,"When you get to that reason, do you go so far as to ask that the old Donnelly case --"
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1099.113,1101.158,We do not think that court has to overrule Donnelly.
1972.71-5908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1133.284,1149.276,"(Inaudible)go so far as it require a predicate for the hearsay testimony as most states I believe do by first asking McDonald as long as he is there, did you ever make a confession, oral confession to Berkley Turner?"
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1149.276,1157.546,"I think that -- and that relates to Mr. Justice White's question, and I think that kind of rule would make a lot of sense."
1972.71-5908,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1191.327,1206.452,"Well, then I gather your submission is that you should have been permitted to put on Hardin and whatever the chap was and testify what McDonald have told them not for impeachment purposes but affirmatively on your defense?"
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1206.452,1208.652,"That's right, there are two arguments we made."
1972.71-5908,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1215.64,1216.485,And somebody else that --
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1216.485,1219.536,That it was not he but someone else who committed the crime.
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1237.424,1240.668,That's as long as McDonald (Inaudible)
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1240.668,1241.261,Excuse me?
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1241.261,1246.429,As long as McDonald is subjected to an examination?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1246.429,1254.589,"We think that California versus Green, and Dutton versus Evans are cumulative in this case."
1972.71-5908,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1283.959,1294.144,I have an understanding that basically this case is – 180 degrees offset from either Dutton against Evans or the Green against California.
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1317.658,1326.912,"In many ways we are -- in some ways, perhaps it's the converse of Dutton and of California versus Green, but for this reason."
1972.71-5908,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1411.824,1418.495,Questions that were asked you by Mr. Justice White?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1435.71,1462.334,"It is my feeling that where a hearsay statement is corroborated by an eyewitness, and is corroborated by the declarance on written confession, and corroborated by independent oral confessions, and is a declaration against penal interest, and is spontaneous and other than on the scene at the crime, defense of the declarant, that it is sufficiently reliable to be introduced in his favor."
1972.71-5908,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1471.009,1482.981,(Inaudible) And it is that in effect the totality of the circumstances to see whether or not the evidence could be admitted that he was inherently reliable?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1482.981,1488.969,"Well, perhaps I have mislead you Mr. Justice Powell."
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1519.615,1528.245,But this is question that's historic rule that (Inaudible)
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1528.245,1531.767,There is a hearsay rule and there is a state and --
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1531.767,1544.382,But it hasn't – the (Inaudible) hasn't the rule regularly (Inaudible) accused may not simply call somebody to testify to a third party confession.
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1544.382,1546.335,That is the rule that perhaps --
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1546.335,1549.706,It has been (Inaudible) the federal rule.
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1549.706,1563.665,"The rule in Federal Courts which has been established in Donnelly versus United States to which Mr. Justice Blackmun referred, establishes that standard, that establishes that proposition --"
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1563.665,1565.266,How about the State cases?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1565.266,1569.921,And the States are generally in agreement with Donnelly about that but I --
1972.71-5908,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.921,1578.601,Did the State every time required the demonstration other than citing (Inaudible)
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1578.601,1593.316,It's our position that the state has the burden of demonstrating a persuasive reason for preventing the accused from proving he is innocent.
1972.71-5908,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1646.411,1653.406,Why Mr. Westen is it that a totality approach as Mr. Justice Powell suggested?
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1664.645,1675.32,"If this were a case like Dutton versus Evans in which there were 19 witnesses against the accused who all pointed the finger at him, there might be some question about whether he could offer a heresy confession to prove that he didn't do it."
1972.71-5908,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1675.32,1685.373,"And I ask you again why is this as Mr. Justice Powell suggested, argument for a totality approach in this context?"
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1685.373,1689.596,I am not sure that I know what you mean by totality.
1972.71-5908,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1694.061,1701.916,"Well, what I mean is, that whether or not in the context of this particular case, he should be permitted it."
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1709.251,1735.414,"Well, the general propositions on which we rest our argument is that accused does have an affirmative right to prove he is innocent unless the state can make some showing and that's in this case, it is we submit absolutely untenable to argue that out of court statements confessions are unreliable."
1972.71-5908,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1735.414,1739.848,"But you have to make this on a constitutional basis, not on a supervisory power basis?"
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1739.848,1740.894,"Oh, that's right."
1972.71-5908,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1792.643,1798.375,"And he became a witness against in that sense when he repudiated his confession, that's your argument?"
1972.71-5908,0,38443,peter_westen,,1798.375,1807.058,--and when he denied the truth of Chamber's affirmative defense.
1972.71-5908,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1814.681,1823.942,"Mr. Hancock, either now or at sometime in your argument, would you address yourself to the situation, a hypothetical situation that I will give you now?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,1865.565,1883.645,"I believe probably under such circumstances it would be the duty of the prosecution to inform the defendant or petitioner here of any evidence that was favorable to him, and that the denial of the state to do such would be certainly considered by this Court and --"
1972.71-5908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1883.645,1895.162,Now in this case then we have -- essentially if it is not the question of what use the defense can make of that information after they discover it?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,1895.162,1898.416,That is correct.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1918.186,1921.821,(Inaudible)witness who said that they saw Chambers do the shooting?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,1921.821,1923.447,One witness testified that he --
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1923.447,1925.502,I thought you said witnesses?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,1925.502,1936.253,One witness testified that he saw Chambers when he actually pulled the trigger and he saw the wounded man flinching as his bullets hit him.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1945.659,1946.918,These were policemen?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,1946.918,1947.988,These were policemen.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1947.988,1950.51,And they arrested Chambers probably as a --
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,1950.51,1959.04,"Oh, Chambers was shot immediately thereafter by the man whom he shot. Chambers shot Aaron Liberty, who was a policeman."
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1970.2,1972.608,Was he arrested?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,1972.608,1977.902,"The sheriff, the testimony of the sheriff was to the fact that he was considered him to be under arrest."
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1977.902,1980.452,He considered him to be under arrest.
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,1982.241,1984.104,He was arraigned though --
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.104,1985.838,A year later.

1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1990.41,1994.78,Any explanation for that?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,1994.78,1997.214,"Well, Leon Chambers during this time was --"
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1997.214,2008.076,"You have a case where you have three policemen who saw the crime of murder, and it took them to get around to arraign him."
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2009.853,2015.429,"Well, I think that depends to some extent upon the physical condition of Leon Chambers at the time."
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2015.429,2018.111,"Well, when did Chambers get out of hospital?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2018.111,2018.803,Pardon sir.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2018.803,2020.425,"Well, when did he get out of hospital?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2020.425,2021.147,I did not know.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2023.502,2028.422,But you do not have any reason for why it took him a year to get around to --
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2028.422,2031.268,"No Your Honor, not based upon the record, I do not, but this question--"
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2031.268,2034.291,Did you have (Inaudible)
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2034.291,2035.004,I do not know.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2037.059,2040.676,"Well, does the record show when a warrant of arrest was issued?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2040.676,2041.493,Pardon me?
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2041.493,2044.304,Does the record show when a warrant of arrest was issued?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2044.304,2046.824,I do not believe it does.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2046.824,2048.248,I assume he was he arrested?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2048.248,2049.418,He was arrested.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2049.418,2050.37,But you do not know when?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2050.37,2056.264,He was arrested I believe within a week after he was shot.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2056.264,2057.523,Was he out on bail?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2057.523,2058.902,He was released on bail.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2058.902,2061.027,Is that in the record?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2061.027,2064.987,"I believe yes sir it is, he was released on $15,000 bail I believe."
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2064.987,2066.656,That was a week after the shooting?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2066.656,2080.214,"I am not sure when he was released, that question was not raised previous to this time."
1972.71-5908,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.695,2228.742,The argument was available for the representation (Inaudible)
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2228.742,2229.593,"Right, right."
1972.71-5908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2237.932,2242.848,Was McDonald asked to whether he had made these oral admissions to the --
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2242.848,2245.356,"No Your Honor, he was not."
1972.71-5908,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2257.235,2268.548,"As a matter of fact, cannot an argument be made that the oral confessions are much more reliable than the written one in this case?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2280.718,2282.426,I do not believe it necessarily can.
1972.71-5908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2310.936,2340.677,"That unless he claimed, unless McDonald claimed that these other three people to whom he made the oral admissions had also promised him money, would they not be those three confessions; would they not be as Justice Blackmun suggested, more cogent, more reliable than the one that he said was given for a promise of money?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2340.677,2350.853,"I do not necessarily think so, because after this great deal of time, the Gable McDonald knew that an investigation was being conducted into the trial."
1972.71-5908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2372.065,2380.728,(Inaudible) one of the buddies to whom the oral confession was made was allowed to testify?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2380.728,2387.253,He did testify not as to the confession because an objection to that was sustained upon the grounds that it was hearsay.
1972.71-5908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2401.859,2409.813,"Did not the court instruct the Jury to disregard that, that testimony?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2409.813,2414.571,I do not believe that Your Honor.
1972.71-5908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2414.571,2425.838,I still construed the records at page 73 of transcript.
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2432.369,2439.632,"I am not being mistaken, but I do not believe that they sustain an objection to his testimony that he saw --"
1972.71-5908,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2439.632,2443.517,Was the witness name Hardin?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2443.517,2450.042,"Oh, yes."

1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2467.509,2478.405,"Yes, that has to do hearsay objections on whether or not a confession was given."
1972.71-5908,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2478.405,2479.314,The oral confession.
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2479.314,2486.423,"The oral confession, this is not sustained objection to his eye-witness testimony that I saw Gable McDonald shoot Leon Chambers."

1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2492.622,2495.267,"I am not sure that it is end of appendix, it is in the trial."
1972.71-5908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2574.71,2588.515,"Under Mississippi practice Mr. Hancock, is the trial judge permitted or authorized to allow leading questions in particular questioning situations even though the witness is not an adverse witness?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2588.515,2599.775,"This is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge, but here no attempt was made at that."
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2599.775,2603.984,"How about the dissent, and judge's explanation to that?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2609.343,2616.525,"Well, as I said, there was no attempt made to cross-examine and this is as I said, there is nothing I do not --"
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2616.525,2620.493,"This is Judge of your Supreme Court, he had no problem with it."
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2620.493,2628.419,"But, maybe this was a descending opinion, but as I said, I don't think there is any magic meaning to the word cross-examination."
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2632.701,2636.664,"Well, wouldn't he be bound with answer?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2636.664,2638.778,"Well, maybe the testimony that Leon --"
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2638.778,2640.85,"Then, what is the law in Mississippi?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2644.705,2655.726,We ordinarily are bound by the answer however the answer might be such as to allow the defendant to then question.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2655.726,2658.754,The judge has already said he cannot do that.
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2660.762,2664.884,That was an after the fact opinion.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2664.884,2668.224,"But, didn't the judge said you cannot cross-examine this witness?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2668.224,2670.231,"No Your Honor, he did not in lower Court."
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2670.231,2671.694,What did he say?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2671.694,2684.325,The petitioner filed a motion and then later requested the trial court to proclaim Gable McDonald to be an adverse witness.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2713.582,2721.184,Did or did not the judge give him the right to cross-examine him as a hostile witness?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2721.184,2723.36,He did not give him --
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2723.36,2729.685,"Under those circumstances, would not he be bound by any answer that witness gave?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2729.685,2732.879,"Well, I would think that would depend upon the answer."
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2732.879,2734.269,"Well, what is law in Mississippi?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2738.746,2748.079,The law in Mississippi as is in most jurisdictions now is that you cannot impeach your own witness under ordinary circumstances.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2748.079,2751.171,"So if he had asked a question, he had been bound with answer?"
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2751.171,2758.922,"If Gable McDonald had said, well, I refuse to answer that at that point, he would become a hostile witness and he could have been cross-examine under Mississippi law."
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2758.922,2762.091,"Well, if McDonald did answer no, I did not kill him, you did."
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2766.748,2768.373,Yes.
1972.71-5908,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2768.373,2776.017,And you do not understand why he did not ask you?
1972.71-5908,1,42799,timmie_hancock,,2776.017,2784.259,"Well, I believe you have to look at the totality of the circumstances that goes to matter of the trial strategy."
1972.71-5908,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2836.873,2841.187,"Thank you Mr. Hancock and Mr. Westen, you have about one minute left."
1972.71-5908,2,38443,peter_westen,,2841.187,2856.659,"I will refer the Court to our reply brief and all of these questions concerning the failure to ask a question and the failure to lay a foundation, but I would like to say a word about it to Mr. Rehnquist, and Mr. Justice White."
1972.71-5908,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2933.5,2961.579,"Mr. Weston, turning to page 146 of your appendix, am I right in thinking that the only time during the trial proceedings that any constitutional dimension was suggested to these rulings of the trial court was in the motion to set aside the verdict where at paragraph six of that motion you say the trial of the defendant was not in accord with fundamental fairness guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of United States?"
1972.71-5908,2,38443,peter_westen,,2961.579,2971.304,"Yes, and for the above reasons, for the reasons that Chambers was unable to offer a hearsay confession to prove he was innocent, and to cross-examine McDonald."
1972.71-5908,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2971.304,2975.498,(Inaudible) had motion for the above discussion?
1972.71-5908,2,38443,peter_westen,,2975.498,2984.412,"No, but I think it's implied because the above grounds are the errors that -- are the specific errors alleged."
1972.71-5908,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2995.806,3001.068,"But these are the opinions in the Supreme Court of Mississippi, you can treat if the matter of the constitution?"
1972.71-5908,2,38443,peter_westen,,3001.068,3006.094,"I think that is right, but that is because they did not bother with them."
1972.71-5908,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3015.737,3017.271,Thank you Mr. Westen.
