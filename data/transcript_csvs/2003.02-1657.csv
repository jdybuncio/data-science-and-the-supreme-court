2003.02-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.454,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1657, Randall Scarborough v. Anthony J. Principi."
2003.02-1657,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,62.415,66.213,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1657,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,192.78,194.599,EAJA is Equal Access to Justice.
2003.02-1657,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,194.599,194.688,--Equal Access to Justice Act.
2003.02-1657,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,234.185,250.243,"Mr. Wolfman, if you're right about that it's not jurisdictional, so there should be equitable tolling, why should there be equitable... what's equitable about allowing a lawyer to overcome his carelessness?"
2003.02-1657,0,18166,brian_wolfman,,278.479,279.056,No.
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1648.159,1655.096,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1657,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1681.224,1687.623,Are there any instances in which the Government is liable for fees even if its position was substantially justified?
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1687.623,1698.564,"Yes, under section 2412(b), EAJA subjects the United States to fees on the same basis as other parties in other legislation."
2003.02-1657,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.175,1722.091,"There are also some... some other statutes besides EAJA in which the Government, when it loses, whether its position was substantially justified or not, is subject to... to fees."
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1723.372,1723.677,"Yes, if I can clarify."
2003.02-1657,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1729.976,1730.059,Right.
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1730.059,1745.086,"So in the case of 2412(b), it puts the United States on the same par as private parties, and in that sense, it's comparable to the situation that was faced in Irwin where the United States is subject to Title VII actions on the same basis as private parties."
2003.02-1657,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1745.086,1748.885,"Well, I... I think you know where I was going."
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1766.179,1768.204,"Justice Kennedy, I have two answers for that."
2003.02-1657,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1773.3,1774.181,"Well, that's the issue we're... we're talking about."
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1774.181,1776.627,--And these are conditions on the Government's waiver of sovereign immunity.
2003.02-1657,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1781.662,1783.231,"Well, that's... that's true."
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1792.89,1793.345,--That's--
2003.02-1657,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1793.345,1794.998,Clearly it has to be made.
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1808.948,1811.26,--I'd like to make two points with regard to this.
2003.02-1657,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1811.26,1811.477,Yes.
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1811.477,1813.778,"First of all, with regard to the 30-day time limit--"
2003.02-1657,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1813.778,1813.861,Right.
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1813.861,1825.667,"--this Court indicated in INS v. Jean, 496 U.S. at 160, that the 30-day requirement does apply to the allegation of no substantial justification."
2003.02-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1833.719,1834.257,"Mr. Minear, can I--"
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1834.257,1835.0,--this allegation.
2003.02-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1835.0,1837.063,--Can I ask you sort of a basic question?
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1844.948,1845.486,That is correct.
2003.02-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1845.486,1860.734,"During... if such a meeting took place 15 days after the application was filed, do you think the Government lawyer would have an ethical duty to tell the plaintiff's lawyer... say, you goofed and forgot the no-substantial-justification allegation in your... in your request?"
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1860.734,1866.663,The Government... the Government attorney might have that obligation in the course of settlement negotiations.
2003.02-1657,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.663,1867.489,What would be the--
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1867.489,1870.34,"But in adversary litigation, the United States certainly doesn't have the obligation--"
2003.02-1657,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1870.34,1874.548,--What would be the basis of settlement... of the obligation in settlement negotiations?
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1883.753,1887.801,"--Yes, that's... and I agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1657,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1906.256,1910.714,But... but in this... in this case the application did say that it was pursuant to 2412.
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1922.824,1930.254,But the United States was not on notice whether this party was contesting that the Government's position was not substantially justified.
2003.02-1657,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1930.254,1939.254,Do you take the position that there is any point in requiring that allegation to be made other than the point that was described in the earlier half of the argument?
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1954.365,1955.229,There--
2003.02-1657,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1955.229,1956.715,Is... is there any other reason for it?
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1956.715,1957.708,--There are three reasons.
2003.02-1657,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1989.182,1995.498,"Yes, but all the United States has to do, in the absence of an... of the allegation, is what it does here and say, you didn't make the allegation."
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2012.466,2019.07,--Except that the party did not comply with the condition that Congress imposed on its waiver of sovereign immunity.
2003.02-1657,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2019.07,2019.647,Mr. Minear--
2003.02-1657,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2019.647,2022.785,"--But other than that, the Government has not really been prejudiced in anyway."
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2029.638,2038.389,"Well, the Government and the courts are both prejudiced by this because it requires two additional filings that otherwise would not need to be made if the lawyer had not been careless."
2003.02-1657,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2054.324,2063.158,"Mr. Minear, the... the Federal Circuit obviously doesn't agree entirely with the position you're now saying, you have to do everything up front."
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2104.685,2107.247,"--Well, those issues are not before the Court at this time."
2003.02-1657,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2122.646,2122.851,No.
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2127.659,2133.11,"--Yes, and in that respect, the parties have... petitioner has... the petitioner has made two arguments."
2003.02-1657,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2138.227,2148.464,"Before you do that, could you finish your answer before where you said you had two points and you raised a case with regard to point one, and then I never did hear point two because a question came up."
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2150.404,2152.056,This... probably... I'm not sure if it was--
2003.02-1657,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.056,2153.005,Let's forget about it.
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2153.005,2155.771,--On... on the relation-back doctrine.
2003.02-1657,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2155.771,2160.108,You said you'd give us some reasons why this is important to the Government.
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2160.108,2174.347,"Yes, and the reasons were, first of all, our obligation to defend those conditions that Congress places on its waiver of sovereign immunity, and second, to ensure that there is efficient processing of attorney application fees."
2003.02-1657,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2235.692,2242.214,Wasn't there a relation-back doctrine that courts were applying before it was codified in 15(c)?
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2242.214,2253.731,The examples that petitioner points to are cases involving the Federal Employees Liability Act involving the injuries to interstate... to railmen who are working in interstate commerce.
2003.02-1657,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2267.932,2270.04,"You wouldn't want to generalize from FELA cases, would you?"
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2270.04,2270.904,"--No, I would not."
2003.02-1657,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2270.904,2275.984,But there was in States... some States also had a relation-back doctrine.
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2275.984,2293.074,"And the note in rule 15(c), the 1937 note to the Federal rules talks about codifications of this, but we're talking here about a situation where Congress has set a time limit and has not provided for relation-back, a case where we're dealing with sovereign immunity, where this is a charge against the Federal fisc."
2003.02-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2293.9,2301.042,"Of course, the timeliness argument is somewhat strange in this case because he filed the application prematurely, as I remember the case, didn't he?"
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2318.299,2322.014,"--Well, Your Honor, in this case there were two premature applications that were filed."
2003.02-1657,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.892,2328.264,Right.
2003.02-1657,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2328.264,2331.319,The parties then filed another premature application.
2003.02-1657,2,18166,brian_wolfman,,3401.62,3408.308,I'd like to go immediately to Justice Kennedy's question.
2003.02-1657,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3574.422,3576.196,"Thank you, Mr. Wolfman."
