1998.97-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.372,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-7164, Francois Holloway v. the United States."
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,60.122,65.608,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.314,160.404,I have a little trouble with understanding the concept of intent and conditional intent.
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,189.339,190.422,"No, Your--"
1998.97-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.422,190.705,--happening?
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,190.705,191.622,"--No, Your Honor."
1998.97-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.622,192.641,"And if not, why not?"
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,192.641,204.265,"The answer is no, Your Honor, and that's precisely why the district court improperly instructed the jury on conditional intent, because the district court realized that that would not satisfy the intent element."
1998.97-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.765,207.098,"Well, why?"
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,228.463,246.842,"--Your Honor, if we define intent as one's conscious objective, which is generally in charges how the concept is defined, the conscious objective of the man who points a gun at somebody and says, give me your keys, is not, not to cause the death or serious physical harm."
1998.97-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,250.543,250.86,"Well, but if--"
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,279.812,283.364,"--Your Honor, could they infer a conditional intent?"
1998.97-7164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,306.214,324.175,"It seems to me that your answer to Justice O'Connor should have been that the Government must have proof of a fixed intent to injure, no matter, and that given her hypothetical there was just not enough."
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,348.641,358.979,"--Well, Your Honor, the statute perhaps is difficult to prosecute if conditional intent is read into it, if I'm understanding the Court's question."
1998.97-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,375.941,377.06,"Well, wait a minute."
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,400.556,404.508,--The Government would have to prove that the defendant intended to cause the death or serious physical harm.
1998.97-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,404.508,405.158,No matter what.
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,405.158,406.124,No matter what.
1998.97-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,407.043,408.36,Whether or not he got the car.
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,408.36,409.543,--Certainly.
1998.97-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,412.062,417.447,"Well, if that was what Congress intended, they sure made a hash of this statute, didn't they, with their amendment."
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,420.232,421.584,"--Yes, I do."
1998.97-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,421.584,421.884,Yes.
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,421.884,422.55,"I do, Your Honor, and--"
1998.97-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,422.55,432.24,Don't you think there are many carjackings that occur all the time without the resulting serious injury?
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,432.24,432.723,--Yes.
1998.97-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,432.723,437.644,"And with somebody who says, well, I'll do it if I have to."
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,440.696,441.896,Yes.
1998.97-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,441.896,446.499,"But Congress didn't intend to cover those cases, in your view."
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,446.499,449.801,"Well, the... I... Your Honor--"
1998.97-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,449.801,455.019,"I mean, that's kind of a... I think Congress might be surprised with your view of what it had done."
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,455.019,463.125,"--Your Honor, I allow for the possibility that this statute doesn't have the reach that Congress intended."
1998.97-7164,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,474.75,483.32,"Isn't it, Mr. Keating, more than that, because before the amendment, when the statute just said, in possession of a gun, this conduct would have been covered, right?"
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,483.32,484.021,--Yes.
1998.97-7164,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,484.021,499.031,"So... and my understanding was that Congress was responding to carjackings that involved weapons other than guns and wanted to take out the gun part in order to broaden, not narrow the reach of the statute."
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,499.848,513.125,"That is so, Your Honor, but at the same time cries were voiced by a number of Members of Congress that by doing that they would be further diluting the already-attenuated Federal nexus of the carjacking statute."
1998.97-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,528.55,528.966,So you think--
1998.97-7164,0,33880,kevin_j_keating,,540.691,544.726,"--Your Honor, I don't think that very few would end up in Federal prosecutions."
1998.97-7164,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,552.331,555.45,"Well, yes, but that's not the way you engage in carjacking."
1998.97-7164,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1607.83,1620.887,The carjacking statute makes it a Federal crime to take a car from a person by force or intimidation with intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.
1998.97-7164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1745.285,1752.408,"Is there anything that would not be covered by your interpretation of the statute, short of the water pistol or the index finger in the pocket?"
1998.97-7164,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1752.408,1758.712,"Its intent to scare, essentially, and it is just what this defendant argued to the jury."
1998.97-7164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.712,1770.27,"I mean, suppose they hadn't put in, with intend to cause death or serious bodily harm, would there be any difference between a statute without that phrase, and your interpretation of the statute with that phrase--"
1998.97-7164,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1770.27,1771.37,Yes.
1998.97-7164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.37,1776.338,"--except the instance of the water gun and the, you know, the phony pistol?"
1998.97-7164,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1776.338,1787.796,"Well, it's the water gun, the phony pistol, or even a loaded gun if the jury is convinced, or is not convinced that he intended to use it."
1998.97-7164,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1841.264,1854.738,So one possibility is that this language was put in to remove from the statute any instance in which the offender either could not or did not intend to carry out the threat.
1998.97-7164,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1854.738,1855.488,That's correct.
1998.97-7164,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1855.488,1855.922,All right.
1998.97-7164,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1889.328,1890.261,"Well, sometimes it's--"
1998.97-7164,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1890.261,1891.677,--there's certainly a good case that that's what happened.
1998.97-7164,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1891.677,1896.331,"--I think the evidence is to the contrary, though, for two reasons."
1998.97-7164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1938.389,1942.441,"Why didn't Congress just say what it meant, if it meant what you say it meant?"
1998.97-7164,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1951.864,1952.899,--Well--
1998.97-7164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.899,1967.908,"But the language, with intent to cause death or serious bodily harm, I mean, you know, whatever Congress meant, I don't think that if I threaten someone with a gun hoping that the person will turn over the car, I don't want to kill the person."
1998.97-7164,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1983.501,1992.624,"--Well, except for the fact that there is a long tradition of using it precisely that way where the phrase is being used as an aggrevator, as it is here."
1998.97-7164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.331,2009.735,And doesn't that require the actual assault intending to hurt the person?
1998.97-7164,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2009.735,2010.785,No.
1998.97-7164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2066.322,2067.638,Not in my lexicon.
1998.97-7164,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2079.295,2085.366,"--With the qualification that I'm not sure punching you in the nose qualifies as seriously bodily harm, but with intent to--"
1998.97-7164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2085.366,2085.782,"I'll break your nose, okay."
1998.97-7164,2,33880,kevin_j_keating,,3148.99,3150.859,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1998.97-7164,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3176.807,3180.009,"But why isn't it a conditional intent, intent to commit rape if necessary?"
