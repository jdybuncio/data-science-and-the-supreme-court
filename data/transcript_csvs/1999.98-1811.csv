1999.98-1811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.272,"We'll hear argument next in No. 98-1811, Alexis Geier v. American Honda Motor Company."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,29.685,32.384,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,117.141,118.66,Where does... where does that appear?
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,118.66,122.862,--That is in... in our... the blue brief at page 10.
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,123.362,125.914,And it's... it's taken from what?
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,125.914,128.515,"--49 Federal Register 29,000."
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.515,131.135,Which is the statement of basis and purpose for the rule?
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,131.135,131.485,Yes.
1999.98-1811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,137.122,142.693,"I... I find the... the statement you just quoted a... a troubling one for the other side, I... I agree."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,182.651,185.167,"Well, I don't think she saw it that way at... at all."
1999.98-1811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,243.872,254.347,"That seems like a very great weight to put on a... a single sentence in... in a preamble, particularly when the Government takes the other position here."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,254.347,257.115,"Well, I don't put the weight solely on that sentence."
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.115,259.199,"Well, maybe you shouldn't put any weight on it."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,282.18,285.199,"Well, that is what we're arguing about today."
1999.98-1811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,308.298,313.535,"Well, what if we... what if we get away from that statement and just look at the statutes?"
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,318.522,330.247,"--Well, disregarding the statement, I still think, in terms of frustrating the policies underlying standard 208, there is no concern about frustrating the type of policies as Justice Souter was talking about."
1999.98-1811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,353.276,385.065,"Well, I wish you'd get back to my question, though, and stop speculating on what Secretary Dole was thinking and tell us what the statutes mean because I think that will be very strongly part of our necessary decision making in the case, and you can help us by focusing on what these two statutes read together mean because it's so unusual to have the subject dealt with in two separate sections rather than one."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,402.726,403.426,"--Well, I think--"
1999.98-1811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,403.426,405.045,--and how do we deal with it?
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,405.045,414.484,"--I think what we make of that is, as the United States itself has said, there is no express preemption whatsoever of common law claims by the statute."
1999.98-1811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,458.263,468.302,"Well, suppose it said that you have to install seat bags and... airbags and a State common law decision was that you're liable because you installed airbags."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,471.338,472.855,"Well, what if there were a direct conflict?"
1999.98-1811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,472.855,473.722,"Yes, yes, right."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,473.722,476.674,"And I do... it is important to point out, of course, there is no direct conflict here."
1999.98-1811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,476.674,477.024,"Yes, I understand that."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,477.657,478.124,Yes.
1999.98-1811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,478.124,481.459,"--an absolute argument, and I'm just saying I don't see how it could possibly be absolute."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,481.459,483.994,"Well, I do think it is absolute, and let... let me explain why."
1999.98-1811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,517.065,520.953,"Well, you know, you could say... I bet your opponent said exactly the same thing about this case."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,538.998,539.698,--Yes.
1999.98-1811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,539.698,548.354,"And in the imagined case is a jury does come in and the State does uphold it, and they are liable because they installed airbags."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,548.837,549.254,Yes.
1999.98-1811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,549.254,551.556,"And now, in that case, would there be preemption?"
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,551.556,553.424,"Yes, there would be preemption and it would be--"
1999.98-1811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,553.424,553.857,All right.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,557.042,568.85,"--Because Congress intended there to be preemption and there would not be the kind of direct conflict, that is, an order requiring the defendant to break Federal law, that this Court has found preempted."
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.85,571.636,I... I'm not sure I understand your... your response.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,609.844,610.161,Well--
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,610.161,612.629,--if we read that provision the way you want us to.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,612.629,614.563,--I do believe that that is what it says.
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.7,621.319,"No, but it is to accept your argument because--"
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,621.319,621.985,"No, I don't think--"
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.985,623.252,--that seems to me absurd.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,623.252,630.925,"--I don't... I don't think it is necessary, and the reason is because this case is about frustration of purposes, not a direct conflict."
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.925,643.898,"I understand, but to accept your categorical reading of that provision, if I see that that reading is going to lead to this absurd conclusion, I might look around for a different reading."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,645.184,647.217,"I agree, but I would say two things."
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,700.502,702.187,That's... that's not my hypothetical.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,711.043,718.546,"Well, as I understood your hypothetical, it was that the basis of liability was that the defendant should not have done something that Federal law required."
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.546,719.398,Required him to do.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,719.398,732.456,"Yes, and that was that one of the theories of liability permitted under the '65 act in Cipollone, that it was a failure to warn because they did what Federal law required them to do, put on these warning labels, instead of something else."
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,734.075,737.86,"No, but they... they could have put on those warning labels and put on something else as well."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,737.86,740.829,"--Well, they could have done that, but they also... one of--"
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,740.829,742.012,--necessary conflict.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,746.133,746.683,--Yes.
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.683,750.335,--you... you don't... you offer me no... no assistance.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,770.598,772.95,"Well, that... that's not my position in two respects."
1999.98-1811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,772.95,773.433,Well--
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,773.433,784.341,"First of all, I don't believe... and I don't think Congress believed... that the common law claim would actually require you to do anything other than pay money."
1999.98-1811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,796.481,800.95,--Then you must... you must think that auto manufacturers are irrational.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,802.016,802.485,Not at all.
1999.98-1811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,802.485,809.322,"--they're going to change their behavior so that they don't have to pay any more money, and that's the point at which you get to the frustration."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,809.839,810.705,"Well, if I may--"
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.705,813.174,And you could say the same thing about a State criminal law.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,821.363,822.347,"--First of all, I don't--"
1999.98-1811,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.347,823.314,It's a free choice.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,823.314,825.048,"--First of all, I don't think they're rational."
1999.98-1811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,832.504,833.02,They can multiply.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,837.139,837.908,--Yes.
1999.98-1811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,837.908,839.241,And the price goes up.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,840.943,842.56,"Well, I think it's part of their thought process."
1999.98-1811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,851.232,851.782,One--
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,851.782,852.432,--Excuse me.
1999.98-1811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,852.432,861.524,--One... one hears defense of large verdicts for plaintiffs frequently as saying this will make the manufacturer take notice and keep it safe.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,865.575,872.312,"To be clear, Congress could reasonably preempt common law claims like the type we're talking about."
1999.98-1811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,875.764,878.882,That doesn't answer my question at all what you're saying now.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,878.882,879.199,--Yes.
1999.98-1811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,888.322,902.914,"The only thing I can get out of what you're saying is the answer would be let the manufacturer pay for all airbag related accidents, whatever the cause, whatever the inconsistency, and that will put cost pressure on the manufacturer to figure out the best system."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,902.914,903.181,No.
1999.98-1811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,903.181,905.097,"Now, that... but that's... I mean, that's in your favor."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,908.235,909.718,I didn't take you as arguing against me.
1999.98-1811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,909.718,910.035,Right.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,925.178,925.711,Yes.
1999.98-1811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,925.711,930.999,Direct conflict I think we both now agree Congress preempts.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,963.553,963.953,Yes.
1999.98-1811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,963.953,966.886,But as to step one and step two--
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,966.886,967.455,"Well, I think--"
1999.98-1811,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,967.455,968.471,--you say I'm right as to step one.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,970.023,986.616,"--Well, as to step two... as to step two, I think Congress' words plainly say that, when we're talking about frustration of policies of the Secretary, regardless of what the rule is as to conflict, there there is no preemption."
1999.98-1811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1142.569,1147.555,We'd be talking about a situation in which the Secretary had done absolutely nothing.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,1165.534,1166.384,"--No, I don't think that's--"
1999.98-1811,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1166.384,1168.302,We... we can't accept that.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,1168.302,1169.702,--I don't accept that.
1999.98-1811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1389.942,1397.013,How has the regulatory scheme changed since this accident occurred?
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,1397.013,1411.672,"Well, I think the single biggest change was that in 1991 Congress amended the act to require the Secretary to install airbags in all cars as of 19... all new cars as of 1998."
1999.98-1811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1428.384,1439.358,"And under the current regime, you would say that there still could be a State common law suit because the airbag had been installed and it damaged someone."
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,1439.358,1439.892,I'm sorry.
1999.98-1811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1440.992,1460.971,"I guess under the present regulatory scheme requiring the airbags, you would still argue that a State or the District of Columbia could in its common law find negligence by virtue of the installation of the airbag, by virtue of having it because it damaged someone--"
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,1460.971,1462.038,"Well, as I--"
1999.98-1811,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1462.038,1463.507,--when it deployed.
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,1463.507,1466.709,--As... as I said... I'm sorry.
1999.98-1811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1548.427,1555.683,"Mr. Bryant, don't you recognize some tension between 1392(d) and 1397(k)?"
1999.98-1811,0,15497,arthur_h_bryant,,1555.683,1559.051,"--Yes, I do recognize the tension."
1999.98-1811,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.775,1573.81,"Very well, Mr. Bryant."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,1577.446,1584.766,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1613.435,1613.785,No.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,1617.237,1623.308,"That's... I think it's his... that was the third question I think that Justice Breyer asked, Justice Kennedy... I'm sorry... Justice Stevens."
1999.98-1811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.331,1632.599,What is the frustration?
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,1641.622,1643.322,"--Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1999.98-1811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1658.064,1663.118,So that there would be more... a greater proportion of airbags than the Secretary desired.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,1663.118,1665.034,"Both a greater... that's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.974,1684.865,"Well, the thing that puzzles me about that is that prior to the regulation going into effect, where there wasn't even arguable preemption, apparently the rate of installation of airbags was zero."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,1692.268,1692.72,Well--
1999.98-1811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1692.72,1695.672,--because we have a history of several years before 1984.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,1695.672,1696.705,"--Excuse me, Justice Stevens."
1999.98-1811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1737.847,1741.549,"So, the frustration is that the rate might be larger than 10 percent."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,1747.619,1751.505,Pushing manufacturers to go beyond that is what the frustration would be.
1999.98-1811,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1751.505,1759.344,"What was her purpose... what was her purpose then in counting the airbag one and a half as against the seatbelt, only one?"
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,1759.344,1776.203,"Because, Your Honor, again it's a very complex rulemaking, and what she was concerned about was that manufacturers, if she didn't do that, would be trying to put a larger number of passive seatbelts into a larger number of cars as opposed to airbags."
1999.98-1811,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1801.088,1810.043,"Well, it sounds like she was trying to promote putting in airbags to that extent by saying they're not all equal, I want to give a little shove."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,1810.043,1811.143,--Some airbags.
1999.98-1811,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1811.876,1823.601,But one basic part of your case that I don't understand is a tort suit doesn't set a standard the way the Secretary does.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,1843.58,1853.722,"Your Honor, the Court... this Court has said many times that, in fact, common law liability does set standards, and it said that, for example, in Cipollone."
1999.98-1811,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1857.107,1871.767,"Well, then explain to me how a particular jury verdict with respect to one particular model would then control all models that by that manufacturer and, moreover, all models by every other manufacturer."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,1871.767,1874.386,"--Because, Your Honor, for example, let's take this very case."
1999.98-1811,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1905.821,1909.892,But I'm asking you to tell me why that liability is a standard.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,1934.674,1943.696,"Well, it's certainly different from a administrative standard and different from a legislative standard in that it is one case specific standard."
1999.98-1811,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1955.318,1959.639,"Well, I'm looking at two sections of the statute that seem to be in tension."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,1974.481,1982.904,"Your Honor, I fully agree, by the way, that there in fact is no tension between section 1392(d) and 1397(k) but for a very different reason."
1999.98-1811,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2005.868,2007.269,Explain to me why it isn't.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2012.673,2016.125,--And that's because the assertion is not compliance with.
1999.98-1811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2045.409,2049.21,"Of course, because if there's preemption, you don't have to worry about compliance."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2049.21,2050.08,Right.
1999.98-1811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2050.08,2060.351,What that suggests is that the compliance provision makes no sense if we agree with you about the preemption provision.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2060.351,2061.185,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1999.98-1811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2061.954,2071.076,"Well, tell me how the compliance provision would have operation if you read the preemption provisions as including preemption of... of State common law."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2071.076,2074.295,"--It would have operation and... and we cited this case in our brief, Your Honor."
1999.98-1811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2112.418,2118.824,But that's... but that's just like saying we complied with the Federal standard by... by having doors on the car.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2130.465,2132.698,I beg to differ with Your Honor.
1999.98-1811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.651,2169.257,"Yes, it wouldn't take me a whole lot of time to... to come to that conclusion by just saying, you know, the... the provision at issue here is not whether the car should have doors."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2189.097,2190.032,"I agree, Your Honor."
1999.98-1811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.299,2194.334,I think it converts... it converts that into a meaningless provision.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2194.334,2201.071,"--Well, but... but again, the very fact we have 13 reported appellate decisions addressing that very question shows that it had meaning."
1999.98-1811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2201.071,2204.106,That plaintiffs make some... some meaningless arguments I suppose.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2204.106,2204.74,The defendants.
1999.98-1811,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2205.456,2206.475,"The defendants, yes."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2219.715,2220.549,That's correct.
1999.98-1811,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2220.549,2224.851,But other tort theories might really not interfere with the purpose and they wouldn't be.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2224.851,2225.684,Would not be preempted.
1999.98-1811,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2225.684,2233.207,"And then... and then compliance in such a case would not, in fact, excuse the tort action that wasn't preempted."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2233.207,2234.473,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1999.98-1811,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.392,2236.909,That's your... that's your point.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2236.909,2237.625,That is my point.
1999.98-1811,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.625,2238.009,"Well, very well."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2294.144,2294.944,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1811,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2300.298,2304.433,"In other words, they had... they didn't have airbags, but they did have spoolable belts?"
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2308.285,2308.918,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1811,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2311.251,2313.203,"Well, then they didn't have passive restraints."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2313.203,2319.857,"But that's not the petitioners' argument, and the reason it's not is because Ms. Geier was wearing her lap and shoulder belt."
1999.98-1811,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2331.731,2345.591,What is... what is the response that you then make to their initial point about Secretary Dole having said we're going to rely upon the tort system to help enforce this?
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2345.591,2347.024,"--I have two responses to that, Your Honor."
1999.98-1811,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2490.533,2504.208,But it makes sense because it's tied into 1392(d) which talks about standards to have the 97 provision relate to standards.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2504.208,2504.925,I agree.
1999.98-1811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2513.814,2517.7,"May I ask, just going back to the language, just... I want to be sure I understand your point."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2527.556,2528.906,"--No, Your Honor, that's not what I'm arguing."
1999.98-1811,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2572.085,2579.339,"So, are you saying that it's irrelevant that you were within the... the... that you were obeying the Federal regulations?"
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2579.339,2585.243,"It's unnecessary... it's irrelevant in the sense that it's unnecessary to ask the question, Justice Kennedy."
1999.98-1811,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2587.543,2589.361,But you cite... but you cite the statute.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2596.015,2603.62,"--Because the... the Federal regulation, Federal motor vehicle safety standard 208, is what conflicts with the asserted State cause of action."
1999.98-1811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2604.654,2611.81,"You argue that frustration itself... if you get more than 10 percent... preempts the cause of action, so you don't need an affirmative defense."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2613.793,2614.726,--That's partly correct.
1999.98-1811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2615.062,2615.528,--That's right.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2631.188,2634.057,"Or something that's on... that's not quite on point, Your Honor, but--"
1999.98-1811,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2634.057,2638.378,"If he raised a irrelevant provision, preemption would be a defense."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2644.697,2645.231,--Is not a defense.
1999.98-1811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2645.231,2654.853,"And you would agree that if the Secretary's policy were fairly read as saying that 10 percent was to be a minimum rather than a maximum, there would be no frustration."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2654.853,2664.625,"No, not at all, Your Honor, because again, even if you read it as a minimum, which it quite clearly is, by the way... the Secretary didn't say that manufacturers can't produce more than that--"
1999.98-1811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2664.625,2671.862,But I thought you agreed earlier that the exposure to tort liability just... will just increase somewhat the rate of adoption of airbags.
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2677.066,2682.17,--What is preempted is the forcing of the manufacturers to go to anything above 10 percent--
1999.98-1811,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.17,2689.074,"Well, they're not forced by the regulation, just forced by what the market forces that were in place before the regulation was adopted."
1999.98-1811,1,36950,malcolm_e_wheeler,,2689.074,2690.776,--They're forced by reality.
1999.98-1811,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2753.432,2754.516,"Thank you, Mr. Wheeler."
1999.98-1811,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2768.026,2773.578,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1811,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2914.52,2915.137,Mr. Wallace?
1999.98-1811,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2915.137,2916.286,--all of which were necessary.
1999.98-1811,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2916.286,2926.094,"Mr. Wallace, would you agree that she was building in some incentive to increase the number of airbags by counting them one and a half?"
1999.98-1811,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2926.094,2942.021,"We... we describe that, and we think accurately, in context as a reasonable incentive to ensure that airbags would be in the mix of passive restraints since she did not impose a requirement."
1999.98-1811,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3099.473,3100.842,"Mr. Wallace, can I ask you this question?"
1999.98-1811,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3131.777,3134.063,"--Well, we... we're really... we--"
1999.98-1811,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3134.063,3140.533,You did not argue that it would be a frustration of policy if they installed them in 20 percent instead of 10 percent.
1999.98-1811,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3140.533,3157.893,"--Well, the... the percentage question really has to do with the transitional nature of the rule, which we understand not to be at issue in this case because the complaint here is not that there was no passive restraint in the car."
1999.98-1811,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3167.1,3173.587,But am I correct in saying that your... the argument in your brief was the frustration would be that it would lead to 100 percent airbags?
1999.98-1811,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3173.587,3175.02,"Well, we... we tried--"
1999.98-1811,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3175.02,3176.503,And are you sticking to that argument?
1999.98-1811,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3176.503,3200.82,"--Well, it... it is... it is a variety of the... of the more basic point that it would undermine the policy determination at that time that there had to be a variety of occupant restraints available in the cars to go through this evolutionary period."
1999.98-1811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3200.82,3228.488,"Mr. Wallace, the problem I have with your implied preemption argument is... is simply that I don't... I don't feel free to find an implication of preemption when I am... when I am confronted flat in the face with a provision which says that compliance with any Federal motor vehicle safety standard issued under this subchapter does not exempt any person from liability under common law."
1999.98-1811,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3237.343,3248.468,It is... we're not saying that... that other theories of common law liability would not be available.
1999.98-1811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3257.99,3261.109,But you wouldn't... you wouldn't that provision to... to preserve that.
1999.98-1811,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3268.613,3283.706,--Even if that... even if that airbag met the standard for an airbag was what I was about to say so that otherwise meeting the... the standard for manufacturing or installing an airbag might be thought to be a defense.
1999.98-1811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3283.706,3289.959,"If there was a standard for an airbag, if... if it said the airbag has to be so many inches thick or whatnot--"
1999.98-1811,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3289.959,3292.059,But we're... we're talking about provisions--
1999.98-1811,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3292.059,3301.85,"--if there wasn't any and all... all it says is you have to have airbags, no one would have thought that... that you needed this provision to be sure that... that you could sue for a defective airbag."
1999.98-1811,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3301.85,3310.521,--But... but the Secretary's standards prescribe minimum standards for many kinds things.
1999.98-1811,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3364.941,3365.924,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1999.98-1811,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3365.924,3367.476,--regulations of the agency.
1999.98-1811,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3367.476,3370.161,"Your time has expired, Mr. Wallace."
