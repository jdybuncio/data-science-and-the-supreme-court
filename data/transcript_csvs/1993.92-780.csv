1993.92-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.649,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 92-780, National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Joseph Scheidler."
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,12.099,15.27,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1993.92-780,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,15.27,20.226,"Ms. Clayton, before you start, could I ask precisely whom you represent here?"
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,20.226,20.833,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,47.311,54.988,"So NOW, using the initials, is definitely a party to this proceeding here."
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,54.988,55.819,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,182.422,185.021,"Kidnapping is usually done for money, isn't it?"
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,185.021,188.044,"Your Honor, it sometimes is and it sometimes isn't."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,217.985,225.688,"Ms. Clayton, it isn't really the predicate acts so much that we're concerned about, as the organization which allegedly is supposed to have committed the predicate acts."
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,225.688,228.41,"Well, Your Honor, that is the alternate source that the lower court--"
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,228.41,228.67,Right.
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,230.7,231.832,"--It certainly does, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,231.832,238.367,And one of the popular proposals that's given political discussion nowadays is so-called enterprise zones.
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,248.102,253.328,"Well, as used in the enterprise zones that we have in Chicago, they relate to commercial businesses."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.496,257.608,"And free enterprise, the term ""free enterprise"" is used the same way."
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,263.784,266.814,"--Enterprise has many definitions, including that, Your Honor, that's correct."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.814,272.999,"One of... one of the meanings of ""enterprise"" at least, one of the possible meanings of ""enterprise"" does have a commercial element to it."
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,272.999,273.69,Unquestionably.
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,279.905,280.453,Define it.
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,294.905,295.503,"That's right, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.503,300.569,"--And then it lists a number of things it includes: an individual partnership, corporation, association, and so forth."
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,300.569,306.341,"And as this Court said in Turkette, that word ""includes"" means that there are no restrictions on the word ""enterprise""."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,308.392,319.058,"Well, but suppose the... suppose the word... just to make the point I'm asking you about clearer, suppose that the phrase used were not ""enterprise"" alone but ""business enterprise""."
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,319.058,321.302,"We'd have a very different situation then, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,321.302,342.764,"Yes, but... yeah, and if that were the case and you had this same what you call definition in 1961(4), suppose it read, ""business enterprise"" includes any individual partnership, corporation, association, and whatnot, would you think that to say it included all of those things would mean that it read out the business, the word ""business""?"
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,342.764,347.328,"Your Honor, I would suggest that if Congress had defined the term that way, that would have been an ambiguous definition."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.648,349.96,"Well, but that depends on whether you think enterprise--"
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,349.96,351.509,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.509,352.711,--Has a business connotation to it or not.
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,352.711,353.321,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.46,412.962,My point is that if you believe that 1961(4) alone would not eliminate the business connotation of it.
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,412.962,416.262,"Your Honor, I do not concede that business means... that enterprise means business."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.78,467.246,"Maybe it didn't want... it didn't business there because they didn't think it had to be a business, but it had to... still had to have a commercial motivation, which is what ""enterprise"" connotes."
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,467.246,468.728,"Well, Your Honor, Congress didn't say--"
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.728,470.328,"You had an antitrust claim below, didn't you?"
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,470.328,471.68,"--We did, Your Honor, and we--"
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.68,475.072,"Now, the antitrust laws don't say anything about commercial motivation either, do they?"
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,475.072,475.971,--They certainly don't.
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.802,480.696,"But do we... do we apply them against, let's say, grape boycotts--"
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,480.696,481.395,--Your--
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,481.395,488.971,"--If a group of citizens for political reasons wants to boycott grapes, that's certainly a contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade."
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,490.771,497.275,"--Your Honor, the answer to your question is no, but not because of the definition of what antitrust covers, but because of the First Amendment."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.241,505.702,A boycott's not speech.
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,507.064,511.864,"Your Honor, the antitrust laws are crystal clear that nonprofit organizations are covered."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.042,524.534,"Of course, the words ""trade or commerce"" have a business aspect to them too, don't they?"
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,524.534,525.305,"They do, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.178,639.26,Well those are some of your claims.
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,646.136,647.244,--That's correct.
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.244,655.649,--Which you would define to include acts which intimidate someone into... simply into not doing something.
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,655.649,655.99,Well--
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.99,660.043,"Extortion doesn't even mean you have to get money or property from someone, in your view."
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,660.043,661.894,"--That's right, Your Honor, on the first point at least."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,661.894,663.236,But just intimidating them into not doing something.
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,663.236,664.746,One does not have to get property.
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,673.094,674.743,You're getting it is the same as somebody else giving it up.
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,674.743,675.754,"Not always, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,676.854,678.296,"Not always, just for purposes of this statute."
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,678.296,692.194,"--In this case, Your Honor, there actually is some gain, because in many cases the clinics run by PLAN and its coconspirators actually get the business opportunities in the form of patients who they take to the... the antichoice clinics."
1993.92-780,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.194,704.803,"Well, let's say that I want to stop somebody... just to take it out of the abortion context, which tends to inflame... inflame emotions, suppose I want to get somebody to stop selling grapes and I throw pickets across the street."
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,718.862,721.413,"It's protected by the First Amendment, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,747.239,755.688,"Ms. Clayton, do we have... do we have a ruling to review on that issue, as distinguished from the one that you were just discussing with Justice Scalia?"
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,755.688,756.716,"Thank you, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-780,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,787.177,795.312,"Well, and if... if we rule as you ask us to in the question presented, that does not prevent the defendants from raising First Amendment defenses below."
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,795.312,797.933,"Your Honor, of course it doesn't."
1993.92-780,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,843.153,844.883,But those issues are not presented here.
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,844.883,845.815,"--They're not, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,846.386,859.142,"The question is on the definition of enterprise and pattern of racketeering activity and whether economic motivation is required for those, and that's it, as far what is before us to review this morning."
1993.92-780,0,23676,fay_clayton,,859.142,860.524,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,883.48,884.952,"Very well, Ms. Clayton."
1993.92-780,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,887.022,896.097,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-780,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.676,942.167,Just... but Justice Scalia just did.
1993.92-780,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,943.729,951.033,"The word ""enterprise"", Justice Stevens, is defined by statute, and it is not new to this Court."
1993.92-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.959,974.467,In an opinion by--
1993.92-780,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,974.467,976.009,--Judge Friendly.
1993.92-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,976.009,977.55,"--By Judge Friendly, and a pretty good panel."
1993.92-780,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,983.674,990.75,"They're all good judges, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1031.665,1033.767,What did Turkette say about enterprise?
1993.92-780,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1033.767,1056.673,"The Court in that case noted that the definition by Congress is very broad, and it certainly includes any entity or group of individuals associated in fact, which, the Court noted, includes any group that associates for a common purpose."
1993.92-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1117.812,1129.261,"How do you... how do you, Mr. Estrada, explain our more limited scope accorded to the Sherman Act?"
1993.92-780,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1129.261,1130.522,--Well--
1993.92-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1130.522,1134.642,Not expanding that to the limit of the meaning of its words.
1993.92-780,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1134.642,1148.561,"--Well, there is a difference in the Sherman Act, Justice Scalia, in that it really does tend to make unlawful things that in the absence of the act could be done lawfully."
1993.92-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.778,1224.012,"The Government supports the interpretation of extortion that the court below adopted as well, doesn't it?"
1993.92-780,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1224.012,1225.364,--We haven't briefed--
1993.92-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.364,1226.803,That is to say you don't have to obtain property?
1993.92-780,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1226.803,1236.01,"--We have not briefed the issue, Justice Scalia, but it... because it is not the question on which the Court granted cert. And in our view, whatever--"
1993.92-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.01,1241.554,"Well, it is... it is an issue which, if... if supported, would sustain the judgment below, isn't it?"
1993.92-780,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1241.554,1242.863,--No--
1993.92-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.863,1244.365,And therefore we could entertain it.
1993.92-780,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1244.365,1245.787,--You could entertain it.
1993.92-780,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1366.356,1400.747,"Mr. Estrada, why I'm concerned about it is that the combination of that broad interpretation of extortion, plus the interpretation of RICO that the petitioners favor here, leaves one in a situation where any... any national organization which has adherents and hangers-on who may commit a tort, hitting someone with a picket sign or trespassing upon property, by committing an unlawful act can be charged with committing extortion even though they're not trying to get money."
1993.92-780,1,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1429.215,1446.856,"--Justice Scalia, I don't think that anyone here has said anything different about the governing constitutional standards, and I don't think anyone views them any differently as the case comes to the Court."
1993.92-780,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1472.274,1473.175,"Thank you, Mr. Estrada."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1475.076,1479.647,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-780,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1527.229,1543.15,"Mr. Blakey, I assume that you're going to deal, both with respect to what you said about standing and what you said about no extortion, with our function as a court of review rather than as a court of first view."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1552.056,1555.669,"Let me answer your second question first, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1561.791,1563.633,You are quite right that it's jurisdictional.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1583.126,1587.049,"To my knowledge... Your Honor, the posture of this case changed over time."
1993.92-780,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1622.282,1635.539,"I thought that Ms. Clayton had explained, in answer to Justice Blackmun's question, the capacity in which NOW is appearing at this stage, as distinguished from its position as an antitrust claimant."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1635.539,1643.236,"Well, if it is appearing as a representative of either the... she is appearing as a representative of the two clinics."
1993.92-780,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1660.007,1661.779,Was... there was no ruling on that question.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1661.779,1662.808,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1662.808,1667.591,So it's not as though you're here after there has been a denial of certification.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1676.846,1691.008,"Yes, but even on the face of this complaint, and certainly in light of the facts set out in the RICO cases statement, NOW has no standing, neither of these clinics have standing."
1993.92-780,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1698.01,1701.012,"I appreciate that, Mr. Blakey, and I don't want to belabor this point."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1710.259,1711.741,Yes.
1993.92-780,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1819.59,1820.121,Mr. Blakey--
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1866.671,1872.564,"Your Honor, it is correct to say that the lower court dismissed this under Rule 12."
1993.92-780,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1880.241,1881.981,"Well, but do we have to do that?"
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1895.391,1899.252,If you confine yourself to the four corners of the complaint.
1993.92-780,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1899.252,1899.703,--Yeah.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1899.703,1908.588,"There's not one word about arson, kidnapping, murder, terrorism, or any of the violent acts being alleged here."
1993.92-780,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1913.06,1920.176,"But is there not... Mr. Blakey, is there not the counterpart of a bill of particulars here in the RICO statements that were made?"
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1920.176,1925.379,"--Your Honor, the RICO cases statement that was filed was filed after two motions were made."
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1981.966,1982.927,"But, Mr. Blakey."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1982.927,1985.488,"Not State extortion, not coercion, but the Hobbs Act."
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1985.488,1995.446,"But, Mr. Blakey, just looking briefly at the district court's opinion, the ground of decision both in the district court and in the court of appeals was the lack of an economic motive, as I understand it."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,1995.446,1996.635,That's correct.
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1996.635,2000.579,"And if that's correct, you win and there'd be no leave to amend and the ballgame is entirely over."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2008.854,2013.776,"Your Honor, this is after almost 5 years of discovery."
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2013.776,2014.197,It's a judgment for the district court.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2019.681,2026.385,"Whether or not they could amend is not in front of this Court, because they never made a motion to amend below."
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.385,2029.126,"Because, they were... they lost on the ground of no economic motive."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2029.126,2032.168,"Let me turn, Your Honor, if I might, to the economic motive."
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2032.168,2035.111,"I wish you would, because that's what we really granted cert to do... to consider."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2035.481,2040.113,"This statute can be summed up in two words, illicit gain."
1993.92-780,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2136.257,2153.498,"Do you agree, though, that if you look specifically at the text of 1262(a), (b), and (c), that in each of those instances it is certainly possible, consistently with those texts, for there to be an enterprise which is not itself devoted to economic gain?"
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2153.498,2154.049,That's correct.
1993.92-780,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2154.049,2154.409,Okay.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2154.409,2158.901,My point here is precisely that of Justice Cardozo in American Knife.
1993.92-780,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2197.186,2207.414,"But you're... again, I don't think you're doing this, but you're not suggesting that the only noncommercial example of an enterprise which might fit under (a), (b), or (c), would be a government."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2207.414,2208.085,"No, no."
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.085,2208.614,That is simply one--
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2208.614,2210.447,Sheerly that to respond to the Government.
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.188,2222.675,"--I don't understand your test, Mr. Blakey, and both the Government and the petitioner assert that it's... it's too confusing to work with."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2229.207,2233.26,"--Well, what I think you have to meet, Your Honor, is the language of the statute."
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2260.609,2264.75,"Well, how do I know whether it's an enterprise within the meaning of the act?"
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2264.75,2270.233,"It's within the meaning of the act, which means you must sit it in the text as drafted."
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2270.233,2270.944,Of course.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2270.944,2272.346,And what we would do--
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.346,2273.405,Tell me... yeah.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2273.405,2277.219,--What we would do in... and let's turn right to section 1962(c).
1993.92-780,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2302.757,2317.186,"Then, why don't you... why don't you go the... why don't you go the whole hog, then, and say that the... that it is an absolute requirement that the commercial enterprise in fact... that the enterprise be commercial, but you instead have an alternative definition."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2328.323,2329.592,"--Your Honor, let me explain it this way."
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2354.53,2356.59,"The Union Trust Fund would be an example, I presume."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2356.59,2357.051,"--Yes, yes."
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2357.051,2359.372,Which is certainly one of the things they were concerned with.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2359.372,2360.784,A benevolent association.
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.784,2361.145,Yeah.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2361.145,2365.716,A benevolent association may very well have a large pension fund and the mob wants to take it over.
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2394.214,2396.878,"Just a minute, Professor Blakey, let me just be sure I understand."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2400.449,2400.859,--No.
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.859,2402.241,So this is debateable.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2402.722,2403.173,No.
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2409.265,2411.979,That doesn't respond to the question Justice Scalia has raised too.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2422.995,2431.029,"--Well, if you... a careful reading of the Seventh Circuit's opinion is that it adopted the Ivic-Bagaric-Ferguson line of opinions."
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2458.879,2467.114,"The... one of the cases that troubles me if you're trying to think through this thing, say you've got a terrorist organization... because we're not just dealing with the abortion situation, but terrorism and other things."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2481.412,2481.652,Yes.
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2516.555,2518.237,Commercial is really not the right word.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2523.671,2525.351,The word I would prefer--
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.351,2526.532,It seems strange to call that a commercial activity.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2526.532,2530.204,"--Your Honor, I'm kind of stuck with the language in the cases."
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2554.539,2555.07,But then you have to give away enterprise.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2560.453,2561.164,"--Your Honor, I don't--"
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2561.164,2563.826,--Don't pull a bunch of free enterprises and a bunch of bank robbers.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2566.889,2570.031,"--Your Honor, I would prefer not to give up anything."
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2585.471,2599.7,"But what if a series of very dramatic illegal acts in support of a cause generate large contributions to the cause from third parties, would that provide the economic requirement that you're talking about?"
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2599.7,2599.93,No.
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2599.93,2602.691,Even though they're publicized and deliberately done for that purpose?
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2602.691,2603.072,No.
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.072,2606.095,Why wouldn't it be?
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2607.434,2607.855,Well--
1993.92-780,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2607.855,2612.078,--Because it would be insufficient to get you over the RICO standing?
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2612.078,2613.539,"--Well, there are two answers to it."
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2642.988,2654.955,"Well, I'm not suggesting the facts of this case are strong enough, but I was thinking of the hypothetical where they said we are going to burn down a church, or something, to demonstrate our strong feelings about this, and we hope everybody who reads about it will send in 100 to such and such an address."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2654.955,2656.117,--As you move in that--
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2656.117,2657.116,Would that qualify--
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2657.116,2659.858,--As you move in that direction... and the question is how far you take me.
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.858,2660.649,--Yeah.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2660.649,2665.384,You will make those third party donors coconspirators and aid-and-abettors.
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2668.884,2671.666,Even though they send the money in after the fact only?
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2671.666,2674.009,"Well, it's quite possible to ratify a crime."
1993.92-780,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2763.616,2773.614,"But the response to that concern was not any narrowing of this definition of enterprise which, on the face of it, is about as broad as you can get."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2784.67,2786.763,The change was not to the definition of enterprise.
1993.92-780,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2806.335,2807.995,And what was the precise modification?
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2807.995,2822.454,"They took the definition of racketeering activity, which included any crime dangerous to life, limb, or property... dangerous to life, limb, or property, which clearly would have fit this facts, and they moved it down to specific crimes."
1993.92-780,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2853.165,2853.465,"Yes, but--"
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2859.7,2861.941,"--Your Honor, this is holistically."
1993.92-780,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2864.843,2867.865,"Well, and I've been meaning to add as a footnote that murder is included."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2870.617,2889.79,"--If... when you read the legislative history closely, you see that the addition of some offenses... murder would be one, obstruction of justice would be another... was added for the instrumental role... not the direct role, but the instrumental role... role they play in economic affairs, not independent."
1993.92-780,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2889.79,2902.447,"--Why isn't it... why isn't it still the case that your... the point of your argument is that extortion should be construed narrowly so that it does not include coercion, but that is irrelevant to the question of what enterprise means."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2902.447,2905.389,"Your Honor, absolutely."
1993.92-780,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2912.604,2917.337,"No, but Congress... by the same token, Congress doesn't have to do the same thing three different ways."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2931.515,2937.421,"Your Honor, I think the... the limitation comes from the word (c)."
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.115,2958.113,"Well, I would certainly feel betrayed if I were one of the Senators who favored a broader statute and the ACLU came in with objections and I conceded well, okay, to meet your objections what we'll do is we'll narrow the crime; we'll just have certain types of crimes instead of other crimes."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2968.17,2969.142,Your Honor.
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2969.142,2970.411,"Or I've changed the meaning of the word ""enterprise""."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2970.411,2971.502,"Your Honor, this statute was--"
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2971.502,2973.002,It seems to me a deal is a deal.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2981.818,2985.531,"--Your Honor, I want to rely on all the arguments--"
1993.92-780,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2985.531,2985.892,I know you do.
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2985.892,2987.664,--And let me... let me turn to another one.
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2987.664,2996.368,"Before you leave this argument, though, you suggest that in response to the concern about the Vietnam protestors they drew up... drafted a rather narrow definition of racketeering activity."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,2996.368,2996.759,That's correct.
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2996.759,3004.804,"The narrowed definition includes over 2 pages and lists lots of crimes, some of which do not have an economic motive such as some of the obscenity crimes."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,3007.296,3008.235,"Obscenity was not in it, Your Honor, in 1970."
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3008.235,3009.136,"Well, it's in it now."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,3009.136,3013.36,"It's in it now, and maybe Congress was unwise in doing that."
1993.92-780,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3017.462,3022.897,"No, but I think it's inconsistent with the notion that they limit it in a way which definitely excluded everything except economic gain."
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,3022.897,3029.012,"Well, Your Honor, I think whatever 1970, it remains that no matter what they do when they introduce obscenity."
1993.92-780,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3118.188,3125.623,"Mr. Blakey, I've been thinking about affairs, and it... if Congress wanted to convey the meaning you suggested, wouldn't it have said business?"
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,3132.338,3134.52,"That's why, Your Honor--"
1993.92-780,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3134.52,3138.123,But wouldn't business fit much better if that's what Congress was trying to portray?
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,3138.123,3140.634,"--Your Honor, let me trace the legislative history at this point."
1993.92-780,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3177.587,3179.377,And you don't think you can have legitimate and illegitimate affairs?
1993.92-780,2,24938,g_robert_blakey,,3179.377,3180.708,--Your Honor--
1993.92-780,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3196.3,3197.021,"Thank you... thank you, Mr. Blakey."
1993.92-780,3,23676,fay_clayton,,3200.401,3205.776,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1993.92-780,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3340.733,3346.587,"Well, that may be, but I think the point he's using them for... and this statute is modeled after the treble damage actions in the antitrust laws."
1993.92-780,3,23676,fay_clayton,,3358.926,3362.238,"--But, Your Honor, it was based on the text, the phrase ""restraint of trade""."
1993.92-780,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3366.382,3367.141,It restrains trade to have a grape boycott.
1993.92-780,3,23676,fay_clayton,,3368.463,3379.229,"--Your Honor, going back almost a century, we know that when the antitrust laws were enacted, the word ""restraint of trade"" was a highly technical, highly legalistic term, and the Court had to infer what it meant."
1993.92-780,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3379.229,3382.943,"In any case, it was a limitation on what, by analogy, we would call the predicate acts, wasn't it?"
1993.92-780,3,23676,fay_clayton,,3382.943,3385.114,"I'm sorry, Justice Souter, I didn't hear your question."
1993.92-780,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3385.114,3392.208,"The limitations that Mr. Blakey was referring to are those which, by analogy, we would refer to as limitations on the predicate acts which would suffice?"
1993.92-780,3,23676,fay_clayton,,3392.208,3394.409,"It would... it would seem like that would be the limitation, but he--"
1993.92-780,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3394.409,3401.314,"It certainly would not support the argument that... that enterprise... in this case, that enterprise has to be so limited."
1993.92-780,3,23676,fay_clayton,,3401.314,3405.957,"--Well, Your Honor, the antitrust laws don't exclude nonprofit enterprises."
1993.92-780,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3418.205,3419.297,"But they're acting for commercial motives,--"
1993.92-780,3,23676,fay_clayton,,3419.297,3420.296,"--Not always, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3459.272,3460.094,--Do you agree with that decision?
1993.92-780,3,23676,fay_clayton,,3460.094,3461.295,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1993.92-780,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3476.935,3477.646,"Thank you, Ms. Clayton."
