1988.88-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.856,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-10, Harte-Hanks Communications v. Connaughton."
1988.88-10,0,34750,lee_levine,,11.322,14.491,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,70.077,74.898,Did the Sixth Circuit here say there was actual malice?
1988.88-10,0,34750,lee_levine,,74.898,78.6,It held that a jury could have found actual malice.
1988.88-10,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,78.6,80.135,And you disagree with that?
1988.88-10,0,34750,lee_levine,,80.135,90.741,We disagree with both the contention that its standard of review was limited to what the jury could have found and with the conclusion that the evidence revealed... that the evidence in the record reveals actual malice.
1988.88-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,93.36,93.76,Excuse me.
1988.88-10,0,34750,lee_levine,,114.856,116.041,"--Justice Scalia, they added--"
1988.88-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.041,117.291,"That's how I understood it, anyway."
1988.88-10,0,34750,lee_levine,,117.291,119.157,"--Justice Scalia, they added another step in there."
1988.88-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,121.757,122.475,Right.
1988.88-10,0,34750,lee_levine,,122.475,123.159,--from those facts--
1988.88-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,123.159,123.525,Right.
1988.88-10,0,34750,lee_levine,,123.525,124.709,--in favor of the jury's verdict.
1988.88-10,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.709,133.065,"But then taking all those facts and the favorable inferences, they made their own judgment, given those facts and inferences, that there was actual malice didn't they?"
1988.88-10,0,34750,lee_levine,,133.065,134.683,That is correct.
1988.88-10,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.913,168.988,"Mr. Levine, the problem I have in applying this standard is what should the Court do where credibility of witnesses is crucial?"
1988.88-10,0,34750,lee_levine,,168.988,169.34,Justice--
1988.88-10,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,169.34,178.196,What standard of appellate review should be applied to subsidiary facts when credibility is crucial?
1988.88-10,0,34750,lee_levine,,178.196,191.436,"--Justice O'Connor, as this Court held in Bose, the standard of independent review requires that courts give due regard to the ability of factfinders, be they juries or trial judges, to observe demeanor and make credibility assessments."
1988.88-10,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,192.955,193.705,"Well, what does that mean?"
1988.88-10,0,34750,lee_levine,,198.257,199.542,--With respect to purely--
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,1468.737,1471.356,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1537.965,1539.6,Including the trial judge?
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,1539.6,1541.683,--Including the trial judge.
1988.88-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1630.388,1630.872,Mr. Lloyd--
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,1630.872,1631.988,--disposes of--
1988.88-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.988,1632.84,--May I ask you just one question--
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,1632.84,1633.54,"--Yes, Justice Stephens."
1988.88-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1633.54,1634.29,--on this subjective point.
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,1652.486,1681.421,"Well, there always is in this sense, and as Justice White taught us in St. Amant, where someone claims that he acted in good faith and didn't know that something was true and published a harmful article, his professions of good faith are not likely to be very persuasive where their statement is so inherently improbable that only a reckless man would put it in circulation."
1988.88-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1719.046,1719.68,But you--
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,1719.68,1725.2,--which the petitioner's make upon this record is so inherently flawed.
1988.88-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1729.835,1738.524,--Do you view the jury verdict here as having found that the newspaper actually knew the story was false or that it acted in reckless disregard and didn't--
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,1738.524,1741.126,--I view it as in the alternative.
1988.88-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1890.591,1894.476,"--You're defending the judgment below in Topra, I guess."
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,1894.476,1900.114,--I'm defending the judgment below in Topra and the opinion of the court of appeals.
1988.88-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.845,1931.216,What about the standard that [inaudible]... how about its definition of malice?
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,1933.918,1940.691,--I think it defined the actual malice as reckless... knowledge of probable falsity or reckless disregard for the truth.
1988.88-10,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.064,1957.05,"Well, saying those words and [inaudible] used reckless disregard."
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,1957.05,1960.485,--But that is said... that demonstrates reckless disregard for the truth.
1988.88-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2157.495,2159.697,"Mr. Lloyd, could I interrupt you for just a moment?"
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,2159.697,2161.213,"--Well, I'm not going to listen to that; I will overrule it."
1988.88-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2161.213,2170.053,How do you deal with the fact that the dissenting opinion below discussed the interview with your client at great length and the majority virtually ignored it?
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,2179.775,2185.56,"Well, Justice Stephens I can't tell you why Judge Guy didn't agree with Judge Krupansky and Judge Keith."
1988.88-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2219.914,2220.58,"No, but the issue--"
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,2220.58,2221.949,--review of the all the evidence.
1988.88-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2221.949,2232.555,"--The issue isn't whether it happened, but whether those statements made by your client and transcribed provided the newspaper with a sufficient basis for... for running the story."
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,2232.555,2234.405,"Well, and Judge Guy thought they did."
1988.88-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.405,2234.855,Yeah.
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,2234.855,2238.373,And the majority thought they didn't.
1988.88-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2243.844,2250.081,"I mean, some... the promise of the Florida trip, and he admits they talked about going down to Hilton Head or Florida, and the promise of a job."
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,2258.002,2261.639,"You see, what... where Judge Guy missed the point."
1988.88-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2300.264,2300.647,"--Yes, but he--"
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,2300.647,2301.731,--hurtful thing to say.
1988.88-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2316.456,2320.341,"--Yes, but isn't it... it is true, is it note, that the interview lasted much longer than the tape?"
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,2320.341,2321.641,--That I don't know.
1988.88-10,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2321.641,2327.745,That's the impression I got that... and that the stuff that was in dispute is what happened on the tape... was not turned on.
1988.88-10,1,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,2327.745,2333.982,"Well, but you see, my client said to the Journal News people at that interview,"
1988.88-10,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2461.014,2462.047,"Thank you, Mr. Lloyd."
1988.88-10,2,34750,lee_levine,,2468.851,2470.87,I'd like just to address a couple of points.
1988.88-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.82,2522.536,What about talking to Ms. Stephens?
1988.88-10,2,34750,lee_levine,,2530.258,2535.412,"Your Honor, it is undisputed we did not talk to her and it would have been a better story if we had."
1988.88-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2539.947,2545.249,"It would have been a non-story if you had, not a better story, because she contradicted everything her sister said."
1988.88-10,2,34750,lee_levine,,2545.249,2556.79,"--Your Honor, with all due respect I think that if you read Patsy Stephens' testimony in the trial of this case, which is the best indication we have of what she would have said had she been interviewed, she does not deny."
1988.88-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.098,2572.418,That... that isn't a denial that there was an offer by--
1988.88-10,2,34750,lee_levine,,2572.418,2575.37,It is... it is a denial that she interpreted it as an offer.
1988.88-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2575.37,2575.736,--As not?
1988.88-10,2,34750,lee_levine,,2577.97,2583.207,But it... but it doesn't bear at all on the question of whether or not those statements were made--
1988.88-10,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.207,2584.309,"Well, what did... what do we do with that testimony?"
1988.88-10,2,34750,lee_levine,,2598.433,2607.121,"--Justice Scalia, on this record you take the position that Patsy Stephens testified at trial that she did not believe she was promised anything--"
1988.88-10,3,31484,john_a_lloyd_jr,,2716.201,2716.735,Okay.
1988.88-10,4,34750,lee_levine,,2716.735,2717.185,--standard that's no good.
1988.88-10,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2717.185,2717.67,Okay.
1988.88-10,4,34750,lee_levine,,2732.913,2735.099,I missed the first part of... of your--
1988.88-10,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.099,2735.499,"Well, you're--"
1988.88-10,4,34750,lee_levine,,2735.499,2735.965,--what you were--
1988.88-10,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.965,2738.384,--not sure it's false but you suspect it's false.
1988.88-10,4,34750,lee_levine,,2741.253,2751.959,"--Your Honor, in Garrison v. Louisiana, a jury instruction that said effectively that was held to be unconstitutional... that you had to have a firm enough reason to believe that it was true."
1988.88-10,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2759.214,2760.614,"Thank you, Mr. Levine."
