1972.71-1456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,32.539,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 71-1456, Salyer Land Company against Tulare Lake District."
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,33.315,37.131,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,178.468,185.685,What’s the high and the low of these two large and small voters that you mentioned on the $100?
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,185.685,192.733,"The J. G. Boswell Company, Mr. Chief Justice, owns some 61,000 acres in the district."
1972.71-1456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,232.857,236.958,Then who -- how many votes did they get under this farm?
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,236.958,241.631,"The J. G. Boswell Company gets 37,835 votes."
1972.71-1456,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,404.968,406.314,That issue is not here?
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,406.314,425.727,"No, sir. Mr. Justice Blackmun, while the district -- while insisting in the court below vigorously insisted that it wasn’t a governmental unit and are continuing to insist that in the briefs before this Court did not file a cross-appeal."
1972.71-1456,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,480.37,490.618,"Well, isn’t your opponent’s brief stand the judges below on any ground he wants to even if it was rejected in the lower court?"
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,490.618,499.523,"Well, I think my point Mr. Justice White is that the court below had to say that this is a governmental district in [Voice Overlap]."
1972.71-1456,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,499.523,504.071,"I know, but he says it isn’t. His position was rejected below."
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,504.071,505.136,"To that extent, yes sir."
1972.71-1456,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,505.136,509.872,"Yes, but can he sustain?"
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,509.872,523.205,"I wouldn’t want to foreclose him from any argument you might wish to make but I just say that it occurs to me that the governmental, the nature of district below maybe -- may have been adjudicated without appeal."
1972.71-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,694.133,697.598,We have a remedy under state law if you object to that.
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,697.598,706.492,"There is a provision that 15% of the land owners can call a special election, that election which we called in 1967."
1972.71-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,706.492,709.092,Does Salyer have that 15%?
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,709.092,710.108,No.
1972.71-1456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,738.102,746.289,"Are you telling us that that’s the reason no election is held is because anyone knowing all the facts, will know the outcome of the election?"
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,746.289,751.157,"I suspect Mr. Chief Justice, that that is true."
1972.71-1456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,771.805,773.084,We’ll resume there after lunch.
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,773.084,780.923,Thank you sir.[Noon Recess]
1972.71-1456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,780.923,788.711,You may resume Mr. Greer.
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,789.856,795.59,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.359,904.067,"What typically, what water rights would belong to the state in a district such as this so they come within the definition?"
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,904.067,915.437,"There would probably be a number of filings of the Director of Finance on the four streams going into Tulare Lake, the Kings, the Kern, the Tule, and the Kaweah Rivers."
1972.71-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,929.116,932.963,And the state in effect says that the district takes over for the state in that instance?
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,932.963,934.177,Yes.
1972.71-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1189.963,1192.626,"Well, counsel on the last case observed it lucky."
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1206.011,1217.096,"No, I say Mr. Justice Rehnquist that it indicates the governmental nature of the district and it also refused the notion that all the financing comes from the lands, that’s all I say."
1972.71-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1217.096,1224.012,"Well but the Federal Government does give up money on occasion or a loan money to non-governmental entities, doesn’t it?"
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1224.012,1237.435,"Well, if in this particular instance, a statute under which it proceeded was a statute limiting grants to governmental agencies for road repair, dam repairing and that sort of thing fallen by disaster."
1972.71-1456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.583,1626.769,What page if --
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1626.769,1632.354,Beginning at page 41 Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-1456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1632.354,1633.427,Thank you.
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1633.427,1649.059,"There is a reference to consulting Engineer Hardy who was a professor, a very eminent professor and his eminence was stipulated too in the record, a leading authority on water matters in the San Joaquin Valley who told this district in effect your about to have a major flood."
1972.71-1456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1903.68,1910.887,"Thank you Mr. Counsel, this is an important, to flush that out this will enlarge your friend’s time."
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1910.887,1913.028,"Oh, thank you sir."
1972.71-1456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1938.922,1946.974,Now that you mentioned that in an emergent terms was this wall that would come suddenly or gradual rising of the water?
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1946.974,1949.453,It would depend on whether a levee have reached.
1972.71-1456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1958.057,1959.582,Nothing gradual about it?
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1959.582,1960.054,Sir?
1972.71-1456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1960.054,1961.11,Nothing gradual about it?
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1961.11,1962.298,No sir not at all.
1972.71-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1964.645,1970.042,Is the district suable at tort in -- under California law?
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,1970.042,1977.484,There is a very complex system relating to governmental immunity in California.
1972.71-1456,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2002.195,2010.529,"Supposing any of these homes had been washed out as a result of claimed, negligence, or misconduct on the part of the directors."
1972.71-1456,0,42754,thomas_keister_greer,,2013.271,2013.99,I think yes.
1972.71-1456,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2033.965,2036.874,Thank you Mr. Greer.
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2038.918,2040.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you."
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2315.476,2323.364,"Well, do you think the district has validly hold an election under a law that said that, half of the landowners may vote and half may not?"
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2323.364,2324.324,"No, I would not think so."
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.371,2330.392,"And it has -- is that anything to do with the reinforcement cases, does it?"
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2330.392,2331.204,I don’t think so.
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2331.204,2332.713,"Or one man, one vote?"
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2332.713,2333.032,I do not --
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2333.032,2337.206,The question is whether somebody has invidiously precluded from voting?
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2337.206,2339.498,"No, I think there is a -- the preliminary question."
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.498,2341.248,Well now how about my example.
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2341.248,2342.547,"Well, can I ask the first question."
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2349.977,2352.265,I got perfectly good question.
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2355.142,2355.834,I don’t think this case is.
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.834,2356.63,"Well, no it isn’t."
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2363.566,2364.628,No.
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2364.628,2366.246,"Well, you just asked me that question."
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2366.246,2366.665,I --
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.665,2368.417,Is it a valid classification?
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2370.587,2382.205,"But there are two answers of the question and let me put to the -- the simple answer is, you look at the legislation to see if the classification is reasonable if anybody is invidiously excluded."
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2382.205,2386.724,"Alright and if it isn’t reasonable, it’s invidiously excluded."
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2386.724,2388.305,It’s a tautology if you say that.
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2388.305,2394.659,"And that so your question is, which is here as whether the vote maybe limited to landowner."
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2394.659,2399.144,That’s right but I think there is a preliminary question on the Equal Protection Clause and it’s this.
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.645,2424.137,"Well, what if the vote here was limited -- every other landowner could vote."
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2424.137,2430.228,I would think you wouldn’t have the other landowners joining in the petition to form the district.
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.421,2451.409,"Well, I suppose the -- I suppose the district could be set up in a way that it didn’t accumulate votes based on acreage?"
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2451.409,2452.483,I don’t think it could.
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.841,2468.247,But you are automatically going -- can you automatically get out if you want it?
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2468.247,2474.032,"Well, I would assume you would have petitioned to be in, in the first instance."
1972.71-1456,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2477.316,2482.251,Are you suggesting a contractual type of obligation?
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2482.251,2490.538,No but they bond together under the statute to try to accomplish water -- improving their water system but it’s a voluntary thing.
1972.71-1456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2495.1,2499.588,But an individual landowner can be involuntary included within the district?
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2499.588,2500.681,I don’t think so.
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.681,2503.809,"Well, in that case should go away then."
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2503.809,2507.088,"It’s not a matter, that’s a matter of state law I think."
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.088,2522.652,You mean if somebody petitions for a water improvement district to cover certain area that everybody within that area is not included if there is the right kind of a vote in the election.
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2522.652,2527.45,That everyone could be included but as a procedure they have the land excluded.
1972.71-1456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2527.45,2531.33,"But that’s discretionary with the board of directors of the district, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2531.33,2534.418,"Well, actually I think it’s heard by others than the board of director."
1972.71-1456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2534.418,2535.584,But you don’t have a matter.
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2551.07,2563.372,I’m sure that’s true but I think it would be unusual that some dissident landowner would be included in and certainly was every other landowner that they wouldn’t form the district.
1972.71-1456,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2572.726,2575.779,"But if it’s just voluntary landowners, you don’t need a district."
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2576.914,2579.399,"No, you wouldn’t have the power of eminent domain."
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2598.301,2599.787,You mean the landowner?
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2599.787,2601.034,"The landowners, yes."
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.025,2623.618,How about the lessees?
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2623.618,2626.062,"The lessees of course, you’re interested at."
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.732,2651.02,Oh!
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2658.865,2659.654,That’s right.
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2659.654,2661.546,"Of course, this is over then."
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2661.546,2663.128,While we thought it was over in the court below.
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2663.128,2665.014,"Yes, I know."
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2665.014,2666.279,"No, that’s right."
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2688.939,2696.606,What is the -- what’s at issue here as to -- is the voting rights are at issue here?
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2696.606,2701.469,"The challenge is, that lessees and residents, nonlandowning residents --"
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2701.469,2702.99,Both are at issue here?
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2702.99,2710.872,"Yes, lessees and residents, nonlandowning residents, qualified voters who reside in the district."
1972.71-1456,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2789.819,2791.268,It might help me.
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2807.963,2808.005,Yes.
1972.71-1456,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2808.005,2816.164,-- or up to the state to move in and do it as a public works?
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2816.164,2823.504,It -- it have to be -- the individuals will just have to agree to do it as a matter of private contract but --
1972.71-1456,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2823.504,2827.813,"In the state as a whole, it doesn’t have that much interest?"
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2827.813,2838.854,"Well, that the state has an interest in the improvement of the availability of water for irrigation purposes in California and has used lots of devices to do this."
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2863.836,2864.318,What was it?
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2865.901,2866.852,No.
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2869.869,2870.337,Yes.
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2870.337,2872.113,For the water to be used on the land.
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2872.113,2872.81,But if there was private --
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2874.132,2874.751,Yes.
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2874.751,2877.796,"Which was an interest to, with good many people I suppose?"
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2879.931,2882.65,"Well there’s nobody there but landowners, Justice White."
1972.71-1456,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2882.65,2883.786,Only 77 people.
1972.71-1456,1,40093,robert_m_newell,,2883.786,2886.51,But 66 of them live on the high ground to the west.
