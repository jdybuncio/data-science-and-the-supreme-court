1983.82-1474,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.317,"I think you may proceed whenever you are ready, Mr. Hoover."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,28.317,31.119,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,250.644,281.164,"Mr. Hoover, may I ask you, assuming, and I know you, of course, deny the allegations in the complaint, but assume that the examiners did not set the exam schedules on the basis of competence to practice law, but they wanted to set the figure so low that very few new lawyers would be admitted to protect the existing bar from the competition of too many lawyers in the community, and the Plaintiff wanted to challenge that practice, which I assume may not well happen."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,286.134,291.721,"--First, Your Honor, we very much appreciate the fact that you recognize we deny having done that."
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,291.721,293.573,But we must assume it's true.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,293.573,296.608,We must assume it's true for this case because it is a pleadings case.
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,296.608,297.858,"Right, so how does he challenge it?"
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,297.858,322.239,"How does he do that; exactly the way he did it, and exactly the way that a case, the Met-Coal case, challenged a state statute in California, that is through some other proceeding in the state courts saying, look, the state should give me a license to practice, and if the method by which I am trying to get there is improper because of a violation of the antitrust laws, then I ought to get my license."
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,355.361,357.497,Do you argue res judicata?
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,357.497,372.256,"--That is an alternate ground, Your Honor, that has been suggested for the first time in these proceedings in the brief of the amicus United States as a basis that the case could be disposed on if it were returned to the court below."
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,374.191,374.658,I see.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,374.658,377.226,"--just to give you an example of how he could do it, and in fact he did."
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,413.166,422.189,"Suppose that on his very first go-round, when he went to the Arizona Supreme Court, he did present his antitrust claim and said, I should have a license."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,422.189,423.222,"And he did, sir."
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.222,425.957,And the Arizona Supreme Court turned him down.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,453.811,456.077,"No, my argument would be different, Your Honor."
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,456.077,461.647,You would still be saying that it is not... that your action is state action.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,461.647,469.503,"In that case, we would not be dealing with a damage lawsuit that would have the chilling effect on state government activities."
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,469.503,471.188,"I understand that, but what would your argument be?"
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,471.188,474.39,That would be... That would be a very substantial difference.
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,475.207,476.107,What would your argument be?
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,476.107,481.544,"--My contention would be on the facts, in that situation, that there was no antitrust violation."
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,481.544,489.667,"You would also say, though, that the antitrust laws have nothing to do with it because we were acting as an agency of the state."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,489.667,495.888,"In the instance of what you are talking about, we would contend that we were an agency of the state absolutely."
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,500.272,508.461,"Actually, since the Arizona Supreme Court would have been turning him down, that is state action, I suppose."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,508.461,527.192,"--That is our position because they are the people who make the decisions as to whether someone is admitted or someone is not admitted, and here we are talking about something that is against the individual members of a committee appointed by the state court as state officers, and as a damage action itself."
1983.82-1474,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,612.715,621.135,"Mr. Hoover, do the bar examiner screen on the basis of anything except legal competence?"
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,621.135,622.32,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1474,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,651.773,653.123,"How does he show that, Mr. Hoover?"
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,653.123,661.295,"--Basically, he shows that simply on indicating a statement of his physical condition and statements from people as recommendations."
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.949,673.503,Do you have an interview like some states do for ethics or moral qualifications?
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,673.503,684.977,We do have interviews and hearings if something comes up in the course of the examination of the materials that are presented that leave us with pause or concern.
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.977,687.029,But you don't have an automatic interview?
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,687.029,694.933,"It is not automatic, but it is... it does occur when someone is in a situation that they are going to be denied on that basis."
1983.82-1474,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,698.921,699.554,But of course--
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,708.176,709.409,That is correct.
1983.82-1474,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,709.409,719.067,"If the applicant passes that, he may nevertheless be denied admission on one of these other factors?"
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,719.067,719.65,Yes.
1983.82-1474,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,719.65,725.221,"Age is simple, of course, he is or isn't over 21, but what about the mental one?"
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,725.221,735.927,"That is exactly Mr. Ronwin's situation, in fact, because he has subsequently taken the Arizona Bar examination on two other occasions, and ultimately on the third one he did pass the examination."
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,763.679,777.087,"Of course, as Justice Stevens asked you, though, we assume that he has been denied because... it is a pleading stage because he wasn't admitted when he took bar because you had a quota."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,777.087,778.789,That is correct.
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,781.391,792.596,"It is as though he had been denied admission because you only wanted, let's just take, for instance, 100 lawyers instead of 200 lawyers being admitted each year, and he happened to be the 101st on the list."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,796.567,799.619,"That's correct, that's the status of the pleadings as we see it."
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,799.619,802.987,Just one other question following on what Justice Brennan asked.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,802.987,803.237,Certainly.
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,803.237,812.343,Is it part of the state policy that the Arizona Supreme Court and these various people administer to limit the number of lawyers for economic reasons?
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,812.343,817.145,"That's not within the record, and as a matter of fact, that is not the case."
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,817.145,825.167,"If it is not the state policy, then how can you contend that the policy he describes is mandated by the state?"
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,825.167,837.558,"That is the impact of the policy no matter how much... If you exclude one person, and any time you deal with qualifications there is a very substantial view that you will--"
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.558,849.616,"No, but there is a very great difference between excluding electricians, because you don't want ten new ones this year, and saying, we won't let any in unless he knows the difference between getting a shock and not getting a shock."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,849.616,853.754,"--I understand, Your Honor, but my point is this."
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.581,975.883,Does the professor embrace the Boulder Television case?
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,975.883,982.804,The article by Professor Areeda was written at a time that--
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.804,983.321,Before.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,983.321,995.629,"--Boulder was then only decided by the Tenth Circuit, and before you decided it, although I contend that Boulder stands for the proposition that home rule is a neutrality in effect, a passiveness upon the state."
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.533,1018.558,Why wouldn't it be passivity if the legislature or the supreme court of your state gives you authority to do anything you want to or very broad discretion in giving exams and in recommending admission?
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1018.558,1019.327,I think that's not--
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1019.327,1022.196,You could go any way of several ways.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1022.196,1024.612,--I don't think that's passivity.
1983.82-1474,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1054.917,1057.785,"Mr. Hoover, where is there any specification on that?"
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1057.785,1059.919,Where is the specification?
1983.82-1474,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1059.919,1064.439,"On what type of exam you give, how many, or anything."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1064.439,1064.973,No.
1983.82-1474,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1064.973,1067.658,Is there anything in writing on this?
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1067.658,1073.312,"No, there is not specificity as to the type of exam to give, other than it has to be a written exam."
1983.82-1474,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1073.312,1077.747,Is there any specificity of any kind that I can look at?
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1077.747,1093.542,"No, no, Justice Marshall, there is not specificity as to say that the exam, other than the subjects that have to be on the exam or the subjects now that may be on the exam, other than those subjects, the dates or the time, that is the last Wednesday."
1983.82-1474,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1098.31,1111.77,Is there anything in the rules or the instructions that say that you cannot adopt a rule which says that we will only let every third person by?
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1111.77,1113.654,--No.
1983.82-1474,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1113.654,1115.006,There is nothing to stop you from doing that?
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1115.006,1117.841,"No, there is nothing in the rules that says, you can't do that."
1983.82-1474,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1148.527,1150.545,"Perhaps you've already answered this, Mr. Hoover."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1166.321,1167.754,No.
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1179.129,1180.429,But that is not what is alleged in the complaint.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1180.429,1181.831,"No, that is not what is alleged in the complaint."
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1181.831,1185.299,We are arguing the merits not the legal sufficiency of the complaint.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1185.299,1187.75,"You're correct, but I am trying to answer his question, Your Honor."
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1187.75,1191.369,"But you are answering it on what the evidence will show, and not what the pleading shows."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1191.369,1192.352,That is correct.
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1215.218,1223.674,"It really seems to me that you are in a position where head you win, no matter what happens you win, because is you have a quota policy, you can say that is the state policy, it is state action."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1229.144,1236.148,"Your Honor, in fact the United States in its amicus brief concedes that the state could exactly do that."
1983.82-1474,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1238.583,1239.75,The Supreme Court could expressly do it.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1239.75,1241.035,That's exactly right.
1983.82-1474,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1250.123,1281.094,"To depart from the pleading situation, on another hypothetical, I assume that a person could take the examination, get a mark of 99, and then in the later stages it would develop that he had just recently been convicted of stock fraud in violation of the Securities and Exchange Act, and you might then reject him... reject the admission on that ground, even if he had 99 on the examination."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1281.094,1284.979,"--That is absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1474,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1284.979,1285.412,But that is not this case.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1285.412,1288.748,That is not this case in terms of what is here on the pleadings.
1983.82-1474,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1295.687,1296.02,Mr. Hoover.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1296.02,1299.055,"Yes, Justice Powell."
1983.82-1474,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1299.055,1324.27,"Rule 28(a) of your bar, quoted on page 7 of your brief, provides that the committee shall examine applicants, shall recommend to this court for admission to practice applicants who are found by the committee to have the necessary qualifications, and would only, if not there--"
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1324.27,1327.889,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear the last question."
1983.82-1474,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1327.889,1334.728,"--Do you see the rule I am reading from, it is Rule 28(a)."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1334.728,1339.097,28(a).
1983.82-1474,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1339.097,1343.168,It starts on page 6 of your blue brief.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1343.168,1348.22,Yes.
1983.82-1474,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1348.22,1354.04,"Look over on page 7, the fourth line down,"
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1366.097,1367.966,That is correct.
1983.82-1474,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1367.966,1374.287,Do you construe that to mean all applicants who have the necessary qualifications as determined by your committee?
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1374.287,1380.607,"That is correct, Your Honor, and that is the discretion which the rule gives to us in terms of grading the examination."
1983.82-1474,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1380.607,1382.709,Is that the policy of the State of Arizona?
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1382.709,1386.078,"I believe that is the policy of the State of Arizona, Your Honor, yes."
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1386.078,1397.553,How can you say that you should have won this summary judgment motion.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1397.553,1399.303,It's a motion for dismissal.
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.303,1422.132,"A motion for dismissal, why should you win that, because it says that he was excluded not because he didn't have the qualifications or the requirements, but just because he was the 101st on the list, that's in his, because to restrict the numbers."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1422.132,1425.834,"The answer to the question was, is that the policy of the State of Arizona."
1983.82-1474,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.119,1439.927,"Well, then you must... How can you say that you are living up to that policy, if you concede that he was excluded because he would have made too many lawyers."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1439.927,1461.257,"--The purpose of determining whether you can have standing to bring a damage action under the antitrust laws, the question is not whether you can... whether you did or did not live up to the policy as it may be interpreted, but whether the state can or cannot create such a policy."
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1504.6,1508.654,"Then you don't... You really can't be contending that it is state policy to do that, then."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1508.654,1511.773,What I'm is that the state policy--
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.773,1516.075,"To get in the state action exception, you have say, this is our state policy to restrain competition."
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1519.26,1522.062,"--As a matter of fact, that is not our state policy."
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1524.514,1526.615,It seems to me that you have a perfect defense on the merits.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1526.615,1529.317,"I agree with you, we have a perfect defense on the merits."
1983.82-1474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1554.7,1556.885,You don't have faith in our Federal judicial system.
1983.82-1474,0,19208,charles_r_hoover,,1556.885,1561.956,I have equal faith in our state judiciary.
1983.82-1474,1,23035,edward_ronwin,,1655.584,1662.404,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-1474,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1762.354,1771.375,Do you mean to apply that proposition even it developed later that the person was not a citizen of the United States or was not 21 years of age.
1983.82-1474,1,23035,edward_ronwin,,1771.375,1772.825,"No, sir, I am not."
1983.82-1474,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1772.825,1774.927,"You've got to meet all of the qualifications, would you not?"
1983.82-1474,1,23035,edward_ronwin,,1774.927,1775.494,Yes.
1983.82-1474,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1837.801,1846.906,"In other words, Mr. Ronwin, it's your allegation that the bar examiners purposely restricted the number of lawyers allowed?"
1983.82-1474,1,23035,edward_ronwin,,1846.906,1852.894,"Your Honor, I don't... I'm not making any determination as to their intent."
1983.82-1474,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1852.894,1854.762,"I am asking, are you alleging that?"
1983.82-1474,1,23035,edward_ronwin,,1854.762,1856.945,"Yes, that they did do this, yes."
1983.82-1474,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1887.733,1891.268,What you are saying that they did... Perhaps I misunderstood you.
1983.82-1474,1,23035,edward_ronwin,,1898.105,1904.843,"I am alleging that they did do this, and I didn't make any... I don't believe I alleged whether it was purposeful or not."
1983.82-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.817,1922.906,I take it you do allege that in advance they had some idea about how many they wanted to admit.
1983.82-1474,1,23035,edward_ronwin,,1922.906,1929.643,That automatically came out when they picked the raw score equal to 70.
1983.82-1474,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1958.162,1968.268,In other words the number... Are you alleging that the number who came out with the 70 was just coincidentally the number that they decided that year to admit?
1983.82-1474,1,23035,edward_ronwin,,1968.268,1981.778,"Yes, I think, when they picked the raw score, they themselves admit in their reply brief, they were automatically picking the numbers that were to be admitted."
1983.82-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.578,1985.58,"They must have been doing it knowingly, then."
1983.82-1474,1,23035,edward_ronwin,,1985.58,1989.599,"I don't want to make that determination at this point, because it's a--"
1983.82-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1989.599,1991.051,How can you win your case without that?
1983.82-1474,1,23035,edward_ronwin,,1991.051,1998.038,--I know they deliberately graded the way they did.
1983.82-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.073,2231.923,"Mr. Ronwin, are you admitted anywhere to practice?"
1983.82-1474,1,23035,edward_ronwin,,2231.923,2232.706,"--Yes, in Iowa."
1983.82-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.706,2233.556,In Iowa.
1983.82-1474,1,23035,edward_ronwin,,2233.556,2234.522,Yes.
1983.82-1474,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.522,2237.658,"And you want to move to Arizona, or you have moved to Arizona?"
1983.82-1474,1,23035,edward_ronwin,,2237.658,2241.443,"No, I just feel... Well, I do have some people I know down there."
1983.82-1474,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2444.743,2470.876,Mr. Wallace.
1983.82-1474,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2470.876,2477.03,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-1474,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2951.772,2957.159,"Mr. Wallace, could I put a hypothetical to you, I'm sure you have thought about it."
1983.82-1474,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2957.159,2959.128,What about a state law school.
1983.82-1474,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2959.128,2968.384,"It is common knowledge, of course, that law schools establish scores below which one does not pass."
1983.82-1474,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2981.191,2992.932,Only if there could be a showing that there was no reasonable objective basis on which the restrictions that they--
1983.82-1474,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2992.932,2995.182,"That hasn't been shown in this case, has it?"
1983.82-1474,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2995.182,3000.019,"--No, but that is the allegation in the complaint which we have to assume is true."
1983.82-1474,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3000.019,3006.34,But every law school would be subjected to suit if a complaint like this were filed against it... every state law school?
1983.82-1474,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3006.34,3009.625,It's not inconceivable.
1983.82-1474,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3045.965,3064.628,"Would it be inappropriate for a state law school to decided, as I think some have, that it wishes to have a higher quality of students and require a higher grade of performance before it gives the accolade of a degree?"
1983.82-1474,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3064.628,3069.063,I rather doubt it.
1983.82-1474,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3107.355,3123.15,"Many states, I think, still admit people to practice who may not have graduated from a law school, but other states do not, and law firms, certainly the law firms I am familiar with are not going to hire someone who failed to graduate from an accredited law school."
1983.82-1474,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3123.15,3126.952,They don't have to have graduated from that particular law school.
1983.82-1474,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3126.952,3127.502,True.
1983.82-1474,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3127.502,3131.071,There is not the same opportunity to--
1983.82-1474,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3131.071,3134.957,You have to find one that has a low standard of quality.
1983.82-1474,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3134.957,3141.444,--There is not the same opportunity to restrain competition that is involved here.
1983.82-1474,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3414.187,3420.108,Mr. Hoover.
1983.82-1474,3,19208,charles_r_hoover,,3420.108,3423.727,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-1474,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3489.002,3492.454,Why didn't you tell him before?
1983.82-1474,3,19208,charles_r_hoover,,3492.454,3496.258,"Why didn't we tell him before, because he didn't pass before."
1983.82-1474,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3496.258,3500.71,Why has he passed now and he didn't pass before?
1983.82-1474,3,19208,charles_r_hoover,,3500.71,3504.614,"He has taken the exam three times, Your Honor, and he passed it on the third attempt."
