2018.17-1606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.36,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1606, Smith versus Berryhill. Mr. Kimberly."
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,6.36,19.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Appeals Council's decision in this case dismissing Petitioner's request for review as untimely was a final decision on his request for benefits."
2018.17-1606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,98.4,110.04,"What about ""after a hearing""? Those words also, ""final decision after a hearing""? There's no -- as I understand it, there are never hearings before the Appeals Council."
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,110.04,138.24,"There is never a hearing before the Appeals Council, Your Honor, and that's true whether the Appeals Council grants review, denies review, or dismisses. Our understanding of the words ""after a hearing"" are that they embody a exhaustion requirement and that the best reading of the word ""hearing"" in Section 405(g) is to give it the same meaning that it has in Section 405(b)(1), which is a hearing before an administrative law judge."
2018.17-1606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,164.64,167.96,"Well, it's not ""take his word for it."" It's that there's no judicial review."
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,178.96,187.16,"Well, the -- the legislature -- I think that would be a departure from this Court's cases indicating that there's a strong presumption in favor of judicial review."
2018.17-1606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,187.64,204.72,"Well, on that, yes, there's normally a presumption, but surely here the presumption is at least out of the picture, if not overturned, because you have a situation where Congress in general said no review under 405(h). It's not the typical case that you get review in this situation."
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,207.12,210.56,"I -- I don't think that's the right way of looking at 405(h), Your Honor."
2018.17-1606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,286.44,300.2,It -- it seems to me -- may I go back to my question? I'm trying to see the difference between you and the government or trying to understand it. The government's position appears fairly straightforward to me.
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,334.12,334.72,Our -- our view --
2018.17-1606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,334.72,338.44,-- the merits of your -- your appeal was right?
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,338.44,354.72,"I -- we accept that if the government does not waive the question of exhaustion of administrative remedies, that the threshold issue has to be judicial review of the Appeals Council's determination on untimeliness in particular. But for --"
2018.17-1606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,354.72,365.4,"And so -- and so assume that we were to find that the court was wrong on that, but if we say the court was right, nobody goes any further, correct?"
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,365.4,368.24,On -- on the merits of the Appeals Council's determination?
2018.17-1606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,368.24,368.32,Right.
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,370.76,371.36,I think that --
2018.17-1606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,371.36,373.32,"-- it was untimely, that ends the matter?"
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,373.32,374.36,"I -- that's right, Your Honor."
2018.17-1606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,374.64,375.24,All right.
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,386.4,386.68,I --
2018.17-1606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,386.68,391.12,-- of the substance of whether what you argued was right on the merits?
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,391.12,400.28,"I think looking at the fourth sentence of 405(g), it would be in the district court's discretion to reach the merits after overruling the Appeals Council on that question."
2018.17-1606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,400.28,409.76,"How -- how to -- skipping over the Appeals Council, when the regime that's set up is after the ALJ, you go to the Appeals Council."
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,427.24,435.0,Do you mean the Appeals Council or -- the ALJ has determined the merits in any case in which the question presented here arises.
2018.17-1606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,441.44,443.48,"Oh, what I mean -- I meant -- I misspoke."
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,444.84,445.24,Right.
2018.17-1606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,445.24,464.0,"You're right, the ALJ has spoken, but the next one in line under the agency progression would be the Appeals Council. You are urging that we skip over the Appeals Council and go back to consider the merits of the ALJ's decision."
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,464.0,469.08,"Well, I -- I -- I think what we're urging is that it would be in the district court's discretion."
2018.17-1606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,599.6,606.24,But your -- your -- your clear statement is simply the reiteration of your presumption of reviewability point?
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,606.24,607.28,That's right.
2018.17-1606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,637.96,648.48,So this is a sort of strange case because it's not that Congress has chosen to divest the courts of total review.
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,677.12,684.16,"Well, I don't think that the agency can dictate to this Court the answer to the question whether there is judicial review. The agency --"
2018.17-1606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,684.16,684.88,Exactly.
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,687.04,697.08,"Well, I -- I -- and our view on that score is the agency of course has the authority to issue the rules and regulations that it deems necessary for a fair and efficient resolution of the claims before it."
2018.17-1606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,697.08,698.04,Without question.
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,698.04,700.32,It -- it has the authority to say when it's done.
2018.17-1606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,709.28,709.52,All right.
2018.17-1606,0,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,709.52,710.16,Thank you.
2018.17-1606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,713.4,724.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Huston."
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,724.08,735.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Social Security Appeals Council dismissal order in this case was a final decision because it marked the agency's last word on Petitioner's application for disability."
2018.17-1606,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,735.16,747.16,"Mr. Huston, if you believe that, is the government instructing its line attorneys to waive exhaustion of remedies in all appeals from timeliness demands?"
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,747.16,770.28,"Yes, during the pendency of this -- of -- until this Court rules in this case, we are, Your Honor, as we described in our brief, in our opening brief. We are no longer notifying claimants who receive an untimely dismissal -- a dismissal for untimeliness from the Appeals Council that they cannot seek judicial review, and where the cases are going to litigation, the Department of Justice is no longer invoking that -- that rule."
2018.17-1606,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,770.28,778.6,"So why don't you just continue doing that irrespective of what we do? Should we have granted, should we have just dug in this case?"
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,778.6,787.2,"Well, Your Honor, there -- there is a entrenched, long-standing division among the circuits on the question whether the existing regulation can be --"
2018.17-1606,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,787.2,790.32,You've mooted the -- you've mooted the split --
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,790.32,791.64,Well --
2018.17-1606,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,791.64,792.72,-- with your action.
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,792.72,808.28,"Your Honor, again, the -- the court granted the petition in order to resolve the disagreement among the courts of appeals on the question whether the agency's regulation, which is published through notice and comment rule-making, is a reasonable interpretation of the statute. Now we believe --"
2018.17-1606,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,808.28,812.08,"You haven't -- haven't mooted the case, have you?"
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,812.08,812.12,No.
2018.17-1606,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,814.24,816.04,"Mr. Smith is still a loser, right?"
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,816.04,817.6,"Absolutely, Your Honor, that's correct."
2018.17-1606,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,818.84,823.24,"Well, you know, of course, he lost. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,823.24,824.48,He -- he lost.
2018.17-1606,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,863.52,863.72,Now your view --
2018.17-1606,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,863.72,865.56,The government's -- go ahead.
2018.17-1606,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,865.56,872.68,"Your view is simply that requirement made after a hearing is purely chronological, doesn't have anything to do with the basis of finality at all?"
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,872.68,885.08,"Well, I think I would say two things about that, Mr. Chief Justice. The first is that it is chronological in the sense that there -- there is a reference to a hearing in Section 405(b)(1), 405(h), as Your Honor mentioned, and in 405(g)."
2018.17-1606,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,952.96,975.04,"Mr. Huston, if I could just understand your position correctly, suppose that before the ALJ hearing happened, there was a filing that was not timely, so let's say that the person had not timely filed a motion for reconsideration. What would happen then according to the government?"
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,975.04,991.96,So there's one thing that I think is clear and one thing that -- that is a little bit more difficult. The clear thing is that the -- the claimant in that case would absolutely be required to continue to pursue the administrative process to essentially appeal up the chain the question of timeliness.
2018.17-1606,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,998.64,998.88,Okay.
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,999.12,999.28,Yeah.
2018.17-1606,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,999.28,1000.2,But let's say he did that.
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1000.2,1000.4,Right.
2018.17-1606,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1000.4,1005.16,But in none of these steps is -- is he ever granted a hearing --
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1005.16,1005.44,Right.
2018.17-1606,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1005.44,1010.04,-- because nobody needs a hearing to decide whether your filing was timely or not.
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1010.6,1020.6,So I think that's a -- a more difficult case than this one that the Court doesn't have to resolve today. I think the right way to think about the problem is probably this Court's decision in Salfi.
2018.17-1606,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1038.52,1041.56,"I mean, Salfi is a constitutional avoidance case, isn't it?"
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1041.56,1042.44,"In part, Your Honor."
2018.17-1606,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1073.24,1077.92,"And that -- that does seem to read out the ""made after a hearing"" from the statute."
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1077.92,1085.2,"So, Your Honor, again, I think that the reason why ""after a hearing"" is in 405(g) is because it's also in 405(h) and it's in 405(b)(1)."
2018.17-1606,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1119.0,1138.64,"Are you -- are you not agreeing with counsel, who told us that ""after a hearing"" refers only to the ALJ, so we don't have to worry about the appeals court -- the Appeals Council never holding hearings because the hearing that counts is the one before the ALJ?"
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1138.64,1140.72,"Your Honor, we agree with that as a basic proposition."
2018.17-1606,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1215.16,1220.56,"You -- you portray this as a straightforward question of statutory interpretation, correct?"
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1220.56,1221.0,"That's right, Your Honor."
2018.17-1606,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1221.0,1224.28,But the government's been on the opposite side of this for a long time.
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1226.52,1230.48,"Your Honor, we take the text of the statute very seriously."
2018.17-1606,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1255.52,1263.24,"There is -- there is an argument on the other side that -- that the -- look, you read the statute, it has to be an individual."
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1316.32,1337.6,"I think it's inconsistent with the Court's decisions in Salfi, in Eldridge, and in City of New York, all of which have said that the way to read this statute, 405(g), is as a waiveable exhaustion of remedies requirement. And in all three cases, the Court authorized judicial review of a question that had not been before the ALJ as part of the disability proceeding."
2018.17-1606,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1470.56,1475.0,So -- so there you're not so focused on the text?
2018.17-1606,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1475.0,1530.48,"No, Your Honor, I think the Court as -- the Court as a general matter has the authority in a case to affirm, modify, or reverse a decision, but the principle of Chenery is that it would be an abuse of that discretion to simply skip over the administrative process and substitute a decision that Congress has assigned to the agency for a decision made by a court. In a -- in a more ordinary case, where the entire administrative process is borne out and the appeals -- the agency has no more work to do, it would be appropriate for a court potentially to affirm, modify -- or modify the decision, but in this case where the -- the -- the principle of Chenery is that the agency's decision has to be judged on the rationale that the agency gave. And so, for all those reasons, we would urge the Court to hold that judicial review is authorized in this case, but to make clear that it must be limited only to the rationale that the agency gave for its decision. Thank you."
2018.17-1606,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1530.48,1534.2,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gupta."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,1534.2,1621.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The way that Section 405(g) has successfully cabined judicial review for eight decades for the more than a dozen massive claims processes to which it now applies is to limit judicial review not just to any final agency action but to a particular kind of action. Each of the words, a final decision of the Commissioner made after a hearing, and especially those last four words, needs to be read together, rather than in isolation, because each word qualifies and modifies the kind of action in question. In SSI cases like this one under Title XVI of the Social Security Act, Section 405(g) guarantees judicial review only for disputes over the eligibility or the amount of welfare benefits, the matters on which the Social Security Act itself requires a hearing and a final determination, not on procedures afforded under the agency's regulations. So the key words to start with, I think, are the ones that the Chief Justice, Justice Kagan, and Justice Breyer have all asked about, which are ""after a hearing."" And I think that the parties' interpretation comes perilously close to reading -- either reading the words out of the statute or reading them so that there isn't really any plausible relationship between the decision and the -- and the ""after a hearing"" requirement. And I think, actually, Congress chose those words carefully and they meant there to be a relationship."
2018.17-1606,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1621.16,1625.72,"Before we go into ""after a hearing,"" final decision."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,1667.08,1671.0,"Well, as I said, I don't think those words can be read in isolation, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.17-1606,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1719.68,1725.56,"Mr. Gupta, that -- that's a somewhat awkward way of putting it, in my mind."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,1725.56,1725.96,Well --
2018.17-1606,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1725.96,1739.2,"Certainly, the agency has the full power under the Act to say what steps the individual has to take to exhaust their process."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,1822.44,1831.96,"Okay, so a couple of responses, Justice Sotomayor. First, the -- the analogy to the -- the way cases get here in the state court system, I'd love to take credit for that analogy."
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1955.68,1963.48,"Mr. Gupta, I -- I appreciate your heroic efforts there with that argument and -- and -- and your appointment to the Court."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,1966.2,1967.08,Thank you.
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1967.08,1974.52,"But, on that, Judge Friendly also admitted his reading was -- what did -- the tyranny of literalism, I think is what he complained about."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,1974.52,1975.12,Right.
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1975.12,1978.84,So you -- you argue that we should pay close attention to the statute.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,1991.52,1994.28,Let -- let me take you then to the text.
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1995.04,2002.08,"So -- so -- so -- so, I mean, an argument from literalism seems to me it might have to live with the tyranny of literalism, Mr. Gupta."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2002.08,2002.44,Sure.
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2143.84,2153.44,"Mr. Gupta, I hate to interrupt, but I understand you -- your basic argument boils down to this, that no hearing was required here under the various terms of the statute."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2153.44,2154.64,That's right.
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2154.64,2154.92,Okay.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2174.88,2175.72,Right.
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2175.72,2178.96,It doesn't say this particular kind of hearing to which he is entitled.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2179.96,2180.4,Right.
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2180.4,2186.24,Maybe -- maybe one given -- imagine that -- the executive branch giving a hearing as a matter of grace.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2186.24,2186.44,Right.
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2187.08,2188.24,Okay? So what about that?
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2188.24,2194.12,"Well, I think, Justice Gorsuch, that's precisely the argument that this Court rejected in Califano versus Sanders."
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2194.12,2199.24,"Well, if I don't read Sanders -- I -- I -- I -- I -- I have parsed Sanders."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2200.48,2201.08,Right.
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2201.08,2210.32,"And it is rather cryptic on this score, and it doesn't directly adopt Judge Friendly's concern about the tyranny of literalism."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2216.56,2216.84,Okay.
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2216.84,2219.12,-- which you've otherwise argued we should attend to carefully?
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2219.12,2219.36,Sure.
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2249.56,2251.56,"Last question and I'll stop, I promise."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2251.56,2251.88,Sure.
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2251.88,2254.44,I promise. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2254.44,2262.44,You'd agree that -- that the Social Security Administration could grant a hearing that it is not statutorily compelled to give?
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2262.44,2262.96,Absolutely.
2018.17-1606,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2262.96,2263.4,All right.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2263.4,2264.04,Absolutely.
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2276.24,2279.0,"I know, but there was that kind of hearing here."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2279.0,2279.6,"No, there wasn't."
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2279.6,2283.36,There wasn't? There was no hearing on whether he's entitled to benefits or not?
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2283.36,2285.64,No -- there was a hearing on -- on the question of benefits.
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2285.64,2285.64,Yeah.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2285.64,2287.84,But that's not the matter on which --
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2287.84,2288.92,"Well, that's different."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2289.16,2290.08,-- Mr. Smith is seeking judicial review.
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.56,2292.32,"I'm sorry, there was a hearing."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2292.32,2293.08,So -- so now I --
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2293.08,2296.8,There was a hearing of the kind set forth in paragraph (1).
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2296.8,2297.8,Right.
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2297.8,2299.48,And then there was a final decision.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2312.8,2313.2,Yes.
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2313.2,2313.8,Okay.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2434.12,2434.88,I will say --
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2434.88,2436.72,That's not a tyranny question.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2436.72,2437.32,Yeah.
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2437.32,2441.32,"That's a purposive, consequential --"
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2441.32,2442.32,Right.
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2442.32,2448.72,-- and basic question for those who don't want to get bogged down in the weeds.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2448.72,2449.08,Okay.
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2471.12,2472.52,"Yes, I told you what it had in mind."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2472.52,2472.88,Congress -- no --
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2472.88,2477.16,"It had in mind making sure there's a hearing, which means we weed out the bad ones."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2477.16,2477.4,Right.
2018.17-1606,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2543.2,2549.48,"What do you say about the application and the presumption of review, which is one of the predicates to the question?"
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2549.48,2550.32,Right.
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2602.92,2606.2,"But what does the link is the word ""after""."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2606.2,2607.4,So --
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2607.4,2608.32,It was after here.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2608.32,2608.68,Right.
2018.17-1606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2610.48,2616.76,"And, therefore, the baddies were in doubt, there was a hearing. And now we just have a different reason."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2629.2,2632.04,So that was true in Califano versus Sanders as well.
2018.17-1606,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2667.72,2675.44,"But, Mr. Gupta, on your theory, doesn't that mean that merits decisions of the Appeals Council would not be reviewable?"
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2675.44,2676.04,I don't think so.
2018.17-1606,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2721.0,2727.2,But it's so out of sync with the normal understanding of a dismissal on procedural grounds.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2742.0,2743.52,Right.
2018.17-1606,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2806.6,2812.92,"Well, the judiciary adds something when the Appeals Council's wrong in how it enforces its procedural rules."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2812.92,2813.36,Right.
2018.17-1606,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2815.68,2815.76,Yeah.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2817.32,2817.68,That's right.
2018.17-1606,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2830.8,2862.2,"Well, on -- sorry to interrupt -- on the floodgates, but if that's all you're viewing, the flip side of my prior question, if that's all you're reviewing, that's not going to be overturned very often. There probably won't be the floodgates because, presumably, the Appeals Council is correctly applying its timeliness rules and other procedural rules in most cases. So that's at least what the Solicitor General suggests, that the floodgates concern is not -- not a problem because of the narrowness of the review."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2862.2,2868.28,"Well, in all of the previous cases where this regime has come up, the Solicitor General's office has actually stressed the floodgates concerns."
2018.17-1606,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2868.28,2868.36,Yes.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2868.36,2870.16,And I think -- I think that's important.
2018.17-1606,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2870.16,2883.64,"What about -- what about the -- the practical experience? We're told in the circuit that applies the -- yes, this is a reviewable final decision, there have been no floods."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2883.64,2900.08,"So I think a couple of points on that, Justice Ginsburg. First of all, that's one circuit. It's very different when this Court says it. That's one system, the Social Security system. And even in that circuit, first of all, it's difficult to tell with Social Security cases because they're largely sealed. But we've looked at them."
2018.17-1606,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2967.2,2971.84,"Does it -- does it feel a little strange, Mr. Gupta, to be making this argument when the Solicitor General is not?"
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2971.84,2972.84,It is. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2972.84,2973.24,But I --
2018.17-1606,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2973.24,2974.96,"You know, I mean, one is tempted --"
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2974.96,2976.44,-- suppose that's why I'm here.
2018.17-1606,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2976.44,2979.52,"-- to say, if they don't care, why should anybody else?"
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2979.52,2990.28,"Well, I think it's a good question, Justice Kagan, and I think one reason is that Congress cared about designing a scheme in this way, with limited judicial review, and I think the Court should care because I think the --"
2018.17-1606,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2990.28,2991.24,But why should we --
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2991.24,2992.8,-- the federal judiciary has an institutional interest.
2018.17-1606,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2992.8,2999.08,"Yeah, but, as an institution, shouldn't we be worried when we're being kicked out of review?"
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,2999.08,2999.68,"No, no."
2018.17-1606,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2999.68,3011.36,Meaning I -- I -- I -- I worry about having no avenue for supplicants to ensure that an administrative process is fair to them.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,3011.36,3011.8,Right.
2018.17-1606,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3011.8,3024.4,"And -- and if you got a final decision saying no after a hearing's been given to you, it should -- as Justice Breyer said, shouldn't you have that one last crack at the apple?"
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,3024.4,3028.92,"Well, what I'm defending is the way that the process has worked since 1939."
2018.17-1606,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3043.64,3043.88,And -- and --
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,3043.88,3045.08,-- suggestion that the regime is broken.
2018.17-1606,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3045.08,3048.84,"-- the SG tells us, not you, that it's not that bad."
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,3049.92,3052.12,"Well, I --"
2018.17-1606,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3052.12,3054.4,-- I go back to Justice Kagan's point.
2018.17-1606,2,20895,deepak_gupta,,3054.4,3054.6,Right.
2018.17-1606,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3135.8,3140.24,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kimberly, three minutes."
2018.17-1606,3,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3140.24,3145.28,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'll -- I'll make just a few brief points."
2018.17-1606,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3277.56,3285.32,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gupta, this Court appointed you to brief and argue this case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment below."
