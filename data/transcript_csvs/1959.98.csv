1959.98,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,57.523,"Number 98, Union Pacific Railroad Company, Appellant, versus United States."
1959.98,0,22089,elmer_b_collins,,68.449,70.881,May it please the Court.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1587.563,1594.971,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1696.677,1699.58,"Let me ask you, as discussed in the outset, Mr. Laughlin."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1722.033,1729.979,"Yes, insofar as we claim that the practice is violative of both the Interstate Commerce Act and the Elkins Act."
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1729.979,1734.133,So the Elkins Act must be a departure from the public tariff.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1734.133,1734.825,"Well, the --"
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1734.825,1751.109,"And Mr. Collins is right that -- well, I suppose I found a theory that -- that although -- although this -- what the service they gave need not be in the -- in the tariff, it -- it's an (Inaudible) upon what is in the tariff."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1752.878,1761.576,"Yes, in -- in the sense that we say that in terms of the Elkins Act, it is a concession, a rebate, on eliminating or avoiding the word discrimination."
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1761.576,1762.156,Yes.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1762.156,1763.263,Whereby --
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1763.263,1766.082,Departure -- knowing departure from the public tariff.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1766.082,1772.931,"A departure from -- or a failure to -- or by property, it's a transfer afforded by less than the tariff rates."
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1772.931,1785.214,"Well, that's on the assumption that there is an implied prohibition against doing this in the tariff and that they didn't set forth this service."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1785.214,1785.32,Yes.
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1785.32,1787.614,"You must imply that -- you must imply that, don't you?"
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1787.614,1788.522,Yes.
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1797.696,1808.125,"Could they put this into the tariff or could if it's conceivable that if they spread this from the tariff and submitted it to the Commission, that they would have sanctioned it?"
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1811.651,1814.287,That -- that is conceivable that they could go either way and of course that is --
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1814.287,1817.345,Aren't there some proceedings of that kind going on before the Commission?
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1817.345,1822.068,"There are, wherein involving six carriers other than the Union Pacific."
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1822.068,1822.493,Yes.
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1822.493,1832.311,"Well, then you'd have a hard time convicting them, because Elkins Act as a criminal statute convicting them of -- of the Elkins Act offense, wouldn't you?"
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1832.311,1834.861,"For -- for purposes of the criminal statute, it might be difficult."
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1834.861,1836.609,"Well, It would -- it's the same statute?"
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1836.609,1836.826,Yes.
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1839.477,1849.918,"The fact that you now have a proceeding before you, the result of which might be a legalization, a form of legalization of this thing, makes it very questionable of the violation of the Elkins Act."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1849.918,1850.317,"Well, if it is --"
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1850.317,1858.714,"Because I can't see that the Commission can, except by changing the tariff (Inaudible), condone the process on the Elkins Act."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1858.714,1868.518,"Well, and I think this is true also that the Commission will not determine whether or not this practice, in the service that is rendered here, is within the prohibitions of the Elkins Act."
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1869.875,1870.055,No.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1873.642,1875.162,That's right.
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1875.162,1879.001,So that the Commission is taking the position that it is in violation of the Elkins Act.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1879.001,1882.969,"Well, we are here at the request of the Interstate Commerce Commission."
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1884.256,1901.545,"Mr. Laughlin, I was a little surprised to hear you say that these unnecessary delays that the shipper is accorded on this trip is -- is no violation of any kind, that he's entitled to -- to have that."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1932.608,1939.494,"Well if -- once it reaches its destination, then they have 24 hours in which to re-consign it or 48 hours in which to unload it."
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1941.571,1951.452,"Well, leave the demurrage -- demurrage out of it because I -- I remember, you said that if it wasn't for the demurrage thing, there wouldn't be any -- any question about it."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1951.452,1955.681,In terms of existing tariff or this -- of this -- of statutory proscription.
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1955.681,1968.809,-- but didn't the B&O case in 305 U.S. hold that they could not give them the equivalent storage in that manner?
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,1968.809,1976.336,"Of course, B&O case was a Commission proceeding in which the railroads were providing in transit warehousing."
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2000.148,2010.454,But you're saying in effect -- aren't you saying in effect to pursue the Chief Justice's question that the device of this thing is that it's really an evasion of the of the demurrage requirement?
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2010.454,2010.875,Exactly.
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2010.875,2011.921,"That's your case, isn't it?"
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2011.921,2021.53,"And -- and evading and in adopting this device, they have run a foul of Section 6 (7) of the Interstate Commerce Act and of course the Elkins Act."
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2049.025,2059.042,"Well, that's what I -- that's what I understood your case was but I -- I thought in your opening statement, you said that you're only interested in the question of demurrage."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2059.042,2069.545,"Not only interested in that, I merely referred to the demurrage tariffs as pointing out the source of this present controversy and the source of the difficulty that we think the Union --"
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2069.545,2069.735,Yes.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2069.735,2071.699,-- Pacific and other carriers are here in now.
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2071.699,2076.322,"But there are other factors in your case than demurrage, is that right?"
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2076.322,2076.88,Yes --
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2076.88,2077.128,Well --
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2077.128,2082.67,"-- because there is no technical -- the demurrage tariffs never become applicable on these transit shipments, where they have --"
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2082.67,2083.699,Not in effect.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2083.699,2100.975,-- not set off these sidings -- sidings designated by the shipper where they're set off by the carrier knowing what the shipper desires that does not reach its consignment point within a time that a shipment would ordinarily arrive.
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2100.975,2110.19,But they -- but the District Court made some findings which went over showing us concern with things other than -- other than demurrage.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2110.19,2110.397,That's what they --
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2110.397,2112.252,"Now, are you -- are those still in the case? Are you interested in --"
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2112.252,2114.349,They are very much in -- very much in the case.
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2114.349,2115.209,They are in the case.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2115.209,2117.618,Because they are -- these -- these --
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2117.618,2118.377,"Well, I won't trouble you with this."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2118.377,2120.245,-- the findings of the District Court establish --
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2120.245,2121.824,I won't -- I won't trouble you to say how now.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2122.644,2122.696,All right.
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2122.696,2125.681,I just want to know - if they are in or they are not.
1959.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2125.681,2133.362,"You could help me if you'd -- to know just what it is you're claiming if you'd let -- answer this question, which you -- maybe you can."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2152.184,2155.071,Is this an agreement between the carrier and a particular shipper?
1959.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2155.071,2156.354,Yes.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2156.354,2159.034,"Well, I think that's the case that we have here now."
1959.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2159.034,2170.702,"Well, what law would -- I -- I was trying to get one that would show in an exact created form, they just agreed that they're going to stop 15 times on the way."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2170.702,2171.975,"Well, if the -- the if the --"
1959.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2171.975,2173.954,"Well, what law would they violate by doing it, if any?"
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2173.954,2204.559,"Well, they would violate in our -- in our judgment, Section 6 (7) and Section 1 of the Elkins Act if the purpose of these 15 stops was to give the shipper a particular service not specified in the tariff and the service of value to the shipper, whereby the transportation rate or -- or a rate less than the published transportation rate was realized but the carrier."
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2204.559,2211.97,"Well, the shipper in Justice Black's question had -- had 15 plans separated, geographically separated."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2211.97,2213.077,15 plan?
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2213.077,2213.681,Plans.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2213.681,2215.602,Plant.
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2215.602,2229.386,"And that each stop that Justice Black hypothesized, they put on some of these stops, which they distributed for purposes of -- for intra -- intra-enterprise reasons."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2235.48,2237.7,And these are regularly serviced by the carrier.
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2237.7,2238.599,Yes.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2238.599,2243.076,"Well, I think it would be a different case in answer to both questions --"
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2243.076,2243.408,"Well, why would it be different case?"
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2243.408,2249.427,If these 15 stops were for operational purposes insofar as the carrier is concerned and --
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2249.427,2251.306,In the engine -- there's something the matter with the engine.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2251.306,2258.307,"Well, that or if they are required this service or render a transportation service to 15 communities in route."
1959.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2258.307,2262.568,"Well, suppose they are not, suppose that the railroad agreed to them and they want that done."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2277.437,2292.527,"Well, I would say, again, the answer would be that if it in anyway that the service is rendered for the convenience or the accommodation of the shipper, then in that event it foul runs into both Section 6 (7) and the Elkins Act."
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2292.527,2293.893,It wouldn't be a demurrage problem?
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2293.893,2295.854,Not a demurrage problem.
1959.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2300.199,2304.932,Is it your -- basis of your argument here that is done for the convenience of the shipper?
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2304.932,2306.555,"Oh, I don't there is any question about it."
1959.98,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2306.555,2310.927,"And it's -- and therefore, comes within the type of situation of --"
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2310.927,2311.825,It's then within the Elkins Act.
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2321.528,2324.438,And the Commission could fine -- I am asking.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2336.365,2339.103,"They -- they could do so, I would say they -- the Commission could --"
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2339.103,2342.68,Although this would only advantage as for big shippers.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2342.68,2343.304,Pardon?
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2343.304,2348.704,Although it would only advantage a big shipper or big shippers.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2348.704,2350.463,"Well, that --"
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2350.463,2357.023,I mean not that they would exclude small shippers but that their business wouldn't bring this kind of advantage into being.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2357.023,2359.669,"Probably, primarily to the advantage of the big shippers."
1959.98,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2359.669,2362.555,But the Commission put in the pending proceedings authorizing this (Inaudible).
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2362.555,2378.881,"It could approve -- it could approve the schedules proposed by the six carriers and would determine that there was no unjust discrimination, undue advantage or preference, and that the tariff rates were not unreasonable."
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2400.083,2403.131,"May I ask this, Mr. Laughlin?"
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2424.45,2432.348,The -- the proposed schedules that they have on file with the Commission are now in effect and have been since June of 1959.
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2432.348,2434.236,They posted them as schedules.
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2434.236,2447.447,"That's right, in tariff form and of course these schedules provide for a 15-day free hold time on lumber shipments at various points on the carrier's lines."
1959.98,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2515.71,2516.109,I wonder --
1959.98,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2516.109,2532.632,"Do I -- do I understand then that -- that although those six companies have done it, the Union Pacific refuses to -- to file schedules and avail itself for the same procedure that these six companies have."
1959.98,1,31498,john_g_laughlin_jr,,2532.632,2533.894,That's right.
1959.98,2,22089,elmer_b_collins,,3403.548,3418.328,"Your Honors, all these reasons just recited by counsel for escaping the doctrine of primary jurisdiction were purged in the Cunar and the Far East cases and were rejected by this Court."
1959.98,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3454.233,3457.373,"Well, that wasn't for the pleasure of the passengers though."
1959.98,2,22089,elmer_b_collins,,3457.373,3458.384,Well --
1959.98,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3458.384,3459.325,I've read in it --
1959.98,2,22089,elmer_b_collins,,3459.325,3461.74,"I -- I think -- I'll have to disagree with you, sir.[Laughs]"
1959.98,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3644.567,3645.161,Mr. Collins.
1959.98,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3645.161,3645.719,"Well, isn't --"
1959.98,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3645.719,3646.191,Go on.
1959.98,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3646.191,3652.865,But isn't the normal way to do that for you to file your rates in and -- and let the Commission investigate it?
1959.98,2,22089,elmer_b_collins,,3652.865,3654.489,We filed the rates.
1959.98,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3656.31,3656.783,"No, no."
1959.98,2,22089,elmer_b_collins,,3660.168,3664.203,"You mean file a rate, a -- a tariff charging more for the slow service?"
1959.98,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3664.203,3677.445,"Well, I am not -- I am not saying what kind you should charge but you -- but you haven't -- you -- you haven't filed any rates, as I understand it, for this particular kind of a service?"
1959.98,2,22089,elmer_b_collins,,3677.445,3678.802,"MYes, we have."
1959.98,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3750.936,3753.053,"Mr. Collins, may I ask you this question?"
1959.98,2,22089,elmer_b_collins,,3800.286,3803.568,They are not the kind of findings the Commission not to make.
