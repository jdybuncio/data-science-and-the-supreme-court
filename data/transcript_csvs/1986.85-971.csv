1986.85-971,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.522,"We will hear arguments next in No. 85-971, Robert L. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, versus Securities Industry Association, and Security Pacific National Bank versus Securities Industry Association."
1986.85-971,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,70.929,79.416,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the basic issues in this case involve fairly narrow questions of statutory construction."
1986.85-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,220.443,228.798,"May I just ask, if you are talking in reverse order, if you persuade us with your second argument, will it be necessary for us to discuss your first?"
1986.85-971,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,228.798,241.039,"Much as we would like you to resolve the banking question, I think if the parties were found not to have standing, that should be the end of the case."
1986.85-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,434.98,452.275,"I take it the argument is, or at least one of the arguments is that this kind of business is part of the banking business and the statute says you are only supposed to conduct banking business at your main... at your home location or in branches."
1986.85-971,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,452.275,457.346,"You are referring, Justice White, to Section 36's companion provision, 12 USC Section 81--"
1986.85-971,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,457.346,457.746,Yes.
1986.85-971,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,457.746,459.529,--which respondent has pointed to for that.
1986.85-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,464.582,466.368,Was that presented below?
1986.85-971,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,466.368,467.351,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1986.85-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,467.351,468.584,And rejected?
1986.85-971,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,468.584,473.022,"Well, the District Court, we think engaged in the proper form of analysis."
1986.85-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,473.022,474.255,Or accepted?
1986.85-971,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,475.14,476.274,That's correct.
1986.85-971,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,517.967,525.121,"Yes, but isn't there language in Plant City suggesting that you could have a branch even though it doesn't do one of those three things?"
1986.85-971,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,525.121,535.477,--I think as far as it went was to state that a bank's branch includes offices that perform those three functions and may include more.
1986.85-971,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,553.038,561.71,I suppose a bank could conduct in non-branches trust business.
1986.85-971,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,561.71,563.262,"Well, that is our position."
1986.85-971,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,849.63,850.815,"Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld."
1986.85-971,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,863.14,884.486,"Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, respondent stockbrokers seek to exclude national banks from their national, nationwide market, not through fair competition beneficial to consumers but through selective, novel, and unfair reading of statutory language."
1986.85-971,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1131.448,1134.984,"But of course there is nothing to indicate to the contrary, either."
1986.85-971,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1140.538,1156.314,"Yes, and then that takes you back to the statute, and here the judge below said, based upon the literal reading of the statute, that the Comptroller was correct."
1986.85-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1290.086,1301.727,Does the Comptroller have to authorize the setting up of a bank office that deals in securities?
1986.85-971,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1301.727,1304.846,"The answer is, Your honor, no."
1986.85-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.546,1307.798,"Well, he has been doing... he has been doing it--"
1986.85-971,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1307.798,1309.564,It took me a long time... I will tell you what the answer is.
1986.85-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.615,1371.538,--So his approval power doesn't suggest that what he is approving is banking business?
1986.85-971,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1371.538,1373.006,That's true.
1986.85-971,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1373.006,1377.442,This is just that he has general... this is just some financial concern.
1986.85-971,1,44300,william_t_coleman_jr,,1377.442,1378.827,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-971,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1385.231,1391.802,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
1986.85-971,2,33454,james_b_weidner,,1394.837,1403.259,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case, of course, concerns the locational restrictions of the National Bank Act."
1986.85-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1416.567,1418.502,"What business, the banking business?"
1986.85-971,2,33454,james_b_weidner,,1418.502,1422.856,"It is, as enacted, and I will return to this, it was its usual business."
1986.85-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.529,1433.595,And you say that it certainly isn't limited to that.
1986.85-971,2,33454,james_b_weidner,,1433.595,1434.814,"--Correct, Justice White."
1986.85-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1481.961,1484.527,What happened to your argument below?
1986.85-971,2,33454,james_b_weidner,,1484.527,1491.5,"--In our argument below, Justice White, there was some suggestion in the briefs in response to ours that the Section 81 argument hadn't been made."
1986.85-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.656,1530.708,What happened in the Court of Appeals?
1986.85-971,2,33454,james_b_weidner,,1530.708,1534.144,"--They affirmed basically for the reasons... the decision below, Justice White."
1986.85-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1536.179,1541.5,So your argument here wasn't sustainable.
1986.85-971,2,33454,james_b_weidner,,1543.366,1546.118,"It was, to the extent... in this sense."
1986.85-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.022,1552.339,--Yes.
1986.85-971,2,33454,james_b_weidner,,1552.339,1555.341,Therefore they are permissible countrywide.
1986.85-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1563.68,1567.317,That wasn't the rationale of the District Court or the Court of Appeals.
1986.85-971,2,33454,james_b_weidner,,1567.317,1570.435,"I think it was the implicit rationale, Justice White."
1986.85-971,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.721,1657.041,"Do you think general business then doesn't mean anything more than just business, in your view?"
1986.85-971,2,33454,james_b_weidner,,1657.041,1662.029,"It means business in all of its respects, yes."
1986.85-971,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1724.536,1729.404,Any indication in the legislative history as to why that change was made?
1986.85-971,2,33454,james_b_weidner,,1729.404,1738.093,"Mr. Chief Justice, there is no indication in the legislative history one way or the other, although I think the circumstances make it fairly plain, and they are these."
1986.85-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.882,2080.953,"Of course, that isn't what Section 36 said."
1986.85-971,2,33454,james_b_weidner,,2083.987,2087.273,"Section 36 does not specifically state that, Justice White."
1986.85-971,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2141.657,2145.209,"Of course, you read 81 as a limitation."
1986.85-971,2,33454,james_b_weidner,,2168.808,2179.014,"Mr. Chief Justice, however, this Court has twice held that indeed the meaning of Section 81 is to limit the transaction of the general business of a national bank to one office."
1986.85-971,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.061,2687.597,Just competitors?
1986.85-971,2,33454,james_b_weidner,,2687.597,2690.799,As competitors.
1986.85-971,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2697.702,2698.969,"Thank you, Mr. Weidner."
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2702.772,2706.058,"Two basic points on the merits and one on standing, Your Honor."
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.651,2721.951,The Court did in this case.
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2721.951,2735.161,"--Well, I think the discussion of Section 81 in this case was largely in response to the Comptroller's argument, which was not repeated here, that the McFadden Act only reaches intrastate and not extra-state activities of national banks."
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2750.337,2757.574,"Well, the District Court specifically said that the brokerage business is part of the general business of the bank."
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2757.574,2761.728,"--It did say that in response, as I said, to the argument of the Comptroller."
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2761.728,2763.128,"Well, isn't that the whole argument?"
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2763.128,2769.215,"Well, leaving aside the District Court's opinion here, which I think the preceding discussion in the District Court's opinion--"
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.215,2771.251,How can you leave aside that opinion?
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2771.251,2772.751,"--Well, I think in looking at it--"
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2772.751,2775.369,You say that no court has ever held it.
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2775.369,2777.571,"--Well, our reading of--"
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2777.571,2779.522,"In this Court and the Court of Appeals, too."
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2782.991,2787.026,"--Well, again, our reading of the District Court's opinion is that it focused on a different analysis."
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2847.917,2852.905,Is it your point that the general business just doesn't include brokerage?
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2852.905,2859.141,"That's right, Justice White, we think the general business... well, our analysis is broader than that, although we think that is all the Court need say here."
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2859.141,2872.782,And the general business of the bank is the business that they perform in branches or... you think the general business is those three functions?
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2872.782,2873.818,Essentially that's right.
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2930.838,2938.677,May banks just willy-nilly engage in any kind of business they want to as long as it isn't specifically prohibited?
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2938.677,2939.894,"No, not at all, Justice White."
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2939.894,2949.966,"What about, could they just set up a... could they just say, well, we know a good place to set up a restaurant, and we are going to get in the restaurant business?"
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2949.966,2950.984,"No, they could not do that."
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2950.984,2951.868,Why couldn't they do that?
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2951.868,2959.34,"The powers granted national banks are specifically set out in 12 USC Section 24 7th, and--"
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.34,2961.307,"The brokerage business is one of those, then?"
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2961.307,2970.196,"--Well, Congress has set out essentially two types of businesses that banks engage in, the business of banking, and it lists a series of things that banks can engage in as part of the business of banking."
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2980.171,2987.991,"But even though the banks are specifically authorized to buy and sell securities, it is not part of their general business?"
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2987.991,2991.293,--It is not part of their general banking business as that term--
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.293,2992.495,That isn't what it says.
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2994.295,3009.155,"--Well, the statute refers to the general business of a national bank, and that statutory language was interpreted by this Court, by the Comptroller, and by the Attorney General, and again in an opinion that was endorsed by this Court prior to 1927 as meaning a general banking business."
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.344,3026.049,"But the statute permits, specifically permits the banks to do this as part of their business, to buy and sell securities as part of their business."
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3026.049,3028.668,"--As part of their business, but again, Section 81--"
1986.85-971,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.668,3030.02,But that is not part of their general business?
1986.85-971,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3030.02,3033.055,--Section 81 doesn't refer to all business or the business.
1986.85-971,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3090.659,3092.261,"Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld."
