1975.74-1245,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,54.882,We will hear arguments next in Liberty Mutual Insurance Company against Wetzel.
1975.74-1245,0,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,58.111,61.561,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1245,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,247.012,257.656,"Well, you would not suggest that Congress could not go further in prohibiting employment practices than the Fourteenth Amendment if it so chose, would you?"
1975.74-1245,0,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,257.656,258.69,I agree with that statement.
1975.74-1245,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,458.34,462.716,"Mr. Grove how old is the plan, the insurance plan?"
1975.74-1245,0,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,462.716,464.23,I do not know exactly Your Honor.
1975.74-1245,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,470.445,473.86,Has it always had the exclusions and exemptions that now have?
1975.74-1245,0,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,473.86,474.688,"Yes, it is."
1975.74-1245,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,474.688,476.293,That always changes?
1975.74-1245,0,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,476.293,479.194,"No, there have not been any changes as far as I know."
1975.74-1245,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,490.636,494.435,"But do you know how they have been -- has there been that evolution, do you?"
1975.74-1245,0,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,494.435,495.087,I cannot respond.
1975.74-1245,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,509.524,529.698,"Is there any legislative history so to speak, any explanation in the record anywhere as to these, I do not mean now, post hoc explanation or rationalization, but any historic explanation for the exclusions and exceptions of this plan?"
1975.74-1245,0,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,529.698,531.509,"No, there was none."
1975.74-1245,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,671.162,679.477,"Mr. Grove, sometime during your argument, would you comment on why you think the District Court’s order was appealable to the Third Circuit?"
1975.74-1245,0,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,708.718,729.77,"Well, I think what the District Court did in this instance Your Honor is it split the issue of liability and remedy and determined liability and then said that there is no reason to delay an appeal on this situation under the rules which she had the right to do and then submitted it to the Third Circuit which took it under that situation."
1975.74-1245,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,729.77,736.839,What authority do you have with the proposition that a judgment on liability only separated from remedy is indeed a final judgment?
1975.74-1245,0,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,736.839,745.555,"Well, I cannot give you any authority right now, but in my knowledge this is very common situation that occurs in the Trial Courts."
1975.74-1245,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,767.392,776.929,"But they can let them go if Congress has permitted them to go I take it and if you cannot do it on the personal injury action, why cannot you do it under Title VII?"
1975.74-1245,0,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,776.929,778.728,"I do not have any answer, a good answer Your Honor."
1975.74-1245,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,815.219,837.863,"Mr. Grove you make reference to the prior position of the EEOC as having changed and I could not find it in your brief, maybe it is, that the prior opinions of the EEOC indicate that they are based on the ground that there was no discrimination in the first instance, no sex discrimination or alternatively where they are based more or less on the ground that there might have been discrimination, but it was justified?"
1975.74-1245,0,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,837.863,839.966,The second is the way I read the guidelines.
1975.74-1245,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,839.966,843.156,Because your argument in this case relies just on the first proposition?
1975.74-1245,0,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,843.156,844.38,That is right.
1975.74-1245,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.986,860.166,"So, really the prior EEOC history is quite irrelevant to the issue you present to us?"
1975.74-1245,0,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,860.166,880.842,"Well, I suggest it is, except for the fact that all employers during the first seven years of Title VII relied upon that and then all of the sudden lawsuits like this came along where the commission then switched their position and came along with plaintiffs as in this case to try to substantiate their guidelines."
1975.74-1245,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,883.862,885.077,Very well Mr. Grove.
1975.74-1245,1,28187,howard_a_specter,,897.305,901.378,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1245,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,988.91,990.286,Waiting periods and things like that?
1975.74-1245,1,28187,howard_a_specter,,990.286,993.641,Changes in premium primarily and things like that.
1975.74-1245,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1142.224,1144.075,So it was colloquy in the Court of Appeals?
1975.74-1245,1,28187,howard_a_specter,,1144.075,1149.839,Yes Your Honor.
1975.74-1245,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1661.394,1662.603,Mr. Specter?
1975.74-1245,1,28187,howard_a_specter,,1662.603,1663.124,Yes Your Honor.
1975.74-1245,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1663.124,1678.785,Where in your view in the many briefs filed with us is the evolution of the commission's attitude most clearly and pictorially and thoroughly and intelligibly set up?
1975.74-1245,1,28187,howard_a_specter,,1678.785,1684.915,"Again, I think credit is to be given to the counsel for the respondents in Gilbert."
1975.74-1245,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1687.966,1690.673,106 to 119 in the Gilbert case?
1975.74-1245,1,28187,howard_a_specter,,1690.673,1690.833,Yes.
1975.74-1245,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1690.833,1691.562,The respondent’s brief?
1975.74-1245,1,28187,howard_a_specter,,1691.562,1699.316,"Yes, that is the fact, the yellow one, Your Honor."
1975.74-1245,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1809.043,1811.843,"If I may, sorry to interrupt you."
1975.74-1245,1,28187,howard_a_specter,,1840.845,1843.321,"I am sorry, it is apparent that I did not articulate as clearly as I should have, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1975.74-1245,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1843.321,1848.562,"Well, I just want to be sure, what you are telling us --"
1975.74-1245,1,28187,howard_a_specter,,1848.562,1878.999,"It is my understanding that in the area of statutory construction, it is appropriate to look if there is any question to statutes and legislative history which were enacted or were involved prior to and subsequent to the particular statute involved to determine some continuing philosophy which would indicate what it was that Congress had in mind back when it enacted the particular statute."
1975.74-1245,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1948.827,1951.368,You know I can certainly see your point.
1975.74-1245,1,28187,howard_a_specter,,1971.884,1978.832,"Well, the most candid answer I can give the Court is I do not believe that would be appealable and I believe it is different."
1975.74-1245,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1996.715,2000.467,"Well, I am not sure it answers it at all.[Laughter]"
1975.74-1245,1,28187,howard_a_specter,,2000.467,2003.608,"As I said, I would do the best that I can."
1975.74-1245,2,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,2767.638,2776.7,"Your Honor what is on page 99 appears to be only a portion of the plan, the limitations."
1975.74-1245,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2786.75,2788.587,Other pregnancy --
1975.74-1245,2,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,2788.587,2791.402,"No, the other disabilities that I talked about."
1975.74-1245,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2791.402,2794.343,"Just the pregnancy, the one we are talking about?"
1975.74-1245,2,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,2794.343,2799.448,"As far as it goes it is accurate, the one that you are referring to on page 99."
1975.74-1245,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2799.448,2804.046,Which say the policy actually had other exclusions in addition to those that are here?
1975.74-1245,2,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,2804.046,2805.973,"Well, the one right before you."
1975.74-1245,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2805.973,2811.006,"Oh! It does, I know, but you say the one in effect had even more other exclusions than this?"
1975.74-1245,2,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,2811.006,2811.858,That is right.
1975.74-1245,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2811.858,2812.554,Where is it in the record?
1975.74-1245,2,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,2812.554,2814.651,Well it is -- I am not sure it is in the record.
1975.74-1245,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2834.612,2836.707,Did you mean the transcript?
1975.74-1245,2,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,2836.707,2838.804,"In my recollection that it is, but --"
1975.74-1245,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2838.804,2840.151,Is it filed here?
1975.74-1245,2,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,2840.151,2842.0,It should be.
1975.74-1245,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2842.0,2844.697,"I cannot help why it should be, do you not know?"
1975.74-1245,2,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,2844.697,2848.586,"Well, yes it is."
1975.74-1245,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.704,2936.287,"They argue, you do not get to the pretext question until you have raised an affirmative defense."
1975.74-1245,2,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,2941.006,2956.03,"Well, Aiello says to us that exclusion of this disability is not discrimination per se until it is shown that the reason for the exclusion is a pretext to engage in invidious discrimination."
1975.74-1245,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.03,2960.653,"Well, by like reasoning, is there any reason to talk about costs in this case?"
1975.74-1245,2,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,2969.919,2974.873,"Well, I do not think you get to the question of cost unless the plaintiff has sustained its initial burden."
1975.74-1245,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2974.873,2981.595,"So, is this not whole case turned on whether or not this is a prima facie case of discrimination within the meaning of the statute?"
1975.74-1245,2,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,2981.595,2985.125,In Aiello says it is not.
1975.74-1245,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2986.641,2992.209,"Do you agree with your opponent’s analysis in my dissent in Spurgess, have you read that case?"
1975.74-1245,2,33827,kalvin_m_grove,,2992.209,2997.302,"Yes, well I agree with your dissent.[Laughter]"
1975.74-1245,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2997.302,2999.538,"Do you agree, that is not question."
