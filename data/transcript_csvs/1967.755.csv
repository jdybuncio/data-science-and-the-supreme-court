1967.755,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,34.573,"Number 755, First Agricultural National Bank of Berkshire County, appellant versus State Tax Commission."
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,38.362,42.834,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,495.845,502.945,What's the case in this Court that most squarely says that answers yesterday's question.
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,502.945,508.198,The case starting â€“ a line of decisions starting with Owensboro --
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,508.198,509.831,Are they square holding for the --
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,509.831,511.979,"Yes, they are square holdings."
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,519.964,520.365,Well that's alright.
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,520.365,525.982,"Des Moines National Bank versus Fairweather, First National Bank of Guthrie Center versus Anderson."
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,525.982,539.656,But either -- you need not go on but your position is that the -- these cases squarely construe the statute to exclude the other type of standard?
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,539.656,543.481,Position we take is that this is perfectly clear.
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.75,579.609,"Well that's one thing right, but do you think they have -- do you think they -- these cases have held of national banks would simply immune because their federal instrumentalities or have they held that they are immune because Congress has set them to be immune?"
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,579.609,601.502,"I think that the cases of -- are subject to both interpretations that the -- they can be construed as holding one that Section 548 as a legislative matter, has defined the scope beyond which states cannot tax national banks."
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,602.95,605.235,Whether did they would be immune constitutionally or not?
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,605.235,610.942,"Whether they would be immune constitutionally or not, and this is the first proposition upon which we were relying."
1967.755,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,627.065,635.605,Well you are saying that the statute said in terms that states could impose these taxes against national bank.
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,640.211,644.781,I would not like be in a position of having in advance with that argument.
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,659.175,660.719,Congress can wave immunity.
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,660.719,662.175,That's exactly right.
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,780.888,786.762,I should like to address myself for a moment to the question of congressional reliance.
1967.755,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,786.762,803.093,"Before you leave that, if 548 by its term seems to be directed to the matter in which the state may tax the shares of the National Banking Association."
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,803.093,804.886,The statute goes on to --
1967.755,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,804.886,807.603,And then later the statute it says nothing here in to show --
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,807.603,808.512,Yes and (Voice Overlap) --
1967.755,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,808.512,812.055,--(Voice Overlap) prohibit states power to tax the real estate of a bank.
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,812.055,830.978,"And -- but it goes on to say that the several states may tax such shares or the dividends or tax such associations on in that income or under the four subdivision, tax such associations according to a measure by the state incomes."
1967.755,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,882.836,901.11,"I suppose your argument would be that if it didn't cover much, much more than that there would be no reason at all from putting any paragraph like paragraph three which says that nothing here in contained shall be deemed to prohibit a state from taxing the real estate of a bank."
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,901.11,902.025,That is true too.
1967.755,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,902.025,908.978,That would be an entirely unnecessary if all the statute were directed where the matter at which shares could be taxed.
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,908.978,914.955,That's true.
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1136.113,1151.156,What's the basis for -- if this bank is not a federal instrumentality what's the congressional basis for immunizing a national bank from state taxation.
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,1151.156,1171.731,The Court has held at -- the Congress has -- there's been a trend of decisions which had indicated as the court below has suggested that the power for the Congress to immunize a federal instrumentality is a very broad one.
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.731,1172.853,"Well yes, I know."
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,1174.966,1175.303,Well.
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1197.079,1205.664,You mean it isn't automatic that just because it's a federal instrumentality it doesn't mean it's immune?
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,1205.664,1217.549,No which I would suggest that there are various vehicles for carrying out some of the aims of the Government where they would not (Voice Overlap)
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.549,1217.896,Well let's assume that (Voice Overlap)
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,1217.896,1219.108,-- be entitled of constitutional immunity.
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.108,1230.915,-- federal instrumentality for the purposes of giving Congress the power to immunize it.
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,1237.385,1241.964,I would submit that that does necessarily follow.
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1284.135,1299.761,"Well, but again now, let's assume the Court presided in its own mind that the -- this bank wasn't entitled to any constitutional immunity and then you come to the statute that you argue that that's immunize --"
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,1299.761,1299.997,Yes.
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1299.997,1302.282,-- bank.
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,1309.444,1311.001,Because the -- under the --
1967.755,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1311.001,1312.689,Is this interstate commerce or what?
1967.755,0,39723,ronald_h_kessel,,1312.689,1348.738,Under the implied powers of the national government to create national banks and a national banking system as an implied power of the federal government implied from the authority to levying collect taxes to develop and be all means to run the affairs of the government why the decision of McCulloch versus Maryland put to rest forever.
1967.755,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1667.463,1672.971,Mr. Dimond.
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,1672.971,1677.264,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court."
1967.755,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2533.892,2550.621,"Mr. Dimond, I understand that the trust of what you've been telling us is to show the difference between what national banks are today and what they were today as of McCulloch against Maryland or even in the days of 1864 --"
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,2550.621,2550.954,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.755,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2550.954,2565.685,"Or prior to 1913, which goes I supposed to the constitutionality of state imposing nondiscriminatory taxes upon national banks in 1968."
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,2565.685,2570.086,Yes sir.
1967.755,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2570.086,2592.527,"Does this mean that if Congress -- if this is mean that if Section 548 means what your opponent says it means is, that is that Congress has given permission to states to tax national banks only in certain specified ways that that Act of Congress is not within the power of Congress to enact to constitutionally or what does it mean?"
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,2600.53,2610.969,"I have not gone as far as Your Honor suggests, I'm not aware of any decision of this Court that goes that far."
1967.755,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2651.686,2656.45,"Because as I understood, your brother's argument on the other side it was primarily bottomed down the statute."
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,2656.45,2659.207,It was Your Honor.
1967.755,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2659.207,2683.661,And if the statute means what he says it means then that wins the case for him unless there's some reason that statute was not within the -- unless for some reason that statute is not constitutionally there because it was not within the constitutionally power of Congress to enact or because it violate some explicit constitutional provision.
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,2683.661,2691.945,"Well, the -- he started that one end of the street and I've started at the other."
1967.755,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.862,2762.768,Do you think that you concede that the Court has squarely construed that statute to exclude other form of protection?
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,2762.768,2766.759,It has done it in terms -- in these terms Your Honor.
1967.755,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.642,2785.808,Or has it ever invalidated the tax because the statute immunizes the banks from the kind of taxation of suddenly imposed?
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,2785.808,2803.335,It is done so Your Honor in circumstances where the tax sought to be imposed as had a direct effect shall we say on the value of an investment in a national bank as compared to the investment in other forms of moneyed capital.
1967.755,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2846.153,2856.012,"But nevertheless, these taxes were invalidated because it held that Congress had intended to authorize those taxes."
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,2856.012,2856.975,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.755,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.652,2860.465,Or Congress intended to immunize against those taxes.
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,2860.465,2861.76,Immunize against those actually.
1967.755,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2861.76,2863.431,And as evidenced by the statute.
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,2863.431,2863.929,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.755,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2882.215,2894.821,"But ordinarily if it goes out far though that kind of problem after lapse of time and Congress has let it alone, don't you think they'll let Congress handle rather than we do?"
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,2894.821,2897.124,In some circumstances that would be so Your Honor.
1967.755,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2919.011,2929.116,Well you're not suggest -- you're not suggesting are you that we apply that principle that Congress take care of it if they don't like the interpretation.
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,2934.414,2938.561,"I won't say, only then I think that is a factor that would be considered Your Honor."
1967.755,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2938.561,2946.665,Now how do we -- how do we know that situation has so changed about banks just by judicial notice?
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,2946.665,2976.331,"What we've attempted to document the change in our brief, there is I believe references to the various sources which indicate the fundamental change in the character of national banks so that today there's simply ordinary private commercial institution say perform no significant fiscal or monetary function for the Federal Government."
1967.755,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2988.093,2995.971,Is there anything in your argument or in your brief that isn't thoroughly familiar on Capitol Hill?
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,2995.971,3004.631,I think every item of history that I've cited here your Honor is generally familiar.
1967.755,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3010.202,3016.557,Well isn't it is well-known as it is to -- me for example?
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,3016.557,3016.791,Well --
1967.755,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3016.791,3020.334,"That's the other question I ask is, the Congress has intention to it."
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,3020.334,3030.213,"Congress has not and I think it has -- once again, not had occasion to do it."
1967.755,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3059.824,3063.136,"Were this state tax, applied to Federal Reserve bank?"
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,3063.136,3067.609,"No Your Honor, because they are specifically exempt by Act of Congress from state taxation."
1967.755,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3359.431,3366.369,Or do you suggest that national banks perform no -- for the no of role for the Federal Government at all?
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,3366.369,3373.285,No role of sufficient importance to justify than being given a constitutional immunity Your Honor.
1967.755,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3373.285,3374.784,But some role.
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,3374.784,3376.499,"They perform some role, yes."
1967.755,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3377.6,3380.824,Well the basic of a role I put this squarely.
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,3380.824,3381.459,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.755,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3381.459,3393.491,That suggests that Congress could grant them this immunity and that constitutional authority would be a necessary part of course as it related to the national --
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,3393.491,3399.616,"I -- as I say, I would -- I've suggested as a possibility."
1967.755,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3404.66,3406.551,Well would you not see fit to --
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,3406.551,3407.615,"No, I'm not challenging you."
1967.755,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3407.615,3409.608,To challenge the statute.
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,3414.084,3418.767,I have not Your Honor in my brief.
1967.755,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3418.767,3425.528,(Inaudible)
1967.755,1,15823,alan_j_dimond,,3425.528,3442.477,Very minor in terms of the criteria which this Court has in recent years established for the enjoyment by an organization of a constitutional immunity.
