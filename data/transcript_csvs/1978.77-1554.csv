1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.203,We'll hear arguments next in County Court of Ulster against Allen.
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,45.203,48.449,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,48.449,50.376,Ms. Shapiro?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,50.376,51.459,Yes sir.
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,183.483,185.945,Is it clear that it was Jane Doe's handbag?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,185.945,189.674,"Yes Your Honor, it is clear, there is no dispute."
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,301.676,304.737,"Well, I thought that Jane Doe was tried in a juvenile proceeding of some kind?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,304.737,306.705,"No, she was tried jointly."
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,306.705,307.736,As a co-defendant in this proceeding?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,307.736,316.656,"As a co-defendant and it was not until sentencing that the trial judge set aside her conviction, adjudicated her a youthful offender."
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,316.656,318.163,So there were four co-defendants in this case?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,318.163,322.309,"Absolutely, yes."
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,494.595,495.695,They conceded what?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,495.695,497.379,They are guilt on the handgun charges.
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,497.379,499.993,"In the arguments, you are telling us."
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,499.993,500.548,Pardon me.
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,500.548,501.685,In their final arguments?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,501.685,505.635,"In their submission and I have the quote from the submission, which --"
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,505.635,507.931,The page you are referring to on the appendix is?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,507.931,517.544,"Page 21 to 22, which also appears on page 654 of the transcript."
1978.77-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,590.481,594.976,"I may be dumb today, but I do not understand why that is a concession?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,594.976,595.4,Pardon me?
1978.77-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,595.4,601.295,"You have to explain a little more to me, why is that a concession, I do not know, there is a concession that they were in the car?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,601.295,610.224,"No, it is concession that they, Allen and Hardrick brought the guns from Detroit where they were coming from to take to New York City."
1978.77-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,610.224,613.453,"I meant the part what you read, you say it is on page 17 of the appendix?"
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,613.453,614.052,21.
1978.77-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,614.052,614.279,21.
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,614.279,617.258,"No, I am sorry."
1978.77-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,619.027,619.566,"Oh, I am sorry."
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,625.01,628.672,"Well, the guns were concededly found in the car?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,628.672,629.15,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,629.15,638.827,"And the car was on a trip from Detroit to New York City, that is, he conceded no more than that, did he?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,641.747,644.064,I believe he conceded more than that.
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,668.64,677.031,"Well, if you look on 22, he made that point, but I notice had denied it?"
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,677.031,709.909,"Well, he is surely on 22 (a), it is in the fifth and sixth lines, fourth, fifth and sixth lines, sounds as though he is waiving any question about the validity of the statute, where he says, if you think that Hardrick and Allen exercised dominion control over the weapons in the purse, then follow of the law as the judge gives it to you on the presumption of what was in the purse is as to all four or three or two or one."
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,709.909,711.843,It would seem to me at the very least --
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,711.843,714.62,Do you think that was his failure to make objection?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,714.62,720.106,"Yeah, I certainly do, I certainly feel that at the very least that quotation indicates that —"
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,720.106,724.583,That would perhaps explain why he did not object to the instructions?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,724.583,732.173,"I have some theories in that regard as to why, I think that he may not have objected or why none of the respondents did object to the presumption?"
1978.77-1554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,732.173,754.879,"Because in theory Ms. Shapiro, I do not know what the procedural practice is in New York, but if a trial judge tells you after you have objected that I am going to charge on the presumption, you do not go to the jury and tell them that this presumption is all bad and the judge may tell you, it is alright, but I do not believe that."
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,763.289,766.805,"Absolutely, but at this point, the jury had not yet been charged."
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,766.805,768.011,He was anticipating that.
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,768.011,791.111,"He was anticipating charge and you would think anticipating the charge, he would also be anticipating the full charge, since he was quite aware that beyond the person presumption was included in the statute and his early motion indicated to some degree that he felt that his defendants were entitled to that charge."
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,791.111,804.324,"Well, of course, Mr. Justice Rehnquist is entirely correct that the lawyer in his summation cannot argue is what the judge is later going to say in the charge, cannot properly do so without being guilty of some misconduct."
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,804.324,804.932,I would not think that.
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,804.932,818.325,"It would appear here that he was reading the statute just as the prosecution was reading it, when you couple that with the fact that he made no objection to the charge."
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,818.325,820.291,"Yes, I would think so."
1978.77-1554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,830.057,848.751,"Now the Court of Appeals’ opinion in the habeas case, Second Circuit opinion does cite passages from briefs but as I read Judge Jason’s opinion for the majority of the New York Court of Appeals that does not pass on any constitutional question, does it?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,848.751,899.227,"What Judge Jason appeared to do or what it seemed apparent is that he did not view a constitutional question as having properly been raised and I think that if you read the full text respondents’ briefs 2 or 3 quotes, they were essentially the same brief and it is repeated throughout the joint appendix, I think you will see that, Your Honor will see that what -- the claim they were making essentially is that not that the statute was unconstitutional but that the failure to grant them the benefit of the exception was the unconstitutional aspect and clearly they had waived that by their earlier failure to object to the charge."
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,899.227,907.98,But why was there ever exhaustion of the statement remidies here?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,907.98,909.559,Pardon me?
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,909.559,913.281,Do you contend that there was no exhaustion of statement remedies here?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,913.281,917.919,"We contended that early in the habeas proceedings, the state did contend it, but --"
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.919,919.608,But have you abandoned that claim now?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,919.608,931.767,"It appears that the waiver, which we argue would bar collateral review in this Court, would bar collateral review in the state court in the state habeas corpus proceeding as well."
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.943,943.828,"Yeah, but this question was never presented in the state courts?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,948.279,963.09,"Well, I think there is a question at this stage in proceeding to require the respondents to go back through a state habeas proceeding, considering that --"
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,963.09,964.973,Is that one of the questions you have raised here?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,964.973,967.868,"No, I have not Your Honor."
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.603,982.856,"Is the state in position to waive that, this federal statutory requirement, may a state waive that?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,982.856,985.482,The Second Circuit does not seem to think so but --
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,985.482,989.534,I beg your pardon.
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,989.534,992.102,We are not waiving it.
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1001.912,1003.735,What is a futile exercise?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1003.735,1013.285,"To ask these respondents to return and go through a state habeas proceeding, since their state direct appeal is completed."
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.76,1026.711,How do you know what the Court of Appeals would decide on this question if it was never presented to them?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1026.711,1028.327,On the facial constitutionality statute?
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1028.327,1029.656,On the direct appeal.
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.656,1030.484,On the direct appeal.
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1039.499,1041.088,I do not know how they would decide Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.088,1046.271,"Well, then what do you mean it is a futile exercise to go back to the state courts?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1046.271,1053.878,It is our point that in effect they waived their right and the state court to even raise the constitutionality of the presumption.
1978.77-1554,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1053.878,1060.634,"Are you saying that not having raised it on direct review, your state courts would not entertain it on state habeas."
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1060.884,1061.456,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1061.456,1062.776,Exactly.
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1062.776,1064.705,"Then why should we entertain it here, that is the next question?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1064.705,1067.786,"That is the point, it goes around in a circle."
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1067.786,1086.184,"Alright but in answer to just my brothers White and Brennan you pointed out, you do not raise the exhaustion point here because of the well-settled rule that exhaustion is satisfied if there can be a showing that a further pursuit of the question of the state courts would be futile."
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1086.184,1087.232,"Yes, that is true, that is our position."
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1087.232,1102.319,But that still does not answer the question of the direct appeal and your claim that it was not even presented in the direct appeal and that therefore the New York Court of Appeals was not asked to rule on the constitutional questions.
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1102.319,1123.588,"Well, what I think the New York courts did is that they found that the respondents by failing to object to the charge, which in that case incorrectly embodied the statutory presumption, has thereafter any waived any claims flowing from that failure."
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.588,1142.23,"Are you suggesting to me that, maybe you are quite right that the person who is convicted in a state trial court can completely abandon his appeal in the state system and come directly into Federal habeas?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1142.23,1143.159,No Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.904,1160.37,"Alright, so let us assume a person is convicted in a New York trial court, he just does not appeal and then he goes to state habeas, he will be thrown out."
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1160.37,1161.766,"Yes Your Honor, he will."
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1161.766,1164.548,Can he then come to this Federal habeas?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1164.548,1165.675,No Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1165.675,1167.721,"Well, why is not that this case?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1167.721,1172.104,He has waived his state direct appeal.
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.104,1189.754,"So in this case, what about this particular question in about the facial constitutionality of this presumption if – let us assume it was never presented to the Court of Appeals of New York, although it could have been and it was not and it was not decided by them and it may not be available in state habeas, but is it available in Federal habeas?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1189.754,1191.891,No Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.891,1193.58,Wasn't that this case?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1193.58,1223.755,"No, what the New York – what I believe the New York Court of Appeals did and of course the opinion is subject to some interpretation is that it held that having waived the objection to the jury charge, which was the embodiment of the statutory presumption, the respondents waived all claims flowing from that waiver including the facial claim, he has applied claim and the state will claim."
1978.77-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1223.755,1226.243,And that is now [Indiscernible]
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1226.243,1236.281,Yes.
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1606.699,1616.005,"I take it New York is one of those states that purports to say that if the presumption disappears and you just disregard it, when any contrary evidence suddenly comes up?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1616.005,1617.369,"Not, when any contrary evidence."
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.336,1637.77,"So apparently, he thought that there was not enough evidence, but he did instruct on the presumption?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1637.77,1641.766,"He did instruct on the presumption, he omitted the instruction on the exception."
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1641.766,1645.623,Do you think he told the jury that they could ignore the presumption if they wanted to?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1645.623,1664.781,"There in the charge, the judge does say specifically and I do not have the exact page here that you may disregard -- court says, you may find for the respondent even though he submits no evidence in rebuttal."
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1670.5,1680.593,But did he not virtually give the instruction that is given on the possession of recently stolen property that you may infer?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1680.593,1681.457,And the warrant exceptions.
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1681.457,1684.652,On what page is it?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1684.652,1687.729,23 (a) Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1687.729,1693.194,"I knew I had seen it somewhere, but essentially the possession of recently stolen property instructs."
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1693.194,1698.23,"It says the burden rest upon the shoulders of the people, it never shifts."
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1709.183,1710.845,The defendant need not have to prove --
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1710.845,1723.917,"The defendants do not, the charge is very careful to state that defendants do not have to come forward with any rebuttal evidence that the jury could disregard the presumption and nevertheless acquit the respondents."
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1723.917,1731.707,"Well then none of that has to do with specifically or explicitly with the presumption at issue, in the statutory presumption at issue in this case?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1731.707,1732.402,"Well, I think it is --"
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1732.402,1734.054,Where are the instructions about that?
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1734.054,1735.887,[Inaudible] went onto instruct on presumption.
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1735.887,1737.413,Yes.
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1737.413,1738.563,Where?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1739.957,1740.993,I am looking for it.
1978.77-1554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1740.993,1741.743,That is the presumption --
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1741.743,1748.103,"On page 25, begins the presumption charge."
1978.77-1554,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1753.834,1754.263,Well.
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1754.263,1758.025,And he defines possession and in terms of the drugs and in terms of the gun.
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1758.025,1761.019,Do you think this part of the instruction is correct?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1776.879,1788.0,"The New York law is if substantial evidence is introduced to rebut the presumption, then the presumption need not go to the jury."
1978.77-1554,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.0,1797.149,So this must have been his opinion if there had not been any substantial evidence on the contrary side or there would not have been any presumption instruction at all?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1797.149,1804.233,Probably so and there was no effort made on the part of the respondents for example to rebut the presumption.
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1804.233,1823.269,"Going up to the third line of that paragraph of the instruction, you may infer and draw a conclusion that such prohibited weapon was possessed by each that is essentially what is given and has been approved universally in terms of possession of recently --"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1823.269,1824.022,Stolen property as in –
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1824.022,1831.455,"-- stolen property, even where records have set a presumption of that effect would violate due process?"
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1831.455,1832.41,But any inference would and --
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1832.41,1837.789,But a permissible inference is acceptable?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1837.789,1859.075,"Well, as I pointed out at the end of my main brief, I think that the New York, the practice in the New York courts in any event is to employ the statute permissively and so it is more like an inference than like a statutory presumption for example, some of the federal cases that this Court has examined."
1978.77-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1859.075,1862.523,But the original Sullivan Law would just an out and out presumption?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1862.523,1863.378,Pardon me?
1978.77-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1863.378,1866.382,The original Sullivan Law was just out and out presumption?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1866.382,1871.541,"Well, the Sullivan law Your Honor, referred to an entire range of firearms protection devices."
1978.77-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1871.541,1873.903,The original one was just presumption?
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1873.903,1877.157,"Oh, you mean the 1936 statute?"
1978.77-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1879.576,1881.786,"Yeah, that one."
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1883.968,1885.603,"Yes Your Honor, yes."
1978.77-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1885.603,1889.446,"But the original one, you called when he did not have a license."
1978.77-1554,0,23259,eileen_f_shapiro,,1889.446,1891.029,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1891.029,1902.909,And it was the constitutional statute except this Court [Inaudible]
1978.77-1554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1902.909,1909.729,"Mr. Young, before you go on, let me try to clear up one question."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,1924.933,1928.228,"In response to that, I would like to clear something up Your Honor."
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1935.251,1937.981,"Well, let us get an answer to my question first."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,1940.447,1941.433,Yes sir.
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1941.433,1943.756,The conviction be attacked on?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,1943.756,1949.699,Not on grounds which were available to the petitioner at the time he could have taken his direct appeal.
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1949.699,1962.507,"Well then, if that is so, would it not follow that a direct appeal, which omitted raising certain points, would not be permitted on habeas corpus, [Voice Overlap] habeas corpus?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,1962.507,1964.694,"Yes Your Honor, that is correct, yes Your Honor."
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1964.694,1966.84,"So, we come down now to what you were about to say?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,1966.84,1971.265,Which is that this direct appeal fully raised the issue we are talking about right here.
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.454,1984.857,[Inaudible] --
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,1984.857,1986.857,"[Attempt to Laughter] Well, I hope I can clear this up."
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2005.106,2006.104,Where do we find it?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2006.104,2013.584,"That set forth on pages 12a to 17a of the appendix, the joint appendix in this case."
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2017.33,2019.179,"12 to 17, that is five pages."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2020.936,2024.194,Sure.
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2033.193,2037.913,You concede that in that five pages you did not specifically challenge it on the federal Constitution?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2037.913,2039.281,"Yes, Your Honor, we concede that."
1978.77-1554,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2057.92,2058.643,Applicable?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2058.643,2061.692,Applicable and most importantly --
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.692,2063.478,Where is the federal constitutional claim?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2063.478,2063.864,Alright.
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2077.261,2079.221,That is your motion for a new trial?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2079.221,2098.998,"That is a motion to set aside a verdict, which is specifically authorized under Section 330.30 of the New York Civil Procedure Law and it is appropriate at that time Your Honor because this is not a charged case, this is not the case in which we are simply arguing that if the judge had charged the jury differently that everything would have been alright."
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2106.063,2110.583,"But this is -- anyway after the trial is over, was the first time that you raised the point constitutional --"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2110.583,2113.481,"The constitutional issue, yes Your Honor, but before judgment."
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2113.481,2118.401,And you are saying that the trial court was obligated to decide your submission here in terms of --
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2118.401,2119.474,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2131.994,2135.419,Okay then where is your submission then?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2135.419,2143.775,"Alright, that is on page 36a in which the respondents specifically stated, secondly, if the presumption is applicable --"
1978.77-1554,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2143.775,2144.192,On what page?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2144.192,2147.733,"On page 36a of the joint appendix, that is the tan document."
1978.77-1554,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2147.733,2149.893,"Alright, I got --"
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2149.893,2161.365,"Mr. Young, is it perfectly clear, you are raising a federal constitutional challenge and not a state one because although you do cite Leary against United States, you suggest the New York test maybe different, and then you cite only New York cases?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2161.365,2166.074,"Well, they do not suggest that the New York case would be different, they say that it is the same."
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2166.074,2166.96,The New York test has been held --
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2166.96,2169.292,"Well, maybe more demanding and in fact."
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2169.292,2174.47,"It has been held they confirm to that's set out in Leary, and then you go ahead and just cite all the New York cases."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2174.47,2176.244,We also cite New Jersey cases Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2177.846,2181.217,On what provision of the United States Constitution did you rely on here?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2181.217,2183.606,The Leary’s due process test Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.606,2185.104,"Well, you do not say so here."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2185.104,2200.027,"No Your Honor, but we do say unconstitutional as applied, and then immediately cite the Leary and there can't be any question, there couldn't have been any question in the state's mind that we are referring to the federal constitutional test that that's set forth in Leary."
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2214.669,2226.522,"Why did not Judge Jason’s opinion for the majority in the New York Court of Appeals make any reference, at least so far as I can tell, to a federal constitutional challenge having been made to the presumption that Leary based?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2226.522,2231.017,"Well, Your Honor, I would point out that the dissenters in the New York Court of Appeals did make reference."
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2231.017,2232.998,"Yeah, but they do not speak for the court?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2232.998,2233.758,"Well, it is our —"
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2233.758,2236.665,"Well, Leary is not in the Constitution?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2236.665,2250.084,"No, but Leary only applies to the federal Constitution Your Honor and I think it is fairly common practice that if you are trying to raise the constitutional claim, if you say it is unconstitutional and then cite to the controlling —"
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2250.084,2257.681,"Now I submit that the usual practice is to cite the Constitution, the exaction of the Constitution?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2257.681,2275.718,"Then defense counsel was less than explicit, but if the purpose of that rule is to make clear to everyone involved what is being relied on and that is what I think Bryant versus Zimmerman and those cases say that the intent of specifying what you are relying on is so that nobody has any question whether it is a federal Constitution versus a state Constitution."
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.2,2284.551,"Well, then we got a little book up here on our desk, that doesn't say a word about Leary."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2286.362,2288.689,"No, but Your Honor as I said Leary --"
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2288.689,2291.083,That is [Inaudible]
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2291.083,2300.928,"But Your Honor, the point is that Leary does refer to the -- suppose the respondents have simply said that it is unconstitutional under Leary, would not that clearly say what we are referring to as the [Voice Overlap] process?"
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2300.928,2311.675,"Well, the New York Court of Appeals to me doesn't even talk about a federal constitutional doctrine relating to presumption in the majority opinion?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2311.675,2312.072,Alright.
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2319.789,2324.5,"Well, you can look at the opinion, we can look at it, and you tell where it did?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2324.5,2335.213,"Alright, it did not -- what it did was in the first paragraphs where it discusses how important this presumption is, how necessarily it is to the activities of criminal justice."
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2335.213,2337.15,The first paragraph of Judge Jason’s opinion?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2337.15,2340.808,"No, Judge Jason’s opinion, I may be mistaken by it."
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2340.808,2345.263,"Well, I thought you said the Second Circuit said the Judge Jason’s opinion does that?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2345.263,2351.374,"No, the Second Circuit said that the New York Court of Appeals had implicitly decided the constitutional --"
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2351.374,2351.938,Okay.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2356.51,2358.7,Alright.
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2362.739,2366.832,It starts at page 40a.
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.832,2369.31,40a.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2369.31,2370.39,Alright.
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2436.128,2440.346,"Well, but there is no reference in that opinion to any provision of the Constitution?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2440.346,2445.818,"Alright, but we argued unconstitutionality in that quote, in our quote of that brief."
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2447.976,2461.485,"No, but then you must be able to convince us that your motion raising the constitutional question in a motion for us to set aside the verdict and the trial court was timely, that it should not have been made before that time?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2461.485,2465.109,"Alright, let us look directly to that issue then."
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.629,2474.423,"Did the court of New York, Court of Appeals agree with you on that?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2474.423,2477.734,New York Court of Appeals never said that the constitutional claim had been waived.
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2495.919,2500.993,"Mr. Young, I imagine one reason maybe you did not make a separate point of the constitutional issue in any of these."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2505.688,2511.115,"Well, Your Honor, it is hard to say that it was argued in passing when it specifically said secondly if the presumption is --"
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2511.115,2517.073,"Yeah, but if somebody read your, who just read the summary of argument in the [Inaudible] you never find the mention of the constitutionality."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2517.073,2525.429,"No, but well you do actually in the part addressing the state, the state argued that it was a constitutional presumption."
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.429,2530.269,"I see, but your point, it is under the point the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction, that is what you used?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2530.269,2537.179,"Yes, if you look at the brief to the Court of Appeals, that's set forth in the joint appendix at page, let us see --"
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2537.179,2538.12,40.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2538.12,2542.613,"40, well 50a is when the constitutional part of that is submitted."
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2542.613,2544.063,50a?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2544.063,2553.91,"50a and there again, the respondents plainly stated secondly, if the presumption is applicable here that it is unconstitutional as applied."
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2560.364,2565.28,"Well, you will surely admit that you did not argue that the statute was facially unconstitutional?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2565.28,2568.49,We will argue that that was preserved Your Honor for two reasons.
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2607.454,2616.974,"Coming back to several questions put to you, where did the Court of Appeals deal with the problem?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2616.974,2620.028,"Well, first of all, let us take it on two stages."
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2693.089,2699.578,"But they did duck it, they did not respond to your precise argument, which was it was unconstitutional as applied to these facts?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2699.578,2700.039,That is right.
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2700.039,2701.706,And they do not mention that argument.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2710.14,2711.086,"That is true Your Honor, but --"
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2711.086,2714.727,Is it pointed out in the opinion just what you are talking about?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2714.727,2725.362,"Yes, the Court of Appeals’ opinion is set forth in the petition, the New York Court of Appeals’ opinion is set forth in the petition for writ of certiorari."
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2725.362,2726.736,I just want to know what page?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2726.736,2729.864,"Okay, the page is, I have to find it again."
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.864,2734.1,The documents that used to be entitled brief for petition.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2734.1,2742.749,"Yeah, it still is on mind, but it's filled on with most finger prints on it since it has been used the longest."
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2755.291,2760.893,I want to point that too that this case has been decided by so many Supreme Court cases?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2760.893,2765.227,"No, I am saying that that is why they did not expressively address it here is because it had been --"
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2765.227,2767.84,But you gave me the impression that was in the opinion?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2767.84,2769.742,"Oh, I am sorry Your Honor, I did not mean to do that."
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2776.058,2777.897,Did the Circuit cycle analyzed it?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2777.897,2780.337,"Well, it was enough for the Second Circuit."
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2783.579,2786.369,"Well, then [Inaudible] analyzed to me because I have been on the Second Circuit while you had it."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2786.369,2793.159,"[Attempt to Laughter] Well, they thought that it was clear that the New York Court of Appeals had only found waivers."
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2793.159,2795.906,Where does it say that?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2795.906,2800.479,It does not expressly address the constitutional issue.
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2800.479,2808.634,"Well what do I -- If I write an opinion sustaining your position, what do I cite for what you just said, you?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2808.634,2821.856,"No, I would cite to the fact that respondents raised the constitutional issue and that since the Court of Appeals did not expressly address it, but did say that they felt that this presumption was valid --"
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2821.856,2823.081,Where was it that they said that?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2823.081,2824.552,"Alright, on pages --"
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2824.552,2826.449,I got to get quote at some place.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2826.449,2828.526,41 -- 43 through 45.
1978.77-1554,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2828.526,2841.769,"Counsel, if you take a look at the top of page 51a and see if that helps you."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2843.955,2847.085,"Yes, I believe that is Your Honor."
1978.77-1554,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2858.648,2863.592,"And that suggests that the issue is before the Court, perhaps?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2863.592,2864.592,"Well, it definitely --"
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2864.592,2868.855,"Well, it really suggests that the dissenters talk something about it."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2871.275,2873.76,"Well, it does suggest that the issue was before the court."
1978.77-1554,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2873.76,2878.136,"It was before the court in people against Terra, like in [Inaudible] New York."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2878.136,2895.906,"But since Judge Walker found it unconstitutional here in this case Your Honor, referring back to Terra, he was clearly saying that it is an issue here too."
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2931.493,2939.551,What if it is an established rule of New York practice that you must make a motion based on a constitutional claim at the time that judge charges the jury.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,2953.453,2959.205,"Alright, Your Honor, again you phrase that in terms of this being a charge case."
1978.77-1554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3028.825,3039.526,"Is the prosecutor saying correct with respect to the contention, the court’s paraphrase of the defense contention or correct to the court's statement that that is the prosecution’s position?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3039.526,3043.07,"Well, I think the last comment by the court makes that clear."
1978.77-1554,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3047.477,3048.203,What page you are on?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3048.203,3055.558,"Oh, I am sorry, page 15a, bottom of 14a, the last three lines of 14a and the first three lines of 15a."
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3055.558,3063.575,That does not mean that anybody says there was a proof just means there is no more proofs than the fact the gun and the defendant were both in the same car?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3063.575,3064.968,That is right and that is why --
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3064.968,3068.022,That does not mean there is no proof?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3068.022,3069.368,"Well, it does that the presumption --"
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3069.368,3077.885,All you are arguing is that you should not be able to infer possession from the presence of the gun and the defendant in the car at the same time?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3077.885,3078.955,That is right Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3084.975,3093.945,"Well, suppose the judge had said, all the evidence you have is that the gun was in the defendant’s hand in the car, is that all you had?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3096.694,3098.626,"Well, then they would not be relying on the presumption."
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3098.626,3099.839,That is right.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3099.839,3102.921,"Right, but here they have admitted that they were relying solely on the presumption."
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3102.921,3112.387,"[Inaudible] when Constitution questions on one sentence and one word by judge everybody else, only one word I know is [Inaudible]"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3112.387,3116.075,"Well, that is what the judge I think should have said, in this case, at this point."
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3116.075,3118.618,"Any other word, [Inaudible] did not they?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3118.618,3120.772,"I am sorry, I do not quite understand."
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3120.772,3125.451,"Oh, may be I do not know, I do not understand what you are talking about?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3125.451,3140.27,What I am saying is that the defendants’ due process rights were violated at the point that the state rested its case without presenting any actual proof of possession but instead relying solely on this presumption.
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3154.717,3160.052,"Mr. Young, the colloquy you referred to of course was in connection to the motion to dismiss the indictment, is that right?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3160.052,3161.248,That is right Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3161.248,3166.068,And is it correct that defendant though testified?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3166.068,3171.093,"Oh, you caught me totally unawares, it is long since long as I read the transcript, I am not sure, I do not think any of the defendants --"
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3171.093,3180.824,"The dissenting opinion is what puzzles me and as Mr. Justice Powell pointed out early, it refers to the fact that the defendant Doe was the only woman in the vehicle expressly admitted that it was her possession?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3180.824,3184.179,I think a police officer testified that she had made that admission Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3184.179,3187.559,"Oh, so there was other evidence then beside there was evidence about [Voice Overlap]"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3187.559,3191.407,Only evidence of Doe's possession and Doe was not a respondent here.
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3191.407,3196.729,I understand but there was some moral testimony about what happened at the time that the vehicle was stopped?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3196.729,3197.791,Well essentially all --
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3197.791,3203.219,So there was something more in the record other than the fact that the guns were in the car.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3203.219,3205.235,"No that was essentially it, as to these – as to the respondents --"
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3205.235,3211.183,"Well, you just told me a moment ago that police officer testified that she made some remarks concerning the location of the gun."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3211.183,3217.645,"Oh you mean that it is a bad evidence, yes that does not apply to the respondents, it only applies to Jane Doe."
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3217.645,3220.342,Would you mind reading me again what the judge asked?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3220.342,3230.988,"Yes, the court referring to the argument defense counsel had just made, he is saying that the only proof you have again is your presumption, right?"
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3233.448,3236.629,Well then that [Inaudible] it was all the evidence?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3236.629,3238.321,"Yes, that is all the evidence that they have."
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3238.321,3240.103,But they had a lot more evidence than that.
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3240.103,3244.056,All the evidence they relied on that [Voice Overlap] dismiss the indictment.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3244.056,3252.781,"Well, his next comment is the court - The defendant was in the car and the statute presumes, you have no other proof?"
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3254.901,3277.543,"Well we can look at the whole record and see what that means because it is ambiguous and it can't mean literally what it says because on this record, it is clear that these two, one an automatic and one a pistol 45 and a 38 and were in plain sight sticking out of the handbag."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3277.543,3279.247,"In plain sight to the police officer, Your Honor."
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3279.247,3281.501,"Well, then you mean they were not in plain sight to the driver."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3281.501,3295.151,"No, because they were in between the right front seat and the right front car door, next to which Jane Doe was sitting, so between the seat and Jane Doe, they were totally out of sight of everybody else in the car."
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3302.773,3311.294,You concede the officer could see it but you are saying that the jury could not reasonably infer that anyone in that car could see it?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3311.294,3317.287,"Well, number one I do not thing that, that is a reason to inference, but number two, sight is not all that is required for possession, Your Honor."
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3317.287,3319.427,"Well, I am just taking one segment of it."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3319.427,3319.97,Yes.
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3319.97,3325.762,There is other evidence besides what this colloquy the judge indicated.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3329.95,3336.147,"Right, one gun was totally out of sight because the police officer did not even see it until he had removed the first gun."
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3345.199,3355.251,The only point I am making is that is evidence from which a reasonable juror could reasonably conclude that other passengers in the car saw the same thing the officer did.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3355.251,3356.908,As to the bottom gun?
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3356.908,3358.883,As to the gun which was in plain sight.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3358.883,3360.526,"Alright, but they were convicted of both guns."
1978.77-1554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3365.561,3369.482,Is the crime greater for the possession of two guns than one?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3369.482,3373.644,"Well, the presumption was used to convict for both."
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3404.995,3409.087,But the presumption does not mean everybody automatically possessed that.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3417.484,3421.531,"No Your Honor, the reason I know is visibility, yes."
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3421.531,3421.765,Yeah.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3421.765,3423.167,But let us look at exactly what the presumption --
1978.77-1554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3423.167,3425.178,They do not have to accept the presumption?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3425.178,3431.134,"Alright, no they do not, but let us look at what the presumption means because it does not mean what Ms. Shapiro described to you."
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3444.097,3458.689,"If they conclude that they have come back with a guilty verdict, they would have violated their instructions unless they have found that beyond a reasonable doubt, every member in the car possessed the gun?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3458.689,3459.585,Well that is not –
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3459.585,3469.866,"The presumption, well, they have been told to find the defendant guilty unless they find the status prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3476.055,3494.761,"Well then Your Honor, let us look at page 25 of the joint appendix which contains the part of the judge’s charge addressing the presumption and there his lead of statement is our penal law also provides that the presence in an automobile of any handgun or firearm which is loaded is presumptive evidence of their unlawful possession."
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3497.352,3505.995,"I know but the jury nevertheless, it's presumptive evidence that is true, but nevertheless it has to be evidence that will convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, that is the instruction."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3505.995,3520.025,"Well, according to the New York Court of Appeals and I think this Court is bound by the New York Court of Appeals’ interpretation of the statute, New York Court of Appeals states in their opinion in this very case that the presumption creates a prima facial case against the defendant."
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3521.109,3524.219,I know that just means it is enough to get to the jury.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3524.219,3525.971,"That is right, enough to convict on."
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3525.971,3544.127,"Well, I know but the jury – yeah, but the jury nevertheless has to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, that is the way it was instructed and say, find the defendant guilty, without finding guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, they have violated their instructions."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3544.127,3545.697,Yes but based on --
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3545.697,3551.572,"Alright, but whatever the evidence is, it has to convince them beyond a reasonable doubt?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3551.572,3554.497,And the judge was telling them that they could reach their conclusion based only on this presumption.
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3554.497,3557.72,"I know but they don’t suggest it, they did not have to."
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3557.72,3558.384,"No, they did not have to."
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3558.384,3561.144,But they have to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3563.87,3566.535,"Yes, I can well, I can construe those together."
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3566.535,3575.472,"If you had, why do not you come up here and claim that some other section of the Constitution has been violated, that they have violated the beyond reasonable doubt standard?"
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3575.472,3577.647,"Well to a certain extent, this does because it --"
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3577.647,3580.476,Well that does not – that isn't the question you presented to us?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3580.476,3583.435,"I know because we do not feel that, that is the central issue here."
1978.77-1554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3626.203,3634.358,So are you really objecting to on a Sixth Amendment basis that they really interfered with your right to a jury trial?
1978.77-1554,1,36968,michael_young,,3634.358,3635.954,There are implications of that Your Honor.
1978.77-1554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3644.287,3646.18,You want us to affirm the –
