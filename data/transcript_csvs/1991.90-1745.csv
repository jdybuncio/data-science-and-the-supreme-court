1991.90-1745,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.122,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-1745, United States v. Richard Wilson."
1991.90-1745,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,60.222,63.24,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1745,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,191.875,198.279,"It did change... delete the language, saying that the Attorney General would determine the credit, though, didn't they?"
1991.90-1745,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,198.279,199.512,"It did, Your Honor."
1991.90-1745,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,219.293,232.0,"Well, I think the most logical reading of a change in the statute like that, where it used to say the Attorney General will determine it and now it doesn't say that is that Congress no longer meant for the Attorney General to determine it."
1991.90-1745,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,237.92,243.974,"Your Honor, this Court has stated that a change in language is just some evidence of a change in meaning."
1991.90-1745,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,313.654,314.57,Let me just pause you right there.
1991.90-1745,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,314.57,315.187,--Yes.
1991.90-1745,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,315.187,318.439,"Isn't that always going to be the case, even if the judge does it?"
1991.90-1745,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,323.176,324.626,"Yes, Your Honor, that's respondent's point."
1991.90-1745,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,328.678,330.228,You couldn't do it before.
1991.90-1745,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,330.228,334.815,"Well, theoretically you could do it before you pronounce sentence, but--"
1991.90-1745,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,334.815,342.052,"Well, if you did it before, you wouldn't know when the sentence was going to be imposed, so that there would be the same argument about not knowing when he is going to arrive at the jail, or the prison."
1991.90-1745,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,342.052,346.122,"--Your Honor, we think that our view has support from the history of this statute."
1991.90-1745,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,376.309,379.761,But the difference is you don't identify the person in the present statute.
1991.90-1745,0,17272,amy_l_wax,,414.517,426.508,"The problem with that, Your Honor, and this is really central to our argument, is that there are going to be periods of detention, periods of custody, that come after the imposition of sentence."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,1662.623,1664.956,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1745,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1708.318,1715.322,"Who... as originally introduced, was the bill... did the bill contain this language?"
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,1715.322,1716.007,I don't know that.
1991.90-1745,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.7,1735.485,I guess we'll have to read the law.
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,1739.789,1745.443,I'm sure Ms. Wax and I both will be more than happy to provide supplemental briefs.
1991.90-1745,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1923.889,1927.274,"Well, Mr. Martin, the problem doesn't lie with all that."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,1931.06,1931.376,"--Yes, ma'am."
1991.90-1745,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1931.376,1932.328,Are you going to talk about that?
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,1932.328,1932.828,"Yes, ma'am."
1991.90-1745,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2081.425,2091.714,"Mr. Martin, I mean, it's interesting how that might work and whatnot, but can we look at the text of the statute since we don't have any legislative history."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2115.646,2116.579,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2116.579,2118.515,For any time he has spent.
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2143.98,2145.248,"Justice Scalia, the reason that I think--"
1991.90-1745,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.248,2147.382,Why wouldn't it say for any time he will have spent?
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2162.794,2163.56,"--Yes, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.075,2194.562,"But obviously, but they use the date the sentence commences because that will sometimes differ from the date of judgment."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2197.931,2198.464,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.464,2202.668,So we have to focus on that area where there is a difference.
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2202.668,2203.018,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2203.018,2208.739,"And where there is a difference, if they had meant the judge to impose the sentence, it seems to me they would have said, for any time you shall have spent."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2208.739,2209.256,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2263.825,2270.479,"Well, I would think that if you are right that the sentence... you say sentence begins when the judge--"
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2270.479,2271.946,"Yes, sir, in most cases."
1991.90-1745,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.946,2272.598,--Is that general rule?
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2272.598,2272.914,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2278.216,2284.137,Is there some statutory provision that says the sentence begins when the judge's gavel comes down?
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2284.137,2286.672,"--No, sir, that was my colloquial approach."
1991.90-1745,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.672,2287.139,I know.
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2291.024,2292.274,"No, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.915,2304.532,Either one.
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2304.532,2305.184,"Yes, sir, either one."
1991.90-1745,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.562,2330.299,When would it never... why would it ever be the case that it would begin only when he arrives at the penitentiary?
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2330.299,2340.774,"If the person is not in custody and is allowed to self-report to the designated institution, which happens less and less often, then the sentence would commence at the time of the arrival at the institution."
1991.90-1745,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2340.774,2345.576,"Of course, if he's out, if he's out, why he... there wouldn't be any problem."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2345.576,2345.976,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.976,2350.479,"Then the judge would know how much time, if any, he had ever spent before he sentenced."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2350.479,2351.612,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2351.612,2357.116,"And he would also... it would also commence later if he's released on a State detainer, wouldn't it?"
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2357.116,2359.068,If he's in State custody and a Federal detainer?
1991.90-1745,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2359.835,2364.389,"No, if he's in Federal custody, he's sentenced, there's a State detainer against him."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2369.607,2382.867,"--That could happen, and what would probably happen under those circumstances, if he's in Federal custody, if he was released at some point to the State on a writ, it would be only for the purpose of judicial proceeding and he would be returned back to Federal custody to continue serving his sentence."
1991.90-1745,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2387.505,2400.228,"But there could be cases in which immediately following the imposition of sentence, instead of being turned over to the marshals for transportation to a Federal prison, he's turned over to State officials for transportation to some State courthouse for a trial."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2407.082,2412.45,That would more likely occur when he's already in State custody to begin with and he's been borrowed under writ for the Federal court.
1991.90-1745,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2421.056,2421.842,You're just saying it's unlikely.
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2423.075,2423.742,It's extremely unlikely.
1991.90-1745,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2625.139,2627.289,Why doesn't their intent frustrate the Federal intent?
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2633.661,2633.961,"--Yes, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2635.377,2639.981,Are you saying the States have the power to frustrate the Federal intent?
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2639.981,2649.587,--I wouldn't characterize it as frustration of Federal intent if it's a matter that's in the control of the State courts and is left within the control of the State courts by the Federal courts.
1991.90-1745,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.587,2653.789,"Well, it's only left within the control of the State courts if you interpret the statute the way you want to interpret it."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2666.346,2666.548,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2666.548,2668.431,And that can be achieved by letting the Attorney General do it.
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2668.431,2670.016,Not necessarily.
1991.90-1745,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.716,2726.235,That's a result that flows from the text of the Federal statute.
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2735.959,2736.409,"--Yes, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2736.409,2748.866,"But the way you want to do it, there will be... even though before his Federal sentence is completed it is credited in the State, the crediting will count."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2761.841,2771.966,I will concede that there can be scenarios under which the district court making the determination could result in the award of double credit.
1991.90-1745,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2794.462,2810.774,--Is one of your concerns in this case that the district judge should have before it the credit and make the calculation of the credit so that the judge can take that into account in determining the base sentence?
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2810.774,2811.741,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2813.293,2838.758,"But then, defendants are being treated differently because if there is a credit that arises by reason of detentions that are after the imposition of the sentence but before it commences, the judge can't do that, so then you are imposing on us a regime where defendants are treated differently, which is precisely what the Congress did not want."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2838.758,2862.476,"--I think, Justice Kennedy, that if you assume that Congress intended for this decision to be made at some point in time, at some precise point in time, either imposition of sentence or commencement of sentence, if those are different dates, that if the decision is made at a precise point in time, there are going to be people who for arbitrary reasons fall on one side or the other of that line."
1991.90-1745,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2871.664,2891.059,"Well, it's not arbitrary if the Bureau of Prisons does it, because it's all after the fact, and under the Government's position, the judge would be encouraged to set the base decision without reference to the credit time, which it seems to me quite a logical design of the statute in any event."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,2893.678,2901.517,--There are two possible... and these are not articulated in the Government's brief... there are two possible alternatives the Bureau of Prisons make in this determination.
1991.90-1745,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3031.465,3038.138,"You don't suggest, do you, Mr. Martin, that there's discretion confided to whoever determines sentencing credit?"
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,3038.138,3038.605,"No, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3051.196,3060.135,"So while it's obviously important to the defendant, it does not depend on any peculiar merit of his."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,3060.135,3060.502,"Oh, no, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3066.973,3079.298,"I'm still not entirely clear, because I think sometimes you didn't quite complete your answers before, but how do you handle the case in which after the trial judge imposes the sentence, there's an appeal and the defendant is out on bond."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,3087.602,3089.238,There are two ways.
1991.90-1745,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3097.594,3098.344,"Well, let's say it doesn't."
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,3100.796,3102.831,A couple of different ways.
1991.90-1745,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3127.196,3127.629,All right.
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,3129.565,3129.981,"Yes, sir."
1991.90-1745,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3129.981,3137.385,What if the event that transpires in the interval is one that makes it clear that he is not entitled to a credit that he might have been entitled to?
1991.90-1745,1,27559,henry_a_martin,,3145.675,3152.394,I think that in that case that the concern then is that he not receive double credit.
1991.90-1745,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3323.837,3325.037,Just a couple of quick points.
1991.90-1745,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3351.904,3355.372,But most of the time those delays won't result in any additional credit.
1991.90-1745,2,17272,amy_l_wax,,3355.372,3356.558,"They sometimes will, Your Honor."
1991.90-1745,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3356.558,3357.424,"They sometimes would, I understand."
1991.90-1745,3,27559,henry_a_martin,,3359.593,3365.68,"As a numerical matter, yes, most sentencing credit issues are routine issues involving presentencing credit."
1991.90-1745,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3387.593,3400.234,"And even in those cases where it doesn't make any difference in the sentencing, it at least explains... it leaves unexplained why the phraseology is for any time he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences."
1991.90-1745,4,17272,amy_l_wax,,3400.234,3401.534,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1991.90-1745,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.151,3406.555,It's an unnatural way to put it if this kind of a situation is common.
1991.90-1745,4,17272,amy_l_wax,,3406.555,3410.607,"--It certainly doesn't fit with the language and it doesn't fit with the reality, either."
1991.90-1745,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3467.092,3467.875,"Thank you, Ms. Wax."
