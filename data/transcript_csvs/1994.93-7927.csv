1994.93-7927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.347,"We'll hear argument now in Number 93-7927, Curtis Lee Kyles v. John P. Whitley."
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,9.057,12.399,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.372,232.433,"Before you get onto that, was Beanie called at trial?"
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,232.433,234.735,--He was not called to testify at trial.
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.276,247.033,"But you assert that the defendant's main hope for acquittal was that Beanie did it, yet the defense did not call Beanie?"
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,247.033,258.529,"That is true, Your Honor, and that is the subject of the ineffective-assistance portion of this claim which has been addressed in the lower courts and is part of the cert petition here, though we did not address in our brief, and that is--"
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,258.529,263.433,"--purposes we have to assume that that was not incompetent assistance of counsel, I assume?"
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,263.433,263.984,"--Well, on the Brady claim... that's right."
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.299,415.082,I thought the rebuttal to that was that they didn't list all of the cars.
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,415.773,416.872,Your Honor--
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,416.872,418.975,--Is there a factual dispute about that?
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,418.975,421.868,"--There is a factual dispute about that, but I don't think it's important."
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,590.418,597.583,"Yes, but all we have for it is your word that the two are not recognizable one from the other except when you see them both standing up."
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,600.455,600.735,No.
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,600.735,601.546,--conceded by everybody?
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,601.546,602.206,"No, that's not right, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,604.609,606.019,Are they part of the record?
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,606.019,623.13,"--Yes, the photographs are a part of the record, and I'd be glad to give you the exhibit numbers, if you'd like the... Kyles is S-45, trial exhibit, and D-19 in the postconviction, and then Beanie's mug shot has two numbers at trial, either D-4 or S-44."
1994.93-7927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,695.929,699.081,There were witnesses who said they didn't look alike?
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,699.081,705.474,"There were witnesses who... no, there were no witnesses who said they didn't look alike."
1994.93-7927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,769.376,779.522,"But isn't it also the case... isn't it also the case that you were in, or the trial counsel was in just as good a position to go after Smallwood at the second trial as he would have been if the disclosure had been made?"
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,779.522,780.413,"No, that's not true."
1994.93-7927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,780.413,781.174,Why not?
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,781.174,789.359,"Because at the first... you're referring, I assume, to the first trial, the testimony at the first trial to which the State refers in its brief, and the difference--"
1994.93-7927,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,789.359,790.601,"The difference between... that's right, yes."
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,790.601,793.723,--There was no difference on the critical point.
1994.93-7927,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,865.438,875.276,"Well, I... just to follow up on that one point, why is it that the first trial testimony was not wholly sufficient for the impeachment purposes without the statement?"
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,875.276,887.893,"--Because the first trial said that Smallwood... both trials, his testimony at both trials was that he saw the assailant outside the car, standing up, walking, clear shot at him."
1994.93-7927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,921.494,925.417,But you haven't explained... I'm not sure... is that also... is that different from the suppressed statement?
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,925.417,927.267,"--Yes, I'm sorry."
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.326,954.607,He must have taken a long time to turn around after the pop.
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,954.607,956.768,"Well, what--"
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,956.768,965.182,"There's a gunshot, and he turns around, and the fellow who did the gunshot at close range had already gone to the car, gotten in the car, and is driving by?"
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,965.182,971.567,"--You might have... Your Honor, he doesn't say... he says he heard the gunshot, and then he's trying to--"
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,971.567,973.289,--he sort of stood there and--
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,973.289,980.312,"--The police officer asked him exactly that question, Your Honor, in the... it's at Joint Appendix 189 through '90."
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,996.555,997.557,"--It doesn't make any sense, is all I'm saying."
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,997.557,998.865,"--Well, let me explain."
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1203.59,1206.1,It's not necessarily false evidence by Smallwood.
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1210.993,1229.837,"--Your Honor, the reason I am prepared to draw that conclusion, although that's possible, is that State has acknowledged in its brief that it was false, and it seems to me that if the State can draw that inference, I can draw it, but the most important thing, obviously, is that a juror could draw the inference that the contemporaneous statement is the better description than one several months later."
1994.93-7927,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1506.476,1507.067,Mr. Liebman--
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1507.067,1507.377,Yes.
1994.93-7927,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1507.377,1510.811,"--before you finish that, I ask you just to clarify two legal points."
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1519.817,1532.214,"That is correct, Your Honor, because the Brady claim encompasses everything that was lost to the jury by the ineffectiveness claim, but then so much more, the narrow ground for the court, is the Brady claim, because the prejudice analysis is the same."
1994.93-7927,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1532.214,1543.623,"My other question is there's a peculiar reference in the Fifth Circuit opinion, two references to Brecht, and you started out by saying Bagley is the standard."
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1550.487,1561.426,"Brecht would enter into the case only if there were an error, in which case it might be analyzed as a... on the harmless error, but the Fifth Circuit's second reference to Brecht says that since we didn't find an error, we don't have to get to the Brecht standard."
1994.93-7927,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.211,1587.034,"Mr. Liebman, could you comment on the dog food evidence?"
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1587.034,1589.074,"--Yes, I'd be glad to do that, Justice Stevens."
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1670.069,1674.932,But what was withheld that would have destroyed that was simply the photograph of--
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1674.932,1677.854,"No, Your Honor, the photograph was presented at trial."
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1681.546,1682.347,"--Oh, I see."
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1682.347,1684.208,--and you can't build a case on that.
1994.93-7927,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1684.208,1684.478,I see.
1994.93-7927,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1684.478,1696.727,"Finally is Curtis Kyles' testimony about the food, and all I can say on that, Your Honor, is that if you look at the Schwegmann's advertising manager, he confirmed every specific of what Curtis Kyles said."
1994.93-7927,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1733.051,1734.381,"Very well, Mr. Liebman."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,1736.04,1742.026,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1814.075,1823.872,"Mr. Peebles, before you get into that, is it common ground that there was a duty to disclose the suppressed statements and the information that Mr. Liebman talked about?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,1823.872,1824.381,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1832.816,1834.188,"No, but... excuse me just a minute."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,1845.855,1846.386,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1846.386,1847.007,You would not.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,1847.007,1855.923,"As we interpret Bagley, the mere fact that evidence might be favorable, or potentially favorable to the other side, does not create a duty to disclose."
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1897.71,1907.585,"Well, do you agree that anything that would amount to substantial impeaching evidence in relation to evidence the State had put in would be subject to disclosure?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,1907.585,1937.856,"I think it should be... if it was substantially impeaching, I think it should be turned over, Your Honor, as a matter of ethical obligation, and I believe that in this case, had the prosecutors believed that these statements contained substantial impeachment material, they would have turned them over, but whether or not they acted correctly ethically in making their decision not to turn these statements over, we submit that the issue before the Court is whether the Constitution was violated by this action."
1994.93-7927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1937.856,1947.173,"When you say, you think they were under an ethical obligation of under some... you do not say that is the same thing as what the Constitution requires?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,1947.173,1948.162,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1949.303,1955.338,So that it is not your view that substantial impeaching testimony would be subject to the Brady obligation?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,1955.338,1967.335,It would not be unless the failure to disclose that information would create a reasonable probability that you might have a different outcome in either the penalty hearing or the guilt--
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1967.335,1973.92,"Well, you... I take it from the way you answer that you believe this judgment should be made on an item-by-item basis."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,1990.71,1998.444,"--Your Honor, when the prosecutor is making these decisions, it unfortunately is usually on an item-by-item basis, but when a reviewing court--"
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1998.444,2000.708,Your view is that that is the standard that we should apply?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2000.708,2001.145,--No.
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2001.496,2002.016,Okay.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2002.016,2017.467,"The standard for the reviewing court, we submit, is to consider all of the trial and all of the evidence which was presented at trial, and the nondisclosed evidence, and consider the evidence cumulatively, and that's what the Fifth Circuit did, and they said that."
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2017.467,2023.332,That standard does not give much guidance to the prosecutor as to what its constitutional obligation is--
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2023.332,2023.933,It certainly does not.
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2023.933,2024.654,"--under Brady, it seems to me."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2024.654,2025.552,"It certainly does not, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2063.025,2066.248,"Well, I'm... I want to get back to this point about ethics."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2090.254,2090.795,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2090.795,2091.255,Okay.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2091.255,2091.987,That's my position.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2091.987,2093.567,May I ask one other preliminary question?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2102.573,2104.987,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2104.987,2112.741,"Now, is... was there a duty on the part of the police to disclose to the prosecutor... how do we measure what the prosecutor would have done if he'd--"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2112.741,2113.032,Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2113.032,2117.834,"--known about it, or are the police allowed to withhold sort of in a separate... is there a separate standard for that?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2117.834,2120.875,"Your Honor, I don't think the police are entitled to a separate standard."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2143.602,2149.636,"And didn't one of the prosecutors testify that had some of this material been presented to him, he would have turned it over?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2149.636,2150.417,--He would have turned it over.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2150.417,2150.728,Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2150.728,2151.289,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2175.394,2176.105,"Well, take a specific example."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2179.127,2179.788,Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2179.788,2180.99,--with an important part of the trial.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2180.99,2181.399,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2181.399,2182.571,Was there a duty to disclose that?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2182.571,2188.604,"The... it should have been disclosed, in my opinion--"
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2188.604,2189.694,Was there a constitutional duty to disclose that?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2189.694,2190.926,--There was a... no.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2190.926,2191.537,No.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2191.537,2194.058,Not under the context of this case.
1994.93-7927,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.058,2194.889,"Mr. Peebles, I--"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2194.889,2195.728,If I may elaborate... I'm sorry.
1994.93-7927,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2195.728,2197.46,--I don't understand the test you're giving us.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2224.578,2227.621,"As we appreciate the Bagley test, Your Honor, that is the rule."
1994.93-7927,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2230.022,2232.563,So you can never say that any single piece of evidence has to be turned over.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2232.563,2233.224,--Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.278,2241.098,Let me put it the other way.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2244.422,2250.987,"--A prosecutor might have a duty to disclose it, but I don't think it would create a constitutional violation."
1994.93-7927,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2250.987,2251.217,He would not know before the fact.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2269.859,2271.061,I think that's what Bagley says.
1994.93-7927,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2271.061,2271.57,"That's crazy, isn't it?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2271.57,2273.493,"Well, I think that's what Bagley says, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.493,2274.362,I don't.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2274.362,2275.073,I submit--
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2275.073,2286.77,"Wasn't Bagley concerned, in that respect, simply with the issue of substantially undermining the verdict, and wasn't that the sense in which Bagley was getting into cumulativeness?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2286.77,2288.731,--Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2309.404,2325.355,"So on a Brady proceeding, where the prosecution denies it has to turn something over, the trial court does make an evidence-by-evidence ruling, as to whether or not each bit of evidence is inculpatory or exculpatory?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2325.355,2326.607,Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2339.535,2344.75,But the standards the prosecutors have to use is on an evidence-by-evidence--
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2344.75,2345.179,"--Yes, case--"
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2345.179,2346.12,--standard?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2346.12,2349.101,"--evidence... that's the only one we can use, Your Honor, because we don't know what the evidence is going to be--"
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2349.101,2349.742,Precisely.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2349.742,2358.708,"--until after the case is over, and it's so much easier to look at a case after it's over, especially long after it's over, than it is at the time."
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2386.364,2390.408,"May I just ask one more preliminary question, and I thought it was clear, but maybe it isn't."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2398.453,2399.063,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2399.063,2407.058,Isn't the State held to a disclosure standard based on what all State officers at the time knew?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2407.058,2407.969,"The State is, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2407.969,2408.37,Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2408.841,2409.96,No question about that.
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2413.043,2420.268,"--So there might well be a Brady violation, even though there was no... as you were saying earlier, there was no unethical conduct on the part of a given prosecutor."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2420.268,2432.336,"If by a Brady violation you mean the obligation to turn over anything that is of potential value to the defendant, we... our argument is that if you want to define the Brady violation that way, that's fine."
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2458.594,2468.291,"No, but my only point was whatever the test is, there could be a Brady violation and still not be any unethical conduct on the part of a prosecutor if he did not know--"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2468.291,2468.842,If it was inadvertent--
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2468.842,2469.239,--That's right.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2469.239,2472.1,"--that's correct, and I think that's probably what happened in this case."
1994.93-7927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2513.158,2515.902,How was it discovered 4 years afterwards?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2515.902,2523.175,"On postconviction relief, the entire DA's file and the police files were made available to counsel for the petitioner."
1994.93-7927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2523.175,2525.827,"Was that, what, by court order of the State court?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2525.827,2531.089,"I don't recall whether there was a court order, but we did it voluntarily, I do know that."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2538.626,2547.832,"Well, isn't it rather clear that if the printout had been available to the prosecutor, that the prosecutor could not have made the argument about the picture, which was right near to the scene, that he did make?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2547.832,2549.392,"No, Your Honor, I submit that it's not clear."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.809,2561.37,"Right, and the picture was also the immediate vicinity, wasn't it?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2561.37,2564.982,"I submit that the picture represented a car that was not in the immediate area, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2569.855,2571.277,"Your opponent just misrepresented the record to us, then."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2571.277,2582.915,"It's a... it's a question of interpretation of the evidence, the interpretation of the pictures and that, but that picture of that car was not a major part of the State's case."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2586.558,2587.988,"It was part of the State's affirmative case, though, wasn't it?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2587.988,2588.269,--It was.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2605.869,2607.18,How many of the eye witnesses--
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2607.18,2607.481,--of this trial.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.481,2609.742,--were able to identify the height of the perpetrator?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2609.742,2614.594,"They all gave opinions, Your Honor, regarding the height of the perpetrator, as I recall."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2725.999,2729.051,"You're talking about just based on their statements, not on the trial testimony?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2729.051,2730.012,"--The trial testimony, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2730.012,2732.854,The trial... seven eye witnesses testified--
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2732.854,2733.185,"No, no."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2739.599,2740.309,--But there were--
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2740.309,2741.33,--three of those gave statements.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2741.33,2742.682,"--When you refer to seven, it was seven--"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2742.682,2743.2,Their statements.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.2,2744.051,--statements given to the police.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2744.051,2745.764,Six statements were given to the police.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2745.764,2749.324,"Six, and how many of those six were turned over, (a) to the prosecutor, and (b) to the defense?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2749.324,2762.244,"We're not certain that the prosecutor saw those statements, but for purposes of this case, I think we have to assume that they either saw the statements or that they should have seen them."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2762.244,2769.229,What you're saying in part is that it is possible the prosecutors were not aware of the statements and any possible discrepancies between the statements and the--
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2769.229,2769.627,Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2770.959,2773.931,--So they wouldn't have had a duty to correct the errors in the witness' statements.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2773.931,2774.152,--Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2946.645,2956.332,"Well, but according to your opponent, he... if he... it makes a big difference if you... if you rely on the size of the perpetrator, whether he saw him outside the car or not."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2956.332,2957.964,"Well, we submit--"
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2957.964,2959.243,"There is that discrepancy, isn't there?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2959.243,2961.514,--We submit that there... it doesn't make that much difference.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2962.025,2969.792,"No, but is it not correct that there is a discrepancy between the suppressed statement and the testimony as to whether he saw him outside the car?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2969.792,2970.233,--Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2970.233,2970.623,There is.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2970.623,2971.074,Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2971.074,2972.994,And your point is that that's not--
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2972.994,2977.469,"That didn't make any difference, and then he came within 15 feet of him and drove slowly by."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2977.469,2979.539,"--Of course, driving by in a car, you couldn't tell how tall he was."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,2979.539,2980.05,No.
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2986.846,3001.126,"If we'd have had time to ask the petitioner's counsel, both of the... Beanie and the defendant were in court, and all four witnesses looked at both of them in court and said that it's definitely not Beanie."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3001.126,3002.346,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3002.346,3010.962,"What has the defense, or the petitioner's response been to that in previous proceedings, that--"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3010.962,3013.884,The response is that there was a misidentification--
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3013.884,3015.476,--to say that this was suggestive--
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3015.476,3037.588,"--They are saying that because there had been one prior trial, which it ended in a mistrial, and there had been prior pretrial hearings in which Kyles had appeared in court and was seen by these witnesses, that this... this influenced them in deciding at this trial, the previous occasions on which they had seen Beanie had influenced them on this occasion."
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3044.044,3045.506,--Was Beanie seen in the first trial?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3045.506,3046.615,"--No, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3046.615,3048.688,Or was not identified?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3048.688,3050.609,He was not identified at the first trial.
1994.93-7927,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.562,3062.596,"Mr. Peebles, I don't know why you concede that once inside a car a fire plug and a bean pole look alike."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3065.34,3066.289,I don't concede that.
1994.93-7927,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3066.289,3067.601,--in the height of these two people in the legs?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3067.872,3069.262,"I don't concede that, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3069.262,3072.293,"--the torsos are the same height, and one of them has very short legs and the other inordinately long?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3072.293,3074.504,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I didn't intend to concede that point."
1994.93-7927,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3074.504,3074.784,"Ah, you did."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3084.21,3087.433,"I would rephrase it, Your Honor, to say that it would be more difficult to determine the height of a person in the car."
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3109.817,3111.019,And Beanie was in the line-ups?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3111.019,3114.051,"He was not, but they all picked out Kyles."
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3114.051,3116.453,Were the witnesses ever shown mug shots of Beanie?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3116.453,3126.77,"I think one of them was, Your Honor, my recollection is, I can't tell you which one, and that that one said... on postconviction, that one said that it was not... it was not Beanie."
1994.93-7927,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3149.153,3154.076,"There's no indication why the police didn't show... didn't put Beanie in the line-up, is there?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3154.076,3155.268,"--He was not a suspect, Your Honor."
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3159.632,3161.892,"Well, has everybody in the line-up got to be a suspect?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3161.892,3162.871,--No.
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3164.353,3166.614,"So, then, why was that an answer to Justice Ginsburg's question?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3166.614,3168.477,"--Well, he was not under arrest or anything."
1994.93-7927,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3171.148,3172.31,I presume neither do--
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3175.171,3181.086,"Yes, he was the informant, but the police at no time suspected Beanie of being a suspect in this case."
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3188.752,3197.715,"Well, it's pretty clear that he was complicit in this taking of the stolen automobile, or in the use of a stolen automobile, that he knew that it was stolen."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3197.715,3202.97,--I think... I would suggest that probably that is a conclusion that could be drawn by a rational person.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3238.664,3245.517,"About the sales slip, I was curious, is it the State's position that the sales slip was the slip of the victim's purchases?"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3245.517,3248.939,"--Your Honor, we can't know that for sure."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3249.35,3251.18,What was their theory in presenting it?
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3252.232,3253.123,--The theory was that it probably was the--
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3253.123,3256.807,--Even though it was much... then smaller than her normal amount of purchases.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3256.807,3257.375,--Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3257.375,3260.767,"Yes, that she did not make her typical purchases that week."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3260.767,3262.049,Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3264.441,3265.092,But she did make her typical purchases of dog food.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3265.092,3266.541,--I'm sorry?
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3266.541,3269.143,But she did make her typical purchases of dog food but of nothing--
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3269.143,3269.533,Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3269.533,3270.244,--else in her weekly shopping.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3270.244,3270.575,Yes.
1994.93-7927,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3342.54,3344.102,"Well, as to the garbage, he might have planted that first."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3344.102,3344.913,He might have.
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3350.406,3355.83,"But of course, the prosecutor argued that he wasn't even there on Sunday when they knew he was, if I remember--"
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3355.83,3357.469,"--Well, I don't think the prosecutor knew that as a fact."
1994.93-7927,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3357.469,3357.89,--The police knew he was.
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3360.221,3376.233,"The police said that they... the police contact with this man was Detective Miller, and Detective Miller didn't even inform his... the principal homicide detective in this case of most of the things that he did with his informant."
1994.93-7927,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3462.79,3464.55,"Your time has expired, Mr. Peebles."
1994.93-7927,1,32323,jack_peebles,,3465.582,3467.682,Thank you very much.
