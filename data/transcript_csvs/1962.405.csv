1962.405,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,19.396,21.003,Mr. Chief Justice --
1962.405,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,21.003,22.122,Mr. Roberts.
1962.405,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,22.122,23.916,-- members of the Court.
1962.405,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,232.102,237.386,What were the dates of the determination in the amount of the fee?
1962.405,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,237.386,247.941,"On November 15, 1961, that was after the last notice of the federal tax lien had been filed Your Honor."
1962.405,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,471.717,474.001,[Inaudible] --
1962.405,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,474.001,474.503,Yes sir.
1962.405,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,474.503,494.444,"Do you concede that being the amount of the attorney's fees wasn't fixed, or has he known, if they have the foreclosure, obviously you will have an attorney's fee and referring to [Inaudible] of the foreclosure decision."
1962.405,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,500.589,502.209,Yes Your Honor.
1962.405,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1093.001,1112.596,"Suppose Mr. Roberts the attorney's fees were passed as cost by the court not under the mortgage and like the British practice, they tax cost for attorney's fee, is there -- would you then assume that those costs [Inaudible]"
1962.405,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,1112.596,1115.349,"No, I would not Your Honor for this reason."
1962.405,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1128.689,1131.154,Or a state may do it.
1962.405,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,1131.154,1149.44,"A state may do it as it did in Buffalo Savings Bank, Your Honor, and this Court 8 to 1 said that it could not in a per curiam opinion, said that the Court or the State cannot characterize this as cost and therefore, jump ahead of the federal tax lien."
1962.405,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1179.482,1188.052,Buffalo involved the taxing of cost arising out of the language of the [Inaudible].
1962.405,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,1224.67,1228.344,"We submit that it would, Your Honor Buffalo and the other cases of this Court."
1962.405,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1575.631,1576.854,"You may, Mr. Roberts."
1962.405,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1576.854,1588.934,"Mr. Roberts, [Inaudible]"
1962.405,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,1588.934,1596.675,It is respondent's position that the mortgage itself provided for attorney's fees.
1962.405,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1615.898,1622.584,[Inaudible]
1962.405,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,1622.584,1635.602,"In the record, I'm trying to find it now, Your Honor."
1962.405,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1704.046,1714.152,"What would be your view if the mortgage liquidated the amount of the attorney's fees, mortgage instrument?"
1962.405,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,1714.152,1725.129,"There, Your Honor, I think you would have to look then to the state law to determine whether or not it really could do so."
1962.405,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1827.63,1829.561,You may have three minutes to close --
1962.405,0,40317,richard_m_roberts,,1829.561,1829.815,Thank you.
1962.405,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1829.815,1831.752,"-- if you wish, Mr. Roberts."
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,1836.297,1840.869,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.161,2360.215,"[Inaudible] that the Buffalo Savings Bank case that if the mortgagee had immediately prior to sale paid delinquent local taxes and added it to the mortgage, your argument would be that that's part of the mortgage, secured by the mortgage and the federal lien must give way."
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2360.215,2373.428,Still we do not believe that in the Buffalo Savings Bank case under the note and the mortgage that the matter was specifically contracted for as it is in this case.
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.213,2382.527,Does your mortgage for example provide that the mortgagee may pay delinquent taxes if it wants to and added it to the mortgage?
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2382.527,2383.762,"Yes it does, but --"
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.762,2384.264,But wouldn't you claim --
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2384.264,2385.378,-- but this was not provided --
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2385.378,2393.954,Wouldn't you claim -- wouldn't you claim that if the mortgagee did so that those amounts are added to the lien and have priority over the federal tax.
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2393.954,2399.627,"If that question was before the Court no doubt we would, yes."
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.119,2446.139,The Buffalo Saving didn't involve -- when the liens became Choate to the -- when it claims to be Choate.
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2455.314,2464.831,"Well, we contend that it should be recognized whether -- and we contend that it is Choate but that it should be recognized whether or not it is."
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.831,2474.983,Why do you think its Choate prior -- why do you think it was Choate prior to the time the Government filed that lien?
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2474.983,2475.106,The Government --
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.106,2477.481,Just by the filing of the action?
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2477.481,2483.014,"No, the Government referred to the matter of being fixed and determined at a certain time."
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.603,2507.931,"Well, yes, but at the time the Government's lien was filed, could you tell that, could you have told anyone about the attorney's fee was going to be in amount?"
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2507.931,2514.094,"No, but it could be determined what the maximum amount of it might have been, just to -- it computed -- it could be computed --"
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.094,2519.606,It was simply the maximum but it wasn't the -- they might not have gotten anything.
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2519.606,2529.684,"The principal is in terms of maximum too so far as the date that the federal tax lien is affixed that the principal may be paid after that date, enters the same way, it maybe (Voice Overlap)."
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2529.684,2543.305,"But as of the date the federal tax lien was filed, no attorney's fee result to anybody, but the Court has to order its payment."
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2543.305,2558.82,"There was a default and it was clear that there would be an attorney's fee the amount that was not known, that's true, but except in the same sense that we contend that all of these other elements were known, it was subject to a maximum amount, it might have been diminished."
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.82,2564.534,But the obligation to pay the fee wasn't settled either at that time.
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2564.534,2566.481,It had been contracted for.
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.481,2570.944,"Yes, but -- but you couldn't have sued for an attorney's fee on that day."
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2570.944,2571.985,Quite right.
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.985,2576.036,You'd have been subject to [Inaudible]
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2576.036,2578.763,"Well, we hadn't earned as much as we did later on when the --"
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2578.763,2578.948,Yes.
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2578.948,2579.799,-- proceeding was finished.
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2581.834,2586.682,You don't think that it has anything to do with the case of being Choate?
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2586.682,2590.556,"Well, we feel that this is a matter of contract."
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2609.477,2630.381,"Well, do you -- do you think the Government would take the same position if their lien was filed after the -- let's assume that there'd been a -- its lien was filed at a time after the amount of attorney's fees had been definitely settled and order to be paid?"
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2630.381,2636.654,I would say they would not claim priority in that case.
1962.405,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2891.012,2905.104,"We'll recess now Mr. â€“ [Recess] Mr. Pearce, you may continue your argument."
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,2905.104,2908.079,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.405,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3102.723,3103.899,It was a bankruptcy case?
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3103.899,3108.33,Yes which was mentioned by Mr. Roberts in his presentation.
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3148.053,3170.511,[Inaudible]
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3170.511,3177.447,"Well, it would be limited to the amount by statute and I would presume that the additional amount would be like it was under the old law which was unenforceable."
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.447,3209.066,[Inaudible]
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3209.066,3214.296,I think that would be a matter of contract and it would seem that it'd be limited to the $500.
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3214.296,3220.143,[Inaudible]
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3220.143,3220.917,"Well, the Court can."
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3220.917,3221.995,The Court can?
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3221.995,3222.485,Yes.
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3222.485,3224.301,And why is that?
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3224.301,3229.355,"Well, the Court passes on these fees just as it did -- in foreclosure just as they did in this case."
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3229.355,3231.626,[Inaudible]
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3231.626,3233.477,"Yes, that's true."
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3245.941,3251.227,[Inaudible]
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3251.227,3255.554,That's correct Your Honor.
1962.405,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3414.189,3425.017,"Your last point -- your -- your last point was that this a Durham Lumber or an Aqualino situation where the attorney's fee was never the property of the taxpayer, is that it --"
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3425.017,3425.282,Yes Your Honor.
1962.405,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3425.282,3426.56,-- under state law?
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3426.56,3440.815,"Any situation we can imagine here whether the Government lien played a part here or what it did not play a part here if there were sufficient funds to go around, still the taxpayer does not get the funds that are used to pay the attorney's fee."
1962.405,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3460.767,3462.445,But that is -- is that your law?
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3471.007,3483.997,"In subject to the mortgage lien, a component part of which is the attorney's fee and the Rogers, the Rogers would not realize any money from the surplus if they were a surplus until after the attorney's fee had been paid."
1962.405,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3483.997,3492.798,"Well, of course, I take it to the Rogers could pay the attorney's fee without requiring his payment of the proceeds to the foreclosure sale, couldn't they know it?"
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3492.798,3494.576,The Rogers are the owners of the property.
1962.405,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3494.576,3497.835,[Inaudible]
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3497.835,3502.73,The Rogers haven't paid it and they're not going to pay unless it's paid out of the proceeds of the property.
1962.405,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3546.247,3555.267,"Well, I'm -- what concerns me, its conceptually whether that means that the Rogers have no interest in the property and the proceeds until after the (Voice Overlap)."
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3555.267,3557.201,They have some interest if Your Honor please.
1962.405,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3557.201,3565.017,They do but you say that if there's $5000 left that they have an interest only in $3750.
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3566.875,3571.841,"Well -- yes, if there's a $5000 left before the attorney's fee is taken out."
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3573.001,3579.473,Not if -- let's still assume that there's going to be an attorney's fee and even if they kept literally what you said.
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3584.27,3587.715,Well I'm talking about -- I'm talking Your Honor about after the foreclosure sales.
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3587.715,3589.382,I understand that.
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3596.293,3601.335,"Well, the court decree has awarded the attorney's fee before the -- before the foreclosure of sale."
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3601.335,3602.902,"Well, if the court awards one, yes."
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3602.902,3604.918,"Yes, and which it has done it this case."
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3604.918,3616.764,"But at the time the -- but at the time the federal lien attaches to the interest of the taxpayer, you say that its interest has already been diminished by the attorney's fee?"
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3616.764,3617.87,"No, I did not say that."
1962.405,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3625.142,3632.187,"And so it is, and still it is determined, the taxpayer has that interest in the property."
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3632.187,3637.026,He has an interest in the property subject to the attorney's fee if it goes into foreclosure.
1962.405,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3775.068,3779.023,"Your statistics add up to 51 states, 39 states --"
1962.405,1,37535,owen_c_pearce,,3779.023,3781.72,"And District of Columbia, thank you, Your Honor."
1962.405,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3864.267,3865.495,Mr. Roberts.
1962.405,2,40317,richard_m_roberts,,3865.495,3867.953,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.405,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3922.0,3926.953,But once that property interest concededly is the question of state law?
1962.405,2,40317,richard_m_roberts,,3926.953,3928.113,The interest is a --
1962.405,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3928.113,3928.233,Yes.
1962.405,2,40317,richard_m_roberts,,3928.233,3929.156,"At that time, (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.405,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3929.156,3936.606,Now what is the law of -- does the law ever say -- your adversary suggests it to be?
1962.405,2,40317,richard_m_roberts,,3936.606,3937.099,That it's subject to --
1962.405,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3937.099,3937.724,In this state?
1962.405,2,40317,richard_m_roberts,,3937.724,3940.068,"It's subject to the mortgage, yes."
1962.405,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3940.068,3940.217,But --
1962.405,2,40317,richard_m_roberts,,3940.217,3943.68,"And under state law, the mortgage -- the attorney's fees are allowed ahead of other liens."
1962.405,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3943.68,3947.523,But the property interest -- at the time is in the property owner.
1962.405,2,40317,richard_m_roberts,,3947.523,3947.625,Yes.
1962.405,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3947.625,3952.59,"Here, the taxpayers, is that it, subject to these various liens, is that the state law?"
1962.405,2,40317,richard_m_roberts,,3952.59,3954.987,"Well, subject to the mortgage."
1962.405,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3971.229,3973.582,"Well, you have a whole piece of property."
1962.405,2,40317,richard_m_roberts,,3977.404,3977.578,Yes.
1962.405,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3977.578,3979.969,"The -- there maybe taxes due, maybe municipalities --"
1962.405,2,40317,richard_m_roberts,,3979.969,3980.663,Yes.
1962.405,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3980.663,3982.996,-- have some kind of interest in it.
1962.405,2,40317,richard_m_roberts,,3989.935,3990.753,He may have.
