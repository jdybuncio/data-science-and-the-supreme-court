1984.83-1748,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,82.405,"Mr. Kammholz, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,82.405,85.545,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court:
1984.83-1748,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,282.136,283.995,Mr. Kammholz--
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,283.995,285.557,"Yes, Justice--"
1984.83-1748,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,285.557,293.132,"--on a side point, may I inquire whether the disability plan involved here is governed by ERISA?"
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,293.132,296.302,--The record does not show this.
1984.83-1748,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,625.435,637.258,"Well, Mr. Kammholz, I gather the Court, in Linn at least, recognized that there might be state law action, notwithstanding a breach of... that was a libel action, wasn't it?"
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,637.258,639.272,--Linn was a libel action.
1984.83-1748,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,647.097,650.877,"Well, when you say preemption, I gather what you mean is that it's a breach of contract."
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,656.25,657.422,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1748,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,657.422,658.39,And it's not really preemption.
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,664.918,665.231,Yes.
1984.83-1748,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,672.15,674.539,"Well, it then was not a breach of collective bargaining?"
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,674.539,675.024,--It was not.
1984.83-1748,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,675.024,676.459,Didn't we have another?
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,682.739,699.264,"There are other cases involving egregious conduct, none in the context of a collective bargaining agreement; all in the context of does the National Labor Relations Act preempt; what is the reach of the NLRA."
1984.83-1748,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,699.264,711.461,"Well, would it have been all right, in your view, if the supreme court of Wisconsin had adjudicated this case but applied the principles of federal labor law that you say are derived from the Lincoln Mills cases?"
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,711.461,712.18,Yes.
1984.83-1748,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,717.693,734.609,"Well, but I... my question was was it all right for the supreme court of Wisconsin to have adjudicated this case so long as it applied principles of federal law derived from the Lincoln Mills trilogy?"
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,734.609,735.233,Yes.
1984.83-1748,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,748.291,766.299,"Well, I gather, Mr. Kammholz, what you would have hoped the Wisconsin court would say is we'll treat this as a 301 suit brought in state court; we'll stay it while we send you to, under Boys Market, to exhaust your administrative remedies and end up in arbitration."
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,767.33,770.298,Yes.
1984.83-1748,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,797.13,809.172,"Is it clear, Mr. Kammholz, that if this particular respondent had a claim for... under this plan that he would have had to submit it to arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement?"
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,809.172,811.469,"Absolutely, no question about that."
1984.83-1748,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,819.59,821.308,I have one question.
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,821.308,821.745,--Yes.
1984.83-1748,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,821.745,826.01,"But again, it's not directly related to the facts of this case obviously."
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,849.968,856.856,"The record is barren, of course, with respect to ERISA."
1984.83-1748,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,856.856,858.793,Both being federal laws--
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,858.793,859.651,Both federal laws.
1984.83-1748,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,859.651,861.308,--but with different remedial approaches.
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,868.586,871.319,"That's why we're here in tandem, I assume."
1984.83-1748,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,898.48,900.447,"At any rate, it's federal, not state."
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,900.447,901.791,"--In any event it's federal, yes."
1984.83-1748,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,901.791,904.103,Very well.
1984.83-1748,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,904.103,904.618,Thank you.
1984.83-1748,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,904.618,905.978,Mr. Boisits.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,905.978,913.427,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court:"
1984.83-1748,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,944.446,948.085,Did the claim... did his claim arise out of the union contract?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,948.085,949.022,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1984.83-1748,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,949.022,951.755,Did his claim arise under the union contract?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,951.755,955.238,"Your Honor, yes and no, all right."
1984.83-1748,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,978.838,983.445,Did that derive from an agreement between the company and the union?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,983.445,984.648,--It did come from the agreement.
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.37,1067.646,"Well, that's what happens under collective bargaining agreements all the time where you have to go through the grievance procedure, and you have to be... you have to settle for whatever you get out of the grievance or the arbitrator."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1067.646,1068.834,True.
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1070.739,1078.815,"And even... even if the employer keeps the wages that you are... withholds, wrongfully withholds wages that you would like to use to feed your family."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1078.815,1087.609,"--Yes, but basically as far as an... when the employer acts as an insurer, there are other obligations that the state feels that are very important."
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1092.511,1102.852,"Would you say that this agreement, then, this agreement that was provided for arbitration of disputes about this very plan, is contrary to public policy?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1103.96,1106.787,--I'm saying that it--
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1106.787,1111.926,"It's just unenforceable, that provision of the contract."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1111.926,1113.098,"--That I'm saying... no, I'm not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.926,1116.549,"Well, if it's enforceable, why can't you insist that he go to arbitration?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1116.549,1125.265,"--He can go to arbitration to get his contract benefits, the benefits that are arising out of the breach of the contract, the employment contract."
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.78,1134.917,"Yes, but most arbitration provisions say that the arbitrator... the arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, and that's all you get."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1134.917,1153.878,"--As far as disability benefits are concerned, but the state interest, the interest that the Wisconsin... that the State of Wisconsin, as well as the Wisconsin majority, indicated was look at, we cannot allow an employer to hide under a Section 301 case, or what's claimed to be a Section 301 case."
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1177.43,1189.176,"If we join you and make this exception as to insurance policies, can you tell me anything that the state can't also do and wreck the whole contract?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1189.176,1193.159,And wreck the entire employment contract by allowing--
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1193.159,1193.752,"Yeah, yeah."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1193.752,1195.689,"--Your Honor, I can't--"
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1195.689,1197.439,"Well, can you name something that they couldn't do?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1202.343,1205.451,"--Yes, but now we're getting into--"
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1205.451,1206.264,Would that apply?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1206.264,1206.528,--Yes.
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1207.965,1209.324,Why not?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1209.324,1218.429,"Basically because now that's dealing... that's stepping right into a situation of the conditions of employment and wages, something that Section 301--"
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1218.429,1220.789,Something that's bound by the contract.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1220.789,1223.647,"--Something that's related to the contract, yes."
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1223.647,1224.958,Just like the policy.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1224.958,1228.551,"Well, the policy... what I'm saying, though, is that--"
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1228.551,1236.126,Is... does the contract in any way say that this benefit under the policy is different from the rest of the contract?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1236.126,1238.36,--I'm sorry.
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1239.298,1242.717,You say this is a separate part of the contract.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1242.717,1243.608,"Yes, it is."
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1243.608,1252.806,Does it say that it is separated from the contract so that it does not apply to arbitration?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1252.806,1253.572,"No, it doesn't."
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1253.572,1255.539,"Well, then how can you say so?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1256.821,1257.649,It says the contrary.
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1264.177,1265.286,"Well, how can the state do it?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1265.286,1268.035,--Why can the state do it?
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1268.035,1268.504,How?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1268.504,1276.439,The state can step in and allow Mr. Lueck compensatory damages and punitive damages just like was discussed in the previous case.
1984.83-1748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1316.938,1341.271,"Well, I gather, though, Mr. Boisits, what you're saying is even though the collective bargaining agreement says for issues of this kind you must go through the grievance procedure, you must accept arbitration, it doesn't really mean anything, because if the state wants to intervene and say well, we've got a different policy in particular respects, and if that policy is violated, then that's in addition to whatever remedy you have under the collective bargaining."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1342.145,1342.911,"No, I'm not."
1984.83-1748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1351.22,1352.47,"I know, but it's... it's adding something."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1364.841,1367.558,--It applies to a claim for disability benefits.
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1390.126,1405.668,"Well, isn't that one of the... so the employee says to the... says to the employer or to the insurance company or whoever he's talking to, you haven't paid me my benefits, and furthermore, you have not done it... you've done it in bad faith."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1421.005,1422.879,That's what I'm saying.
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1422.879,1423.77,"Well, that's--"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1446.073,1448.806,You're talking a renegotiation of the contract then.
1984.83-1748,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1448.806,1449.399,I realize--
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1449.399,1452.492,There's no... there's no provisions in there for that now.
1984.83-1748,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1469.969,1476.92,"--But he's bound by the union's contract on his behalf to arbitrate this particular kind of dispute, as I understand it."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1476.92,1492.586,"Just the disability, not... Wisconsin looked at this as a separate tort action, just like it looked... this Court has looked at as emotional distress, intentional causing emotional distress, malicious libel... those type of cases."
1984.83-1748,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1539.832,1545.22,Is this obligation on the benefits a debt?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1549.405,1551.499,As far as the disability benefits are concerned?
1984.83-1748,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1554.544,1561.057,"Well, then, is every person who doesn't pay his bills on time committing a tort?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1561.057,1561.526,"No, he isn't."
1984.83-1748,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1561.526,1567.274,"Well, you've just said that their failure to pay was a tort."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1567.274,1574.083,"There's got to be a particularly abusive manner in failing to do it, other ulterior motives."
1984.83-1748,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1574.083,1583.595,"Well, let's say that you write Brooks Brothers and say that go fly a kite, we're not going to pay you the bill, and don't waste your postage sending me any more bills."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1585.047,1586.016,It's a breach of contract.
1984.83-1748,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1599.652,1601.136,They haven't got their money.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1601.136,1606.978,"They haven't gotten their money, but they have not been harmed by the action that you've done except they haven't gotten their money."
1984.83-1748,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1606.978,1609.695,How's Brooks Brothers any different from your client?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1609.695,1610.07,"Yes, they are."
1984.83-1748,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1610.07,1610.43,How?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1610.43,1613.585,"We're talking... we're talking an employer, a giant industry."
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1643.135,1646.29,How can you say the union was disinterested in this case?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1649.101,1653.896,--Mr. Lueck received his benefits before there was any right--
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1653.896,1656.645,"Well, what did the union refuse to do?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1656.645,1659.051,"--Well, the union didn't refuse to do anything in this case."
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1659.051,1662.579,So you can't complain against the union.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1662.579,1665.985,But what I'm saying is is that--
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1665.985,1667.171,"You can't, can you?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1667.171,1667.609,"--No, I can't."
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1667.609,1669.015,"Well, why try to do it now?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1669.015,1672.654,"Justice, I'm not trying."
1984.83-1748,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1699.596,1704.579,What if the union... do you think the union's reason is that it might be a defendant in such a claim?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1704.579,1705.764,I think that's why they're there.
1984.83-1748,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1721.79,1731.302,"Well, may I ask you on that point, this contract, as I remember it, there's some supplementary correspondence about insurance-related matters, that they had some kind of a special arbitration procedure."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1747.874,1748.702,--Yes.
1984.83-1748,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1754.777,1769.991,"Well, then, may I ask why couldn't one argue that your first step in this problem, if it's a general problem, is to ask the union to negotiate such a provision, or to bring a proceeding and see whether they might not even interpret the existing documents to give that relief?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1783.233,1788.357,"Justice, it is conceivable, but unfortunately, it wasn't done in this case, or fortunately."
1984.83-1748,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1788.357,1801.492,"Well, Mr. Boisits, I'm looking at the collective bargaining agreement at page 24 of the Joint Appendix, and there's a provision as to the jurisdictional authority of the impartial referee, and it says,"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1832.338,1837.884,"Your Honor, in addition to that there's the other letter that specifically just says that--"
1984.83-1748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1837.884,1838.82,"Well, I was looking at the conclusion of the agreement."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1839.633,1841.444,--Are we looking in the... what's--
1984.83-1748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1841.444,1843.131,"--Joint Appendix, page 24."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1843.131,1847.723,--On page 24?
1984.83-1748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1847.723,1848.645,"Twenty-four, yes."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1862.06,1873.823,"Yes, Your Honor, but again, as far as this would... this page is concerned and this paragraph is concerned, I would argue that this applies to anything dealing with wages and conditions of employment."
1984.83-1748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1875.884,1885.848,"Well, doesn't... doesn't the... under that provision would not the arbitrator decide whether a given grievance comes within his authority or not?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1885.848,1890.722,"--As far as... whether they decide... whether... well, I'd say--"
1984.83-1748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1890.722,1891.596,Whether it's an arbitrable grievance.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1894.438,1905.247,"--Well, I'd say as far as Mr. Lueck was concerned, if he looked at the thing and he determined that this is a wage-related or he felt it was a wage-related condition of employment situation, yes, he would go to the arbitrator."
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1938.53,1942.137,"But the supreme court of Wisconsin didn't consider it at all, did they?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1942.137,1944.137,Didn't consider what at all?
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1944.137,1944.73,That provision.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1946.698,1950.306,I was asked about it at an oral argument.
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1954.164,1957.429,"It's not in their opinion at all, is it?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,1957.429,1958.616,"No, it isn't."
1984.83-1748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1986.699,1993.056,"Well, now, look at this letter at page 43 that you refer to expressly says that"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2008.159,2009.862,I look--
1984.83-1748,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2009.862,2012.22,I don't see any independent.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2017.873,2023.324,"--But they're making the final decision as to whether or not we're going to refer it back to the labor agreement, Justice."
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2476.578,2479.858,--But your complaint says nothing except contract.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2479.858,2480.749,--Excuse me?
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2480.749,2488.152,Your complaint in this case says nothing except a violation of the contract.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2488.152,2490.604,"My complaint does not say that, Your Honor."
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2490.604,2491.416,It doesn't say contract?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2491.416,2494.946,My complaint is saying that one of the elements--
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2494.946,2496.242,It doesn't say contract?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2496.242,2500.459,"--Well, it mentions contracts, Your Honor, but I am not going--"
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2500.459,2501.444,"Well, that's all it said."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2515.421,2521.122,--But I'm going for something that does not... that the contract does not provide for.
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2537.725,2539.959,"I think we have your point on that, counsel."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2539.959,2540.193,All right.
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2540.193,2554.61,"Could you tell me where specifically it is that the agreements or the letter of understanding require that claims for benefits, disputed claims for benefits be arbitrated?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2554.61,2557.796,For... for the insurance benefits?
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2557.796,2558.529,Yes.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2558.529,2561.403,That would be on page 43.
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2561.403,2567.369,"Now, is this committee that that letter talks about, is that the... are they the arbitrators?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2567.369,2568.088,No.
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2575.585,2584.972,"Well, I know, but now you... where does it require that... we're talking about an insurance-related matter, aren't we?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2584.972,2586.065,"--Yes, we are, definitely."
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.065,2592.11,And tell me where this letter requires something to be presented to arbitration.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2592.11,2597.483,"On page 43, second paragraph, it says,"
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.415,2612.415,Yes.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2612.415,2612.883,"Then it says,"
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.97,2627.625,"Well, the committee is... so where do you present it for arbitration?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2627.625,2630.125,You present it to the committee.
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2631.577,2633.53,So the committee are the arbitrators.
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2633.53,2635.217,--No.
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2643.433,2645.229,And that would be under the main contract?
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2645.229,2649.102,"That would be under the main contract, at least from my understanding of this, Justice."
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2652.164,2654.1,"But that word ""may"" is in there."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2654.1,2655.022,Yes.
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2655.022,2658.474,"Now, does that require presentation to arbitration?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2658.474,2658.958,No.
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.958,2666.016,"Well, I suppose--"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2666.016,2669.437,"That's one of the reasons we brought the action, Justice."
1984.83-1748,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.936,2680.262,"--If the company... but if the company wanted to present it for arbitration, the claimant would have to go to arbitration."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2680.262,2682.667,That's correct.
1984.83-1748,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2684.479,2688.508,"But, counsel, that letter can't alter the terms of the contract, can it?"
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2688.508,2698.161,"Justice, it is my... it is my opinion both from the way it has been presented by Allis-Chalmers that those letters definitely alter the contract."
1984.83-1748,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2707.546,2710.201,"Thank you, counsel."
1984.83-1748,1,24973,gerald_s_boisits,,2710.201,2710.936,"Thank you, Justice."
1984.83-1748,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2710.936,2712.186,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Kammholz?"
1984.83-1748,2,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,2712.186,2715.716,"Your Honors, if you have no questions."
1984.83-1748,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2715.716,2717.277,"I have a question, Mr. Kammholz."
1984.83-1748,2,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,2752.825,2756.543,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1748,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2756.543,2757.152,"Thank you, counsel."
