2007.06-11543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.576,"We'll hear argument next in Case 06-11543, Begay v. United States."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,11.81,23.618,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether DWI is a violent felony for purposes of an Armed Career Criminal Act sentencing enhancement."
2007.06-11543,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,99.354,103.617,"If you're quoting that, then this is what's now bothering me."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,159.173,175.884,"--Your Honor, I think what you said was sufficient, but you might have added that there are other attributes to the... the crimes in the... the enumerated crimes, those being burglary, arson, extortion, use of explosives."
2007.06-11543,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,202.78,208.512,Some of those characteristics don't seem to apply to all of the specific crimes that are mentioned.
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,233.19,238.907,"Your Honor, arguably they might not apply to everyone every time."
2007.06-11543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.371,265.46,I think you can say that all of the crimes that are listed require mens rea and DUI doesn't; does it?
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,265.46,266.101,Absolutely.
2007.06-11543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.101,268.006,"That's a big different, isn't it?"
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,268.006,270.506,I think it's a huge difference.
2007.06-11543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,300.338,313.426,"Would you have the same answer if you had a State statute which defined felony drunk driving, as many do, as felony drunk driving which causes serious death or serious physical injury to another?"
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,313.426,317.737,--I think it would... the analysis wouldn't be different.
2007.06-11543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,320.595,322.454,You would still say that that statute does not qualify?
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,322.454,329.311,--Not unless there is a definition of... if there is an actual intent to cause harm.
2007.06-11543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,332.043,336.416,"No, there isn't in the usual felony drunk driving statute, there is--"
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,336.416,336.9,--And I agree.
2007.06-11543,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,343.023,351.91,"What if the crime is vehicular homicide, defined as causing the death of another person while driving intoxicated?"
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,358.36,363.437,"That would not fall under paragraph 2, because it would not meet any of the other attributes of the enumerated crimes."
2007.06-11543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,380.008,391.051,"You are assuming, of course, that the canon of ejusdem generis applies to the statute, as opposed to Congress just singling out a couple of things it wanted to be sure were covered."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,394.738,395.502,"Yes, you did."
2007.06-11543,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,406.826,414.948,"Well, in one way... in one way it is, in that like those other crimes it presents a serious risk of potential injury to another."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,440.157,450.246,"--Your Honor, answering your question and the Chief Justice's question, I think it's important to remember that the first version of this statute came out in 1984, and that just involved burglary and robbery."
2007.06-11543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,500.179,501.866,"Then why did it use the word ""otherwise""?"
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,505.037,508.879,"I would agree, ""likewise"" would have been a more artful way to have written it."
2007.06-11543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,508.879,511.111,"It would have meant something different, wouldn't it?"
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,511.111,511.815,"I think, in fact--"
2007.06-11543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,511.815,513.751,"""Otherwise"" means in some other way."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,513.751,516.033,"--That's the dictionary definition, Your Honor."
2007.06-11543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,516.033,516.658,"Well, yes."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,524.373,527.996,I would agree that's one thing that we look at.
2007.06-11543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.162,545.864,"You've run away from me on ""otherwise""."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,596.702,600.78,"Your Honor, and I'm not running away from the ""otherwise""."
2007.06-11543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,610.775,615.977,"But in... in doing that, you've got, in other words, to understand what ""otherwise"" means."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,645.653,664.896,"--I believe the correct analysis... and I do believe that ejusdem generis does apply here, because here we have a list of four specific offenses followed by a general term, and we have to read that general term narrowly so as not to give additional breadth to acts of Congress."
2007.06-11543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,678.235,684.263,"No, but then I was wondering about that as well, that as a violent felony whether that gives you any traction."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,692.948,701.163,--It's violent in the sense that extortion is trying to get something from somebody of value.
2007.06-11543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,702.037,704.115,"Yes, but you don't say, give me that or I'll break your legs all the time."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,710.861,724.497,"--I think it is violent in the sense of the terms that this Court used in Leocal and that Justice Breyer used in Doe, the idea of some kind of violent act or more closely related action."
2007.06-11543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,724.497,731.197,"But then, releasing the letter is not violent and it may cause embarrassment rather than physical injury."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,732.087,740.99,"It absolutely would, and this Court in Taylor said that the four crimes all have those... basically, in general, have those attributes."
2007.06-11543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,755.374,758.794,"No, but it says ""person"", not... it says ""person"", not ""reputation""."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,758.794,760.388,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2007.06-11543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,760.388,765.168,You're saying the violence can be against the reputation.
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,770.431,774.492,But the statute does talk about violence.
2007.06-11543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,774.976,778.459,It doesn't talk about violence in the abstract.
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,791.609,795.53,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-11543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,813.243,816.43,"Well, it has to do with the idea of risk of violence."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,828.627,830.33,"--I would agree with you, Your Honor."
2007.06-11543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,830.33,837.39,"And the problem is that, by being in the situation he's in, he creates a risk that violence will occur."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,863.551,867.612,"I would disagree, Your Honor, and here's why I don't think they're parallel."
2007.06-11543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,879.966,888.059,"When the drunk leaves the bar, doesn't he have the realization, unless he is just blind at that point, that he may be apprehended?"
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,888.059,891.508,It is just--
2007.06-11543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,891.508,892.665,He's not going to throw himself into the arms of the nearest cop.
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,892.665,895.632,"--Absolutely not, but here's the big... the big difference."
2007.06-11543,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,906.909,912.032,"Right, but when a guy goes up the ladder for the silver in the sideboard, at most what he wants is the silver."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,912.032,918.357,But he intentionally goes to somebody else's property to commit this act that will cause harm.
2007.06-11543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,918.357,921.653,"--Well, the driver intentionally drives the car knowing that there's a risk."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,921.653,926.559,"With all due respect, Your Honor, in DWI there is no intention to drive."
2007.06-11543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,930.493,940.599,"But that... that is because everybody knows there are... there are two conditions: One in which he just is reckless and he doesn't care, in which case he has the intent; the other one, he's so drunk he can't form the intent."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,951.048,957.389,"--Your Honor, in New Mexico, DWI is a strict liability."
2007.06-11543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,962.168,969.51,"That's true in almost every State, for the reasons that I've indicated, because many people have the intent, and those that don't shouldn't be exonerated because they're more drunk."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,969.51,982.442,"If I may just add as well, in some of the discussions about the actions of DWI and running into people, it's important to note, if we're looking at this with a categorical analysis, just to look at the elements of the offense."
2007.06-11543,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,988.831,1002.388,"The residual clause is a difficult problem, but I still have not heard what characteristic the enumerated offenses have in common, all of them, that provides a basis for limiting the residual clause."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1032.156,1035.592,"--At their very least, they all are acts that intend to cause harm."
2007.06-11543,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1039.232,1040.107,"No, they're not."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1053.538,1055.507,--Your Honor--
2007.06-11543,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1055.507,1056.834,There's no intent to cause harm there.
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1056.834,1061.317,"--Your Honor, the term in the Armed Career Criminal Act is the ""use of explosives""."
2007.06-11543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1104.802,1107.378,I don't... I don't understand this line of argue.
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1119.936,1120.483,--Yes.
2007.06-11543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1120.483,1123.294,"That wouldn't be included in the ""otherwise involved""?"
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1123.294,1126.855,"No, Your Honor, that would not fit under paragraph 2."
2007.06-11543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1139.209,1146.722,"It's kind of odd, when the catch-all is phrased in terms of physical injury to another, to say that it's concerned only with property crimes."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1146.722,1151.313,"--Property crimes with the potential for physical injury to another, not just purely property crimes."
2007.06-11543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1157.0,1174.975,"Well, it seems to me that your argument gives us greater reason to treat the last clause as independent just so that we can be sure that it doesn't include only property crimes, because, as the Chief Justice just pointed out, ""physical injury"" is really the term that does the work in the second clause."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1182.286,1183.8,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2007.06-11543,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.428,1216.287,"May I ask this question about your interpretation of the word ""otherwise""."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1237.045,1243.541,"Your Honor, I don't know that I would agree ""equally serious"" would be the exact correct equivalent."
2007.06-11543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1272.874,1281.135,"Well, doesn't that suggest that ""otherwise"" in the statute is in fact used to mean ""likewise""?"
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1293.1,1297.957,"--And that was this Court's analysis in James, and I think that that's reasonable to--"
2007.06-11543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1297.957,1300.051,That was a helpful question.
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1301.254,1325.51,"--I think it's important not to lose sight of the term that we are defining, ""violent felony"", and that... as well as the purpose or intent of the statute was to punish a very small percentage, as this... as this Court said in Taylor, a very small percentage of very serious offenders."
2007.06-11543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1346.455,1362.042,"Well, particularly when you look at subsection (i) in the broad reading of serious potential risk of (ii), why would... why would Congress mean to exclude a particular category of physical injury from the reach of the statute?"
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1362.042,1368.352,"Because if it... if it did include absolutely everything, then it would swallow the whole statute, because certainly--"
2007.06-11543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1368.352,1373.287,"No, not everything; everything that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1373.287,1380.473,"--I think it... if it... for example, if it could include DWI, it would be hard to imagine what kind of crime wouldn't be included in there."
2007.06-11543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1382.487,1385.142,Filling out a false income tax return.
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1386.236,1388.594,--Other than maybe some white-collar crime.
2007.06-11543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1388.594,1391.343,"Well, there is a whole category of those."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1392.015,1409.369,"But the... the problem with that analysis is that Congress was very clear who these... who this statute was geared at; and as Judge McConnell said in his dissent, the name of the statute, the Armed Career Criminal Act, is not just window dressing."
2007.06-11543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1419.551,1428.672,"What do you think presents the most serious potential risk of injury to all of us, that we are going to be a victim of arson or that we are likely to get hit by a drunk driver?"
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1428.672,1442.308,"--Here's why it's hard to answer that: I wouldn't argue with you that there are more people driving drunk than there are people burglarizing houses, but the relevant analysis is what's the risk in an individual incident?"
2007.06-11543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1562.634,1563.384,"Thank you, Counsel."
2007.06-11543,0,36166,margaret_a_katze,,1563.384,1563.962,Thank you.
2007.06-11543,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1563.962,1578.143,Ms. Kruger.
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1578.143,1585.187,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Drunk driving is an act that by its nature endangers people's lives."
2007.06-11543,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1606.631,1607.959,How about a habitual speeder?
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1607.959,1614.753,"--Well, speeding isn't a felony offense under the laws of any State, to my knowledge."
2007.06-11543,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1654.472,1664.578,"And what is the... if the legislature made it a crime to send text messages on a cell phone while driving, and the punishment were severe enough to qualify here?"
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1665.968,1680.024,"Well, it would present a harder question, Justice Alito, and that's because, for one thing, we don't have the uniform judgment of legislatures that helps us know in this case that drunk driving does in all cases present a serious risk of injury."
2007.06-11543,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1705.092,1715.713,So there is no State where speeding... even if maybe you hurt somebody or something... there is no State where speeding is under a statute that you could be imprisoned for more than a year?
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1715.713,1719.555,"To my knowledge, there is no State in which speeding itself is a felony offense."
2007.06-11543,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1719.555,1720.758,"Well, a felony as defined here."
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1730.347,1731.582,"To my knowledge, at least, Justice Breyer--"
2007.06-11543,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1731.582,1732.925,"--Okay, I just want to be sure we're on the same wavelength."
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1733.643,1739.407,"--Reckless driving, on the other hand, when it does result in serious physical injury to another, is often punished as a felony."
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1745.17,1753.995,"Ms. Kruger, what I don't understand about this statute as you're interpreting it is why you need any of it except the last phrase?"
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1792.01,1808.051,"Well, what this Court said about the structure of the statute in Taylor is that Congress's purpose was first to identify crimes that do have as an element the use force, but also to capture a category of crimes that do not have as an element the use force but nevertheless present a potential harm to another human being."
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1808.051,1822.81,"Why... why would Congress go through that trouble, unless they wanted to suggest what other kind of crimes they need to include by this residual category of ""any conduct"" that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury?"
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1822.81,1835.274,"Well, indeed as the Court said in Taylor and I think as the Court reiterated in James, it included the examples of four enumerated offenses in clause 2 to provide examples of the kinds of crimes that they believed to present a serious--"
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1835.274,1837.867,"The degree of risk... the degree of risk, for example?"
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1837.867,1838.695,--Yes.
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1838.695,1843.927,"So if it doesn't come up to the degree of risk that any of those four would, it would not be included?"
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1843.927,1845.318,"Well, I don't know that the--"
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1845.318,1845.771,No.
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1845.771,1848.911,--that the enumerated crimes set an absolute four.
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.753,1851.346,"Well, then what did it do?"
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1851.675,1856.454,--They do provide examples of the kinds of crimes that Congress thought did present a serious risk.
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1856.454,1856.688,How?
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1871.838,1880.365,"Well, I think, as the Court said in James, all of these crimes are quite different offenses that don't share very many characteristics in common, including incidentally intent to cause harm."
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.365,1881.522,But you say it does limit it.
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1882.599,1888.909,"Well, what it does is it provides a useful benchmark against which to assess the risks that are associated with any other crime."
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.909,1889.315,That's nice.
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1892.768,1894.563,Of degree... it's degree and kinds of risk.
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.907,1895.375,Okay.
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1899.093,1901.218,"It has to be comparable, which is what the Court said in James--"
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.218,1901.654,Comparable--
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1901.654,1904.778,--And in this case we do think that the risks associated with DUI are comparable to the risks--
2007.06-11543,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1904.778,1905.371,How do we know that?
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1920.007,1921.32,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2007.06-11543,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1921.32,1931.392,"In other words, I guess... do we really look at how... what percentage of drunk drivers are involved in accidents as opposed to what percentage of burglars are involved in violent confrontations?"
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1931.392,1932.345,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-11543,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1959.039,1966.553,"One of the anomalies about this, and we start out... this is an armed career criminal."
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2010.238,2022.888,"Well, we think that it's clear from the enumeration of the offenses in clause 2 in the definition of ""violent felony"" that Congress wasn't intending to capture only a set of crimes that are made more dangerous when they're committed with a firearm."
2007.06-11543,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.188,2053.299,Then they could have turned it just on dangerousness.
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2193.164,2205.285,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that the initial response to that question is that the statute that Congress wrote unequivocally focuses the inquiry on the risk of harm to other human beings."
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.86,2221.311,"--Oh, but it didn't mean that... you said it didn't mean that because they could have said that and nothing else."
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2237.103,2255.094,"--Well, I think you don't, Your Honor, because I think the most obvious way to tie it to the preceding sections is, again, to import a kind of use-of-force requirement such as the 18 U.S.C. 16(b) requirements that would look at the risk of force intentionally will be used in the course of committing the offense, and--"
2007.06-11543,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2255.094,2259.281,How much of a limitation is the point Justice Breyer was making?
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2270.917,2285.222,"--Well, indeed, I think that it does, and I think the facts of this case bear out that Congress's concern about possession of firearms by people who have committed crimes of a character that present a serious risk in a serial manner was indeed well-founded."
2007.06-11543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2285.222,2289.674,"Can you tell me what test, what conclusion, you want me to come to in your argument?"
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2297.312,2301.03,"It is because, first of all, the risks of drunk driving are commonly understood."
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.79,2314.415,She says not at all.
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2330.095,2338.546,"Well, I think, again, the statistical inquiry, while it can be helpful and relevant in individual cases, is not dispositive."
2007.06-11543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2350.089,2353.258,"--Well, I suppose you say most legislatures think this is dangerous."
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2353.929,2358.193,"--Well, I think that Congress was entitled to look at--"
2007.06-11543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2358.193,2362.926,"I'm not trying to be captious, but I... it's difficult to find out what the standard is."
2007.06-11543,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2362.926,2376.733,"Isn't the significance of Justice Breyer's point that each of the listed crimes is more dangerous when a criminal is carrying a gun, but driving drunk isn't made any more dangerous whether or not there's a gun in the car?"
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2376.733,2383.714,"--Well, Justice Stevens, it's difficult to see how arson, for example, or explosives use is made more dangerous when the criminal is carrying a gun."
2007.06-11543,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2405.158,2413.983,"Is a person who deliberately burns down buildings, is a person who if he had a gun might pull the trigger?"
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2455.951,2462.947,"Well, I think one way to start to answer that question is by looking specifically at what Congress likely meant when it referred to ""arson"" in the statute."
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2501.231,2504.445,You don't think this is just limited to intentional arson?
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2507.82,2509.429,"Well, it's certainly true that--"
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2509.429,2514.536,"Negligent extortion, negligent use of explosives?"
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2525.86,2534.168,"--Well, I think that Congress was more than likely aware of the fact that 18 U.S.C. 844 did treat arson in this manner, particularly considering that--"
2007.06-11543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2534.168,2537.277,I don't think Congress had the slightest idea.
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2537.871,2550.974,"--Well, the definition of... the reach of the Federal arson statute came to encompass use of fire in 1982, only shortly before the ACCA was enacted."
2007.06-11543,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2562.486,2566.624,Could you comment on one other point that Judge McConnell made in his opinion?
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2576.043,2586.618,"Well, I think it's difficult to see how it would support a limitation to the kinds of crimes that are normally committed as a means of livelihood in that sense of ""career""."
2007.06-11543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2603.687,2604.64,"Well, I'm not so sure."
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2624.54,2628.692,"--Well, it is certainly true that the kind of--"
2007.06-11543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2628.692,2629.63,Obviously... obviously incomplete.
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2629.63,2641.281,"--Well, it's certainly true that the kinds of crimes that are encompassed by clause 1 of the definition, sort of traditional crimes of violence like murder, assault, rape, are not ordinarily committed as a means of livelihood."
2007.06-11543,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2666.677,2668.583,What else... what else would be in this catalogue?
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2685.047,2708.474,"We think the category of crimes of recklessness that pose an injury, reckless disregard of the risk of injury to others, would qualify because in those cases juries have necessarily found that there was objectively a serious risk and that failures to appreciate that risk and to act accordingly constitutes a gross deviation from the ordinary standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise."
2007.06-11543,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2708.474,2709.599,I'd like to know specifically.
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2715.284,2723.14,"Reckless driving that results in serious bodily injury or death to another, which is a felony under the laws of many States, would qualify."
2007.06-11543,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2723.14,2724.748,"That has the potential of doing that, not--"
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2724.748,2731.182,"Yes, but reckless driving simple is ordinarily, not punishable as a felony under the traffic laws."
2007.06-11543,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2734.962,2740.461,"--But wouldn't that come in in the first, the violent crime, the first part?"
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2740.461,2748.629,"Well, presumably it wouldn't, because by definition a reckless homicide does not involve the intentional use of force, the threatened use of force, or attempted use of force."
2007.06-11543,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2834.501,2840.109,May I ask about something in your brief on page 37?
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2890.183,2891.401,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-11543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2921.107,2930.948,"It would, in the case of drunk driving... though, it seems this would be a better case for the Petitioner if we were operating under this statute."
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2930.948,2935.212,"Well, indeed, I think that that is the thrust of the court's decision--"
2007.06-11543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2935.212,2938.118,It's narrower in that sense as applied to this case.
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2938.118,2938.696,--That's correct.
2007.06-11543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2938.696,2940.116,May I ask you this question?
2007.06-11543,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2964.747,2983.927,"Well, if the Court decided to reach that issue in this case, even though the issue was not pressed or passed on in the court of appeals and wasn't raised in the cert petition, we do think the Court's analysis of the issue in that case applies equally to its analysis of the issue of whether or not the felony prong of the definition of ""violent felony"" is applicable in this case."
2007.06-11543,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3081.091,3083.512,"Thank you, Ms. Kruger."
2007.06-11543,2,36166,margaret_a_katze,,3087.589,3096.601,The problem with the Government's interpretation is that it offers no limiting principle whatsoever.
2007.06-11543,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3143.817,3145.942,Why wouldn't drunk driving be property crime?
2007.06-11543,2,36166,margaret_a_katze,,3148.534,3164.464,"--Under a categorical analysis, there is no element that has anything to do with property whatsoever in DWI, which brings me to my next point that recidivism is not an element of DWI in New Mexico."
2007.06-11543,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3183.613,3188.05,Extortion doesn't involve property as an element.
2007.06-11543,2,36166,margaret_a_katze,,3188.05,3190.158,I believe it does.
2007.06-11543,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3194.311,3199.154,"Something of value... something of value could be, you know, a confession in a related case or something."
2007.06-11543,2,36166,margaret_a_katze,,3200.496,3212.867,"In the ordinary case, it's property even if we think of it as reputation; property in the sense of the common law, life, liberty, and property; that that includes more than just physical property, I think."
2007.06-11543,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3215.944,3216.334,I don't understand that.
2007.06-11543,2,36166,margaret_a_katze,,3220.146,3224.597,"--""Property"" includes more than tangible, physical property."
2007.06-11543,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3230.672,3233.578,I thought you said that you... you look at the generality of cases.
2007.06-11543,2,36166,margaret_a_katze,,3235.936,3239.685,"--That is correct, and money is property."
2007.06-11543,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3254.445,3266.096,"Well, if you look at the generality of drunk-driving offenses, those that result in physical injury almost always involve, or in the great majority of cases involve, property damage, too; don't they?"
2007.06-11543,2,36166,margaret_a_katze,,3266.096,3268.533,--But that's not an element of the crime.
2007.06-11543,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3269.469,3271.578,"It's not an element of some of these other crimes, either."
2007.06-11543,2,36166,margaret_a_katze,,3273.984,3275.124,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-11543,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3281.34,3282.59,That's an entering.
2007.06-11543,2,36166,margaret_a_katze,,3282.949,3283.293,Right.
2007.06-11543,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3283.293,3283.824,--That's a property element?
2007.06-11543,2,36166,margaret_a_katze,,3283.824,3284.136,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-11543,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3284.136,3284.62,--What about--
2007.06-11543,2,36166,margaret_a_katze,,3284.62,3285.292,You have to enter a property.
2007.06-11543,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3286.823,3291.103,"--Well, we know that attempted burglary is covered, and you don't have to enter the house in an attempted burglary."
2007.06-11543,2,36166,margaret_a_katze,,3291.103,3297.912,--I think that's exactly the situation when there are analogous crimes.
2007.06-11543,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3299.942,3300.927,Yes.
2007.06-11543,2,36166,margaret_a_katze,,3306.596,3314.843,"--That's correct, but this Court has said that the four offenses that were enumerated by Congress are, in fact, property crimes."
2007.06-11543,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3339.036,3339.582,"Thank you, Ms. Katze."
