1972.71-6698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.878,We will hear arguments next Number 71-6698 Morris against Weinberger.
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,61.048,64.182,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,370.624,381.362,Mr. McClelland as you know because of that 1972 Amendment it’s the government’s position in this case and that amendment incidentally came along after we granted certiorari in this case.
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,381.362,382.668,"As a practice sir, I’m on --"
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,382.668,389.996,"It’s the government’s position in this case that the writ should be dismissed, I trust you’ll address yourself to that argument."
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,389.996,390.502,-- excited sir.
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,390.502,398.884,"Right very good, in your own time I just --"
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,398.884,424.92,"Pertaining to this and the fact that that respondent has raised this issue of whether or not this writ was probably granted, I would like to say this that I’m happy that the question was raised because it does bring this -- at least I would hope that it would bring this new amendment before this Court for consideration today."
1972.71-6698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,426.147,431.271,How do we get the new amendment before us?
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,431.271,436.466,I say sir that I would hope that you would the fact that we are considering that at this time.
1972.71-6698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,436.466,445.093,Well has there been any administrative action under the law as changed?
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,445.093,448.241,"So far as this case is concerned, the answer is negative."
1972.71-6698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,453.757,456.108,Mr. McClelland we have only this case before us.
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,456.108,458.19,"You have only this case before you, that’s true sir."
1972.71-6698,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.19,462.971,No one is trying to apply this new statute to Linda Gayle situation.
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,462.971,468.812,No sir.
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,468.812,470.902,"Well, there’s no need to."
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,484.708,489.78,That’s correct.
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,596.501,610.686,"It is clear that if the 1972 Amendments had been in effect at the time that your case arose, your case could not have arisen because Linda Gayle would have ineligible."
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,613.597,633.253,"Sir, on the issues that I’m bringing forth here today and the issues of discrimination against adopted children, they would not be affected either way had this, let’s assume that you should decide at this particular moment right now."
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,693.333,694.559,Same Fifth Amendment argument?
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,694.559,705.587,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1972.71-6698,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.18,731.071,"In what sense Mr. McClelland, do you say the same Fifth Amendment issues are here under the amendment statute?"
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,731.071,742.794,"As effects after adopted children sir, as against children born as issue of the recipient."
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,742.794,745.544,Or/and as against pre-adopted children?
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,745.544,746.501,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,746.501,753.213,"But it’s a basic denial of the ingredient of equal protection of the laws, it’s included in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment?"
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,753.213,753.481,That’s exactly right sir.
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,753.481,754.526,"That’s your argument, isn’t it?"
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,754.526,760.969,Yes sir.
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1083.132,1085.275,It was Senator Allen’s Bill was it not?
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1097.916,1099.343,That’s correct sir.
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1099.343,1111.53,"So when he was talking about no possibility, no substantial possibility of abuse, he was talking about no substantial possibility of abuse under his Bill which became Law and which you are now attacking."
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1115.743,1116.732,"No, all I’m asking you this --"
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1116.732,1119.052,You’re attacking the Bill that he sponsored and --
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1119.052,1123.107,"In this particular instance sir, I’m not attacking his Bill."
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1139.395,1164.451,"But, the problem in this case is that the law which was as I understand it, had its genesis and a Bill sponsored by Senator Allen, supported by Senators Curtis and Dominic and obviously by the majority of both houses ultimately, that that Bill contains in it a limitation for adoption of the eligibility of adopted children that those adoptions have taken place under a Child Placement Agency."
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1168.439,1168.985,That’s correct sir.
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1168.985,1169.507,Is it not?
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1169.507,1171.535,Yes sir.
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1171.535,1184.524,And it’s been held by the Agency that a court even a juvenile court or any other kind of court is not a Child Placement Agency within the meaning of that provision of the federal law.
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1186.173,1187.945,Yes sir.
1972.71-6698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1187.945,1189.949,Congress had two objectives did they not?
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1211.329,1213.477,Correct sir.
1972.71-6698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1213.477,1235.418,"Now, hasn’t the Court said many times that in many cases that the fact that a regulation may occasionally reach some blameless person when its aimed at a larger target of preventing abuses, it will be sustained."
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1235.418,1238.819,That also is correct sir.
1972.71-6698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1256.917,1261.116,Well of course Congress can’t legislate on specific cases.
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1265.826,1284.622,"Mr. Chief Justice, of the 200 and some odd cases that we have relative to adoptions that we’ve had since I’ve been with this particular program in the last six years, more than 50% of them have been grandparents adopting children."
1972.71-6698,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.946,1310.149,"Well, what is the purpose then of their adopting the grandchild?"
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1310.149,1316.334,"For the purpose of providing a home for them generally sir, that’s the case here."
1972.71-6698,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.334,1319.097,Or simply they do that without adoption?
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1319.097,1320.038,They could do that.
1972.71-6698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1322.942,1327.788,It also might be the purpose of might giving a child a name and making the child legitimate?
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1327.788,1331.507,"That’s correct, that’s as to those who are born of wedlock that’s true sir."
1972.71-6698,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1331.507,1335.172,But that’s not applied to those born in wedlock.
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1335.172,1340.808,But it does do however sir if in the absence of a natural parent.
1972.71-6698,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1358.395,1370.816,"Well, are you suggesting that all of your grandparent/grandchild adoptions are situations where the “a natural parent” is absent to the death or something?"
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1370.816,1386.165,"As a general thing sir, I will say this that the children come to a grandparent during times of adversity regardless of what the adversity happens to be."
1972.71-6698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1386.165,1396.543,"Under the law of West Virginia, does an adoption change or alter in any way the status of the illegitimate child and may render it legitimate."
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1396.543,1398.132,"Yes sir, under our laws --"
1972.71-6698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1398.132,1408.683,"The adoption by a grandparent or a stranger, or is it just limited to the adoption by the parent, natural parent?"
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1408.683,1439.009,"Any adoption sir, under our adoption laws make the adopting parent in the same position exactly as if that child had been born in lawful wedlock, and any and every respect, our courts and our laws have been following that classification had gone just as far as they possibly can in doing that."
1972.71-6698,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.009,1440.017,Mr. McClelland.
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1440.017,1441.34,Yes sir?
1972.71-6698,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1441.34,1446.598,Would you follow up a little bit on Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question to you?
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1463.064,1489.512,"Well, for one thing sir, authorization for medical attention --surgical attention and that sort of thing, for the responsibility of the child as a parent rather than let’s say as a foster parents, or just as a friend as babysitter."
1972.71-6698,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1489.512,1497.359,What tangible elements flow from that responsibility?
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1497.359,1504.732,"That this child then becomes a;, for all intents and purposes, a natural child."
1972.71-6698,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1615.973,1619.814,What are you suggesting that Mr. Morris’ home wasn’t a good home?
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1619.814,1635.598,"No sir, no sir, I’m saying what a placement agency could have done or our welfare department which is about the only thing that we have in the State of West Virginia and all it comes close to being a Child Placement Agency or Public Placement Agency."
1972.71-6698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1669.988,1674.924,"Yes, your time is almost expired now, counsel."
1972.71-6698,0,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,1674.924,1675.927,Thank you sir.
1972.71-6698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1729.301,1731.445,Thank you Mr. McClelland.
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,1733.482,1756.628,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think that a short review of the development of the provision dealing with benefits for adopted children may be helpful in assessing both whether there are issues which ought to be decided now despite the repeal of the disputed provision after certiorari was granted and also in the merits of those issues."
1972.71-6698,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1953.974,1960.906,What’s involved here is the law as it was in the period of 1968 to 1972.
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,1960.906,1961.43,Correct.
1972.71-6698,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1961.43,1978.916,"And the issue here as I understand it you tell me please, if I misunderstand it, is the validity boils down and that balanced to the validity of the regulation that says that the court is not and cannot be a Child Placement Agency."
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,1981.327,1984.191,Yes and [voice overlap]
1972.71-6698,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1984.191,2001.885,And its impact in this West Virginia case where the criminal court in this county acted as a juvenile court and the court got the local policeman to make an investigation of the home and the claim is that not to allow this kind of a situation as a deprivation of due process of law.
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2001.885,2005.901,"Yes, I think that that’s correct."
1972.71-6698,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.056,2021.69,"Mr. Fleischer, could you tell me why the new, in the 72 Amendment does not apply to this case?"
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2021.69,2057.686,"There is a yes, yes, Mr. Justice White, Section 1 (11) (b) of the 72 Amendments provides a specific time clause and while it’s a bit ambiguous that Social Security Administration has interpreted that clause to mean that as to applications filed before the '72 Amendments became law that the applicant gets the best of the two."
1972.71-6698,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2057.686,2070.156,"So that even the applicant -- if by some possibility the applicant is disqualified under the 68 and 72 provisions, he could still take advantage if the 72 Act if he qualifies to that."
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2070.156,2084.205,"Yes, but in cander, I must say that its quite clear that this plaintiff does not under either -- this case is not moot."
1972.71-6698,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.303,2104.995,Well is it still then that the ‘72 provisions would not be applied to disqualify who would qualify them to a previous?
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2104.995,2108.051,That’s correct.
1972.71-6698,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2161.565,2173.088,"As I understand it that your -- before you move on to the merits theory, your initial argument here is that we ought to dismiss this writ as has been probably granted."
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2173.088,2173.304,That’s the --
1972.71-6698,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2173.304,2186.462,"-- because the law has never changed and because of this beyond the confines of this particular case it has very little impact if any, but you’re not making the argument if this particular case is moot."
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2186.462,2187.832,That is the correct statement of our position.
1972.71-6698,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2187.832,2192.806,The rights of the party still depend on the decision of this case?
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2192.806,2195.444,"Yes, now --"
1972.71-6698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2195.444,2201.569,When we get to the merits how many counties are there similar to this?
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2201.569,2208.177,I simply can’t say the record doesn’t disclose Mr. Justice Marshall and it --
1972.71-6698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2208.177,2216.693,Wouldn’t it be important to find out how many children are denied these benefits solely because they happen to be in the county that’s like this one?
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2216.693,2223.644,Well I don’t believe Mr. Justice Marshall that this plaintiff is denied solely because of that reason.
1972.71-6698,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.024,2284.571,But you don’t know of any other actual cases that depend on this?
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2284.571,2292.275,"No Mr. Justice White, counsel has represented this morning that there is one other now and I don’t doubt to that maybe so."
1972.71-6698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2292.275,2299.904,But can I take judicial notice that there are many counties in this country that don’t have Child Placement Bureau?
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2299.904,2308.439,"Well, even assuming that so, that doesn’t mean that in out county agency cannot supervise the adoption."
1972.71-6698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2308.439,2312.455,"Well, suppose they don’t."
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2312.455,2314.961,"Well in the first place, I don’t believe…"
1972.71-6698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2314.961,2319.952,I guess the child should move to another county.
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2319.952,2327.545,"Well, I don’t know that there is any basis for the supposition in the first place."
1972.71-6698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2673.611,2690.389,"In this particular case, suppose they moved to a county that did have a placement settlement and qualified and then move back to this county what would happen?"
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2690.389,2695.121,"You mean, if the adoption in the first place had been in a county where --"
1972.71-6698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2695.121,2703.869,Or they are living in a county where they can’t get it and they moved into a county where they can get it and they do get it.
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2710.03,2718.646,"Well, I would think that if the adoption is valid under the state law that its move was not solely for purposes of qualifying --"
1972.71-6698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2718.646,2724.988,I’m just trying to find some way this family could get it so they could get it by moving to another county and then moving right back.
1972.71-6698,1,44676,walter_h_fleischer,,2724.988,2734.861,"Well, I’m not certain Mr. Justice Marshall that the adoption could now be undone and reinstitute it."
1972.71-6698,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2770.845,2773.616,Thank you Mr. Fleischer.
1972.71-6698,2,22865,e_r_mcclelland,,2779.399,2793.139,"Your Honor on the question of adoptions and placements here there is no way that I could give justice to that in two minutes and all I can say is, well, thank you for your consideration."
1972.71-6698,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2793.139,2793.766,Thank you gentlemen.
