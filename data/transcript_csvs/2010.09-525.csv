2010.09-525,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.745,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-525, Janus Capital Group v. First Derivative Traders."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,8.759,13.805,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,65.14,69.797,"Counsel, is -- who is the violator alleged here?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,103.844,112.153,"Justice Sotomayor, the challenge statements appear in the prospectuses for the Janus Funds, separate legal entities not parties to this lawsuit."
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,112.153,122.479,"So how do we sustain the intermediary cases when the company, through market analysts, divulges misleading statements?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,132.038,137.832,"Your Honor, the company -- excuse me -- the conduit or analyst cases fall under two categories, neither of which is met here."
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,172.865,184.532,"Well, what's the difference between an omission or a commission if a company purposely divulges a falsehood to an analyst, knowing it's going to be distributed and told?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,187.78,190.089,"--Your Honor, the company makes the statement to the market."
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,195.197,204.397,"So why isn't -- why aren't the two appellants, on their theory, on -- we can talk about whether the complaint does or does not adequately allege their theory."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,230.542,236.166,"Your Honor, the analyst cases, the issuer speaks to the market directly."
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,243.13,254.923,Do you mean to say to me that puppets become a legal defense for someone who intentionally manipulates the market information?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,254.923,258.627,"--Justice Sotomayor, the Congress has drafted two statutes that deal with puppets."
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,269.152,270.949,That's the control person statute?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,270.949,271.23,No.
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,283.256,298.5,"But I -- but if Janus had no scienter, if its board of directors did not know that the statements were false, they had no way of knowing, because as I understand the complaint, and this is alleged, the deal was secret."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,303.951,314.46,"Justice Sotomayor, our position is nobody had scienter, and every adjudicator to look at these facts -- Judge Mott in the district court, the ALJ of the SEC, has found that there was no scienter anywhere up and down the line."
2010.09-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,319.147,337.421,"Well, somebody deviated from what was the announced policy -- that there was to be no market timers investing in this -- in these Janus Funds."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,347.321,357.943,"--The advisor personnel made the determination, Justice Ginsburg, that the policy was discretionary, that when it said we may refuse trades, the Funds may refuse trades, that there are discretion--"
2010.09-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,357.943,376.576,"Well, the statement that's alleged to have been -- the conduct that is alleged to have been in opposition to the announced policy, that is attributable squarely to -- this is the entity called JCM?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,376.576,378.17,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,378.17,383.95,So it made the decision that violated the policy?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,383.95,384.979,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,386.402,388.103,"Nonetheless, it's not a primary actor?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,388.103,389.775,"--Not as to these plaintiffs, Your Honor."
2010.09-525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,389.775,394.618,"But can -- can -- can we discuss the case, and -- and -- and perhaps you don't think so."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,410.544,412.887,"Justice Kennedy, you're exactly right."
2010.09-525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,414.65,417.119,And it seems to me that's what the argument here is mostly about.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,417.119,427.445,"And the question that is before this Court, we would submit, is whether, scienter or no scienter, JCM can be held liable for the statements in another company's prospectus."
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,427.913,431.894,Even though there was no scheme with another actor?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,437.034,439.078,--They chose not to bring a scheme case.
2010.09-525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,462.571,478.906,"But once again -- once again, if the complainants in the case, the plaintiffs in the case -- hypothetical case, not this case, hypothetical case -- were injured shareholders the Fund, I take it you say still they could not sue JCM?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,478.906,480.891,"--Your Honor, for different reasons."
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,527.073,529.619,"Well, Mr. Perry, who wrote the relevant statements?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,529.619,532.68,"Your Honor, the Fund made the statements to the public."
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,533.963,537.586,"I understand that they were in the Fund's prospectus, but who wrote them?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,537.586,541.116,"--They were drafted by lawyers for the Fund, lawyers representing the Fund."
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,541.116,542.613,Who paid those lawyers?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,542.613,545.44,The advisor paid the lawyers' salaries.
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,545.44,546.942,So JCM paid the lawyers?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,546.942,547.628,"Correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,547.628,556.297,"And so it was JCM's lawyers who wrote the prospectus, including the relevant statements here, the asserted misrepresentations?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,556.297,557.841,"I -- I disagree with that, Justice Kagan."
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,561.135,563.12,"Well, suppose the complaint had alleged that."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,570.135,570.869,--One would have to--
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,570.869,573.18,Would that be enough to survive a motion to dismiss?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,573.18,573.633,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,577.35,578.286,They're paid by JCM.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,578.286,581.035,"--Every prospectus is written by lawyers, Justice Kagan."
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,582.302,586.689,These are in-house counsel for the investment advisor.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,586.689,594.126,"In-house counsel, outside counsel, once they draft materials and present them to their client, it becomes the client's statement when adopted by the client."
2010.09-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,614.192,627.844,"Mr. Perry, you -- you said that it was the Fund's lawyers who drafted the prospectus, but in fact, it was JCM's lawyers, the lawyers -- they were in-house lawyers for JCM."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,638.779,642.385,"Your Honor, like all lawyers, they wear multiple hats."
2010.09-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,645.571,647.665,I thought they were in-house lawyers?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,647.665,663.174,"They are in-house lawyers at JCM, but they also represent the Funds, and the SEC has specifically recognized in the context of investment companies that where an advisor counsel is representing the Funds, his client or her client, for those purposes, is the Funds."
2010.09-525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,668.704,675.871,"Well, let's say that JCM's principal officers and managers wrote the statement."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,677.263,684.149,"Absolutely, Justice Kennedy, because when the statement is adopted by the issuer, it becomes the issuer's statement."
2010.09-525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,685.775,685.946,Yes.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,690.786,691.379,That's--
2010.09-525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,691.379,712.495,"Is there an alternate theory that JCM is really the day-to-day managers in day-to-day active control of the Fund, and therefore, it should be chargeable as if it and the Fund are the same for purposes of making the statement?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,712.495,712.904,--Your Honor--
2010.09-525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,712.904,718.402,"And we would say that that's different from, say, an outside law firm or an auditor?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,718.402,727.118,"--Your Honor, the word ""control"" appears more than a hundred times in the briefs on the plaintiff's side of this case in this Court, and the Congress has dealt with control."
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,733.567,755.495,"Except that I, as I read your brief, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, you were arguing that since there was an independent board of directors, presumably because there are two corporate -- different corporate funds -- two different corporate forms, that there couldn't be control person liability under 20(a)."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,769.318,778.845,"Our position, Your Honor, is that the Congress has dealt with the situation where you have two separate companies and to make a claim against the second company, you have to prove control."
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,785.155,803.022,"Under what theory would you defend an allegation that the investment manager who had control over the everyday affairs of the company, drafted or helped draft the prospectus, hired the lawyers who helped draft it, wouldn't be a control person?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,804.414,809.378,"--Your Honor, the investment company, the mutual funds, are separately owned, separately governed."
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,809.378,810.677,Exactly.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,820.016,826.715,"Well, Your Honor, then -- then we're just saying that the investment advisor is a service provider like every other service provider."
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,826.715,835.68,"But it's not in this case, because the allegation is that it -- not the company, that it chose to deceive the market."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,835.68,847.547,"--Your Honor, with respect, the allegation is that the advisor wrote a certain policy, but the very document cited for that in the complaint says that the trustees are responsible for the policies of the funds."
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,853.294,854.982,"Mr. Perry, does the Fund have employees?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,854.982,855.606,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,856.468,857.622,Who are the Fund's employees?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,857.622,860.808,"--Are the officers of the Fund, the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer--"
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,860.808,863.979,Are all of the employees also employees of JCM?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,863.979,868.245,"--Not the president, Your Honor, but the others are joint -- serve in joint capacities."
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,868.245,876.208,And could you just run through a little bit how one of these prospectuses gets -- gets issues eventually?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,880.396,887.126,"The lawyers representing the trusts, both in-house and external, draft the underlying document--"
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,887.126,893.888,"Well, here, I believe there was a statement in your interrogatories that it's JCM's lawyers, in-house lawyers, who drafted the relevant statement."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,893.888,896.309,"--The particular prospectus, answered in that prospectus."
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,896.793,898.743,And then what happens?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,898.743,902.213,"They are presented to the board of trustees, which holds a meeting."
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,907.209,910.395,Was there any change to these statements made by the board of trustees?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,910.395,911.206,These particular statements?
2010.09-525,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,911.206,911.581,Yes.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,911.581,912.158,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-525,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,931.526,937.477,Does the outside counsel you're talking about represent the Fund only?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,937.477,939.598,There is two separate sets of outside counsel.
2010.09-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,961.218,970.354,But the law firm that -- the lawyers who drafted the prospectus were in-house counsel for JCM on JCM's payroll?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,970.354,977.614,"They were paid by JCM, and at the time they drafted, they were representing the Funds, again, as allowed by the SEC, as disclosed in the documents--"
2010.09-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,977.614,986.814,But they weren't the independent outside lawyers who were representing the board or the Fund; they were the in-house counsel?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,986.814,988.955,--Those outside counsel reviewed every policy.
2010.09-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,990.031,996.251,I guess my question was simply: The drafters of the prospectus were the in-house counsel for JCM?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,996.251,999.812,"--The -- the paragraph being challenged in this case, that's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-525,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1003.044,1015.6,"I suppose if the lawyers for the trust did an inadequate job of reviewing the JCM drafts, they would be subject to a malpractice action by the trust?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1015.6,1016.536,"Correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-525,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1027.268,1038.67,"What happens if the president of the oil company, knowing that the statement is false, says: We have discovered 42 trillion barrels of oil in Yucatan."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1059.567,1063.58,--If he's an authorized agent of the same company that issued the statement?
2010.09-525,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1063.58,1065.174,What he is -- he didn't issue it.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1070.751,1074.186,"If the board of trustees of his company, so that the statement--"
2010.09-525,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1074.186,1075.84,He's the president of the company.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1075.84,1078.028,"--And the distinction here, Justice Breyer, is--"
2010.09-525,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1078.028,1078.621,"No, no."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1079.778,1082.465,"--If he is an authorized agent, he may be sued as--"
2010.09-525,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1082.465,1086.556,"He is running the business, the daily affairs, of the company."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1091.804,1093.317,"--He may be subject to liability, then."
2010.09-525,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1093.317,1105.297,"Now, if he is subject to liability, why isn't your firm, your client, subject to liability, who, after all, run every affair of the Fund?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1105.297,1108.343,"Your Honor, they run the management of the Fund."
2010.09-525,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1108.998,1110.218,"Yes, that's what a president does."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1120.103,1124.525,"--Because the corporate form has meaning in the Federal law and in State law, and where--"
2010.09-525,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1124.525,1126.335,"No, you have to explain it to me more."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1141.002,1149.807,"--The answer is, Your Honor: These funds are managed -- governed, excuse me, is a better word -- by the trustees."
2010.09-525,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1170.833,1171.348,I get it.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1177.017,1178.234,--That govern everything.
2010.09-525,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1178.234,1180.983,"That govern everything, and these are like helpers?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1180.983,1182.216,"Well, they're -- they're--"
2010.09-525,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1182.216,1183.219,They do a lot as helpers.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1221.203,1222.202,--Three answers.
2010.09-525,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1264.652,1264.948,Could you--
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1264.948,1270.695,"You're -- you're not suggesting, are you, that they did this for purposes of protecting your client from lawsuit?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1270.695,1271.837,--Absolutely not.
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1271.837,1279.835,"When it -- no, they did it for a business reason, that having separate entities was economically more useful for the market, correct?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1279.835,1283.568,"And every fund, or virtually every fund in -- in the United States, is set up this way."
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1283.989,1286.426,"So -- but that doesn't answer Justice Breyer's question, now."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1286.426,1287.112,--My third--
2010.09-525,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1287.112,1291.016,"Assuming that they didn't do it for that reason, what does it mean?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1291.016,1305.979,"--My third answer is that extensive regulatory involvement in the two acts enacted in 1940 specifically to regulate this industry, that Congress never made the decision to hold the advisor liable for the Fund's conduct."
2010.09-525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1319.475,1322.676,Just -- just to clarify Justice Breyer's hypothetical.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1337.389,1339.405,The company may be sued under 10b-5.
2010.09-525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1340.513,1340.856,Yes.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1340.856,1343.964,"But yes, it is an authorized agent making a statement on behalf of the company."
2010.09-525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1343.964,1352.554,So what you're saying is that the -- the agency relation that the president of the company holds is different that than the agency relation that JCM holds?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1352.554,1354.118,"Absolutely right, Your Honor, and that's a distinction--"
2010.09-525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1354.118,1354.757,Why is that?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1354.757,1359.16,"--It's grounded in State law, and it differs between one company and two companies."
2010.09-525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.876,1365.547,"Well, but is JCM an agent?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1368.608,1371.482,"--You know, for certain purposes, Justice Scalia, they are an agent."
2010.09-525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1371.482,1373.354,What -- what purposes are that?
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1376.665,1378.896,"No, Your Honor, for -- not for drafting a prospectus."
2010.09-525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1382.362,1382.518,Okay--
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1382.518,1396.884,"--It's attached as an appendix to our brief, which sets forth the things that JCM is an agent for investment operations, not an agent specifically for registering the Fund's securities for sales, complying with the Federal securities laws, preparing and issuing the prospectus."
2010.09-525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1398.261,1402.04,"So even though they did those things, they acted in excess of their authority?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1402.04,1403.21,"--They did not do those things, Your Honor."
2010.09-525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1403.21,1404.351,But that's the allegation.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1404.351,1405.443,"No, it's not the allegation."
2010.09-525,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1405.443,1407.568,"Well, suppose it were proved that they did do those things."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1414.127,1422.5,"I don't know how to respond to that, Justice Kennedy, since it's so far beyond what they could possibly prove here."
2010.09-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1423.233,1428.481,"Well, this case -- this case went off on -- in the district court, it was -- was it 12b-6?"
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1428.481,1429.339,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1429.339,1429.593,Okay.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1454.843,1461.483,"And, Your Honor, no court, no case from this Court or any court of appeals has ever held that the driver's seat exception, the central bank, exists."
2010.09-525,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1472.726,1484.99,"--But that was -- I mean, before you started out with statements that sounded like the sky is falling because lawyers would no longer be safe, banks would no longer be safe -- but the Fourth Circuit was -- was a much narrower view."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1494.906,1499.886,"--Justice Ginsburg, the Fourth Circuit's view was the manager helps the Fund."
2010.09-525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1511.117,1529.0,"--I thought that the question on which we granted cert was very clear: whether the Fourth Circuit erred in concluding that a service provider can be held primarily liable in the private securities fraud action for, quote, ""helping"", close quote, or, quote, ""participating in"", close quote, another company's misstatements."
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1535.246,1535.714,"--Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-525,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1537.995,1539.243,And that's what I thought we granted.
2010.09-525,0,36483,mark_a_perry,,1543.915,1545.12,--We agree with the Court.
2010.09-525,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1550.459,1551.258,"--Thank you, Counsel."
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1565.204,1567.173,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1567.173,1570.935,"Mr. Frederick, is that an accurate description of -- of the question before us?"
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1570.935,1572.764,"I don't think it is, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1572.764,1574.858,Why didn't you object to it in -- in your -- in your opposition?
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1574.858,1584.478,"We did object, in the sense that we described the complaint's allegations as JCM writing and preparing and being responsible for the prospectus."
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.414,1588.662,I don't -- but we -- we don't reevaluate facts.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1599.815,1627.661,"--We did say it in our brief in opposition, Justice Scalia, and the Solicitor General, when you called for the views of the Solicitor General, also said in the invitation brief that this case was not an appropriate vehicle for deciding just simply JCM was responsible for the prospectuses in all their various aspects: In writing, preparing, et cetera."
2010.09-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1628.648,1629.631,How can -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1630.114,1663.307,"--So we would submit that for the reasons we stated in our opposition and we stated in our red brief, as the case comes to this Court on reviewing a motion to dismiss of a complaint's well-pleaded allegations -- and I can go through the complaint's allegations if you like that explain how JCM wrote and prepared the prospectus and the policies for the Fund and then implemented them falsely -- we would submit this case is not about service providers, but it is about Janus Capital Management being the primary violator."
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.489,1669.943,Did they make the statements?
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1673.067,1673.972,"Yes, they did."
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.972,1675.598,They did make the statements?
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1675.598,1677.376,"Yes, they composed and created--"
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.376,1678.675,It didn't go out under their name.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1678.675,1679.549,"--It did, in--"
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.549,1685.327,"If someone writes a speech for me, one can say he drafted the speech, but I make the speech."
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1685.327,1699.338,"--Justice Scalia, we address the definition of SEC's interpretation, which is entitled to deference, as to being to create or to compose or to accept as one's own."
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.338,1701.962,"That's not what -- it depends on the context of ""make""."
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1716.94,1725.516,"In the prospectus, there is a section on management that explains that Janus Capital Management engages in the day-to-day functions."
2010.09-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1731.42,1735.697,--Except -- except when they review material going in the prospectus.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1735.697,1736.118,--But that--
2010.09-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1736.118,1739.18,Then they have independent representation by outside counsel.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1739.18,1739.979,--Right.
2010.09-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1759.641,1761.154,I don't understand -- I don't understand your answer.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1768.2,1768.606,--Yes.
2010.09-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1768.606,1775.492,"Our question is the validity of that statement, whether that's deceptive in the prospectus."
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1784.285,1788.988,And what they did was to falsely represent what they would do with that statement.
2010.09-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1791.608,1797.794,"Well, that's the question, I guess, that -- your response seems to beg the question -- is that they falsely represented."
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1809.742,1819.412,"It is a statement of both, in the sense that the Fund is attracting investors, but the Fund is managed and controlled by the investment manager; here, JCM."
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1819.412,1833.123,"But if JCM falsely represented what it would do, it made that false representation to the Fund, and the Fund, as has been acknowledged, would have a cause of action against JCM."
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1833.123,1834.078,No--
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.078,1835.544,But that's not what's going on here.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1835.544,1835.778,--No.
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1871.03,1877.153,What isn't clear from all of those things is that JCM made any representation to the public.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1901.972,1905.064,"Justice Scalia, they wrote the prospectus."
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1905.594,1906.14,That's fine.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1907.778,1914.139,"--And when they issued the prospectus, they used their address and represented to the public that they--"
2010.09-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1914.139,1917.356,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but it seems be an important -- when they issued the prospectus?"
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1918.463,1918.682,--Sorry.
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.41,1938.303,"If I carry a letter over and file it on behalf of some principal, does it become my letter?"
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1941.785,1942.487,Because it's--
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.487,1948.704,"As you say, they have no other agents, unless the trustees themselves were going to walk over and file it."
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1958.09,1958.948,"--Yes, they did."
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.948,1959.964,On their own behalf?
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1959.964,1960.542,Absolutely.
2010.09-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1971.629,1977.674,"And the SEC has recognized that they remain two separate entities, despite the interconnected relationship."
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1977.674,1993.169,"Certainly, but there are many cases -- in fact, I don't think it's ever been disputed in the courts of appeals that if one company outsources its management function and those outsourced managers make lies on behalf of the company, they are also--"
2010.09-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1993.169,1999.915,The one activity -- one activity that we know they did not outsource was review of the materials submitted by JCM.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2020.486,2028.67,"--Mr. Chief Justice, my answer to your question is: That's actually a very difficult question under fiduciary duty law, because here, the fiduciaries have been duped themselves."
2010.09-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2048.41,2055.768,"Isn't that, again, what has been conceded: That there may well be an action from the Fund represented by their trustees against--"
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.768,2056.501,Common lawsuit for duping.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2056.501,2070.84,"--Justice Scalia, in no instance that I'm aware of where a mutual fund investment advisor is a publicly traded company would that cause of action run on behalf of the managers shareholders."
2010.09-525,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2090.723,2093.738,Suppose this case didn't involve a mutual fund.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2114.916,2118.616,"--Well, the outside lawyers, I think, are distinguishable in a number of different ways."
2010.09-525,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2131.485,2133.47,What if it's alleged they knew exactly what was going on?
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2133.47,2146.506,"If there is scienter, where the lawyers knowingly act in a way that helps or that contributes to that fraud, they may well be subject as aiders and abettors."
2010.09-525,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2155.471,2157.172,And what are aiders and abettors?
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2158.626,2159.827,--Sorry.
2010.09-525,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2176.931,2181.8,What is it that -- I'm unclear on this.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2203.857,2206.028,"Yes, and we cited those cases--"
2010.09-525,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.028,2207.027,And they are liable.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2207.027,2208.337,--i believe at page 37.
2010.09-525,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2208.337,2208.871,You're saying they are liable?
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2231.78,2232.077,Yes.
2010.09-525,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2246.26,2246.635,All right.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2253.322,2254.43,--That's correct.
2010.09-525,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2254.43,2254.851,All right.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2290.898,2295.816,"Well, to be a primary violator, you have to have met all the elements of the cause of action."
2010.09-525,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2295.816,2296.175,Yes.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2296.175,2305.467,"To be an aider and abettor for SEC enforcement purposes, you simply have to provide substantial assistance to one who is a primary violator."
2010.09-525,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2305.467,2309.904,What's the difference between substantial assistance and doing it?
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2309.904,2311.686,You would not have to make the statement.
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2316.432,2322.992,"Mr. Frederick, I thought we had held -- I was sure we had held that there is no aiding and abetting liability--"
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2322.992,2323.257,Yes.
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2324.758,2326.287,--under the provision we're discussing here.
2010.09-525,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2326.287,2327.582,There's a distinction.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2335.358,2340.731,"--That's correct, because there is no primary violator under JCM's view of the facts here."
2010.09-525,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2350.898,2355.818,Is your claim premised on Janus being duped or not?
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2371.467,2373.047,--We would.
2010.09-525,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2379.543,2397.769,"Then go back to Justice Breyer's question, because I can see when there's one primary violator who uses another entity as a dupe or as a puppet, but I can't, and I don't know how to distinguish what you're proposing, from aiding and abetting."
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2403.766,2413.562,--It's the failure on the part of the person who would not have met all of the elements of the 10b-5 claim.
2010.09-525,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2440.02,2444.859,The distinction you're drawing is between making the statement and assisting in making the statement.
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2447.328,2456.059,"Well, no, in the sense that we believe, and we assert in the complaint and the complaint is adequately pleaded, is that JCM made the statements."
2010.09-525,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2456.854,2464.354,"Yes, aiding and abetting is assisting in making these statements as if -- as in something you want to take place, right?"
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2464.354,2465.243,--Yes.
2010.09-525,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2465.243,2469.007,"What is the difference, the distinction in -- in this context?"
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2480.439,2483.047,Who has substantive control over the content of the message.
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2507.521,2511.226,Do you deny that the Fund had substantive control?
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2526.999,2531.261,"--Well, they did not have a knowledge of the falsity."
2010.09-525,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2531.261,2535.433,"Well, that may mean that they're duped, but it doesn't mean that they don't have control."

2010.09-525,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2568.466,2573.231,But there is -- there is nothing in the record to indicate that that statement was attributed to JCM?
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2573.231,2575.855,--The public understood it that way.

2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2589.364,2599.939,"Well, JA 275A, Justice -- Justice Kennedy -- excuse me -- says that Janus Capital Management reserved the Janus name for itself."
2010.09-525,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2599.939,2601.842,How did it reserve that?
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2612.87,2624.289,"It said, and this is at page 275A, if for some reason Janus Capital Management's contract is terminated, the Funds can no longer use the Janus name."
2010.09-525,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2651.261,2669.722,"Mr. Frederick, a substantial part of the power of your argument comes from this notion that, as Justice Ginsburg said, that JCM was in the driver's seat, that JCM had control, that they were -- Janus was at most an alter ego of JCM and maybe something more, that it was just a creature of JCM."
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2693.805,2699.911,"Because you don't want to create a road map for other people to commit fraud, Justice Kagan, and that's what their theory does."

2010.09-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2741.141,2745.407,"Well, I know, but you were just responding by saying the problem is that this will give people a road map."
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2751.561,2757.886,"--But, no, the problem, Mr. Chief Justice, is that under their construction of the facts there's no primary violator."
2010.09-525,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2759.306,2760.039,The SEC--
2010.09-525,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2760.039,2760.838,--there's no primary violator.

2010.09-525,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2822.922,2828.654,--A primary violator must be somebody who has actually committed all the elements of a 10b-5--
2010.09-525,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2828.654,2829.793,Give me an example of that.
2010.09-525,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2832.121,2837.104,"--Well, the elements for the private cause of action are the ones that this Court has repeated."
2010.09-525,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2837.541,2838.321,I understand.
2010.09-525,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2838.882,2845.161,"--In this case the key one we're talking about is you would need to be an actual maker of the statement, and -- and--"
2010.09-525,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2845.161,2849.707,--And that becomes -- how is that different from aiding and abetting the making of a statement?

2010.09-525,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2908.46,2909.459,It seems like a yes or no question.

2010.09-525,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2946.68,2951.504,I'm still not clear what your distinction is between making the statement and aiding and abetting in the making of the statement.

2010.09-525,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3195.118,3195.539,It would be--
2010.09-525,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3195.539,3196.834,And you've bought yourself a big lawsuit.
