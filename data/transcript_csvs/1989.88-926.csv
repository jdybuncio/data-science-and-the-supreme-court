1989.88-926,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.92,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-926, North Dakota versus the United States."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,59.242,60.164,Thank you.
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,88.37,91.963,"Well, that isn't all the law says, is it?"
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,96.429,100.632,"If you buy it from a local distributor, that is correct."
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,100.632,103.195,"Oh yeah, yeah."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,103.818,104.787,"That is correct, and pay the tax."
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,104.787,105.928,"All right, all right."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,105.928,109.442,"We don't have a bootlegging problem with that, because there isn't a price differential."
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,110.177,120.047,"Well, why would that... don't you want to keep the... you don't want... you can't even use the liquor off the base--"
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,120.047,120.781,--That is correct.
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,120.781,121.266,--under this law.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,121.266,122.016,That is correct.
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,122.016,126.387,But if you... if it is bought from a local distributor--
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,126.387,127.653,That is correct.
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,127.653,128.511,--you may take it off the base.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,128.511,130.136,"That is correct, because the taxes have been paid."
1989.88-926,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,132.322,135.712,"Well, what's the purpose of the North Dakota requirement?"
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,135.712,138.664,--To prevent bootlegging of the liquor off the base.
1989.88-926,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,149.534,153.956,What sorts of diversions constitute the evil or the problem?
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,153.956,159.328,"Well, if I can confine myself to answer your question, first of all, solely to the record."
1989.88-926,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.956,190.831,Is that supposed to tax our credibility?
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,191.846,200.421,"--Well, anybody who has been around military bases knows that there is a little bit of drinking that goes on, but I think that is more than... than its share."
1989.88-926,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,203.279,212.15,Does the record show that the labeling requirement is what caused the out of state suppliers to stop supplying liquor to the government?
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,212.15,213.134,"No, it does not."
1989.88-926,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,230.206,234.922,Do you think you could require the federal government to affix the labels?
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,234.922,245.841,"That would be certainly more problematical then, because that would be an effort to directly regulate within the military enclave, and prior cases of this Court have not allowed states that kind of discretion."
1989.88-926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,277.61,285.122,"Can they be... may I just ask, you're worrying about the... having somebody... an officer buy so much liquor he could open his own liquor store, he could peel off these labels pretty easily, couldn't he?"
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,285.122,285.794,"--No, you can't."
1989.88-926,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,287.856,289.293,Can you peel it off the podium there?
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,293.962,295.181,--My apologies to the Marshal.
1989.88-926,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.954,317.937,Do you take the position that it is not a burdensome requirement?
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,317.937,320.249,No.
1989.88-926,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,324.325,330.448,"Well, then why couldn't the state just require all of the liquor sold in its stores to have the sticker that it was sold in the stores?"
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,335.664,341.882,"Well, that wouldn't help us with respect to identifying liquor that is sold on the base versus liquor that might be brought in from Minnesota."
1989.88-926,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,364.606,367.932,Does the state have any regulatory interest in liquor brought in from Minnesota?
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,373.399,380.412,"It is not a problem because the prices are roughly equivalent, because again they go through their regular state distribution system and taxes are collected on that liquor."
1989.88-926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,380.412,384.364,"Well, what you are saying is you don't need the stickers because the market takes the place of it there."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,396.156,399.64,"I am sorry, Justice Stevens."
1989.88-926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,408.495,408.932,I understand.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,408.932,413.43,"--and liquor sold in North Dakota, in Minnesota, in Montana and in South Dakota."
1989.88-926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,413.43,417.054,"I understand, but there is no similar price differential between the Minnesota liquor and the North Dakota liquor."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,417.054,417.772,That is correct.
1989.88-926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,417.772,429.377,"And therefore, if you required all North Dakota wholesalers and retailers to spend the three cents for these stickers on their liquor, anything that didn't have it would either be from Minnesota or from the base."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,429.377,429.909,That is right.
1989.88-926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,429.909,433.625,"And presumably, it wouldn't be from Minnesota because it doesn't save any money to get it from Minnesota."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,437.124,447.714,"The difficulty we have, though, is one of the two military enclaves we are talking about here is located in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and I am not... I don't know your familiarity with North Dakota geography, but that sits squarely on the border with Minnesota."
1989.88-926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,461.911,464.972,"I'm really, I don't... aren't there Minnesota tax stamps on the Minnesota liquor?"
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,464.972,466.081,"No, there are not."
1989.88-926,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,466.081,466.705,There are not.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,466.705,469.595,Only the federal tax stamp exists on both North Dakota and Minnesota liquor.
1989.88-926,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.527,496.553,"General Spaeth, one of the affidavits submitted on behalf of the government indicated that one out-of-state wholesaler said he was going to have to raise his price something like $20 a case if this requirement went into effect."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,503.91,507.237,I think it is a rather extravagant estimate.
1989.88-926,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,515.764,517.654,Let me ask you one more question.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,527.572,528.571,That is correct.
1989.88-926,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,528.571,532.381,"So if there were any triable issue in fact in the case, both courts were wrong, in effect."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,532.381,537.083,"That is right, although both sides stipulated to most of the essential facts in this case."
1989.88-926,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,545.252,549.875,"Well, I think there is a disagreement among you as to whether there is a ""burden"" or not."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,549.875,550.641,That is correct.
1989.88-926,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,550.641,552.592,And I am not so sure that isn't a factual question.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,552.592,561.464,"And, it could be, in some sense of the word, because obviously the federal government is arguing that it is extremely burdensome to comply with this requirement, and the state is arguing to the contrary."
1989.88-926,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,561.464,574.444,I... I take it the $20 a case figure could include also the substantial cost of having to keep separate inventories in the warehouse of the stickered and the non-stickered liquor.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,579.863,580.769,That's correct.
1989.88-926,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,583.722,591.015,"And of course, if your view prevails, you can have every state requiring stickers and then the distiller would have to keep 49 separate inventories."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,591.015,595.95,"--Unless the states got together and agreed on a sample labeling procedure, that is correct."
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.304,698.331,"xxx I gather, if the... if you don't comply with the labeling, then you have to be... work through the state wholesalers--"
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,698.331,699.282,That is right.
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.282,705.639,"--and you have to pay the tax, and inevitably, the price of liquor then delivered to the base will go up."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,705.639,706.28,That is correct.
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,706.28,709.091,Every bottle will be... will cost more.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,709.091,710.435,"That is right, because the tax will be--"
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,710.435,717.838,And in the long run the people on the base will be paying the same price as... as people pay off the base at local stores.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,717.838,721.931,"--That assumes that they are going to go through the distribution network, and many of the stores--"
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,721.931,723.664,"Well, I know, but if they don't label they go through that."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,723.664,724.367,--That is correct.
1989.88-926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.783,742.672,"General Spaeth, you say it is like a lot of other state regulation."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,751.685,752.355,That is correct.
1989.88-926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.277,753.808,That is a big difference.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,753.808,764.866,"--Well, it is a difference, but it is a discrimination in favor of the federal government, because every other distributor has to pay the tax and go through the whole distribution network, be licensed and be bonded."
1989.88-926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,785.889,790.091,"Well, how does this, how does this in favor of the government in any respect?"
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,790.091,799.992,Because it doesn't require... we are not attempting to tax the distributor or the supplier or purveyor of liquor to the base.
1989.88-926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,804.648,805.007,They just have to label.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,805.007,806.568,They just have to label.
1989.88-926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.691,814.705,"Do you think you could do that, you could go the other route?"
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,814.705,818.859,Go which route?
1989.88-926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.859,828.075,"Re... impose the tax, require the base to buy it from your... require the federal enclaves to buy it through the distributor system?"
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,828.075,839.445,"I don't think that the state could require the federal enclaves to buy it through the distribution system, but I do think the state, if it wanted to, could tax those suppliers before they sell the liquor to the base."
1989.88-926,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,856.375,859.811,Is that true if the supplier... that's not true if the suppliers are out of state.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,859.811,869.09,"--Well, they are in state, though, for the purpose of doing business, in the sense that they are selling to locations within the state."
1989.88-926,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,917.149,935.874,"Well, one gets the impression, General Spaeth, from reading about what Congress did, that the intent was to require the bases to purchase locally when they are talking about beer and wine, but to allow liquor to come in from out of state as well as locally, and be competitive, when you are talking about hard liquor."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,935.874,936.593,That is correct.
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,947.808,951.307,xxx liquor at the lowest prices available.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,951.307,951.822,--That is right.
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,951.822,954.462,"No matter what the price is, it is the lowest price that is available."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,954.462,958.695,"That is right, and they are free... the bases are free to buy from whatever source they want."
1989.88-926,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,973.657,980.56,"General Spaeth, do you have any comment on the milk case of Paul against United States, and how it bears on this?"
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,980.56,982.294,"Yes, Justice Blackmun."
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1014.609,1020.216,To cure a danger to your own economy.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1020.216,1023.184,"That is right, bootlegging of liquor within the state."
1989.88-926,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1052.828,1054.203,How much liquor are we talking about?
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1054.203,1056.717,--Being supplied to the base?
1989.88-926,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1073.086,1076.71,"They drink a lot at Minot and Grand Forks to keep warm, I suppose."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1076.71,1077.132,That's right.
1989.88-926,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1085.127,1086.581,You have an interest in this litigation.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1088.017,1089.189,It cuts both ways.
1989.88-926,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1090.766,1095.967,"Of course, what I am concerned about is your, you show no comfort for the Minnesota bootleggers who need all the help they can get."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1098.107,1103.745,"--Well, the State of Minnesota's economy is doing so much better than ours these days that I have no sympathy whatsoever for it."
1989.88-926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1107.119,1109.696,"General Spaeth, I didn't understand the last statement you made."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1120.27,1120.489,Yes.
1989.88-926,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.737,1124.69,Readily.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1124.69,1130.36,"--enforce some sort of tax, and that would lessen the price differential and help alleviate the bootlegging."
1989.88-926,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1130.36,1132.56,But not cure it.
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1132.56,1138.7,But perhaps not cure it because the military enjoys a tremendous purchasing advantage as well because of the volumes it buys.
1989.88-926,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1138.7,1142.308,"Thank you, General Spaeth."
1989.88-926,0,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,1142.308,1142.917,Thank you.
1989.88-926,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1142.917,1145.666,Mr. Lazerwitz.
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1145.666,1149.774,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1226.632,1231.084,"Well, now... but that is basically an issue of fact, don't you think, Mr. Lazerwitz?"
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1231.084,1247.016,"That is clearly an issue of fact, and in this case there was an uncontroverted affidavit from Kim Keltz, that would be found at the Joint Appendix 25 to 28, and she... her affidavit stated that these regulations would in effect require the government to pay more money."
1989.88-926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1250.311,1253.763,That these regulations would require the government to pay more money?
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1253.763,1254.154,--Yes.
1989.88-926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1256.339,1257.776,But more money than what?
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1289.327,1300.15,"Well, Ms. Keltz's affidavit, she testified or explained that five of our prime source suppliers said, in light of these regulations, we are no longer going to sell directly to you."
1989.88-926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1300.15,1303.039,"Okay, but do we know how many source suppliers you had?"
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1303.039,1304.148,"No, we don't."
1989.88-926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1305.241,1307.068,So that proves five wouldn't do it.
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1310.677,1321.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Court, in the liquor business, with both liquor that is manufactured, distilled, in this country and out of the country, there are exclusive distributors."
1989.88-926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1323.22,1324.999,But is this all in the record?
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1324.999,1334.293,"--The only record support, or the record that bears on this aspect, is in the Kim Keltz affidavit, and that is not contradicted."
1989.88-926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1334.293,1343.617,"And you... but, you're defending a summary judgment on the basis of a statement that five out-of-state suppliers said they would no longer supply."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1347.724,1352.207,"The affidavit further states... no, it doesn't, that is clear."
1989.88-926,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1362.812,1371.2,Suppose that all suppliers would go ahead and put the labels on with the inevitable result that the price would go up.
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1377.338,1382.883,"In that respect, if in fact every state in the country had one of these... had a labeling requirement, yes."
1989.88-926,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1386.755,1398.0,"But somebody has to be, some suppliers have to say no, and the base would want to... nevertheless, to purchase from those suppliers."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1402.406,1405.452,Whether the government would want to.
1989.88-926,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.452,1405.795,Yes.
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1405.795,1406.561,The government--
1989.88-926,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1406.561,1408.184,"They would say okay, so long, friend."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1413.838,1421.819,"--The government, at least in the liquor field, the government... there are only certain entities that sell particular brands."
1989.88-926,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.818,1428.628,You don't need to have a... you don't need to have a full line of whiskey to make--
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1428.628,1434.079,"--Well, the whole point of these enterprises on military bases, they are twofold."
1989.88-926,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1442.045,1445.309,"--We are arguing about something that really there are no findings about, so--"
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1445.309,1451.166,"Well, there is a second aspect to this case that's equally important in terms of its constitutional invalidity."
1989.88-926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1528.385,1529.01,--But they wouldn't--
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1537.476,1541.021,"Well, he says that, we don't know."
1989.88-926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1541.021,1544.253,"Well, that is one of the many things we don't know in this case."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1544.253,1550.517,"Well, the... there is no doubt that because this case was decided on cross motions for summary judgment the record is quite minimal."
1989.88-926,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1552.719,1568.76,"Excuse me, as far as the Minnesota liquor is concerned, I assume it is a violation of the states law to bring in untaxed liquor, untaxed by North Dakota, whether it is taxed by another state or not."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1569.76,1571.275,--There are allegations--
1989.88-926,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1571.275,1579.365,"--I mean, I assume they would want to find all liquor that hasn't paid the state tax, whether it is federal liquor or non-federal liquor."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1590.142,1590.642,--That is true.
1989.88-926,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.637,1642.729,I suppose that also there is probably not as high a mark up on the base either.
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1651.819,1664.611,"Not that I know of, although the military, the Department of Defense, has a specific regulation telling the servicemen that you cannot... we will sell you the liquor on the base, but if you take it off the base you are subject to state law."
1989.88-926,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1675.935,1676.419,"No, but you can take it home."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1682.136,1682.604,"Oh, of course not."
1989.88-926,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1685.681,1685.947,The state can't make you do it.
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1685.947,1689.977,And the state has told us in its brief that it can't tell us to do it.
1989.88-926,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1689.977,1693.959,"But you could presumably satisfy... if you were willing to go to that burden, you could probably get the liquor."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1699.847,1700.488,"Actually, no."
1989.88-926,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1784.408,1789.373,Could the state impose a general sales or use tax on these sales?
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1789.373,1790.638,They could not.
1989.88-926,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.506,1931.426,"And you... that is a 10 percent profit margin, assuming you had to pay the same rent for stores and everything else."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1937.548,1948.559,"Oh, I don't want to downplay the competitive advantages of military procurement, but I just don't want to leave the Court with the impression that we had a simple option of just raising prices."
1989.88-926,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1981.374,1992.838,"Yes, but it is also true, I suppose, that they... to the extent that there is liquor bootlegged off the base in large volumes, you get the benefit of that by increased sales and increased profit to support your day care centers."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1992.838,1993.431,Well--
1989.88-926,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1993.431,1997.898,"So you actually have a financial interest in having the state law violated, in the way they are complaining about it."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,1997.898,2001.037,"--Well, no, we don't, Justice Stevens, and there are some practical concerns."
1989.88-926,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2021.311,2025.107,"It may not, but if its, if the figures he has given us are correct--"
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2025.107,2025.513,"--Well, the--"
1989.88-926,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2025.513,2030.712,--it is apparently a serious problem that the Commander of the base should have been able to see was going on out there.
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2030.712,2037.289,"--Well, the example in Hawaii was, I believe it is Hawaii, it is so silly, but the money, the liquor was stolen from the military."
1989.88-926,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2105.621,2110.26,"Who's supposed to read these labels, do you suppose?"
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2112.898,2116.724,"--Well, I think the way the regulations are set up, they don't, they could care less."
1989.88-926,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.521,2124.55,"Yeah, but they... so, do they think this is really going to be an effective way of curing their problem?"
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2129.642,2130.016,"--Well, I--"
1989.88-926,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.016,2133.093,"--don't sell off the base, don't use off the base."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2133.093,2146.213,"--Well, one curious aspect of this case, and I am not sure it's my province to get into, but the only, if you read North Dakota's laws, there is no law that says it's illegal to consume liquor off the base."
1989.88-926,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.11,2180.839,"Well, do you think there... I would think, I would think if this... putting on this label is not an effective way of curing the problem they want to cure, that you would argue that."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2186.791,2192.334,"--The labeling would be... no, it is an incomplete way, and it is an incomplete way for the reason I gave before."
1989.88-926,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2215.309,2222.026,"But for the state to think this is going to cure their problem, somebody has to read the label and say gee, I had better obey what this label says."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2222.026,2223.714,"Well, the servicemen are told--"
1989.88-926,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.714,2229.039,But that is no different than what the military already requires.
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2229.039,2235.208,"--We tell the servicemen that we'll sell it to you, but if you take it off the base you are subject to state law."
1989.88-926,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.208,2242.611,"Well, I guess the state wants to be able to identify these bottles off base, if they should come across a cache of liquor in a barn."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2242.611,2243.158,"Oh, sure, or--"
1989.88-926,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2243.158,2248.249,"For example, say ah ha, this is untaxed liquor, I see these little orange labels on it which you can't get off."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2251.045,2256.028,"--Yes, and also... I mean, the example cited in Washington where someone was essentially selling to another liquor store."
1989.88-926,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2263.478,2270.367,"--Well, I suppose it is also not implausible to assume that the sticker requirement is so burdensome that you will have to buy through the local wholesaler."
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2270.367,2274.49,It certainly... anyone who knows the liquor business would know that you would.
1989.88-926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2353.146,2356.503,Do you feel you may need amicus briefs to win this case?
1989.88-926,1,36236,michael_r_lazerwitz,,2356.503,2361.344,"At times I did, but I don't think... the government can stand on its own briefs and its own arguments."
1989.88-926,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2397.283,2399.266,"Thank you, Mr. Lazerwitz."
1989.88-926,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2401.624,2411.871,"I think the Court understands the case, but I thought I would follow up on a couple of points that came up and perhaps the Court is also in doubt about the answer."
1989.88-926,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2424.054,2433.051,"But you don't think it is going to add... be a deterrent effect to... I mean, somebody reads that label and says I should--"
1989.88-926,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2433.051,2433.877,--No.
1989.88-926,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2441.405,2448.544,"--Well, is it... what is the penalty for possessing liquor in North Dakota which has not been purchased through a wholesaler?"
1989.88-926,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2448.544,2450.715,It depends on... on how we find them.
1989.88-926,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2455.65,2456.697,"Well, is there a violation?"
1989.88-926,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2456.697,2457.398,--There could be.
1989.88-926,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2469.988,2473.768,So the penalties we are talking about is possession of liquor for resale?
1989.88-926,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2473.768,2474.502,That is correct.
1989.88-926,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.543,2492.042,Isn't there some rule you're not supposed to be in possession of untaxed liquor in--
1989.88-926,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2492.042,2494.368,"No, we don't have a possession rule."
1989.88-926,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2502.194,2504.069,"--General Spaeth, I had two questions."
1989.88-926,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2519.841,2522.013,"I don't know if it is substantial, but it is more than three cents a bottle."
1989.88-926,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2522.013,2527.965,"It is a lot more if you have to open... I mean just opening a liquor case takes a little work, you know, and it's... and then getting each bottle--"
1989.88-926,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2527.965,2531.775,"I don't know, I don't buy it by the case, but it could be more burdensome."
1989.88-926,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2532.463,2534.273,"--And so that is what we are talking about, is that?"
1989.88-926,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2534.273,2534.461,Yes.
1989.88-926,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2534.976,2539.397,"And the second thing, is there... maybe you have answered it, I just wasn't entirely clear."
1989.88-926,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2545.989,2546.8,"No, there is no labeling requirement."
1989.88-926,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2546.8,2547.91,Don't many states do that?
1989.88-926,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2547.91,2549.674,"Some states do, but many states do not."
1989.88-926,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2549.674,2550.158,Yeah.
1989.88-926,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2550.158,2558.404,"The last point I wanted to address, and then if there are any questions I will answer them, is the dispute we are having with the government about whether we could tax or not."
1989.88-926,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2592.297,2594.483,Thank you General Spaeth.
1989.88-926,2,37281,nicholas_spaeth,,2594.483,2595.015,Thank you.
1989.88-926,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2595.015,2595.827,The case is submitted.
