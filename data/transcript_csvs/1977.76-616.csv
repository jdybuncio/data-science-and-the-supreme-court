1977.76-616,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,24.982,We will hear arguments next in Number 76-616 New York against Cathedral Academy.
1977.76-616,0,29612,jean_m_coon,,28.381,32.073,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-616,1,40099,richard_e_nolan,,1426.103,1428.274,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-616,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.156,1496.445,"Mr. Nolan, write at that point, because I want to be sure you cleared for me the the reliance issue."
1977.76-616,1,40099,richard_e_nolan,,1503.88,1506.037,"I believe that so, I know this helped there."
1977.76-616,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1510.561,1516.298,But then would they had not had to perform this service entirely apart from any reliance on other funds?
1977.76-616,1,40099,richard_e_nolan,,1516.298,1536.141,"They would have had to perform the services, but they would not have expected any reimbursement, but the Statute Mandated Services Act did, was to give that at the schools an expectation of reimbursement of certain moneys which they could use for their general purposes."
1977.76-616,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1537.651,1546.04,"So the real harm to the school is not having all these funds available as replacement for funds, they will be used for general purposes?"
1977.76-616,1,40099,richard_e_nolan,,1546.04,1553.583,"Well, I think the funds that would have been made available really would have gone into the general purposes of the school, would be an additional money."
1977.76-616,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.583,1558.592,So it is really the same case as if these funds were just the general subsidy to that extent?
1977.76-616,1,40099,richard_e_nolan,,1558.592,1573.123,"Well, I think that was raised in the Levitt case, but I think as to that, this Court has never said that simply because a payment is made to a school which enables it to free up all the funds, but that is a violation of the Establishment Clause."
1977.76-616,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1577.427,1583.021,That the whole concept of reliance here is really inability to free up funds for general purposes?
1977.76-616,1,40099,richard_e_nolan,,1583.021,1585.522,That is right Your Honor.
1977.76-616,2,29612,jean_m_coon,,2693.446,2693.859,No.
1977.76-616,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2693.859,2699.336,"Thank you, the case is submitted."
