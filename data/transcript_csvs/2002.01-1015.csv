2002.01-1015,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.946,"We'll hear argument next in Number 01-1015, Victor Moseley and Cathy Moseley doing business as Victor's Little Secret versus V. Secret Catalogue, Inc.--"
2002.01-1015,0,30755,james_r_higgins_jr,,54.236,58.694,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, counsel:"
2002.01-1015,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,97.682,101.13,"You mean Tennessee is remote, or this particular business is?"
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1458.0,1462.83,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1015,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1525.495,1528.346,"What if the answer was simply, I'm not sure any more?"
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1530.779,1534.594,It... it might.
2002.01-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1555.417,1574.536,"But you... you would get that answer from a consumer if you asked them about the word, Delta, what products do you associate with the word, delta, and the consumer would say, airplanes, or air... you know, air travel and faucets, and there wouldn't be any dilution there, would there?"
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1574.536,1585.021,Not unless their... a conclusion could be drawn based on other factors that--
2002.01-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.021,1585.393,Right.
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1585.393,1596.167,"--a mark had established a certain distinctiveness that is associated only with the particular mark, and now that is being blurred."
2002.01-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1596.167,1613.085,"Well, I believe... are you saying that the Delta example is only good now, and that when the person who made Delta Faucets first came out with a faucet that he called Delta, or Delta Airline... I don't know who came first... the chicken or the egg, the airline or the faucet."
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1627.475,1643.7,"Only under the Federal dilution statute of '95 if the mark is a famous mark, and in the Toro case that we cite, the--"
2002.01-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1643.7,1645.779,So I can't even have Delta Peanuts?
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1654.307,1660.912,"--Well, not automatically, but if--"
2002.01-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1660.912,1669.823,"All you have to do is find a consumer who knows of Delta Peanuts and says, you know, what do you associate the name Delta with, and he says, airlines and peanuts?"
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1669.823,1682.46,"--Well, that would involve an exact replication of the mark, which are the only examples given in the House report or in the legislative history, such as Kodak Pianos."
2002.01-1015,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1699.65,1718.952,"Mr. Wallace, at least in some of the circuits, I'm not sure in the cases of this Court, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought that in trademark infringement cases, that the circuit court said that they have certain de novo authority."
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1731.478,1733.13,Yes.
2002.01-1015,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1733.13,1738.637,"--in infringement cases, and shouldn't that same rule be applied here?"
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1760.452,1765.16,It is very difficult.
2002.01-1015,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1770.461,1776.238,"Mr. Wallace, may I ask you something to clarify the Government's position on this?"
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1813.861,1814.671,--Yes.
2002.01-1015,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1835.848,1840.677,"But the court of appeals was going on, when you think of Victor's you think of Victoria's."
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1850.248,1865.48,"I think the... the question is not do you think of Victor's, but when you think of Victoria's, do you think of more than what Victoria's Secret--"
2002.01-1015,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1865.48,1865.813,Right.
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1865.813,1870.022,--itself has as its merchandise and image.
2002.01-1015,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1884.139,1893.899,"Is there... what is the extra... I'm not... if you're finished with that question, I'd like to... which I think there's a lot to."
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1939.374,1951.634,We don't believe that in itself constitutes dilution if there is none of the damage to the ability of the mark.
2002.01-1015,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1951.767,1962.408,"All right, so... so the ability of the mark consists either of my bug example, or some general weakening of the goodness that inheres in the name."
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1963.401,1965.63,"--Well, yes... no, I think--"
2002.01-1015,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1965.63,1966.085,"No, okay--"
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1966.085,1966.928,--I think the Fourth--
2002.01-1015,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1966.928,1967.943,--The answer's no.
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1967.943,1972.112,--The Fourth Circuit case of Ringling Brothers was very illustrative.
2002.01-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2036.302,2037.683,That's... but that's confusion.
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2056.364,2060.822,"That's true, at least when it's an identical mark, or one that's so confusingly similar--"
2002.01-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.822,2065.952,"But that goes to the very point you've just been talking about, and contradicts what you've said."
2002.01-1015,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2069.904,2077.252,"--There... there has to be confusion as to the mark, rather than as to the source of the product."
2002.01-1015,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2077.252,2078.655,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2083.112,2087.821,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1015,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2108.133,2111.598,"Well, it... I mean, that's to some extent a play on words."
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2135.808,2146.11,"Justice Scalia, we agree that the act requires a showing of actual, present dilution, and that such a showing was, in fact, made below."
2002.01-1015,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2168.651,2174.883,"--But what about the first time it was used either for... what is it, the airline, and what's... faucets?"
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2180.623,2185.164,--Then it would not suffer the disqualification that would come as to what is present--
2002.01-1015,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2185.164,2185.364,Yes.
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2185.364,2186.196,--about proliferating uses.
2002.01-1015,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2202.892,2206.135,"Well, let's... and keep it so I can understand it."
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2215.151,2216.72,--I don't know--
2002.01-1015,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2216.72,2217.092,--on your criterion?
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2217.092,2217.952,--on those facts.
2002.01-1015,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2220.824,2221.074,All right.
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2248.444,2273.13,"--If they're not sure who's the source of the product, it may be infringement, and the reason I resist the use of Delta is that a lot goes into a determination of whether... as it did in this case... as to whether a mark has those special qualities that mean that the second or junior user and the third, fourth, and fifth are lessening its capacity to communicate these very distinctive ideas."
2002.01-1015,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.281,2297.767,That was bad?
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2309.246,2309.739,Yes.
2002.01-1015,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2309.739,2310.361,Okay.
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2310.361,2311.354,"I have, and--"
2002.01-1015,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2312.962,2317.536,And the difference between Tiffany's Restaurants and Delta Faucets is what?
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2317.536,2319.649,There may be no difference.
2002.01-1015,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2324.933,2325.1,Okay.
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2325.1,2336.717,But here's why Delta Faucets and Tiffany's... if the original marks are famous... both constitute the harm of dilution.
2002.01-1015,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2337.915,2340.244,"You mean, just using the name?"
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2340.244,2343.404,--Just using the name--
2002.01-1015,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2343.404,2348.129,Is likelihood of dilution enough?
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2348.129,2355.121,"--No, not under the act, and... and nor is just using the name enough, nor is just semantic similarity."
2002.01-1015,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2359.834,2361.775,That it causes dilution for everybody--
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2361.775,2364.308,"--It causes dilution, and dilution--"
2002.01-1015,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.326,2388.691,--Where will it all end?
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2388.691,2389.346,--Where will it all end?
2002.01-1015,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2390.92,2391.863,"Well, so what?"
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2401.777,2402.487,--Exactly.
2002.01-1015,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2433.623,2435.564,No longer identifies one thing.
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2448.767,2456.94,"--Congress determined that that was bad to the extent that the mark no longer stood for something singular or particular, no longer conveyed--"
2002.01-1015,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2456.94,2469.367,"Then again, that's just another way of repeating the same thing, and the reason that I think it's important is, perhaps we can survive with only having one Tiffany's, but let's think of some slogans out of my youth, you know."
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2496.404,2500.491,"--No, I do not... it is not at all the case."
2002.01-1015,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2503.258,2506.025,"Yes, the safe harbor is fair use."
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2506.025,2506.43,--And it--
2002.01-1015,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2506.43,2516.633,"Fair use, and that's what's again worrying me, because those two words, fair use to me spell lawyers, lawsuits, uncertainty and confusion."
2002.01-1015,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2516.633,2524.229,"--If you lose distinctiveness, what you lose is the selling power of the mark."
2002.01-1015,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2535.459,2537.332,Chevrolet doesn't matter.
2002.01-1015,3,30755,james_r_higgins_jr,,3616.183,3620.392,"Mr. Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1015,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3734.593,3736.35,"Thank you, Mr. Higgins."
