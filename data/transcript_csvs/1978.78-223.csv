1978.78-223,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.074,The case is submitted.
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,71.636,75.191,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-223,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,521.416,526.857,"Now, Mr. Come, what significance is your reference to special permission?"
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,531.618,532.662,"Well, --"
1978.78-223,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,532.662,535.703,I just wonder why are you emphasizing it?
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,535.703,564.319,"Well, I'm emphasizing it to show that the -- there's nothing in this record to indicate that the use of the cafeteria was a predominant part of the hospital's therapeutic treatment here."
1978.78-223,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,582.928,593.549,"Well, wouldn't a special permission to be relevant to the question whether patients who went to the cafeteria were at least thought to be well enough to associate with the public as opposed to secret people."
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,593.549,597.67,That is correct.
1978.78-223,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,640.533,645.914,"You are using, the Labor Board's definition of patient care, aren't you Mr. Come?"
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,657.05,663.411,"Well, I -- I'm going by the testimony of the hospital administrator who --"
1978.78-223,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,663.411,665.703,He talked about work areas?
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,665.703,672.177,"Well, he defined a work area as an area where a patient received care or treatment."
1978.78-223,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,672.177,678.849,You're not suggesting that the corridors of the hospital were not associated with patient care?
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,678.849,679.785,If --
1978.78-223,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,679.785,681.157,Are you?
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,681.157,688.663,"No, I'm not but the -- but we do not have the corridors of the hospital involved in this case."
1978.78-223,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,714.87,721.727,Does the Board apply its rule to hospital corridors?
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,721.727,751.607,"The Court of Appeals in the Baylor Hospital found that it had and the Board was reversed on that because on the ground that the -- there was not -- the hospital had shown enough facts to indicate that those hospitals, that those corridors were associated with patient care."
1978.78-223,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,754.189,761.103,Does the Board apply rules to nurse stations?
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,761.103,769.831,The hospital in this case permitted solicitation in the --
1978.78-223,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,769.831,780.956,"Yes, I'm going to ask your opposition why but does the Board apply its rules to nurse station?"
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,780.956,800.215,"I think it would depend upon whether or not you could -- it would -- the hospital could show that those were patient care areas and I think in most hospitals, it would be easy to show that."
1978.78-223,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,812.105,821.136,"What's the Board's attitude about nurse stations, if any?"
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,821.136,831.597,I -- I think that it would depend upon whether it could be shown that that was a work area or a patient care area.
1978.78-223,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,846.117,854.432,"Well, I take it then to constant care area which is becoming more and more popular, probably the Board would be fairly lenient there."
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,854.432,857.872,I would -- I would think so.
1978.78-223,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,857.872,871.88,Mr. Come has the Board -- is the Board still applying the -- its rule to corridors in any hospitals after the reversal in the Baylor case?
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,877.535,886.576,I do not know Your Honor what the Board has done as to take back some of the other hospital cases and --
1978.78-223,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,886.576,888.212,What about the General Counsel?
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,888.212,889.502,What's that?
1978.78-223,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,889.502,892.214,What about the General Counsel?
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,892.214,899.701,I know of no specific case involving the corridors.
1978.78-223,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,899.701,913.898,"Well, Mr. Come doesn't this case, I know you said it but doesn't this case involve the corridor at least to this extent even though the solicitation was not in the corridor, the Board's order, if one reads it one way, does prohibit solicitation in the corridor, if one reads it another way, it doesn't."
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,923.182,941.089,"Well, I think -- I think that what the Board order says is that the hospital just cannot have a blanket ban in these public areas."
1978.78-223,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.549,972.444,"There is substantial testimony in this case, Mr. Come, about the corridors and the use to which they were put."
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,972.444,979.217,"Well, I'd like to get to that testimony but I will --"
1978.78-223,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,979.217,982.946,"In light of that testimony, what happened to it?"
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,985.836,1037.829,"No, I -- that testimony in short merely indicated that -- and it was given after the rule was promulgated, it was essential to keep a tranquil atmosphere, well, throughout the hospital, that when the doctors were asked about union solicitation, as my brother, Mr. Gold will indicate in more detail, he indicated that what they were concerned about was loud or hostile or volatile union solicitation and that peaceful solicitation one on one, they did not think would affect patient care."
1978.78-223,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1037.829,1048.985,"One on one when a patient may need the attention of the nurse for example, one on one solicitation at a time when patients are ringing for nurses or orderlies."
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1048.985,1051.837,"Well, this is not in a patient care area."
1978.78-223,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1056.619,1063.401,"I'd like to get back to your statement, about this corridor that's not being used for treatment."
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1107.37,1121.911,I think that they're in unless the hospital is able to demonstrate that they are patient care areas or that the activity there would interfere with patient care.
1978.78-223,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1125.268,1130.301,Must they demonstrate both that they were patient care areas and that activity --
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1130.301,1131.153,"No, either."
1978.78-223,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1133.069,1144.565,"Didn't this Court earlier this term, in Baylor University Hospital differentiated between the cafeteria and the corridors and its disposition to the case summarily?"
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1144.565,1159.987,They did because they found that the hospital there had introduced evidence which showed that the corridors were not -- were patient care areas.
1978.78-223,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1163.238,1164.726,What's happened to that case?
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1164.726,1166.211,Baylor Hospital.
1978.78-223,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1166.211,1166.993,What's happened to it?
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1170.665,1174.247,"Well, their only cafeteria was remanded to the Court of Appeals."
1978.78-223,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1180.233,1181.849,But the corridor --
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1181.849,1182.867,The corridor issue --
1978.78-223,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1182.867,1184.302,We denied certiorari?
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1184.302,1185.857,"Yes, you did, Your Honors."
1978.78-223,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1185.857,1191.424,"And it was held in that case but the Court of Appeals refused to enforce the Board's order with respect to the corridors, is that it?"
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1191.424,1200.278,"Right, because what the reason for denying cert was that the Court viewed it as a substantial evidence question in that case."
1978.78-223,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1200.278,1202.622,You're telling us that's why we denied cert?
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1202.622,1205.216,"Well, that is what the opinion for the Court --"
1978.78-223,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1205.216,1205.835,Said.
1978.78-223,0,37058,norton_j_come,,1205.835,1207.316,-- said.
1978.78-223,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1215.598,1220.473,Mr. Gold.
1978.78-223,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1220.473,1224.872,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-223,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1485.066,1488.619,"These cases you refer to were not hospital cases, were they?"
1978.78-223,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1488.619,1489.076,No.
1978.78-223,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1489.967,1496.626,Don't you think there's quite a difference between a factory or something of that kind in a hospital or a hotel?
1978.78-223,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1503.697,1512.448,It would seem to me that there would be occasions where it might.
1978.78-223,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1512.448,1517.252,Solicit the bell boys when they are to take care of the customers?
1978.78-223,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1517.252,1529.629,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think the best way I can answer that question is to turn to (a) (66) of the record."
1978.78-223,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1575.995,1578.178,You moved in to the cafeteria.
1978.78-223,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1584.632,1585.642,"Well, I --"
1978.78-223,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1585.642,1592.472,You mean they can just -- they can solicit without any interference with working functions?
1978.78-223,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1592.472,1599.278,I -- I think it would depend on whether it was a nonworking area for them and whether they were on nonworking time.
1978.78-223,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1698.775,1705.893,"Mr. Gold, you restrict this to a nonworking area and nonworking time?"
1978.78-223,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1705.893,1706.49,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-223,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1706.49,1707.154,Both?
1978.78-223,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1707.154,1707.412,Right.
1978.78-223,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1707.412,1712.37,Absolutely.
1978.78-223,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1712.37,1731.732,"In the nonhospital context or at least, the factory context maybe a better word, solicitation has been permitted in working areas during nonworking time but not distribution."
1978.78-223,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1888.243,1893.449,"Mr. Gold, I'm sorry, I beg your pardon right there."
1978.78-223,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1920.775,1923.104,Yes.
1978.78-223,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1924.567,1928.716,If Mr. Come is willing to give you his time?
1978.78-223,1,34498,laurence_gold,,1928.716,1939.623,If I have time I have plan to go on to that but the reason that we think the Board could disregard that testimony is the reason I concluded with.
1978.78-223,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2001.874,2006.026,I think you've covered those points so far.
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2007.632,2011.173,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2048.146,2050.971,"Well, as a defector, you're familiar of the both sides of the problem now?"
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2050.971,2053.678,"Yes, hope so."
1978.78-223,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2053.678,2055.319,"Well, as you see, I'm a defector, too."
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2057.172,2059.53,Yes sir.
1978.78-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2477.052,2485.126,(Voice Overlap) could a patient make an appointment with his insurance broker to meet him in the cafeteria say if he needs some insurance or not?
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2485.126,2485.928,"No, sir."
1978.78-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2493.752,2500.068,What about in the sitting room just a place to -- a place where patient -- the only place the patient can probably talk to somebody outside?
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2513.778,2522.948,"According to the rule Mr. Justice, the solicitation or selling things of that sort are not permitted in the public access areas."
1978.78-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2533.486,2537.17,"If the patient wants to see his insurance agent, he can invite him to his room and --"
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2537.17,2546.624,"He could invite him to his room and I suppose that might be alright if only the patient, his insurance salesman was there."
1978.78-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.728,2554.944,"But suppose he's in the ward a fortiori, he couldn't invite him in there?"
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2554.944,2555.89,"No, sir."
1978.78-223,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2563.486,2565.884,"Now, let's get close to the home."
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2568.309,2569.607,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-223,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2569.607,2571.933,And write a will?
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2571.933,2575.794,"I suppose he could talk to him about important matters such as will, yes sir."
1978.78-223,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2575.794,2577.963,"Well, I'm just trying to get closer to home."
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2577.963,2586.756,"But Mr. Justice Marshall, I'd like to get to a point here I think it may be somewhat misleading."
1978.78-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.392,2643.674,"Well, you show that suppose it makes any difference, if it's 30%, 10% patients in the cafeteria or 60%."
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2643.674,2644.646,"No sir, I don't."
1978.78-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2644.831,2647.639,And so you would suggest that we were wrong in Beth Israel?
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2647.639,2650.022,"Well, I could go along with you a little bit on that context."
1978.78-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.022,2652.767,"Well, not very far though on this argument because --"
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2652.767,2653.394,"Pardon, sir?"
1978.78-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2653.394,2657.073,"You couldn't go very far with this on Beth Israel, making this argument you're making now."
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2657.073,2657.727,"No, sir."
1978.78-223,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2688.786,2693.365,You think we can draw a line between the operating room and the parking lot?
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2693.365,2694.424,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-223,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2696.085,2699.646,"Well I mean, do you?"
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2699.646,2700.712,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2700.712,2703.712,"You don't have any patients out on the parking lot very often, do you?"
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2703.712,2705.062,"No, sir."
1978.78-223,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2705.062,2709.049,Are you going to mention nurses' station situation at this hospital case?
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2709.049,2710.7,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-223,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2733.883,2740.416,"Well, I just wondered whether you thought that was consistent with your position on after the cafeteria and other places."
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2740.416,2742.312,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-223,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2759.607,2760.448,Not I.
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2763.964,2768.699,Well I -- but at least the record -- pardon sir?
1978.78-223,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2768.699,2775.508,"Nurses' station, the area in which the nurses relax when they are not working or is it like the desk of a hotel where they are giving orders --"
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2775.508,2787.041,"It is primarily as I understand it sir a work area but according to the evidence in this record at this hospital, it is used for employees for breaks also and the utility rooms next door."
1978.78-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2788.499,2789.916,But the patients don't use it.
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2789.916,2790.516,"No, sir."
1978.78-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2812.968,2818.761,At least it has anything to do with this case or the rationale of this case if there aren't any patients involved.
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2818.761,2819.832,"That's right, sir."
1978.78-223,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2862.701,2864.003,You mean in Beth Israel.
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2864.003,2864.431,Pardon?
1978.78-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2869.05,2879.744,"May employees, is there a rule against employees talking with each other about whether or not to join a union just to get away from this word solicitation?"
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2879.744,2880.464,Solicitation?
1978.78-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2880.464,2881.6,Yes.
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2897.058,2899.138,"Your Honor, I would say not."
1978.78-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2899.138,2900.26,"Well, you would say not."
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2903.606,2906.64,That particular set of facts has not brought up.
1978.78-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.39,2915.394,"Well, can you get into the big argument in the cafeteria about whether ought to be a united fund or separate fund drives for Red Cross?"
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2915.394,2921.975,"Well, Your Honor -- Your Honor, I view a discussion between two people as a little bit differently as when I view solicitation as such."
1978.78-223,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2954.559,2967.967,"So employee can't -- couldn't circulate a petition in an election, not a union election, but couldn't get to have –- to get signatures to put somebody on a ballot for city council?"
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2967.967,2971.49,"Not in those areas accessible to the public in the hospital, sir."
1978.78-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2977.692,2980.752,"Well, which ones do you mean, the locker room and the parking lot?"
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2980.752,2981.536,"No, sir."
1978.78-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2982.135,2982.724,Which ones?
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,2982.724,3007.567,"The nurses' stations, the utility rooms, the two employee lounges where one is a cafeteria type lounge that have vending machines, seats approximately 50 people, another one seats 25 to 30 and apparently in the entire maintenance building at least after the testimony and the laundry building is also in the testimony, employee restrooms and the parking lot."
1978.78-223,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3014.21,3018.04,"In the laundry, can you hear anything in the laundry --"
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,3018.04,3020.538,Laundry building is what they --
1978.78-223,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3020.538,3022.473,Can you hear anything -- have you ever been in laundry room?
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,3022.473,3023.639,"Yes, sir."
1978.78-223,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3023.639,3024.946,Have you been able to hear anything?
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,3024.946,3027.1,Not a great deal.
1978.78-223,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3045.429,3047.692,"There are places for hidden discussion, I suppose."
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,3047.692,3050.008,That's right.
1978.78-223,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3073.846,3085.806,"Yes, but there are some people that have been in a hospital and hearing nurses talking about when they are going to get their promotion which has nothing to do with the union but that's alright."
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,3085.806,3110.254,"Well, I think the testimony of the doctors was that any type of conduct or conversation which was unprofessional or would show the patient or the patient might be led to believe that these people are more concerned with something rather than patient care or need would be upsetting to a patient and they did not distinguish Justice Marshall between patient's stamina or a patient."
1978.78-223,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3110.254,3117.263,What I am worried about is that they decide what is good conversation and what is not.
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,3117.263,3117.749,Well --
1978.78-223,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3117.749,3124.605,And I think some people don't like other people deciding what they should talk about.
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,3124.605,3125.488,I suppose --
1978.78-223,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3125.488,3128.383,Isn't that right?
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,3128.383,3129.987,"Well, yes and no."
1978.78-223,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3138.285,3140.026,"Well, I don't want to get involved in that."
1978.78-223,2,23886,fred_w_elarbee_jr,,3140.026,3141.09,Alright sir.
1978.78-223,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3232.457,3233.078,Thank you gentlemen.
