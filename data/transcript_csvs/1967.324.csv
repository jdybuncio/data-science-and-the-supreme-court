1967.324,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,16.375,"Number 324, Norfolk and Western Railway Company et. al, versus Missouri State Tax Commission."
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,55.255,58.551,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.324,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,383.67,393.079,"Well, how would the -- how would the value of the Wabash affect the value of the Norfolk."
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,393.079,401.124,The purpose of the Missouri formula is to get at the value of the rolling stock within the state.
1967.324,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,401.124,402.478,I understand that.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,402.478,426.908,"The -- in the previous year, it was quite true, only Wabash rolling stock was sought to be valued but it was thought and indeed the evidence at the hearing before the State Tax Commission showed that the most of the rolling stock of the N&W that was in Missouri in 1965 was that rolling stock which had been leased from the Wabash."
1967.324,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,426.908,427.203,I see.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,427.203,433.42,So that the two complements of rolling stock were roughly comparable.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,433.42,440.252,Well was the -- was the valuation factor in the hands of Wabash different?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,440.252,441.488,It was the same 47%.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,441.488,442.248,Same 47%.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,442.248,443.169,The same 47%.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,443.169,456.107,And I take it the N&W has returned that is the cost less depreciation figure on the Wabash holding stock.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,456.891,460.106,That would've been the same with one year further advance a particular car can be.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,460.106,463.867,Then this all -- then this increase from $9 to $20 million you're talking about --
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,463.867,465.035,To nearly 20 --
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,465.035,467.63,-- because of the increase in the trackage factors?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,467.63,469.641,Because in the increase of the trackage factor.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,469.641,476.346,Well now what trackage in addition to the Wabash trackage did the N&W have in Missouri?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,476.346,486.285,None but that trackage was a -- a percentage of the entire N&W.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,516.327,517.14,Do you know what that was?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,517.14,518.357,-- the Wabash fleet.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,518.357,521.246,Do you know what that was in the hands of Wabash?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,522.913,524.973,I do not know the answer of that.
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.644,550.214,"But if the N&W had built, had always owned the Wabash, had always owned those lines had built them and had built them up and was operating them, had been operating them like the Wabash had been, why N&W always would have paid this much on this formula?"
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,550.214,572.729,"If the formula had been valuably applied through the years of the N&W that's quite true and the assertion is not that the mere inquiry shows that it is enough to prove the formula is invaluably applied but when there is no real change in what is sought to be measured by the formula, it is an indication that something is wrong."
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,572.729,577.173,What was N&W's submission as to what the correct text should have been?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,577.173,577.584,The N --
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,577.584,580.459,Was it something in the excess of $9 million but less this one?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,580.459,580.91,No.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,627.113,629.241,And roughly what would that compute out to in fact?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,629.241,638.959,And if you computed that in the same way that the Tax Commission computed the value for the entire fleet that is by taking 47% of the cost less depreciation.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,643.381,647.057,"Not much less that had been paid by the Wabash, is that it?"
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,647.057,648.804,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,666.976,675.088,"Well, was there any finding as a matter of state law that the N&W approach was not permissible on the state statute."
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,675.088,682.401,The Tax Commission said it was bound to tax all railroads in the same manner under the mileage formula.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,682.401,683.203,Did the Supreme Court disagree?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,683.203,685.996,The Supreme Court did not disagree with that.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,685.996,688.282,But are we just going to take that is the state law.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,688.282,699.762,I think although the Supreme Court suggested at one point in its opinion on a slightly different manner that the -- that the Tax Commission was free to consider other matters.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,704.352,705.068,"Well, how are we --"
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,705.068,713.169,"Well in event, well, the state law has been so applied as to amount to a mere mechanical application of mileage formula."
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,713.169,717.07,So you stand therefore under constitutional attachment?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,717.07,721.323,That is correct.
1967.324,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,849.985,854.283,"Mr. Allen, how many states used the mileage approach?"
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,855.668,856.875,The pure mileage approach?
1967.324,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,856.875,859.919,Yes.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,859.919,864.178,There are only two others on the N&W system that due.
1967.324,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,877.067,881.93,"On the N&W system, how many states are involved?"
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,881.93,883.889,There are --
1967.324,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,883.889,884.815,You said only two.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,884.815,885.64,Only two.
1967.324,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,885.64,886.625,And how many are there --
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,886.625,889.185,There will be 14 states involved.
1967.324,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,889.185,890.232,14.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,891.307,898.875,"Only three in addition to Missouri, I should have said."
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,949.771,952.035,"Does it work this way, Mr. Allen?"
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,977.311,979.273,That's exactly the point Mr. Justice Brennan.
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1011.203,1028.98,"But you're -- you're -- the premise for that argument is that there's only thousand cars in Missouri which they were permitted to -- were within the jurisdiction of Missouri and your proof of that in this case is that well last year the Wabash only takes paid some, only paid X."
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1028.98,1031.526,No Mr. Justice White.
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.526,1033.854,Where do you get the thousand cars factor.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1033.854,1040.784,The proof -- the proof of that is to count of cars on tax day and on days throughout 1964.
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1040.784,1044.574,I see.
1967.324,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1044.574,1051.026,Would you mind stating that premise again what Mr. Justice Brennan was talking about?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1051.026,1067.628,The way Mr. Justice Brennan phrased the point is this that a state is entitled by a formula if that proves convenient to get at the fraction of a carrier's rolling stock that is always in the state.
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1107.876,1114.606,So the number of cars has no relationship to mileage which is the factor they apply.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1114.606,1115.345,That's right.
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1116.755,1127.628,So that say West Virginia or Kentucky where you're carrying coal did the state used the same formula they're liable to under tax.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1127.628,1139.307,"If the state used the same formula, they would be likely undertaxed and the case that originally proved the use of the mileage formula, a case decided by this court that approved its general validity."
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1170.412,1172.773,Especially states that would under the statute.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1172.773,1177.815,States like West Virginia have more sophisticated formulas that take into account density of traffic.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1177.815,1184.54,"Well of course, Mr. Allen, I don't understand that you're asking us to say that per setting this formula is unconstitutional."
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1184.54,1185.251,That --
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1185.251,1190.02,You're just addressing your case to the application of that point.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1190.02,1190.299,That is correct.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1190.299,1191.261,Producing this.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1191.261,1212.367,"That is correct and there -- this has a tradition in this Court and there are cases in which the general validity of mileage formula has been sustained but in which subsequently in cases involving those same statutes that were sustained, they have been invalidated in application."
1967.324,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1212.367,1216.89,"Mr. Allen, suppose the state -- this is statutory, this method is --"
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1216.89,1219.234,This method is statutory.
1967.324,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1219.234,1221.365,So it's not something a Commission invented.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1223.816,1224.723,That is correct.
1967.324,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1224.723,1259.779,"Now suppose the statute has provided only this that all railroads in Missouri shall be subject to a tax and that when the railroad is an interstate road, and the railroads to be subject to a tax based upon the mileage of tracks not the number of miles of tracks that they have in the state and when the railroad has track in the state and outside of the state, it shall determine it by this precise formula."
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1264.934,1268.119,I'm not quite clear what the measure of the tax is Your Honor.
1967.324,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1268.119,1270.368,Your track to mileage.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1274.155,1278.399,But what value are you using or what value are you dividing by --
1967.324,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1278.399,1287.539,"To drive out of exactly the same way, instead of calling it a tax on rolling stock, they call it a tax on trackage to the state."
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1287.539,1289.817,"No, I -- no, Your Honor."
1967.324,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1313.538,1320.215,Why would that be a violation of the United States Constitution now?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1320.215,1333.741,For the reason that you are -- that in that case the state is in substance justice in this one taking out of state values into its taxing power.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1333.741,1335.731,This isn't just an ad valorem tax?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1335.731,1338.188,This is an ad valorem tax in this case.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1338.188,1346.26,"There's nothing known but at least, the principles that have the franchise, or the other types that -- no concerns us here."
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1346.26,1348.133,Well they don't -- they don't concern us directly.
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1363.693,1370.878,"I suppose in a particular case, the mileage formula, if that's all that was would might be even held valid."
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1370.878,1370.972,Yes.
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1370.972,1373.725,Or do you just say that on its phase it's that no matter what.
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1373.725,1374.486,Oh no.
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.863,1386.649,"Yes, but today is also long past with saying that it can't be counted in any case."
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1386.649,1388.937,I -- I submit that it has long passed.
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1485.452,1486.309,But what is this argument?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1489.53,1500.638,"It is both and in all the cases, that in which -- in which the issue has arisen or either the case has --"
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.638,1502.79,"Either, either?"
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1505.949,1507.536,I assume it doesn't have to be both.
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1514.276,1516.955,"Now, why does it establish the burden on commerce?"
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1516.955,1527.273,Because the carrier has been subjected to the risk of multiple taxation on its --
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1527.273,1531.796,Why shouldn't they -- why waive to prove a multiple burden?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1531.796,1535.538,"Well, I don't think that has been the approach to waive for actual multiple burden."
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1546.676,1550.892,"Haven't you already agreed that if all the states have this formula, there would be no burden."
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1550.892,1556.01,But there -- but the problem Mr. Justice White is that not all the states do have this formula.
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1556.01,1558.54,"Well, is that in this record?"
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1558.54,1558.73,It --
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.73,1564.106,"That's what I mean, I'm just waiting -- I'm just wondering if you can say it's a burden until you've actually demonstrated that it's a burden."
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1564.106,1576.525,"No I think you can demonstrate it by reference to the taxing laws and practices of the other states in which the N&W operates, I think they can be noticed."
1967.324,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1576.525,1586.049,Is there not too destructive to conclude that your coal cars and (Voice Overlap) in West Virginia are being taxed not only by those two states but by Missouri?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1586.049,1589.218,I cannot say that it appears in the record before the state Tax Commission.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1592.635,1601.359,"Well tell me Mr. Allen, I -- could New Jersey impose an ad valorem tax against Grand Central Station in New York City?"
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1601.359,1602.365,I think not.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1602.365,1604.748,Why?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1607.296,1609.39,I would look to the Due Process Clause.
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1609.39,1615.737,"You wouldn't look to the burden on commerce in that case, would you?"
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1615.737,1617.849,I would -- I would -- my instinct is to say --
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1617.849,1619.01,How does this differ?
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1619.01,1620.867,How does this differ?
1967.324,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1620.867,1623.229,"Well then otherwise, why do you have to go to the burden on commerce?"
1967.324,0,43817,william_h_allen,,1623.229,1624.837,You may not have to Your Honor.
1967.324,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1690.67,1692.45,Mr. Peterson.
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,1692.45,1696.504,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please."
1967.324,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1712.09,1713.483,Is what?
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,1713.483,1714.297,Excuse me.
1967.324,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1714.297,1715.725,Is what?
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,1715.725,1737.32,Is grossly excessive and if it is grossly excessive within the standard of the case that attribute constitutional problems to this then undoubtedly it would be or could be a burden under state commerce and or violates a Due Process Clause as it applies to the states.
1967.324,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1737.32,1740.797,"It's not -- it's not quite that blunt measurement, is it?"
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,1755.912,1756.534,Mr. Justice Stewart --
1967.324,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1756.534,1775.245,"As a matter of the constitutional limitation of the state that it either sometimes framed than do in our cases in due process terms, sometimes in interstate commerce terms that the state is exactly more than it can constitutionally can from this interstate."
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,1775.245,1787.457,"If I understand you correctly -- your question correctly sir, it would be whether or not I suppose the tax is reasonably related to the commerce conducted in the state, do I understand you?"
1967.324,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1787.457,1797.911,"The state has, if this Court has said I think that many times powered a tax what is within or rationally connected with that state."
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,1797.911,1798.416,Yes.
1967.324,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1798.416,1807.472,And you wouldn't I suppose contend that Missouri could impose a tax on things out in California even though for a very low tax.
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,1807.472,1808.532,Oh not at all.
1967.324,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1809.007,1814.414,"So it's not really whether it's in our judgment grossly excessive, that's not quite, that's all I ask."
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,1814.414,1817.092,"Well this is -- yes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1967.324,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1917.421,1918.822,Examined the findings?
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,1918.822,1919.807,Examined the findings.
1967.324,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1920.027,1920.282,Where is this finding?
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,1922.805,1927.938,On page 55 in the appendix to the record I believe.
1967.324,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1927.938,1931.637,55.
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,1931.637,1935.056,"Starting on 52, I'm sorry Mr. Justice Black."
1967.324,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1935.056,1935.646,What?
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,1935.646,1939.722,"52, page 52."
1967.324,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1939.722,1942.73,Well may I just ask Mr. Peterson.
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,1948.111,1949.36,Yes it is Mr. Justice.
1967.324,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1949.36,1959.939,"And I take that Missouri would not claim any power constitutionally, the tax rolling stock, in fact outside the State of Missouri."
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,1988.369,1959.939,Not at all.
1967.324,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1988.888,2003.808,"Now then I take it if in fact a formula resulted in the tax of property outside the state, you take the same position if constitutionally this could not be dealt with."
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2003.808,2003.811,Certainly.
1967.324,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2003.811,2024.291,"So that really, what you're coming down to is that on all of the findings made by the tax and agencies and courts of your state concerned with this, they have reached the conclusion that actually, the application of this point that did not result in the tax of any rolling stock of N&W outside the state."
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2024.291,2025.371,That's correct.
1967.324,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.371,2027.612,Suppose not and you will.
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2062.802,2065.094,This is what they're contending Mr. Justice White.
1967.324,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.094,2067.103,You mean those are not the facts.
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2067.103,2070.652,We do not feel they are.
1967.324,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2108.372,2116.825,That just goes to rebutting the point that you will be -- that peripheral factor of the Wabash value the year before.
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2146.555,2154.195,"If I may sir, the formula of course is the trackage percentage not -- it's not proportion number of cars."
1967.324,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.218,2162.958,"I understand that but applying your trackage percentage, is the number of cars gives you $3000.00 worth of cars instead of $1000.00 worth of cars."
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2171.861,2173.083,Yes total depreciated equal less.
1967.324,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.083,2176.929,Wholly aside from what the daily car count is.
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2176.929,2177.577,Yes.
1967.324,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.552,2195.557,"So you could -- you could easily come out if they have pure cars per mile at Missouri than they have at all the other states but had the same number of miles in Missouri as they have in all the other states, you're going to come out taxing cars that aren't in Missouri."
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2195.557,2199.897,"Mr. Justice White, that is correct if you assume that that has happened."
1967.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2217.803,2227.763,"Mr. Peterson, is it true that the same track of the same number of cars here as when the Wabash was operating independently?"
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2227.763,2237.209,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I would say that there are evidence in the Commission hearing evidence that was true."
1967.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2239.64,2250.086,And so merely by being leased by Norfolk and Western without more the evaluation went up.
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2250.086,2250.235,Yes.
1967.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2250.235,2252.186,Missouri evaluation went up.
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2252.186,2252.63,Yes.
1967.324,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2252.63,2264.918,"Well suppose Penn Central now takes over N&W, they'll go up again?"
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2264.918,2267.634,"May I answer this way, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1967.324,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2315.925,2321.432,What's the function of the equalization factor in this situation?
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2321.432,2330.285,Mr. Justice Fortas the Missouri Tax Commission in its findings explains the equalization factor.
1967.324,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2341.871,2346.892,"In other words, you don't assess at full value at 47% of full value."
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2346.892,2347.631,"Yes, that's correct."
1967.324,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2347.631,2352.02,Now that's pretty much what the general level of assessment says for other types of property.
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2352.02,2360.797,This -- that percentage figure is not Mr. Justice Brennan but it's an attempt by the Tax Commission to make it assessed.
1967.324,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2364.267,2364.658,Yes.
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2364.658,2368.39,"And it is set out in their finding, how they arrived with that."
1967.324,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2368.39,2376.666,Does the 47% across the board is applicable to the whole railroad properties in the state?
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2376.666,2381.446,Yes Mr. Justice Fortas and that also in their finding.
1967.324,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2408.646,2417.09,"You mean what they haven't done -- if what they have done is in otherwise alright in the taking of another $300,000.00?"
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2417.09,2427.855,Not exactly Mr. Justice Fortas but it is an attempt to take into consideration there are certain depreciations and so forth that are not within the schedules.
1967.324,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2427.855,2433.635,Now Mr. Peterson I'm sorry I didn't had a chance really to study your (Inaudible) so perhaps you will recover this.
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2446.849,2449.132,That is not in our brief Mr. Justice Brennan.
1967.324,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2450.724,2451.806,"Well then, don't bother."
1967.324,1,45790,william_a_peterson,,2453.605,2458.121,Now I'd like to if I may continue on one point.
1967.324,2,43817,william_h_allen,,2570.924,2575.549,May it please the Court.
1967.324,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2588.755,2590.331,"To the thousand cars, you're referring."
1967.324,2,43817,william_h_allen,,2590.331,2593.818,To the 3000 cars.
1967.324,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2599.423,2603.855,Now could -- could Missouri do this Mr. Allen?
1967.324,2,43817,william_h_allen,,2621.68,2623.168,It might raise a different question.
1967.324,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.309,2633.283,"They can't tax 2000 cars, but now as they merge with the Wabash --"
1967.324,2,43817,william_h_allen,,2633.283,2636.912,You can't tax the 2000 cars merely because of a merger.
