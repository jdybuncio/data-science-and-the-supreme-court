1988.87-6325,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.82,We'll hear argument now in Donald Ray Perry v. William D. Leeke.
1988.87-6325,0,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,49.414,51.516,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-6325,1,21740,donald_j_zelenka,,1676.947,1682.601,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-6325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1695.027,1700.579,"Well, is it your position that you have to prove prejudice in this situation to prove any constitutional violation at all?"
1988.87-6325,1,21740,donald_j_zelenka,,1700.579,1708.835,That is generally the position because we see the Sixth Amendment as being whether he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at this trial.
1988.87-6325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1708.835,1719.142,"Because the court below seemed to say there was a violation, a Sixth Amendment violation, did it, but that it... but what, no new trial unless there's prejudice, or--"
1988.87-6325,1,21740,donald_j_zelenka,,1719.142,1729.498,"From our reading, they looked at the Sixth Amendment and said the Sixth Amendment essentially is to determine whether there is a fundamentally fair trial where the true adversarial testing had occurred."
1988.87-6325,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1742.425,1747.46,"--Well, do you argue, do you argue here that that was proper in any event, or admit that that was error?"
1988.87-6325,1,21740,donald_j_zelenka,,1747.46,1760.719,--We submit that that did not act as a situation where he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel at his trial because generally you do not have a constitutional right to consult between direct and cross examination.
1988.87-6325,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1797.576,1800.261,Fundamental fairness is a due process inquiry.
1988.87-6325,1,21740,donald_j_zelenka,,1810.736,1832.232,"--It turns on, we submit it turns on fundamental fairness when you look at Strickland v. Washington where the concern was whether in that situation prejudice had been shown, whether the reliability in the verdict and the decision of the court by the guarantee of the right to counsel had been undermined by something that occurred within the trial."
1988.87-6325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.194,1862.519,"Mr. Zelenka, your position that it's okay here because there's generally no right to speak to your counsel between direct and cross examination or between cross and redirect, that position would apply even if the recess were overnight, wouldn't it?"
1988.87-6325,1,21740,donald_j_zelenka,,1862.519,1864.121,If that was--
1988.87-6325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.121,1872.358,"So you would say that even if he were deprived of access to counsel overnight, so long as that overnight break occurred between direct and cross, that would be all right."
1988.87-6325,1,21740,donald_j_zelenka,,1872.358,1875.761,"--No, we don't take that position because of what--"
1988.87-6325,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1875.761,1879.546,"Well, then, you must be relying on something different from the principle you just expressed."
1988.87-6325,1,21740,donald_j_zelenka,,1879.546,1898.842,"--In Geders v. United States, that was a situation involving the overnight recess, and this Court looked at that situation and said that that is a time they normally confer to talk about the strategies of the day, what occurred during the trial, and to prepare for the next day and the succeeding days in the particular trial."
1988.87-6325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1957.463,1965.152,"Mr. Zelenka, you refer to this as a nonroutine recess, but don't courts in South Carolina generally take an afternoon recess?"
1988.87-6325,1,21740,donald_j_zelenka,,1965.152,1975.358,"That is, my experience is it does not always occur, and it certainly does not always occur when a defendant is on the witness stand."
1988.87-6325,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1975.358,1988.435,"No, I recognize that, but I don't know that you can necessarily distinguish the overnight recess in Geders from the much shorter recess here by whether one is routine and the other is not routine."
1988.87-6325,1,21740,donald_j_zelenka,,1988.435,2002.694,"I think you might have an expectation for a lunch recess, but I don't think you would have an expectation generally of there being the, what we'll call the routine brief recess in the afternoon of the trial or in the morning of the trial."
1988.87-6325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2183.012,2217.5,"Mr. Fairey, let me interrupt to say, because I'd like you before you finish to comment on your opponent's argument that during a recess of this kind, if the defendant has to be placed in a cell for 15 or 20 minutes while the prosecutor is getting organized for cross examination, there's a little unfairness there, and my particular question now is supposing instead of giving what you say is good testimony on cross examination, he knew what he was doing, say he had stammered and indicated that he was really emotionally upset and one thing or another, but yet there's all the evidence of guilt in the world, as you're going to say, what result in that case?"
1988.87-6325,1,21740,donald_j_zelenka,,2217.5,2220.868,I don't think it would be a constitutional situation.
1988.87-6325,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2224.339,2237.897,"No, the only issue I'm directing this to is would there be prejudice if in reading the transcript you thought it may well be this man got quite upset by being isolated for 15 or 20 minutes, I can't really tell, but what do you do?"
1988.87-6325,1,21740,donald_j_zelenka,,2246.885,2250.471,I think the test would be to review the record as a whole overall.
1988.87-6325,2,44668,w_gaston_fairey,,2548.446,2549.181,"Thank you, Your Honor."
