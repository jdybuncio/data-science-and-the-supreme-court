1974.73-1697,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.312,"We’ll arguments next in 73-1697, Standard Pressed Steel against State of Washington."
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,56.356,59.928,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1697,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,465.129,470.427,"Mr. Cornell, incidentally, did either California or Pennsylvania tax these gross receipts?"
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,470.427,474.947,No they did not.
1974.73-1697,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,493.36,498.265,"What is it, based on the tax on the gross receipts of your client from its sales to Boeing?"
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,498.265,505.287,Yes and other Washington customers although we are contacted solely with Boeing.
1974.73-1697,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,505.287,510.362,You’re not urging an apportionment here if you should lose on the basic issue?
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,510.362,511.513,"Oh, yes, I am."
1974.73-1697,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,559.06,565.109,Do you know of any fair way to apportion here if we get to that?
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,565.109,570.285,That’s a difficult question.
1974.73-1697,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,614.457,631.633,But isn’t that when you’re talking about you’re starting to tax the gross income and then you have to divide it up by these percentages rather than just the gross receipts of sales which concededly occur in the state?
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,631.633,633.193,I don’t believe I follow your question.
1974.73-1697,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,633.193,644.527,"Well, you were citing some cases where you say that you have to show what percentage is the payroll in the taxing jurisdiction is to the payroll elsewhere, and that sort of thing."
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,660.785,689.962,"Yes, I think that’s correct, I believe in the General Motors District of Columbia case, however, that all of the income they’re being taxed was resulted from sales to individuals within the District of Columbia and the Court urged apportionment in that case as well and that was the basis of the Court’s decision striking down the tax."
1974.73-1697,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,731.896,734.789,"This employee worked out of his own home, did he?"
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,734.789,737.558,"Yes, he did a portion of one room."
1974.73-1697,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,737.558,738.905,Was he full time?
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,738.905,740.314,"Yes, he was full time."
1974.73-1697,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,740.314,746.493,He just used a portion of one room in his house to perform this full-time work for it?
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,746.493,747.279,Yes.
1974.73-1697,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,747.279,755.499,And which you say was engineering work although the fact is his degree was in animal husbandry.
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,759.93,770.198,I believe if I recall the facts correctly that there was an answering service for -- the Standard Pressed Steel telephone number was listed in the telephone book.
1974.73-1697,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,770.198,772.801,"And was that -- what number was that, was it this man’s home?"
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,772.801,777.038,"No, it was an answering service and the answering service would contact this man."
1974.73-1697,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,780.369,784.616,Did he have any secretarial help or any --
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,784.616,786.487,"Not in the State of Washington, no."
1974.73-1697,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,786.487,789.522,What did he do when he wanted to communicate with?
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,789.522,797.5,He would either -- many of the exhibits are handwritten and at least my copies are somewhat illegible.
1974.73-1697,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,809.04,817.397,"You referred to General Motors against District of Columbia at one point, what’s the citation in that case?"
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,818.928,820.645,It’s not cited in the briefs.
1974.73-1697,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,820.645,822.408,Where I wrote opinion and I can’t --
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,822.408,824.738,It’s 380 U.S.
1974.73-1697,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,824.738,825.06,Well don’t assume --
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,825.06,826.834,It’s 380 U.S.
1974.73-1697,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,826.834,827.846,380?
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,827.846,828.31,Yes.
1974.73-1697,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,828.31,828.69,That would about right.
1974.73-1697,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,828.69,830.875,Don’t stop your argument now for it.
1974.73-1697,0,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,836.668,843.399,I believe also that the nature of the activities conducted by appellant in Washington have to be considered.
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1675.238,1678.786,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1697,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1918.605,1928.034,Does the record show what percentage of Standard’s gross income was derived from its sales to Boeing?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1928.034,1929.042,Of its total --
1974.73-1697,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1929.042,1930.006,Total gross income.
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,1930.006,1932.451,"Gross income, no, the record makes no such showing."
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2223.546,2236.373,"Well on that basis, if Washington could charge a gross receipts tax on any sales made to local residents whether there are any employees of the seller in the state or not?"
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2236.373,2238.523,"From the point of view of the Commerce Clause, Mr. Justice White --"
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.523,2239.699,"Well, isn’t that right?"
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2242.675,2245.762,The argument would be just as good from a conceptual point of view.
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2245.762,2246.071,Or just it would not?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2246.071,2252.289,It would not from a point of view of the history of your decisions as they relate to due process.
1974.73-1697,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2269.201,2272.255,"How about the National Bellas Hess case, --"
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2272.255,2272.7,The National Bellas case --
1974.73-1697,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2272.7,2276.912,-- didn’t that involve both the commerce claim and the due process claim?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2276.912,2282.592,"Yes, in that case, there was however, no real jurisdiction."
1974.73-1697,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2285.461,2285.862,Yes.
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2285.862,2294.747,"It had no employee, it did nothing in the State of Illinois other than to send catalogues into the state and send by common carrier its goods into the state."
1974.73-1697,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2294.747,2297.425,But then didn’t it -- that was the due process claim?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2301.102,2304.29,There was a -- they made a commerce claim in it.
1974.73-1697,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2308.843,2310.529,"The Court did it reach it, didn’t it?"
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2310.529,2317.077,And the Court said under those circumstances that perhaps apportionment would solve the problem.
1974.73-1697,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2357.394,2360.764,"In National Bellas Hess, Illinois was the destination state?"
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2360.764,2363.654,Illinois was the destination state.
1974.73-1697,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2363.654,2366.793,And we held that Illinois did not have power to impose that tax?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2366.793,2375.138,"Yes, at least in part -- I think in controlling part because there was no presence whatsoever of National Bellas Hess --"
1974.73-1697,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2375.138,2376.625,But that was the due process part?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2376.625,2378.784,Yes.
1974.73-1697,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2378.784,2382.078,"The economic effect of this tax is the same as a use tax, isn’t it?"
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2382.078,2383.789,It’s identical to a use tax.
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2385.032,2392.106,The only thing is you’re not trying to collect it from the buyer?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2392.106,2392.819,We’re not trying to --
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.819,2396.014,You’re collecting it from a local citizen or--
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2396.014,2396.816,"Yes, though --"
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2396.816,2400.434,Using some property that was bought out -- bought somewhere else.
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2400.434,2412.37,"Though you have gone a long way in use taxes and permitting its collection from the seller, if he fails to make collection from the buyer and to forward it to the state."
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2424.575,2431.752,And you ultimately -- and its ultimate burden if the seller doesn’t pay is on the buyer?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2431.752,2437.221,That’s right but both taxes go into the cost of the goods sold.
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.642,2449.759,It doesn’t literally purport to be on an interstate sale?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2449.759,2452.839,"No, it purports to the --"
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2452.839,2456.54,This purports to be specifically on interstate sale?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2456.54,2463.16,"No, this purports to be on the privilege or act of wholesaling in the State of Washington."
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2466.964,2469.624,It’s measured by the gross receipts --
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2469.624,2478.904,It’s measured by the gross receipts of the transaction as exactly and precisely as the sales tax is.
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2478.904,2482.918,Isn’t this concededly an interstate -- aren’t these sales concededly interstate sales?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2482.918,2484.219,"Of course, they’re interstate sales."
1974.73-1697,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2484.996,2492.713,So my brother White was quite correct isn’t he in saying that the tax is imposed directly upon interstate activity?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2492.713,2493.556,The taxes --
1974.73-1697,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2493.556,2494.749,I don’t want you to lose your case --
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2494.749,2499.012,That depends on your technical definition of the incidents.
1974.73-1697,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2505.988,2509.954,It is a tax on his sales in the interstate commerce?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2509.954,2511.198,It is Mr. Justice Stewart.
1974.73-1697,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2511.198,2519.366,"Virtually every time this question comes up, it’s on something involving interstate transportation --"
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2519.366,2523.165,It will not come up unless it is Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.73-1697,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2680.385,2691.458,"Well, then your answer to the commerce aspect of the thing as opposed to the due process aspect is not apportionment but to limit the levy to the state of destination."
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2691.458,2695.453,Precisely Mr. Justice Rehnquist and I don’t think I’m making a new proposal.
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2859.02,2860.439,Do you have a net income tax rate?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2860.439,2864.228,We do not have a net income tax.
1974.73-1697,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2929.878,2942.81,We’ll resume there at 1 o’clock.[Lunch Recess]
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,2946.54,2950.782,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3167.131,3181.828,But the McGoldrick case was long before Norton and Norton specifically cited McGoldrick as being quite distinguishable and I’m not sure McGoldrick is much help to you?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,3181.828,3188.984,"McGoldrick is of help to us, the particular McGoldrick case, there were more than one."
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.14,3193.971,"I’m talking about the one of 309 U.S., are you?"
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,3193.971,3194.69,Yes.
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3197.054,3201.784,The one that Norton cited?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,3208.195,3227.148,"No, the Norton -- the cite in Norton is McGoldrick versus Berwind-White Coal Company which also involved a sales tax in which the presence in the state consisted of a in-state office, delivery in-state actually by a carrier which was owned by the out-of-state seller."
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3227.148,3231.382,"Yes, but it distinguish the sales tax situation, generally?"
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,3231.382,3233.972,It did distinguish the sales tax situation.
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3233.972,3243.545,"And that the Norton tax was on the seller, that’s what point it made."
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,3243.545,3266.534,"It did distinguish it on the ground that the sales tax is collected -- excuse me, that the sales tax has collected from the seller. Gross receipt tax at least in theory is collected from the -- excuse me, a gross receipts tax is collected from the seller, a sales tax is collected from the purchaser but that is a theoretical and technical difference which has nothing to do."
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3266.534,3271.275,So you are -- you do think that we must then disavow Norton?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,3271.275,3273.059,"Oh, no."
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3273.059,3273.947,To that extent?
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,3273.947,3275.933,We fall directly within Norton.
1974.73-1697,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3325.267,3340.24,"Justice Goldberg cited in Norton as dictating a different result, the Court arrived at in Norton, Norton said not so in those cases in the McGoldrick type case is not controlling here. Now you can call that dictum if you want to."
1974.73-1697,1,41407,slade_gorton,,3340.24,3349.404,"In any event, our case can be solidly based on either McGoldrick or on the actual findings in Norton."
1974.73-1697,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3526.613,3529.147,"Thank you, Mr. Attorney General."
1974.73-1697,2,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,3531.121,3534.011,Thank you.
1974.73-1697,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3571.068,3575.824,You lost me there a little bit with the multiple taxation.
1974.73-1697,2,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,3575.824,3594.096,"Well, the Attorney General’s position is that to avoid the risk of multiple taxation in case of such as this where you have activities occurring in two states from which the gross receipts are derived, that the easy solution is to give the destination state the ability to tax and deny the market state --"
1974.73-1697,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3594.096,3599.935,"you don’t claim that there’s a tax in any other state on this same transaction, do you?"
1974.73-1697,2,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,3599.935,3600.942,"No, I do not."
1974.73-1697,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3609.476,3613.486,In addition to the one imposed now by Washington?
1974.73-1697,2,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,3613.486,3614.452,Yes.

1974.73-1697,2,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,3617.827,3619.469,"No, I do not."

1974.73-1697,2,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,3657.864,3658.823,"Well, --"
1974.73-1697,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3658.823,3673.762,-- excise taxes or other taxes but they couldn’t tax as such and exclusively could they the gross receipts of wholesale sales made by Standard Process Steel Company in the State of Washington?

1974.73-1697,2,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,3733.694,3734.311,No.
1974.73-1697,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3734.311,3741.218,"Well, in know but would you object to this particular --"
1974.73-1697,2,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,3741.218,3743.214,That would be a much different case.
1974.73-1697,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3745.704,3749.631,"Well, but I know but your apportionment argument ought to be much the same."
1974.73-1697,2,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,3749.631,3751.436,The apportionment argument would be much the same.
1974.73-1697,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3751.436,3754.248,You would be able to make it would you?

1974.73-1697,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3811.18,3813.248,So what do you think in this case?
1974.73-1697,2,33787,kenneth_l_cornell,,3813.248,3823.187,"I think since the use takes place in the State of Washington, the State of Washington could impose a use tax."
