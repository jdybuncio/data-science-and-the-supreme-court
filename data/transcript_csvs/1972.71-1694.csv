1972.71-1694,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,256.914,259.87,"Did they indicate a general tendency, do you think?"
1972.71-1694,0,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,259.87,273.533,"I think that earning level, not necessary even a general tendency I would think that you could say that in the whole population that it does indicate a tendency that men earn more than women, and we don’t dispute that."
1972.71-1694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,389.572,391.536,This is a median income of Armed Forces males and --
1972.71-1694,0,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,391.536,394.279,"Of Armed Forces males, yes, sir."
1972.71-1694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,394.279,400.306,The reason is there is a higher percentage of non-commissioned and commissioned officers among the female?
1972.71-1694,0,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,400.306,401.413,I don’t --
1972.71-1694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,401.413,403.385,"Well, that would have to be the reason, wouldn’t it?"
1972.71-1694,0,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,403.385,405.511,It very well could be.
1972.71-1694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,405.511,412.497,"And we’re dealing here with military personnel whose spouses are civilians, are we not?"

1972.71-1694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,414.151,414.154,Are we not?
1972.71-1694,0,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,414.154,417.609,-- let's assume that the Government is correct in what they say that we should not have used this case.
1972.71-1694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,417.609,425.241,Does these case involved only military personnel whose spouses are civilians?
1972.71-1694,0,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,425.241,425.507,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,426.33,426.747,That’s right.
1972.71-1694,0,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,426.747,428.181,That’s correct.
1972.71-1694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,542.759,545.583,What are we talking about the terms of numbers?
1972.71-1694,0,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,554.318,557.598,I don’t have access to these percentages.
1972.71-1694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,578.207,583.232,So would this percentage of -- somewhat comparable to that I mentioned?
1972.71-1694,0,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,583.232,584.138,They very well could be.
1972.71-1694,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,587.055,596.922,"Because I understood that the good part of the Government’s argument is based upon administrative simplicity, is it not?"
1972.71-1694,0,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,596.922,604.068,"Mr. Justice, the only part of the Government’s argument, their entire argument is based upon administrative convenience."
1972.71-1694,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,761.146,767.352,"Well, Mr. Levin, you say that it’s a personal right you claim here, following the analysis in Weber."
1972.71-1694,0,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,770.84,772.155,It’s a personal right.
1972.71-1694,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,780.455,785.712,"Well, but you can argue any equal protection that way."
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,1703.336,1707.464,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1823.284,1831.021,Does this housing allowance run right through all of the commissioned and non-commissioned ranks?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,1831.021,1832.217,"Yes, it applies to everyone."
1972.71-1694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1832.217,1833.253,"There is an amount, I know, but --?"
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,1833.253,1833.955,There is an amount.
1972.71-1694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1835.646,1836.273,Thank you.

1972.71-1694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1838.754,1842.343,Except those for whom housing is provided by the Government?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,1842.343,1843.062,"Yes, right."
1972.71-1694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1843.679,1846.387,"For the person and his family, and his or her family?"
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,1846.387,1848.709,Right.
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.537,1859.402,"Well, as you put it, the discrimination is against the men, is that it?"
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,1859.402,1861.02,"Well, I didn’t mean to imply that."

1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1953.21,1953.755,Is that right?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,1953.755,1956.14,"One way, yes."
1972.71-1694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2143.833,2144.309,We’re talking --
1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2144.309,2149.084,"On your rational relationship, are you going to square this with Reed against Reed as some?"
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2149.084,2154.283,"Yes, we think Reed against Reed is distinguishable."
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.082,2205.264,You mean like a 90% or what ir do you know it?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2205.264,2214.669,"Well, I think the figure in their brief was that 43% of women are in the labor force and 18% work full time."
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.669,2216.466,18%.
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2216.466,2224.929,That’s at page 45 of the ACLU brief.

1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2337.587,2340.118,They fill out a form listing their expenses.
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2340.118,2341.66,"That will be the end of it, isn't it?"
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2341.66,2342.451,I beg your pardon?
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.451,2343.243,"That’s the end of it, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2343.243,2345.354,"That, I believe that probably is."
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.354,2350.686,What is the -- is that the large administrative burden you’re talking about?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2350.686,2358.379,"Well, for a million and a half men to have to examine a million and a half forms, I submit would be an administrative burden to --"
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2358.379,2363.131,"But I mean, I agree it’s a burden but I’m just trying to find out how much of the burden it is."
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2364.294,2364.486,Well --
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2364.486,2368.128,"-- making an affidavit, and then somebody will have to read them, I suppose."

1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.221,2401.734,But wouldn’t it be the other -- how about – how about letting the women claim -- you could treat women the same as men the other way I suppose.
1972.71-1694,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2401.734,2402.698,[Voice Overlap] of all administration.
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2402.698,2405.391,You mean deny them benefits altogether?
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.834,2408.491,"Well, treat them like --"
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2408.491,2413.753,"Or treat them the way the men; well, certainly Congress could do that --"
1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2413.753,2414.836,That is the whole argument?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2414.836,2424.092,-- and the proposal before Congress in the last Congress and it probably be resubmitted at this time is to amend the statute to treat women exactly the same way.
1972.71-1694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2424.902,2429.557,Would that include a requirement to show a dependency?

1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2479.481,2480.984,You mean consistent for 40 years?
1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2481.855,2483.978,"Of course, they vary every year."
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2483.978,2488.692,Well the statistics I gave were for the current year or in the last couple of years.
1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2488.692,2490.935,And that would not what the statute was based on?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2490.935,2495.479,The statute was based on the situation 20 years ago and as --
1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2495.479,2501.757,Is there any evidence in the legislative history that they consider those factors?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2501.757,2503.199,"No, there is not."
1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2506.262,2507.307,Women are women and men are men.
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2507.307,2513.075,The statute was designed to give dependent -- to give benefits for dependence.
1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2513.548,2520.659,Do I understand the legislative history other than there should be a distinction made between men and women in the Armed Services?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2527.06,2528.052,"Well, it’s not even that."
1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2572.948,2581.991,We base it on the whole general class of women and the whole general class of men.
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2581.991,2583.441,"Right, but we submit that there is a --"
1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2583.441,2585.299,And that’s a rational basis.
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2585.299,2586.241,We submit it’s a rational basis.
1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2586.241,2587.942,That’s a rational basis.
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2587.942,2588.59,Yes.
1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2588.59,2589.88,It is!
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2589.88,2595.549,We submit it is a rational basis because there’s statistical differences between the two classes which justify --
1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2595.549,2598.312,What’s the good difference is that Congress consider.
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2600.798,2605.125,I said the legislative history doesn’t indicate that they – they -- they looked at it.
1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2641.299,2649.255,Women are women and men are men and you can draw that difference and that difference only in based money on.
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,2649.255,2656.05,"Well, I would submit simply that there are statistical differences here which do justify the different treatment."
1972.71-1694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3217.606,3227.067,"But when you talk about generality of women as being less likely to have dependents, you mean dependents in this narrow sense, financially?"
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3227.067,3231.464,"Dependence as defined -- yes, dependence --"
1972.71-1694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3231.464,3233.65,In terms of children?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3233.65,3241.555,"No, in terms of dependent spouses, that’s what I mean."
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3280.466,3288.23,"Could I ask you -- if we agreed with the other side, what do you understand the consequence would be?"
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3288.23,3291.914,I understand the consequence would be that you would extend the same benefits to women.
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3292.725,3294.881,What would we strike down?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3294.881,3304.545,You would strike down the portion of the statute which says that women have to establish dependency in fact in order to claim their wife as a --
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3304.545,3313.065,Or we strike that provision down which provides for their allowance then how do they get the allowance?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3313.065,3313.984,"No, you wouldn’t strike."
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.348,3328.468,"Well, if you just strike down the discrimination, the other way of doing it would be to say that the -- is that the male must prove --"
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3328.468,3332.942,"The males must -- well, I would think that would definitely not be the preferable alternative."

1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3336.35,3352.399,"Well, I think the -- I think the inquiry here would be what Congress would have wished had it been faced with the situation of not being able to make this classification and I think that the conclusion would have to be that they would wish that the --"
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3352.399,3360.087,"Could we just strike down that particular part of the statute of the provision, just those particular words?"
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3360.087,3360.647,That’s right.
1972.71-1694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3361.036,3369.265,And then we construe all the other relevant statutes to mean and then women wherever it says men or --
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3369.265,3371.382,"Well, just in this narrow context."
1972.71-1694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3371.382,3373.5,I am talking about in these statutes.
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3373.5,3377.803,In Section -- in 43 -- 37 U.S.C. 401.
1972.71-1694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3377.803,3382.188,"So, we strike down one statute and rework some others?"
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3382.503,3395.013,"Well, no, just within the definition part itself would be the only -- if you simply said that the same standard have to apply to women as applies to men."
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3395.013,3396.549,"Well, a --"
1972.71-1694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3396.549,3406.618,"Well, couldn’t we just as easily, why couldn’t we just as easily say that since the allowances if that were the conclusion are discriminatory, all allowances are stricken?"
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3406.618,3413.743,"Well, I think that would fly right in the face of the purpose of Congress in adopting the dependency benefits statutes to be --"
1972.71-1694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3413.743,3417.878,Any more so than except as to numbers?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3417.878,3426.349,"Oh, yes, but well I think the numbers [Attempt to Laughter] are quite relevant when you’re talking about a million and a half men and only a couple of a thousand women married to civilians."
1972.71-1694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3426.349,3428.498,You don’t want us to strike the allowances for men?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3428.498,3438.131,"No, we don’t want you to strike that and we don’t want you to require that the men’s applications for dependency allowances be examined in each case."
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.131,3449.449,"Well, in fact in 401 the definition says that a dependent is a -- of a member of the service is one, his spouse; two, is unmarried minor child."
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3449.449,3450.519,"Well, if you just struck the --"
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3450.519,3458.025,"And then down below it says however, the first is not a dependent of a female member unless he is in fact dependent on her for over half his support."
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3459.372,3460.545,That sentence.
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3460.545,3461.706,That sentence.
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3472.08,3474.223,"Well, I think “his” means her in this context."
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3477.72,3482.241,"Obviously, I mean if the Constitution discriminated what, is that it?"
1972.71-1694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3482.241,3483.217,Right.
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3483.217,3486.036,"Well, if the statute has always been construed to --"
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3486.036,3487.792,"Well, it doesn’t, is it so?"
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3490.984,3494.786,"Well, I mean take the next one, his unmarried legitimate child."
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3494.786,3499.316,"Well, so we do have to change the meaning of “his” in one, don’t we?"
1972.71-1694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3499.316,3500.925,We have to make it really his or hers?
1972.71-1694,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3500.925,3502.086,We have to make it his or hers?
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3502.086,3503.257,Then why do a complete job.
1972.71-1694,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3510.021,3517.355,"Well, should we assume that petitioners cases in this case are not in favor of cutting out all of the allowances that the wife gets."
1972.71-1694,1,41452,samuel_huntington,,3517.355,3521.83,"Well, you could certainly assume that and we’re not suggesting that you do that."
1972.71-1694,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3522.964,3534.292,"You have three minutes left, Mr. Levin if you wish to use it."
1972.71-1694,2,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,3534.292,3540.136,I would do answer Mr. Justice White about which provision of the statute should be struck.
1972.71-1694,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3540.136,3541.85,Rewritten?
1972.71-1694,2,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,3541.85,3547.275,"First of all, I think you don’t get into any trouble by striking that portion that begins however and in support."
1972.71-1694,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3547.275,3548.506,Why not?
1972.71-1694,2,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,3548.506,3551.335,Because I don’t believe that “his” means his in the masculine --
1972.71-1694,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3551.335,3554.066,It means not -- now doesn’t it?
1972.71-1694,2,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,3554.066,3554.662,"No, sir."
1972.71-1694,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3565.687,3567.144,What page of what document?
1972.71-1694,2,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,3567.144,3570.283,I am looking at page 23 (a) of the appendix.
1972.71-1694,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3570.283,3570.871,Of the appendix?
1972.71-1694,2,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,3570.871,3572.125,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1694,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3573.08,3574.435,Hmm.
1972.71-1694,2,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,3574.435,3577.856,But I certainly wouldn’t construe “his” in the masculine or feminine sense.
1972.71-1694,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3577.856,3579.518,Or we need to strike that one sentence?
1972.71-1694,2,31434,joseph_j_levin_jr,,3580.81,3584.426,"I believe that that would extend the benefits to all, yes sir."
1972.71-1694,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3751.129,3751.613,Thank you.
