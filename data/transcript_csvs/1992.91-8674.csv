1992.91-8674,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.19,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-8674, John Angus Smith v. the United States."
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,49.484,55.829,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-8674,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.999,121.83,I guess he could have been charged with carrying it.
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,121.83,123.252,"--That is correct, Justice."
1992.91-8674,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,141.515,148.637,"If you had been charged with carrying, I don't suppose... and you had been... your client had been convicted, I don't suppose you would be here."
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,148.637,151.449,"That is probably correct, Justice."
1992.91-8674,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,151.449,157.103,"You wouldn't have much of a case about coverage, would you?"
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,157.103,166.349,"That is probably true, but the Government did choose to and elected to charge him with use, and that is the reason why we're here today and what he is charged with."
1992.91-8674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,166.349,172.104,You wouldn't argue that use or carry means carry for the purpose of using?
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,172.104,172.875,Well--
1992.91-8674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,172.875,173.706,Really?
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,174.657,175.506,--Justice Scalia--
1992.91-8674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.506,176.387,"Well, that's all right."
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,176.387,177.519,"--I'm prepared to argue that, and--"
1992.91-8674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,177.519,178.126,"Yes, I think you would."
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,178.126,192.897,"--Because what I want to say here is that if we accept the Government's suggestion of the definition of use, this all-encompassing definition, or the lower courts', then the word use would always swallow up and encompass the word carry."
1992.91-8674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,213.56,215.653,"Anything you're carrying, you're using?"
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,216.383,227.6,"Under their definition, it's to possess with the intent to facilitate the crime, to possess and the presumption of intention."
1992.91-8674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,269.686,274.871,"I mean, we really haven't accomplished a whole lot if carry means what you say it means."
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,381.222,382.22,It means actual use.
1992.91-8674,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,382.22,385.833,"Okay, but to say use means actual use doesn't help at all."
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,385.833,386.995,Okay.
1992.91-8674,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,397.25,404.606,"Well, then you're saying that... you're really putting quite a narrow construction on the phrase."
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,416.933,426.129,"Well, also but it's an offensive weapon to protect themselves or... as a weapon in the normal connotation of the way the item is used."
1992.91-8674,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,466.817,472.991,You could say the carpenter used the hammer to obtain what he traded it for.
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,472.991,476.352,"--Yes, but I don't think that's the normal connotation of the word use."
1992.91-8674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,728.598,737.584,Section 924(g) prohibits the transfer of a firearm that's going to be used in drug transfer... in drug trafficking.
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,752.763,761.691,"To be quite truthful, Justice, I have not explored the... those aspects of section (g)."
1992.91-8674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,761.691,774.177,"Well, your word... definition of the word use is such that it has to be somehow used in order to protect the person and not for a trade."
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,790.31,794.35,I don't know the exact wording of section (g)--
1992.91-8674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,794.35,800.645,"It says whoever knowingly transfers a firearm, knowing that such firearm will be used to commit a crime of drug trafficking."
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,800.645,807.651,"--Well, I think that the issue there is transfer, and the later aspect is used--"
1992.91-8674,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,807.651,808.342,No.
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,826.914,833.807,"--That is correct, but it could be the person could possibly charge with carrying the firearm under the other prong of the statute."
1992.91-8674,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,833.807,839.673,"Well, doesn't the word carrying carry... strike that."
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,855.862,869.572,"Well, I think that one of the courts have held that carrying is a very narrow... the lower courts have held that carry is a very narrow definition and use has a very... has lost its active connotation."
1992.91-8674,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,877.327,888.293,"But doesn't it also, for purposes of this statute in your judgment at least, require a... an offensive or protective purpose when it is carried--"
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,888.293,891.866,Not under the definition that I've suggested.
1992.91-8674,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,891.866,897.74,"--Well, how about the definition that you would like us to assume in deciding this case?"
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,902.632,905.324,"I think generally yes, Justice."
1992.91-8674,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,910.877,920.274,Should we construe the statute to import that requirement of an offensive or protective purpose when we use... when the statute uses the word carry?
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,920.274,926.301,I don't think that is necessary in regard to reaching the decision in regards... in this case.
1992.91-8674,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,926.301,933.354,"Well, if we don't do that, didn't your client carry the weapon in relation to the barter that he later engaged in?"
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,939.207,941.22,"No, Justice, because--"
1992.91-8674,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,941.22,941.591,"Oh, he was discharged."
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,942.082,943.01,--He was discharged under the use prong.
1992.91-8674,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,943.01,947.564,But you would lose if he had been charged with carry if you adopt the broad definition that you're considering.
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,947.564,963.242,"I think that was the same question Justice White asked earlier which I agreed with, but for whatever reasons, in three superseding indictments the Government chose to only charge John Angus Smith with the use of the firearm during and in relation to the Federal drug trafficking crime."
1992.91-8674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.242,992.933,"Mr. Kollin, surely a court that's going to use language reasonably enough so that it interprets using a gun to mean what you say it means, using it in a crime, would also not be so unreasonable as to interpret the phrase carry a gun to mean a longshoreman who's... who has on his shoulder a crate full of weapons that he's taking off the ship."
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,997.678,1002.499,"I agree, Justice, that that requires that reasonableness."
1992.91-8674,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1016.919,1026.255,"You can say in some sense, of course, that the longshoreman carrying this crate is carrying a gun, but that's not what you mean when you say are you carrying a gun."
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,1048.718,1049.389,"That's true, Justice."
1992.91-8674,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.389,1054.583,I was just curious about your legislative history point.
1992.91-8674,0,25597,gary_kollin,,1075.066,1076.909,"Well, if there is an ambiguity--"
1992.91-8674,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1658.489,1665.324,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-8674,2,25597,gary_kollin,,2718.856,2749.414,"As express words are placed in statutes and have to be read in their context, like use or carry, involved in, or used in, and not to make other words superfluous, in these cases with use or carry or involved in or used in, they are not mere iterations of spanning out of different methods of commission of the crimes, and we look at them in the normal parlance."
1992.91-8674,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2840.535,2843.347,"Okay, Mr. Kollin."
