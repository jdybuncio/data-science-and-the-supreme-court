1996.96-320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We'll hear argument next in No. 96-320, Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company v. Michael Buckley."
1996.96-320,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,17.093,20.663,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1996.96-320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,65.524,77.082,"Ms. Birnbaum, may I ask you if you would clarify your position in this case with the one that the... that is being taken by the defendants in the case this afternoon?"
1996.96-320,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,104.066,104.818,What--
1996.96-320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,104.818,106.384,We can't both be right.
1996.96-320,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,106.384,111.072,"--Well, I'm not going to argue the Georgene case on the standing issue."
1996.96-320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,149.78,157.117,The courts below relied on the physical impact of the fibers going inside his lungs.
1996.96-320,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,157.117,164.79,"--But, first, there is no real evidence of that except a hypothetical given by the expert below."
1996.96-320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.03,184.517,"Well, how do we deal with a physical impact, does that constitute an injury, even if it's slight?"
1996.96-320,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,184.517,185.119,No.
1996.96-320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,228.296,244.825,"But aren't there many jurisdictions that have recognized a claim for medical monitoring, a common law claim for medical monitoring, for people who have been massively exposed but have not yet manifested any illness?"
1996.96-320,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,245.342,246.944,There are... there are a few.
1996.96-320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,247.444,249.094,"--How many, roughly, would you say?"
1996.96-320,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,250.646,252.512,"--A little less, but there are some."
1996.96-320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,277.143,278.76,"Yes, but may I interrupt with just a question?"
1996.96-320,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,296.389,296.874,--No.
1996.96-320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,297.707,300.676,Even though he'd have to pay his doctor's bill every 6 months?
1996.96-320,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,300.676,302.861,"That would be a damage, but it wouldn't be an injury."
1996.96-320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,302.861,304.961,But not within the meaning of the statute?
1996.96-320,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,304.961,305.478,Right.
1996.96-320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,305.478,313.983,"But as a matter of ordinary reasoning, would not that be a pecuniary injury that one could at least say gave... gave rise to some kind of claim?"
1996.96-320,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,313.983,316.518,I think it's just much more complicated than that--
1996.96-320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,316.518,319.037,"Well, it's more complicated because there are 21 million people out there."
1996.96-320,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,319.837,320.154,--Twenty-one million--
1996.96-320,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,320.154,322.522,But if you look at just the one is what I'm trying to think of.
1996.96-320,0,41083,sheila_l_birnbaum,,322.522,325.041,"--But the problem is, if you had 21 million just asbestos-exposed people--"
1996.96-320,1,18974,charles_c_goetsch,,1704.694,1708.295,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-320,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1752.422,1754.64,"Well, how... let's talk about your first point for a minute."
1996.96-320,1,18974,charles_c_goetsch,,1764.213,1764.713,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1996.96-320,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1770.533,1771.802,"But the first, obviously, doesn't?"
1996.96-320,1,18974,charles_c_goetsch,,1771.802,1773.002,"Exactly, yes."
1996.96-320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.884,1798.452,Why a grave toxic disease?
1996.96-320,1,18974,charles_c_goetsch,,1799.119,1799.536,Well--
1996.96-320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1799.536,1804.19,"--there are all sorts of risks that we go through in life, and you pay for them out of your own pocket."
1996.96-320,1,18974,charles_c_goetsch,,1805.406,1805.99,--Right.
1996.96-320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1806.458,1807.508,--is not a bed of roses.
1996.96-320,1,18974,charles_c_goetsch,,1825.719,1826.269,--That's right.
1996.96-320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.269,1829.321,"This person is coughing, presumably because he has a cold."
1996.96-320,1,18974,charles_c_goetsch,,1829.321,1829.84,Right.
1996.96-320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1829.84,1831.507,And I'm very careful about such things.
1996.96-320,1,18974,charles_c_goetsch,,1838.613,1839.479,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
