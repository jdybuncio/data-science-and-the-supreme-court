1996.95-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.168,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-1065, Paul Schenck and Dwight Saunders v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,11.63,14.211,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.95-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,59.542,60.113,Mr. Sekulow--
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,60.113,60.702,"--Yes, Justice--"
1996.95-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,60.702,62.655,--I think we can hear you quite well if you were to lower your voice a little.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,62.655,63.793,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,100.559,107.752,You'd be content if we modified that so only verbal indications would suffice?
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,107.752,109.755,"--No, Justice Scalia, we would not."
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,113.586,115.83,"And that's not really what you're after here, is it?"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,115.83,116.867,--That is not.
1996.95-1065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,139.765,140.395,How does it stop?
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,143.258,143.859,Yes.
1996.95-1065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,143.859,147.361,Even without this microphone I think I can hear you perfectly well.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,147.361,149.111,The Chief Justice certainly said that.
1996.95-1065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,149.111,149.532,Yes.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,156.298,157.009,We're in the--
1996.95-1065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,157.009,160.458,"--and the judge's decree allows everybody to go 15 feet apart, doesn't it?"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,160.458,168.034,"--Justice Breyer, I think that in reality we're talking about, of course, in Buffalo city sidewalks and city streets, with sidewalk escorts trying to get people into the clinic."
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,202.075,202.646,Let me ask you--
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,202.646,203.057,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,203.057,204.339,--Would 5 feet be okay?
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,204.339,207.03,I don't think so in the particular situation here.
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,208.22,209.152,Two feet?
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,209.152,221.109,"--Two feet I think would approach what we would consider probably blocking, certainly crowding, and crowding is prohibited by section 1(c) of the injunction and we're not challenging that, but crowding in the sense that if I were blocking your access."
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.799,296.14,Yelling.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,303.523,306.014,"Oh, no, I don't think that is the prohibition that we're concerned with."
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.078,310.919,To be heard inside.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,310.919,311.578,--Yes.
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.578,315.852,But you wouldn't say that this injunction would be okay if it prevented the counselors from shouting at the--
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,315.852,316.372,No.
1996.95-1065,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,328.929,332.812,"--Well, are you challenging the fixed 15-foot limit?"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,332.812,334.742,We are challenging that as well.
1996.95-1065,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,348.153,354.006,"I'm not talking about the floating bubble, I'm talking about the fixed buffer zone provision."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,354.006,356.708,"The fixed buffer zone in and of itself, Justice O'Connor, we are challenging."
1996.95-1065,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,385.266,393.282,Is it your position that there was no post-TRO conduct that justified the 15-foot limit?
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,393.282,404.91,"That is our position, and I think the record in that sense shows it, because there would have been six contempts, or actually seven contempt actions brought in an almost 18-month period, three of them involving cease and desist... yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.95-1065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,404.91,441.844,"As I recall, Judge Meskill in the panel ruling did find that there had been violations after the issuance of the TRO, and if you would look at A-57 he refers to an incident on March 26, 1991, in which two men blocked the doorway to the clinic, and then another one on January 1, so Judge Meskill, whose position I think you are not challenging--"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,441.844,442.324,That's correct.
1996.95-1065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,442.324,450.208,--did find post-TRO conduct that violated the Court's order.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,450.208,456.632,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct, and we've acknowledged, and they're in the Joint Appendix, there are also contempt actions that have been filed."
1996.95-1065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,456.632,470.003,"But you did say in your reply brief that the district judge found no defendants physically blocked access after the issuance of the TRO, and as I read Judge Meskill's opinion that's not so."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,470.003,487.333,"What it's talking about there in the particular page A-57, the way we understand the evidence was submitted at trial and the way we've seen the case was, this was not a mass blockade, and what we were talking about in our reply brief, Justice Ginsburg, is, this is not a case involving mass blockades."
1996.95-1065,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,491.865,524.377,"But I wanted to inquire, what is the principle that limits the Court to the conduct post-TRO and pre-preliminary injunction, given the long history of discord, to use the mildest term, what is it that confines the district judge in thoughtfully drawing a preliminary injunction after trying to preserve the peace with a TRO, from crafting it in a sensible way in light of all of the past history?"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,527.589,534.504,--I think that the Court should only be looking at this particular injunction in light of the facts that the district court have.
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.733,567.547,"Was that 15-foot... not the floating zone, but the 15-foot absolute, that was in the TRO originally."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,568.705,569.767,"Actually, the--"
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.767,571.908,Wasn't that in the original TRO as well?
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,571.908,574.71,"--Justice Scalia, actually it was the floating zone was in the TRO."
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,574.71,575.501,Ah.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,575.501,587.979,"And the fixed zone came afterwards, and I think that points to the nature of what took place here, so we have these automatic floating zones, if you will, without geographic limitation, and then a 15-foot zone is imposed, and we would--"
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.979,609.772,"What Meskill says on A-57, after noting that there were these two violations after the TRO, he says, however, the Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence clearly requires more than two isolated incidents over the course of 1-1/2 years before a court may banish an entire protest demonstration from a given area, and that's your contention here."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,609.772,611.224,"--And that is our contention, and also--"
1996.95-1065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,611.224,625.463,"But Mr. Sekulow, I think you will agree that it is a standard in law regarding injunctions that if there is no incident following the TRO... the TRO is a very temporary thing."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,625.463,626.084,--Right.
1996.95-1065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,626.084,632.379,"And if there is no violation of it, that shows the injunction is working, not that it should be stopped."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,643.446,647.566,"But Justice Ginsburg, if it is working but infringes on free speech at the same time--"
1996.95-1065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,647.566,650.688,"Well, then... then there was something wrong with the TRO."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,650.688,652.15,"--Well, precisely."
1996.95-1065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,652.15,663.367,But the notion that I thought you were putting forward to us was that because there was compliance with the TRO there was no longer need for that restraint.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,663.367,677.036,"We have not challenged, nor are we here challenging the restrictions other than the two speech provisions, but the district court and the court of appeals acknowledge, and it's on A-8 of the petition appendix, that the demonstrations are mostly peaceful in nature."
1996.95-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,699.021,706.327,"We also said in Madsen, Mr. Sekulow, that some deference was due to the trial court's formulation of the thing."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,706.327,718.583,"Yes, and this Court, in looking at the... in giving some deference to the trial court struck down the no-approach zone in Madsen and also declared that a portion of the 36-foot zone burdened more speech than necessary."
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,740.709,742.279,May I ask on the floating zone--
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,742.279,742.759,--Yes.
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,742.759,751.075,"--is it your position that a floating zone, no matter how carefully tailored, could never be justified as a remedy for repetitive speech?"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,768.766,771.08,I think it would be prohibited by the First Amendment.
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.689,774.919,There's no... floating zone is per se bad?
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,774.919,780.443,"--There are times, Justice Stevens, where floating zones have been adopted in domestic violence situations where... of course, that's not involving speech."
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.443,780.784,No.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,781.294,783.525,Right.
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,783.525,790.942,"--about harassing only in the sense of one must listen to the same message over and over and over again, and you say you just have to... you have to swallow that."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,790.942,794.694,"Well, I think on a public sidewalk or a public street we're going to hear messages we may not like, we may disagree with, but it can--"
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,794.694,797.085,"Yes, but I'm talking about the same message over and over and over--"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,797.085,798.127,--By one person to the same person.
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,801.25,807.632,"--And then if one could do it, why is it different if, instead of one doing it 20 times, 20 different people do it in succession?"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,807.632,811.015,--I don't think that necessarily that would be inappropriate.
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,811.015,811.464,Oh.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,811.464,817.769,"In the context of robust debate on a public issue like this, there is going to be a variety of speech."
1996.95-1065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,856.354,864.159,"Is that the way you would distinguish, if you would distinguish this situation from the application of some of the new stalker laws?"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,864.159,866.96,--I think the stalker laws are different in that regard.
1996.95-1065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,866.96,867.781,Because?
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,867.781,871.843,"Because the persistence is not necessarily, Number 1, protected speech."
1996.95-1065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,872.935,878.247,"Well, let's assume that the stalker does have a message, and my guess is a lot of them do."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,878.247,881.28,And at some point that crosses the line from speech to harassment.
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,901.712,904.724,"This injunction doesn't prohibit following, does it?"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,904.724,905.145,--It does not.
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,905.145,906.106,It prohibits speaking.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,906.106,906.727,That's correct.
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,907.777,912.031,And you would feel differently about an injunction that prohibited following.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,912.031,913.761,It's a different scenario.
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,916.122,918.215,But I don't think this injunction prohibits the speech.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,921.468,924.978,"--No, I think not, Justice Stevens, with respect, for two reasons."
1996.95-1065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,965.326,981.196,"I still don't understand, what is the word, or the idea, or the expression that one could make if you're within a 15-foot radius that you couldn't communicate being the distance, a little bit less than the distance that we are now."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,993.363,995.566,"I think, Justice Breyer, all of the above."
1996.95-1065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1013.439,1019.561,"But then they can go up and do that, can't they, unless the person affirmatively says that they don't want that."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1019.561,1023.382,"Actually, there's no demonstration allowed within the 15-foot zones at all."
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1044.156,1048.901,Why couldn't the counselor show the person the Bible within the 15... if the person doesn't object.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1048.901,1050.13,"Well, the counselor could."
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1050.13,1050.661,Yes.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1050.661,1053.013,"Unless, of course, somebody in that group says, get away."
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1053.013,1054.873,You need more than two people to show the passage from the Bible?
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1054.873,1057.276,"Well, I don't think that's... I don't think that's what I'm saying, Justice Stevens."
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1062.438,1065.751,But you're saying that because it's small print you have to be close for the person to be able to read it.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1067.511,1068.253,I think it's more than print.
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1075.047,1082.691,"No, but you're responding to a question about what can't you do at 15 feet that you could do in less than 15 feet, and it seems to me your point is you've got something they couldn't read."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1082.691,1094.51,"--I have something they couldn't read, it's hard to shout over sidewalk counselors, the lower courts acknowledge that the sidewalk counselors, the escorts, rather, trying to get these women in the clinic create an increased atmosphere, it's noisy, and it's hard to communicate."
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1094.51,1103.926,"I understood from the record that the... whatever you call them, the antiabortion people had people called sidewalk counselors--"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1103.926,1105.215,"Sidewalk counselors, yes, Justice."
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1105.215,1107.989,--and the clinics had people who were meant to counter the sidewalk counselors.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1107.989,1108.518,Escorts.
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1108.518,1119.617,"Who would surround the person coming in and talk about everything and anything, make noise, which made it quite difficult to speak to that person from 15 feet."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1119.617,1131.844,"Precisely, and in that nature would also inform these women about their rights under the injunction, would encourage them to engage in a communication to stop the communication, they would surround them... this was not, as I said, courtroom decorum discussion."
1996.95-1065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1134.625,1135.887,"Mr. Sekulow, you had--"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1139.248,1140.41,I don't think so.
1996.95-1065,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1141.109,1144.111,So really you're not resting on the fact that they are escorts there.

1996.95-1065,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1189.141,1189.842,I'm sorry.

1996.95-1065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1208.396,1208.673,Mr. Sekulow--
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1208.673,1209.865,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.95-1065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1209.865,1223.874,"--Unlike a statute that's just regulating everybody, we do have an injunction that's supposed to be tailored to these circumstances, and you had no objection, I take it, to injunction against grabbing, pushing, shoving."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1223.874,1225.195,That is correct.
1996.95-1065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1225.195,1241.505,"The district court did make a finding that the sidewalk counselors often crowded around the patients, and mustn't there be some kind of keep-your-distance rule to prevent the pushing, shoving, grabbing that had gone on before?"

1996.95-1065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1260.628,1279.239,"No, but isn't the answer to that, Mr. Sekulow, that the closer they are, given the history, the more likely there are going to be incidents of pushing and shoving, and you can't as a practical matter, simply as a court, prosecute 100 contempts a day under these orders, so the idea, to have something... you're making a practicality argument."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1295.782,1296.623,--Justice Souter--
1996.95-1065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1296.623,1297.572,Isn't that the answer?
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1297.572,1299.454,--I don't think it is in this regard.
1996.95-1065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1307.949,1314.992,"No, but don't you agree that the probability of grabbing is going to be greater the closer people are in these situations?"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1320.337,1321.359,"--Well, they made that argument."
1996.95-1065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1322.08,1322.38,Isn't that point correct?

1996.95-1065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1324.881,1325.332,Yes.
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1325.332,1325.682,But I think--
1996.95-1065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1325.682,1327.223,"And that's... I mean, the point is correct."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1333.937,1335.309,--I think no.
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1341.821,1347.335,"Mr. Sekulow, can you enter the 15-foot zone, crowd, and even grab, so long as you don't try to talk?"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1347.335,1348.737,"--You know, that's interesting."

1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1356.972,1362.164,"--Well, you know, it says that no demonstrator shall physically abuse, grab, or touch, but I mean--"
1996.95-1065,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.164,1368.259,--But the 15-foot zone does not apply to someone who is not trying to communicate.

1996.95-1065,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1378.978,1380.297,"The two go together, don't they?"
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1380.297,1381.709,I think not in this context.
1996.95-1065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1401.682,1439.796,"Mr. Sekulow, what was... what is the meaning of something that the Government emphasizes in its brief, the provision that if the court concludes that some of the relief requested by the plaintiff should be granted, that the defendants will consent to the entry of an injunction against each and every one of them, and the Government tells us that the defendants thus stipulated below that any unlawful conduct found to have been performed by any of them could be attributed to all of them for purposes of the preliminary injunction."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1454.536,1463.993,"There was a concession, Justice Ginsburg, in the district court regarding the nature of the evidence, and it simplified in a pretty real way, and a not necessarily beneficial one, it simplified the evidence that was presented."
1996.95-1065,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1484.956,1492.04,"Did you ask to have that clarified, because wasn't there a point where the district judge said, gee, that's not what I meant."
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1492.04,1494.243,"--I found that... we found that fascinating, too."

1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1522.6,1523.201,"Yes, it was."
1996.95-1065,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1525.132,1526.274,You don't raise that point here?
1996.95-1065,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1526.274,1528.184,"Well, I think we're beyond that point."
1996.95-1065,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1536.479,1538.051,"Very well, Mr. Sekulow."

1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1597.891,1616.343,"--The preliminary injunction allows sidewalk counselors to come right up to people, which is far more accommodating of defendants' free speech rights than the buffer zone affirmed by this Court in Madsen and by the buffer zone around polling places affirmed by this Court in Burson v. Freeman."
1996.95-1065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1641.408,1645.371,Without any traffic and without any opposing escort.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1645.371,1647.772,--He refers to the hustle and bustle of streets.
1996.95-1065,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.659,1701.809,"Well, Ms. Finley, are you suggesting that there's some special rule for abortion clinics that wouldn't apply in other cases where people are being perhaps harassed or counseled or argued with?"
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1701.809,1703.361,"No, not at all, of course--"
1996.95-1065,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1703.361,1704.932,Certainly Madsen doesn't say that.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1704.932,1705.773,"--No, it does not."
1996.95-1065,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1705.773,1708.715,Then why do you keep stressing the quiet zone outside the abortion--
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1708.715,1721.951,"Because Madsen did recognize that the governmental interest ensuring... in ensuring safe conditions for health care is a compelling interest, and I think we must keep in mind that that interest is very present in this case."
1996.95-1065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1755.625,1766.19,--Did Madsen suggest that there has to be some underlying violation of statutory or common law to support a preliminary injunction burdening speech?
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1766.19,1773.907,"Well, of course, to get a preliminary injunction anyone has to show a likelihood of success on the merits of some valid cause of action."
1996.95-1065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1775.386,1777.159,"Okay, and what is it here that you rely on?"
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1777.159,1782.933,"--Our causes of action... well, the district court found that in addition to the Federal civil rights claim that the--"
1996.95-1065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1782.933,1789.688,I thought that claim under section 1985(3) was dismissed here.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1789.688,1807.628,"--Dismissed, and subsequently the complaint was amended and it was reasserted, but the district court also found that the State law causes of action for trespass, which under New York law broadly protects people's use and enjoyment of their property rights, and the causes of action under New York State law for harassing people for exercising their right--"
1996.95-1065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1807.628,1816.704,"Could there be trespass on a public street or sidewalk, or would that just apply to the property of the clinic?"
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1816.704,1823.128,"--In... under New York law, trespass is not simply the physical invasion of a line-demarcated private property."
1996.95-1065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1857.152,1865.547,Did Madsen state that the consent requirement alone invalidated the no-approach provision in that case?

1996.95-1065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1869.05,1871.461,So are you asking that we ignore that here?
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1871.461,1871.821,--No.
1996.95-1065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1909.805,1932.299,"But the reason... the reason we struck down the uninvited approach provision in Madsen is as follows, quoting from Boos v. Barry: As a general matter, we have indicated that in public debate our own citizens must tolerate insulting and even outrageous speech in order to provide adequate breathing space to the freedoms protected by the First Amendment."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1943.927,1947.771,"--Nobody under this injunction, Your Honor, is protected from any speech at all."

1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1963.702,1964.651,Yes.
1996.95-1065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.651,1965.953,--proximity... where is that?
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1965.953,1969.695,"Dr. Hoagland's testimony, which is extensively recounted--"
1996.95-1065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.695,1972.176,"He did studies on forced physical proximity, and it's--"
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1972.176,1989.858,"--Dr. Hoagland was certified as an expert in both behavioral medicine and social impact theory, and social impact theory is, in fact, the study of how invasions of personal space create physical stress reactions, and the adverse effect of such reactions on medical care."
1996.95-1065,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1993.511,1998.114,--So we have experts like that now in any case where we're talking about this sort of thing?
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,1998.114,2002.748,I... it may be advisable for people to put on medical testimony.
1996.95-1065,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2002.748,2006.081,"What was she a specialist in, social impact theory?"
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2006.081,2011.023,Behav... it's an established area of social science.
1996.95-1065,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2011.023,2012.114,Would you name it again?
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2012.114,2027.205,"It's called social impact theory, a scholar named Edward Hall developed it in the fifties, and there's been an extensive body of research in the fields of psychology, medicine, and anthropology that have further studied it."
1996.95-1065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2041.143,2053.531,But I thought we had to... the Court had to find some violation of statutory or common law to justify a preliminary injunction.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2053.531,2054.751,And it did.
1996.95-1065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2057.362,2061.527,So I don't know what this argument does to bolster that.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2066.128,2067.679,No.
1996.95-1065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2087.433,2093.507,But you say the preliminary injunction could be based solely on testimony of an expert--
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2093.507,2095.079,"Oh... oh, no... oh, I--"
1996.95-1065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2095.079,2095.92,--on this social theory?
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2095.92,2097.902,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, if you understood me to say that."
1996.95-1065,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2097.902,2098.322,I did.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2098.322,2099.862,Certainly I misspoke if I did.
1996.95-1065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2113.581,2120.785,"Do I understand, Ms. Finley, that that is still something that's open to inspection by the district judge?"
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2135.886,2140.139,"Absolutely yes, Your Honor, it is very much open to the district court."
1996.95-1065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2152.896,2161.522,"So the viability of this whole case under State law has yet to be fully tested in the district court, and it hasn't been touched by the court of appeals."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2161.522,2162.633,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1996.95-1065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2162.633,2170.548,But the district judge did make a preliminary finding that you had under New York law a probability of success on the merits.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2170.548,2172.711,"That is correct, Your Honor, yes."
1996.95-1065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.711,2186.719,"But even... regarding... you're not contending that the provisions of the injunction do not have to be designed to prevent a violation of the law, as opposed to prevent the kind of emotional upset that your expert testimony related to."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2192.593,2194.042,"Yes, of course."
1996.95-1065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.861,2205.382,I don't understand that.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2208.344,2209.193,--No.
1996.95-1065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2252.162,2260.267,I would say that persons who walk through a picket line in order to work despite a strike face extreme stress.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2271.593,2280.65,"In the labor context, many courts have established buffer zones to keep the picketers out of the face of people, particularly when they're picketing at hospitals."
1996.95-1065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2280.65,2285.125,"But this is an order to prevent violence, et cetera."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2285.125,2287.705,Violence and intimidation.
1996.95-1065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2287.705,2289.506,Those cases do not talk about stress to the individual.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2295.55,2318.514,"Well, I think that when people are going in for surgery, and there's medical evidence that to safely perform the surgery the stress needs to be reduced, not elevated, that is a governmental interest that is present in this context that is only present in labor contexts when people are picketing at hospitals or nursing homes, and--"
1996.95-1065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2318.514,2332.135,"And I submit to you that anybody who walks through a picket line at any facility in order to take a job during the pendency of a strike is subjected to great emotional stress, and our cases have never recognized that as a ground for injunction."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2332.135,2349.826,"--Well, Madsen recognized that the elevated medical risks are a governmental interest that needs to be weighed in assessing whether the restrictions on speech are no more burdensome than necessary to protect that governmental interest in ensuring safe conditions for health care."
1996.95-1065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2349.826,2356.819,But only in the context of keeping the noise down outside the hospital which could be heard inside.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2373.231,2377.834,"Well, I'm sure Your Honors know better what you did in Madsen than I do."
1996.95-1065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2377.834,2378.465,"Oh, I doubt it."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2379.526,2390.863,"That discussion was... yes, Your Honor, that discussion was linked to the noise provision, but the same interest pertains when people are having others screaming in their face."
1996.95-1065,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2390.863,2405.182,"Well, what about a situation such as Justice Kennedy posits, where you walk through a picket line to go to work, and you've got a very important assignment that day, and you feel you're subjected to a great deal of stress, you're not going to be able to do that work."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2409.824,2424.504,"Whether the protest conduct disrupts the safe and normal functioning of the place is a basic governmental interest that this Court has recognized many times in Grayned v. Rockford on, so I think yes, whether--"
1996.95-1065,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2424.504,2449.42,"Ms. Finley, why do you lay such stress on this point, when I thought the major reason for the injunction and for its provisions was that there was a history of grabbing, pushing, shoving, and the district judge thought that it was reasonable to have a keep-your-distance rule to make sure that the pushing, grabbing, and shoving didn't go on again?"
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2460.248,2475.196,"--No, I would agree, Your Honor, with your point that the defendant's persistent, proven conduct of crowding, grabbing, punching, sometimes knocking people down is what necessitates some kind of a clear zone in this case."
1996.95-1065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2477.299,2479.47,"It's not enough that the zone be reasonable, though."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2484.923,2485.374,--No.
1996.95-1065,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.905,2486.445,--such a zone.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2488.446,2496.75,"--That's right, and here the 15-feet, the length of a car, is necessary to ensure that a car can safely drive down the road."
1996.95-1065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2496.75,2498.292,"Well, it's 15 feet on all sides."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2498.292,2500.544,All sides of--
1996.95-1065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2500.544,2501.996,"Of the person, I take it, or the vehicle."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2501.996,2502.754,--Yes.
1996.95-1065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2504.735,2508.168,"All right, and so if you have two people, that amounts to a 60-foot exclusion zone, I take it."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2508.168,2509.2,No.
1996.95-1065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2511.671,2512.061,No.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2514.192,2517.624,--But at all points sidewalk counselors can always come right up.
1996.95-1065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2517.624,2519.996,I'm talking about the extent of the zone.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2524.9,2533.626,"I think I would say it could be 30 feet but not 60, 15 in this direction and 15... that's 30."
1996.95-1065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2533.626,2535.166,At the outer extremities it would be 60.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2538.028,2540.141,"It could possibly be, although--"
1996.95-1065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2540.141,2542.07,"Fifteen... well, it's not... it's mathematical."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2546.453,2550.326,--The reason I said possibly is there's no evidence in the record of that problem ever happening.
1996.95-1065,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2550.326,2553.037,Do we need evidence to add 15 X 4?
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2555.11,2557.492,"No, Your Honor, we don't need a mathematical expert."
1996.95-1065,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2559.603,2560.814,"Of course, we don't have to limit it to two."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2566.278,2582.951,"--I think you're alluding to the notion of the floating bubble, and I want to remind this Court that judges under a Federal statute, 18 U.S.C. 1507, have what amounts to a floating bubble around any building or residence you use or occupy."
1996.95-1065,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2584.71,2586.19,"Yes, but the building doesn't float."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2587.091,2604.773,"--But judges move from building to building, and it says building or residence used or occupied by judges, so you are protected from people demonstrating near your courthouse, your home, an office you may use off-premises--"
1996.95-1065,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2604.773,2613.359,"Yes, but I have to get... On the hypothesis you're raising, I have to get to the courthouse or to the house, or whatnot, before the zone appears."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2613.359,2614.901,"--Yes, and it--"
1996.95-1065,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2614.901,2616.641,It doesn't come out to meet me.
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2616.641,2627.667,"--No, and if there were a record that protestors started impeding your paths as you tried to go to work or to home, I submit someone could easily get an injunction to keep a clear zone--"
1996.95-1065,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2627.667,2628.358,But wouldn't the--
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2628.358,2629.57,--around you so you could get to work.
1996.95-1065,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2629.57,2658.169,"--But wouldn't there be a difference, and isn't this the difficulty in this case, that if there were simply a 15-foot zone around one person, that's fairly easy to administer and to police, but when you've got multiple, intersecting 15-foot zones around a lot of people who may even be subject to argument as even covered by the zone, you've got something which is far more difficult to administer."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2704.18,2717.097,"I think it is, Your Honor, and just if I may conclude the point... I see the red light is on... that a lot of the problems you're alluding to are precisely because the district judge here gave the defendants more leeway than the fixed zone in Madsen."
1996.95-1065,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2730.056,2730.777,"Thank you, Ms. Finley."
1996.95-1065,1,34455,lucinda_m_finley,,2730.777,2731.246,--Thank you.
1996.95-1065,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2731.246,2733.779,"General Dellinger, we'll hear from you."
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2733.779,2741.995,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1065,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2815.412,2831.242,"Well, one of the things he's supposed to do is read the First Amendment, I take it, and what he's doing here is, he's prohibiting certain conduct based on speech, and that means that the injunction must be precisely tailored."
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2833.664,2834.973,I'm--
1996.95-1065,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2834.973,2851.115,"This injunction goes much further than that, and if you want to defend it as saying that everything here is necessary to avoid the touching, grabbing aspect, that's one thing, but the harassment rationale as I see it goes much further."
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2860.492,2862.252,"--Justice Kennedy, I--"
1996.95-1065,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2862.252,2864.363,--and that's a very difficult First Amendment case.
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2864.363,2883.426,"--I believe that it is not difficult because the trial judge did tailor this to burden no more speech than necessary by making it clear that this message, or messages could continue to be conveyed."
1996.95-1065,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2916.817,2918.639,In--
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2918.639,2942.365,"Justice Breyer, if you wish... well, in further response to Justice Kennedy, one of those issues is the sheer effect of the crowding itself, that is, the use of what were called constructive blockades by having 4, 6, 10 people literally crowd around a patient as she attempted to approach the clinic, and to use that in an intimidating way."
1996.95-1065,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.804,2946.316,--I don't under... why is that a constructive blockade?
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2953.18,2954.462,--It was a construct--
1996.95-1065,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2954.462,2956.003,They were just annoying the person--
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2956.003,2956.383,--No.
1996.95-1065,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2956.383,2958.163,--and that's why it was a constructive blockade.
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2958.163,2962.837,"Well, they were not physically barring the people from entering, but--"
1996.95-1065,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.837,2963.668,"Well then, it's not a blockade--"
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2963.668,2964.819,--Then it's not a blockade.
1996.95-1065,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2964.819,2966.07,"--constructive or otherwise, it seems to me."
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,2966.07,2988.423,"The term, constructive blockade I think came from those who were engaged in them, Justice Scalia, because the use of 4, 6, or 10 people to crowd around an individual and to use that effect... we had testimony, or the plaintiffs had testimony in this case of one of the women who said she felt like she was in the middle of a lynch mob."
1996.95-1065,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3000.942,3002.523,I see.
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3020.106,3021.045,"--Here, Justice O'Connor--"
1996.95-1065,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3021.045,3023.056,How do you distinguish that?
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3023.056,3025.59,--Here I think it is--
1996.95-1065,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3025.59,3030.561,"And it effectively prevented people from entering a restaurant, or what have you."
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3030.561,3047.833,"--I think the difference is that in this case the... first of all, there was a record... the contempt proceedings are probably the most accessible place... that this was constant and ongoing, and this was an attempt that this was a medical facility, its--"
1996.95-1065,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3047.833,3053.837,But I thought there were something like five episodes over 18 months.
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3053.837,3057.47,"--Those were the ones, I think, that were raised in the contempt proceedings."
1996.95-1065,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3086.108,3106.021,"In answer to Justice Kennedy and Justice O'Connor, and I wonder, I'm just asking this, is it relevant to consider this is not labor picketing or civil rights picketing because the people by and large are pregnant women who are undergoing a serious medical procedure."
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3113.415,3117.557,--I do think it is relevant in precisely this way.
1996.95-1065,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3143.737,3146.469,"Is there... well, that's it, on their way to see the doctor."
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3153.862,3156.263,There are different--
1996.95-1065,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3156.263,3157.264,And maybe once afterwards.
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3157.264,3157.755,--That is correct.
1996.95-1065,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3157.755,3166.06,"So probably less than half of the women who are going in, just to speak of the women who are going in... does this injunction apply only to women going in?"
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3166.06,3166.39,No.
1996.95-1065,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3168.422,3173.864,"Who go in, so even if you take just the women, probably less than half of them are going in to have--"
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3173.864,3174.595,--That is--
1996.95-1065,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3174.595,3175.457,--a medical procedure--
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3175.457,3176.178,--Well--
1996.95-1065,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3176.178,3177.347,--at that time.
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3177.347,3177.707,--Yes.
1996.95-1065,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3185.592,3194.02,"So would the same reasoning apply simply to a group of, a building where doctors had offices but no surgical procedures were performed?"
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3196.941,3204.355,"--It would apply, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but with, I think, significantly less force than it does in those facilities where stress applies."
1996.95-1065,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3218.564,3220.457,"Mr. Dellinger, may I interrupt you--"
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3220.457,3220.938,--Yes.
1996.95-1065,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3220.938,3225.95,"--because I think you're going on to another point, and I just want to raise another point along Justice Breyer's lines."
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3262.443,3267.738,"Yes, that is certainly part of a calculation here."
1996.95-1065,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3267.738,3273.661,So labor picketing in the context of air traffic controllers would be a different case?
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3273.661,3275.041,I think--
1996.95-1065,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3275.041,3277.652,Because you don't want to upset air traffic controllers.
1996.95-1065,2,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,3279.785,3298.346,--It is... it is not at all clear that there would be any prohibition in the First Amendment or elsewhere on the use of close physical proximity and an intimidating and obstructing manner whether you're dealing with judges coming to work or air traffic controllers.
1996.95-1065,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3311.506,3318.95,"General Dellinger, what is careful about 15 feet of any personal vehicle seeking access to or leaving?"

1996.95-1065,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3443.982,3446.262,And your point is they've never used sticks or stones.
1996.95-1065,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3446.262,3447.494,--Not these clients.
1996.95-1065,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3447.494,3448.255,No.
1996.95-1065,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3448.255,3467.137,"But they do use words, but it's interesting, those words under this injunction, if they were directed at, say, a Xerox salesman who was doing business with the abortion facility and a demonstrator were to try to approach him and say, please don't do business with this facility because they're engaged in a practice that we personally find abhorrent."
1996.95-1065,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3478.924,3487.83,"But if in fact, coming right next to a person, right in their face, screaming at them and so forth, does physically hurt them, then it's like a stick or stone."
1996.95-1065,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3487.83,3493.554,"Well, I think that's actually prohibited by the injunction that we're not challenging, screaming in someone's face to the point where--"
