1980.79-1266,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.013,We will hear argument next in Steadman v. Securities and Exchange Commission.
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,70.597,74.986,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1266,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,178.351,181.833,"But the case was sent back for reconsideration of the sanctions, wasn't it?"
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,181.833,189.487,The case was sent back on remand because of the problem the Fifth Circuit had with the articulation of reasons for the extreme sanctions.
1980.79-1266,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,208.152,216.663,"Mr. Nickles, assume for a moment that the sanction had merely been a reprimand, a very mild sanction."
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,218.912,219.912,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1266,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,219.912,224.941,So that the severity of the sanction is really totally irrelevant to our consideration of the case?
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,224.941,252.648,"It is not irrelevant, because one gets into gradations of relevant factors dictating what standard of proof should be applied, and it will be our argument that when one has in this case, a combination of important factors such as the extreme sanctions and such as the allegations of fraud, that that is a much easier case for this Court to impose a clear and convincing standard of proof."
1980.79-1266,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,252.648,275.577,"What your argument really is, I guess, Mr. Nickles, that in view of the fact that a sanction of this severity is potentially impossible then a clear and convincing standard is necessary before offending the statutes can be assumed."
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,275.577,276.249,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1266,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,276.249,277.014,Because--
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,277.014,278.217,And we have that exact--
1980.79-1266,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,278.217,292.117,"--the sanction, for one thing, as my brother Blackmun said, has been remanded, and for another thing just in logic, the... your argument would be the same, whether the sanction actually imposed had been this one or some less severe one."
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,298.723,299.13,--Absolutely.
1980.79-1266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,299.13,322.027,"Certainly one of the reasons, as I have understood it, that in a criminal case the proof must be beyond a reasonable doubt, is the fact that the sanction upon conviction can be loss of personal liberty and confinement in an institution, and in some extreme cases, death."
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,322.027,323.198,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1266,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,353.311,359.934,But that isn't quite consistent with your initial answer to Mr. Justice Stevens.
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,360.309,361.135,I don't--
1980.79-1266,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,361.135,367.649,"--make no difference to you, to your case, if there had been simply a reprimand."
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,367.649,398.591,"--I believe, Your Honor, that the authorization to impose extreme sanctions is the triggering device to impose a higher standard of proof, but I am also saying the fact that the SEC imposed extreme sanctions is relevant in this context for the Court to understand the nature of the damage to reputation and profession that can be imposed by the SEC, on the basis of the lowest standard of proof known to the judicial system, preponderance of evidence standard."
1980.79-1266,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,429.876,437.607,"Mr. Nickles, I take it you feel that the... in this case and on the facts of this case, a different standard would have led to a different result?"
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,437.607,438.528,--Absolutely.
1980.79-1266,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,809.957,817.781,"Mr. Nickles, before you get into the specifics, just as a matter of putting the entire argument into perspective, you are not making a constitutional argument?"
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,817.781,818.125,--Absolutely not.
1980.79-1266,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.125,819.547,Are you making a statutory argument?
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,819.547,821.999,"Not exactly, Your Honor."
1980.79-1266,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,822.452,827.402,You're arguing as a matter of policy the Court should fashion a rule covering standard of proof?
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,827.402,827.684,--That's right.
1980.79-1266,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,846.489,851.783,"Now the government relies rather, toward the end of their brief, on the language of the Administrative Procedures Act?"
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,851.783,852.049,"Yes, on Section 7(c)--"
1980.79-1266,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.049,861.108,"And do you contend that that language should be construed to impose a clear and convincing burden, or that that language has nothing to do with the burden of proof?"
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,861.108,866.668,"--We contend it has nothing to do with this case, and this Court held in the Woodby case that language--"
1980.79-1266,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,866.668,867.34,That was a different statute.
1980.79-1266,0,38197,peter_j_nickles,,867.34,870.823,"--It's the Immigration and Nationality Act, Your Honor."
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1651.43,1660.943,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1701.925,1710.219,Is there any basis for him to suggest a supervisory power of the Court over the regulatory agency?
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1710.219,1721.324,"There is, Mr. Chief Justice, and the Court has exercised its supervisory powers in other cases, particularly the cases that the Petitioner has cited to the Court in the course of his argument."
1980.79-1266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1738.944,1747.205,"But this Court doesn't have the supervisory authority over agency proceedings that it does over lower federal courts, does it?"
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1747.205,1765.682,"It does not, Your Honor, but I believe what Mr. Nickles was referring to, was the Court's supervisory procedures to establish standards of proof in lower court proceedings and perhaps by analogy, to agency proceedings."
1980.79-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1766.307,1766.964,That's the question.
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1782.52,1796.311,"--Once you eliminate the constitutional question and take, as a given, that there's a statute that governs the situation, then the Court in the past has said it would not exercise any supervisory power that it might have."
1980.79-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1851.774,1855.724,What do you say about the relevance of the Addington holding here?
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1855.724,1860.957,"Well, we believe that the Court never need reach Addington."
1980.79-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.191,2066.858,"Could I ask you what is the... is the board that did the adjudication in Woodby, was that an administrative agency?"
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2066.858,2070.934,It was not an agency that was subject to the Administrative Procedure Act.
1980.79-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.934,2072.512,Expressly?
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2072.512,2073.137,That's correct.
1980.79-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2074.308,2076.917,And that's why Section 7(c) was irrelevant in that case?
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2076.917,2077.838,--That's correct.
1980.79-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.129,2099.705,"I know, but nevertheless, those words of the Immigration and Nationality Act related exclusively to--"
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2099.705,2101.0,--Scope of review.
1980.79-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.0,2104.202,--related to review in the... not to adjudication?
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2104.202,2104.624,That's correct.
1980.79-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.111,2145.091,"Well, what did, apparently there was no statutory guide then for the standard of proof, before the administrative agency in Woodby?"
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2145.091,2145.482,"--In Woodby, that's absolutely correct."
1980.79-1266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2163.022,2169.285,But the APA wasn't passed until 1946--
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2169.285,2169.566,That's correct.
1980.79-1266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2169.566,2171.535,--and the SEC Acts in question were passed in the '30's.
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2171.535,2177.141,That's correct.
1980.79-1266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2177.141,2186.418,"So, what was the standard... rather, what was the standard of proof before the SEC, between the time the SEC Acts were passed and the APA was passed?"
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2186.418,2189.901,The scope of review was substantial evidence for facts.
1980.79-1266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2189.901,2190.323,Standard of proof.
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2190.323,2195.368,"Standard of proof, was historically always preponderance of the evidence standard."
1980.79-1266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2198.039,2199.101,Even in a fraud case?
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2199.101,2200.725,Even in a fraud case.
1980.79-1266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2211.566,2219.468,"And even if, in... I suppose you could argue the Administrative Procedure Act would govern, regardless of what the standard was before it was passed?"
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2219.468,2219.812,Absolutely.
1980.79-1266,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2312.118,2321.443,May I ask one other question about the statutory language in the APA?
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2327.346,2331.72,"Yes, as a matter of fact, it has."
1980.79-1266,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.916,2350.383,"That's a strange way to describe preponderance, in all candor."
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2350.383,2350.993,--I'm sorry?
1980.79-1266,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.993,2354.569,"If the Congress had meant preponderance, I don't know why they didn't say that."
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2354.569,2360.707,"Well there's, I think, a reason for that."
1980.79-1266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2595.209,2600.002,"Of course, the Attorney General's manual may be a little bit one-sided too."
1980.79-1266,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2628.975,2639.816,"But that... that may very well be, Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1266,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2833.988,2835.081,"Well do you have anything further, Mr. Nickles?"
1980.79-1266,2,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2835.081,2838.502,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1266,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2887.731,2900.101,"Mr. Justice Clark, in his dissenting opinion in Woodby, spoke as though it was well established that that language did establish a burden of proof within the agency."
1980.79-1266,2,38197,peter_j_nickles,,2900.101,2906.271,"--I don't think so, Mr. Justice Clark... Mr. Justice Stewart."
