1986.85-1259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.724,"Mr. Nageotte, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,12.724,16.193,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,145.375,150.595,"Mr. Nageotte, we granted certiorari only on the jury trial issue in this case."
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,150.595,155.297,"Yes, Your Honor, I'm simply trying to briefly summarize the facts."
1986.85-1259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,234.166,260.733,"Mr. Nageotte, if the language of the statute had made clear that the so-called civil sanction was to be related to disgorgement of economic benefit for example, would you think the Seventh Amendment would then guarantee a right to trial by jury?"
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,260.733,264.452,That would really depend on the precise language used.
1986.85-1259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,285.865,289.836,"Well, you would concede that it could be an equitable remedy?"
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,289.836,290.353,--Yes.
1986.85-1259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.166,322.224,"Well, is it possible that we could interpret this statute as essentially one for that type of relief even though it's not express?"
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,322.224,330.663,"Justice O'Connor, I don't believe that that could be done in this case for this very specific reason."
1986.85-1259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,405.461,409.763,Would you clarify one thing factually for me?
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,422.423,427.827,"--Yes, Your Honor, he was."
1986.85-1259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,508.212,517.134,"Mr. Nageotte, do I understand you to say that there is no discretion as to whether or not a civil penalty shall be imposed under the statute?"
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,517.134,519.067,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,521.269,528.525,Says that any person who commits a violation shall be subject to a civil penalty.
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,528.525,528.859,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-1259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.059,532.144,"Yes, shall be subject to."
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,532.144,546.154,"Shall be subject, I read the words, ""shall be"" to require the imposition of some penalty and that's the government's position in most of these cases, that it's not a discretionary item, that the court must impose some civil penalty in each case."
1986.85-1259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.154,552.14,"If someone is subject to deportation, it means he must be deported."
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,565.448,580.208,"Well, if you read, if you read it together with the criminal penalties which are provided in 33 U.S.C. 1319(c), the criminal penalties provide for a willful or negligent violation."
1986.85-1259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.796,587.814,I agree that you're subject to them.
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,597.419,602.907,"No, Your Honor, these are... this is simply from my experience in trying these cases at the district court level."
1986.85-1259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,823.948,836.34,"--Well, if Congress had vested the authority in an administrative agency to impose a civil fine, I don't suppose you'd be here."
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,836.34,839.708,"--That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.6,857.503,And so you are in effect saying Congress made its choice.
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,862.538,863.99,"Well absolutely, Your Honor."
1986.85-1259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,866.442,868.811,"Well, xxx but is there a jury trial."
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,868.811,879.333,"--Yes, Justice White, and it was, and they knew, I mean they knew, we have, what we have is a coin that has heads and tails."
1986.85-1259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,916.042,923.029,Is there any administrative mechanism for imposing civil penalties under the Clean Water Act?
1986.85-1259,0,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,923.029,923.546,"--No, sir."
1986.85-1259,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1805.053,1808.572,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1845.947,1846.947,You haven't addressed it at all.
1986.85-1259,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1850.316,1853.2,That is what has been held and that is the xxx.
1986.85-1259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1853.2,1855.033,--Have you addressed whether it must be assessed.
1986.85-1259,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1855.033,1857.068,I'm addressing it right now.
1986.85-1259,2,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,3706.633,3710.418,Unless there are any questions from the Court I really have nothing further to add.
1986.85-1259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3710.418,3720.475,"Mr. Nageotte, are you really serious in your claim that the jury would have to set, if you have a right to jury trial, you have a right to have the jury set the fine?"
1986.85-1259,2,40079,richard_n_nageotte,,3720.475,3722.092,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1259,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3735.633,3736.65,"Thank you, Mr. Nageotte."
