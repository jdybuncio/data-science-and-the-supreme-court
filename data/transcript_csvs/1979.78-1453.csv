1979.78-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,42.305,We will hear arguments next in United States v. Euge.
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,46.793,49.588,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,219.191,224.519,"Mr. Smith, Mr. Euge is here on an in forma pauperis basis, isn't he?"
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,224.519,234.066,"That seems to be correct, yes, because the briefs, I think, were printed at the expense of the Court."
1979.78-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,510.29,513.844,"Well, what you're arguing is basically a statutory question, isn't it?"
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,513.844,514.113,Yes.
1979.78-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,514.113,520.544,"Certainly Mara and Dionisio establish that if Congress says so, there is no constitutional objection."
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,520.544,521.014,Exactly.
1979.78-1453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,557.538,563.345,"Mr. Smith, is your argument then, you are not arguing that the handwriting exemplar is testimony."
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,565.914,567.09,"No, well, we're arguing --"
1979.78-1453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.09,568.914,-- given the power to take testimony --
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,568.914,572.253,"Testimony; right, exactly."
1979.78-1453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.735,645.365,"You don't really claim, then, that the literal wording of the statute covers this case?"
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,645.365,645.694,No.
1979.78-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,920.742,924.267,"Mr. Smith, does this statute authorize taking fingerprints?"
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,924.267,925.797,"I would think it would, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1979.78-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.797,927.083,Blood samples?
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,927.083,927.282,What?
1979.78-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,927.282,928.917,"What about blood samples, voice exemplars?"
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,928.917,929.389,"I would think it would, also."
1979.78-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.389,930.715,All of those things.
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,930.715,942.384,"I would think it would -- you know, the whole gamut of non-testimonial disclosures, like asking somebody to put on a hat, or you know, these things are normally not done in tax investigation."
1979.78-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,942.384,946.964,Is this power used in connection with preparation of criminal cases or just civil cases?
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,946.964,948.05,The summons authority power?
1979.78-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,948.05,948.623,Yes.
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,948.623,961.056,"Well, I think that, you know at this stage, I think the decisions of this Court indicate that the civil and criminal aspects of the case are intertwined."
1979.78-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,979.953,988.737,"If these exemplars showed that it was the same person who signed his name on all these accounts, it would be pretty clear criminal liability, wouldn't there?"
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,988.737,996.459,"Assuming that the balances that went into the accounts were, represented unreported taxable income."
1979.78-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1008.446,1014.177,"And if that was his signature, the only thing left for him to do was plead guilty."
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1014.177,1015.126,"Well, that would --"
1979.78-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1015.126,1018.993,"It would be a real waste of time to try him, wouldn't it?"
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1018.993,1025.925,"Well, it's possible that he could then say that an elderly aunt left him all of this money."
1979.78-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1053.316,1057.77,"Is there any federal statute or -- well, we'll start with federal."
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1068.349,1087.998,"Oh, I don't think there's any federal prohibition, but I suspect that he probably ran the gamut here and used false social security numbers, and you know, I suspect at that point, there probably -- because you do have an obligation, I think to give your bank an appropriate, you know, the correct social security number so they could report --"
1979.78-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1087.998,1090.784,Is that by federal statute?
1979.78-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1090.784,1093.806,"Well, most people only have one social security number."
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1093.806,1096.273,"Right, that's right, Exactly."
1979.78-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1155.959,1156.1,Your answer --
1979.78-1453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1156.1,1158.298,The Service has a real problem --
1979.78-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1158.298,1158.951,Go ahead.
1979.78-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1158.951,1182.781,"The Service has a real problem, doesn't it, in the case of kids going to college and working for the summer whose wages are withheld during the time they work, but they don't work a long enough period to be required to pay any tax, and so they're just literally thousands of legitimate --"
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1182.781,1209.187,"Yes, but Mr. Justice Rehnquist, my recollection is that several years ago, it certainly came long after I worked for the summer that you could file a particular form and absolve yourself of withholding, if you could demonstrate, on the assertion, on the assurance that you were not going to have taxable income in excess of a certain amount so that you wouldn't have this over-withholding."
1979.78-1453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1209.187,1217.608,My kids have been -- you do an awful lot of paper work --
1979.78-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1217.608,1231.667,"But it is, I take it from your response to my earlier question that there is no statute which forbids any person from having ten different bank accounts in ten different names?"
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1231.667,1239.832,"I am not aware of any statutory prohibition, but of course there is a statutory provision against concealing taxable income and not reporting it."
1979.78-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1239.832,1241.294,That's not my question.
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1254.621,1257.309,Absolutely not; absolutely not.
1979.78-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1257.439,1260.117,You might do that so that your children --
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1260.117,1260.947,"Well, no, no."
1979.78-1453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1278.806,1284.186,"-- wasn't a plea of guilty, but at least was a prima facie net worth case, wasn't it?"
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1284.186,1289.787,"It certainly would enhance, it would bring the Service, Mr. Justice Blackmun, sir, to first base."
1979.78-1453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1289.787,1291.15,"Let's settle with ""enhance."""
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1292.04,1293.89,Okay.
1979.78-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1293.89,1301.996,Perhaps he might come in and explain that he just didn't want his wife and his children to know how much money he had in the bank.
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1301.996,1311.615,"Yes, indeed, but of course he hadn't filed any tax returns at all, so it's possible he didn't want the Internal Revenue Service to know how much money he had earned."
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1315.819,1319.279,-- he's not the kind of person who is innocent of learning in these matters.
1979.78-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1319.279,1321.308,And he's here IFP?
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1321.308,1322.66,He's here IFP.
1979.78-1453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1397.754,1402.656,"Mr. Smith, I know you discuss in your brief but I just don't remember, how old is this problem?"
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1405.587,1417.742,"Well, the problem in the litigation, apparently, just began to surface about four or five years ago when people began to object."
1979.78-1453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1448.988,1452.7,"Practiced since 1921, suddenly they're requiring or just requesting, do you know?"
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1452.7,1456.781,"No, they've been requesting where cases make it appropriate to request."
1979.78-1453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.781,1458.923,"Have there been enforcement proceedings, do you know?"
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1458.923,1464.914,I'm not aware of any litigation or enforcement proceedings until the mid-1970's when this started to become a problem.
1979.78-1453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1510.436,1511.625,"I have a question, Mr. Smith."
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1527.038,1536.677,"We think that the words ""other data"" further support our submission that the statute covers these kinds of exemplars."
1979.78-1453,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1542.764,1543.314,Is the one you make.
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1543.314,1548.13,The Service has the authority to make someone come and appear.
1979.78-1453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1600.881,1607.679,It would be harder to say that exemplars are memoranda than it is to say that they are data?
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1607.679,1608.396,Exactly.
1979.78-1453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.181,1658.243,"That isn't much of a mistake, is it?"
1979.78-1453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1658.243,1659.675,No.
1979.78-1453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.675,1661.657,Fairly minor.
1979.78-1453,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1661.657,1665.609,But it would be hard to find.
1979.78-1453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1672.842,1674.659,Mr. Erwin.
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1674.659,1677.362,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1453,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1818.108,1819.459,You say there was a hearing?
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1819.459,1820.74,"Yes, there was."
1979.78-1453,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1825.725,1830.692,How much was involved in these side accounts?
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1830.692,1831.498,Pardon me?
1979.78-1453,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1831.498,1834.695,How much money is in the side accounts?
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1834.695,1846.193,"The agent testified at the hearing that he had determined that in the year 1975 $30,000 had passed through the account, and in 1976 $50,000."
1979.78-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1846.193,1849.088,And he couldn't afford counsel?
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1849.088,1860.734,"Well, Your Honor, this was at a time two years, about two years before the time of the hearing on his financial condition."
1979.78-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1860.734,1864.062,"Well, maybe there is $60,000 in there now."
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1864.062,1865.303,I don't know.
1979.78-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1865.303,1870.391,That is just as inferable as there is nothing in there at this point.00
1979.78-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1870.391,1873.654,What was his testimony as to his net worth at the time?
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1873.654,1876.343,He did not testify.
1979.78-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1876.343,1880.999,And the court nonetheless allowed him to proceed IFP?
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1880.999,1897.323,"Well, he testified that his assets were tied up in real estate which were subject to foreclosure in proceedings by the redevelopment authority in St. Louis for failure to pay city taxes."
1979.78-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1897.323,1904.233,Are you as a member of the bar satisfied that he fulfills the IFP standard?
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1904.233,1911.864,"Yes, I am, sir."
1979.78-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.204,1963.291,"Would you agree, as suggested by your brother, that he could be summoned to appear for the purpose of having his picture taken?"
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1963.291,1964.081,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.081,1964.764,You don't?
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1964.764,1965.629,I do not agree.
1979.78-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1965.629,1969.033,"He could be summoned to appear and bring with him an existing picture, couldn't he?"
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1969.033,1969.559,Yes.
1979.78-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1969.559,1970.357,You do concede that?
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1970.357,1981.818,"I believe that the point on which the statute addresses itself, he could be compelled to produce documents or evidence of a documentary nature that does exist."
1979.78-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1984.621,1988.714,"Your response to that is in the framework of the Tax Code, I take it?"
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1988.714,1989.365,Yes.
1979.78-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1989.365,1991.089,Not generally.
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,1991.089,1992.332,"No, not generally."
1979.78-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2006.335,2018.143,"If he is ordered to produce an exemplar in the proceeding by the District Court, where does the compulsion originate?"
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2020.451,2024.411,"Yes, the court is acting but it is acting pursuant to the statute."
1979.78-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2044.692,2051.636,But the District Court would have no more power to enforce the summons than the service had to issue the summons.
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2051.636,2053.179,That's correct.
1979.78-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2053.179,2059.516,Then why do you say that the District Court could do something that the service could not do?
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2059.516,2071.751,The District Court in a pending criminal case pursuant to a motion of the government could order the execution of the handwriting exemplar or it could order the enforcement of a grand jury subpoena for handwriting exemplar.
1979.78-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2071.751,2074.549,But that doesn't depend on the Internal Revenue Code.
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2074.549,2079.646,"No, it does not, but its power in this particular type of case does depend upon the Internal Revenue Code."
1979.78-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2079.646,2084.01,"And we are dealing here specifically with the provisions of 7602, are we not?"
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2084.01,2085.58,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2085.58,2098.887,"Do I understand that you that if Congress had provided in that section that the Internal Revenue Service could require the production of handwriting exemplars, you would not be here?"
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2098.887,2104.597,That's correct.
1979.78-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.597,2119.162,"Mr. Erwin, I know the government doesn't argue this, but have you considered whether the analogy of the New York Telephone case, whether the all writs act would give the court the power to aid the jurisdiction to order production of this kind of material?"
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2119.162,2123.067,"No, sir, I have not considered that."
1979.78-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2192.056,2220.647,"Mr. Erwin, supposing that under section 7602 the last sentence of it, and to give such testimony under oath before the Secretary or his delegate at a time and place named in the summons and to produce such books, papers, records or other data and to give such testimony under oath as may be relevant or material to such inquiry."
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2249.72,2255.783,I believe in that situation the person would have the Fifth Amendment privilege to refuse to respond.
1979.78-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2255.783,2260.341,I don't doubt it for a minute if he came within the Fifth Amendment.
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2264.444,2269.35,"Well, the taking of testimony from the taxpayer is authorized by statute."
1979.78-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2269.35,2269.619,So you would say --
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2269.619,2276.494,"The taking of oral statements under oath, the statute specifically authorizes that in subsection 3."
1979.78-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2276.494,2283.599,"Well, what they are asking for here is to write it out."
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2283.599,2288.45,I don't believe the statute authorizes them to compel the creation of a document.
1979.78-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2288.45,2302.387,"You say that he could be asked what his net worth was on January 1st and on December 31st, but he could not be asked to write out what his net worth was on January 1st and December 31st?"
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2302.387,2303.237,That is our position.
1979.78-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.384,2308.64,Let's make it even more simple.
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2329.551,2332.147,"I think not, Your Honor, if it is for the purpose of a handwriting exemplar."
1979.78-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.154,2337.721,It doesn't speak of oral testimony.
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2337.721,2344.947,"Well, testimony under oath I think refers to oral testimony."
1979.78-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2344.947,2346.849,It does?
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2346.849,2356.877,"In the production of evidence, production of documentary type evidence, books, papers and records."
1979.78-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2356.877,2370.87,"On the same line, supposing they asked him for a list of his receipts by month for the past twelve months and a list of expenditures and a profit and loss statement and a balance sheet, none of which he had prepared."
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2377.84,2378.731,"I think not, Your Honor."
1979.78-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2409.011,2438.865,"What if he said in response to the same question that we have been talking about, it is all on a data processing system in my office and I just don't have any recollection of it, and the people in the service say, well, we have no way of getting into your data processing machine, would you just wrote out the summary of the net worth or name or whatever it is as of January 1st and as of January 31st?"
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2438.865,2442.623,"Well, again I do not think they could be compelled to create that document."
1979.78-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2452.69,2453.066,So that --
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2453.066,2454.802,If that is in existence.
1979.78-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2454.802,2458.854,He could compel the retrieval of raw data in the computer?
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2458.854,2466.854,"Well, the data case involved the production of the actual tape itself rather than the retrieval of the data."
1979.78-1453,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2474.818,2475.807,That wasn't my question.
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2481.748,2505.375,"I think this is a transformation of existing information that is capable, that does exist, is in existing records and cannot be read by human beings, of course, and must be transformed into a printout in order to be read by persons."
1979.78-1453,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2579.986,2583.448,"Mr. Erwin, I wanted to ask you about the Bisceglia case."
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2598.696,2601.016,Yes.
1979.78-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2651.953,2659.669,"Do you think that if Congress abolished grand juries, that law would be unconstitutional?"
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2659.669,2665.783,"Yes, I think it would."
1979.78-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2665.783,2675.198,The Constitution assures every defendant in a federal criminal case that he can't be tried unless he is indicted by a grand jury.
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2675.198,2682.217,"I believe it does in practically those very words, Your Honor, and I believe that therefore it could not be abolished."
1979.78-1453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.639,2691.614,"So maybe it wouldn't be constitutional, but nobody could be tried in a federal criminal court."
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2691.614,2697.06,Right.
1979.78-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.948,2732.86,"You are saying that somehow the guarantee that Justice Stewart has commented upon, upon the right of every person to be indicted by a grand jury constitutionalizes the right of the grand jury in a way that favors the government over an act of Congress which authorizes the service to do something."
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2734.315,2744.766,"Well, what I am saying is that the grand jury has inherent power such as the court does in a pending criminal case to order the production of this type of evidence."
1979.78-1453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2954.404,2958.575,But the Second Circuit held that it applied to computer tapes.
1979.78-1453,1,30136,james_w_erwin,,2958.575,2989.654,"Yes, and because they were presently in existence and they made reference to the Brown case and said that it only applied to documents which were presently in existence and agreed with that position of the Brown case which relied primarily on canons of statutory construction which is essentially what we have been arguing in this case."
1979.78-1453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3069.378,3071.299,"Mr. Smith, do you have anything further?"
1979.78-1453,2,42099,stuart_a_smith,,3071.299,3074.404,"I have nothing further, if the Court has no questions."
1979.78-1453,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3074.404,3074.951,I think not.
