1989.89-5809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.154,"We'll hear argument next in number 89-5809, Sawyer against Smith."
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,43.843,51.413,"Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-5809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,121.759,128.413,"In... in Caldwell the bad statements came from a judge, did they not?"
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,128.413,141.138,"Your Honor, in Caldwell the context was that the prosecutor stood up in response to defense counsel and said, what the defense counsel's telling you is not true, it's automatically reviewable, your decision is not final."
1989.89-5809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,150.778,153.73,And here did the judge say anything?
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,153.73,154.797,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-5809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,154.797,157.449,Did defense counsel object to the--
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,157.449,159.651,"No, Your Honor, defense counsel did not object."
1989.89-5809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,336.5,349.724,"--Ms. Hancock, I... I take it you concede that all the cases that you say foreshadowed Caldwell were indeed state law cases."
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,349.724,370.888,"Counsel in the Ramos decision... but this Court noted that in looking at state court cases in the death penalty context, it is sometimes difficult to discern whether those cases are based on state law that is a narrow kind of state law or state law that is informed by Federal principles."
1989.89-5809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,386.85,399.824,Were there any cases or do you cite any cases that relied on the Eighth Amendment as a ground for the result reached in Caldwell?
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,399.824,407.696,"--I can... the Georgia and the Louisiana cases do cite Eighth Amendment cases in their decisions, as does the Mississippi Court."
1989.89-5809,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,486.363,487.715,Ms. Hancock--
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,487.715,489.065,Yes?
1989.89-5809,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,489.065,494.719,--was the claim you're advancing now ever raised in the state courts?
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,494.719,500.54,"It was not raised in the state direct appeal where Petitioner was represented by different counsel, Your Honor."
1989.89-5809,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,513.782,521.869,"So, you feel that the... any requirement of raising the point on the state side first has been satisfied?"
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,521.869,523.571,"Yes, the state has not argued."
1989.89-5809,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,523.571,524.905,I know it hasn't.
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,524.905,525.405,Yes.
1989.89-5809,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,532.892,536.694,"I'm a little surprised the state hasn't raised it, but apparently they don't want to rely on it."
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,536.694,544.8,"--Yes, the Louisiana law appears clearly to find... to not use any kind of procedural default doctrine in this area of the law, Your Honor."
1989.89-5809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,544.8,554.422,Was the Donnelly case relied upon in the proceedings in the Louisiana Court on direct review?
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,554.422,556.589,"Not to my recollection, Your Honor."
1989.89-5809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.574,559.157,Ms. Hancock?
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,559.157,559.524,--Yes?
1989.89-5809,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.524,576.0,"Even if you assume that Caldwell was... was old law not... not new law, would it... would it be compelled from a holding that when the judge misrepresents the sentencing law you have to have a new sentencing proceeding?"
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,584.872,593.228,"Your Honor, the lines of authority we rely on... and please tell me if this is not responsive... but the lines of authority we rely on are two."
1989.89-5809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,756.315,761.636,"Well, if... if this was so highly damaging, Ms. Hancock, why didn't the defense lawyer object when it was made?"
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,761.636,768.473,"Your Honor, defense counsel in this case, as the record shows, and as the court of appeals in its panel opinion revealed--"
1989.89-5809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,768.473,770.256,"--which has been superseded, hasn't it?"
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,770.256,771.575,"--Yes, that's right, but not this part of it."
1989.89-5809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,771.575,778.162,You mean the... the panel opinion remains dispositive of the case?
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,778.162,783.547,"No, I merely want to illustrate the answer to Your Honor's question, which I could directly answer better by saying that--"
1989.89-5809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,783.547,784.566,"Well, why don't you?"
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,784.566,787.618,"--the defense lawyer was not competent, Your Honor."
1989.89-5809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,801.259,807.929,"No, but you would think if this is such a terribly damaging thing, even a relatively unskilled lawyer would object to it."
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,807.929,818.886,"--Well, Your Honor, it may surprise you, but state cases before Caldwell did sometimes involve this fact pattern where a prosecutor would make these misleading statements."
1989.89-5809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,863.799,885.763,"Ms. Hancock, it seems to me that you have to address the effect of this Court's per curiam in Maggio against Williams, decided in 1983, in which the Court summarily rejected a claim just like this."
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,885.763,886.263,--Yes--
1989.89-5809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,886.263,894.035,It makes it very hard to say that Caldwell is not a new rule in... at least in... in the view of this Court.
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,894.035,902.724,"--Well, counsel... I mean, Your Honor, an answer to that question is provided by a glance at the district court's opinion in that case."
1989.89-5809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1199.984,1207.006,Can you give me an example of any of our cases in the capital sentencing area in recent years that are not fundamental?
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,1207.006,1216.695,"Well, Your Honor, that's a tough question since you've decided many cases and this is the first case to raise this question."
1989.89-5809,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1216.695,1226.901,"Well, but as you look back over our jurisprudence, it seems to me that most of them would fit within the guidelines you've just suggested."
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,1228.936,1238.959,"I think, on the contrary, Your Honor, that Teague is not at all a dead letter, that Teague's demands are quite difficult to meet."
1989.89-5809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1257.372,1270.247,"Well, would you say that every capital sentencing procedure that reduces the risk of an unreliable determination falls within the second example?"
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,1270.247,1284.939,"--Your Honor, that's a very difficult question to answer because whenever this Court writes Eighth Amendment opinions upholding defendant's rights, it is common for that to be said about the right, that they reduce the risk of unreliability."
1989.89-5809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1323.698,1326.333,But it does seem your argument would sweep--
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,1326.333,1327.066,--Oh--
1989.89-5809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1327.066,1328.451,--in a great many of the--
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,1328.451,1328.918,--Well--
1989.89-5809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1328.918,1333.737,--of the criminal procedure rulings and I think that has to be a matter of concern.
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,1351.182,1352.098,--Yes.
1989.89-5809,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1482.567,1487.804,"Well, all of that lends support to the notion that it's certainly articulated a new rule."
1989.89-5809,0,19175,catherine_hancock,,1487.804,1493.307,"No, Your Honor, superficially one might think that that is the case."
1989.89-5809,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1545.473,1546.657,"Very well, Ms. Hancock."
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,1549.173,1557.363,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-5809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1763.914,1767.032,We... we said it didn't violate the Federal Constitution.
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,1767.032,1769.116,"--Exactly, and that it was not an arbitrary factor."
1989.89-5809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1793.397,1796.099,In... in this case to... to affirm the conviction?
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,1796.099,1796.549,"--Oh, no."
1989.89-5809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2008.536,2025.015,"Well, Ms. Pendergast, there certainly is an impressive array of cases from state courts showing a long history of condemnation of false and misleading prosecutorial arguments that diminish the jury's sense of responsibility."
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2025.882,2026.932,"--That's so, Your Honor."
1989.89-5809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2033.287,2033.887,"Well, does it--"
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2033.887,2034.803,--under an Eight Amendment--
1989.89-5809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2034.803,2045.328,--does it indicate that at least the Caldwell rule comes close to being essential to fundamentally fair proceedings?
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2045.328,2046.328,--No.
1989.89-5809,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2055.851,2057.553,"Well, that has to be your argument, of course."
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2064.704,2078.881,"Your Honor, I don't... this case here does not rise... arise to the level of... the argument here does not rise to a Caldwell violation level if we... if you look at the entire record."
1989.89-5809,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2079.498,2083.767,"Well, I have looked at the entire record, and I think I disagree with you mildly on that one."
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2083.767,2090.021,--I can... I do... Caldwell is not a watershed rule.
1989.89-5809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2106.098,2114.287,Would you tend to say that a rule essential to the fundamental fairness of the proceeding could be a watershed rule?
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2114.287,2126.261,--I think a watershed rule has to be essential to the reliability of the outcome of that trial and without which we feel like you would not have a reliable verdict.
1989.89-5809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2243.002,2248.64,"Well, does... does Caldwell stand for anything more than the proposition that the information may not be misleading?"
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2248.64,2252.842,--It stands... you cannot mislead the jury.
1989.89-5809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2257.995,2258.611,So--
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2258.611,2259.78,"So, you have two things--"
1989.89-5809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2259.78,2268.469,"--So if you want to bring something under the head of Caldwell, I would... I would think you would have to show that the information is... is inaccurate or false."
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2268.469,2270.203,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-5809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2270.203,2280.027,"And so that if one refers to... to some further proceeding, and there is such a further proceeding, that information would... would not be prohibited by Caldwell?"
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2280.027,2283.645,I think Caldwell would not necessarily prohibit it.
1989.89-5809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2289.049,2295.537,"At least... if there was any constitutional objection to it, it would not be because of a Caldwell case?"
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2295.537,2297.739,--Probably not.
1989.89-5809,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.739,2298.589,But counsel--
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2303.39,2304.392,Exactly.
1989.89-5809,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2304.392,2306.042,--and responsibility--
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2306.042,2307.344,Exactly.
1989.89-5809,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.01,2311.962,--Not just any type of other misleading information?
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2311.962,2316.45,"--No, Caldwell addresses was the jury misled as to its role as sentencer."
1989.89-5809,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.352,2347.252,Yes.
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2349.635,2349.968,--Yes.
1989.89-5809,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2350.751,2351.734,And it was misleading?
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2351.734,2354.42,I do not think this jury was misled.
1989.89-5809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.42,2356.372,"You don't think that... well, that isn't the question I asked."
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2362.026,2364.109,I would not condone some of the things the prosecution said.
1989.89-5809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2364.109,2365.811,"I know you wouldn't condone it, but would you agree it was misleading?"
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2365.811,2367.311,"Yes, I would agree that--"
1989.89-5809,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2367.311,2367.577,Thank you.
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2367.577,2368.66,--some of it was misleading.
1989.89-5809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.689,2442.208,"You mean for the defense counsel to object, don't you?"
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2442.208,2442.741,"Yes, I do."
1989.89-5809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2442.741,2443.424,You just said prosecutor.
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2443.424,2443.807,I'm sorry.
1989.89-5809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2452.78,2460.017,Why do you suppose here it was that the state court did not give relief to the defendant?
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2460.017,2465.988,"--Because it did not rise to the height of a... well, what we call now as a Caldwell violation."
1989.89-5809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2480.847,2494.007,"But you are... you are making the argument that even assuming it would rise to the level of a Caldwell violation in our view, that the defendant should not get relief?"
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2494.007,2495.407,"Yes, I am."
1989.89-5809,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2592.503,2600.007,Would you agree that every judge on the Fifth Circuit felt there was a Caldwell violation?
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2600.007,2601.359,"No, I would not agree to that."
1989.89-5809,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2601.359,2603.311,And explain it for me.
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2603.311,2616.552,"In the en banc opinion, we have... the... they review the case for prejudice and, if I may, Your Honor, the opinion says,"
1989.89-5809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2655.844,2661.647,What's your understanding of the difference between the prejudice inquiry under Donnelly and under Caldwell?
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2661.647,2665.968,My understanding would be the same as the Fifth Circuit.
1989.89-5809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2697.588,2702.807,"And there is... if it reaches that level, as you understand it, then there isn't a further inquiry as to prejudice?"
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2702.807,2703.693,Right.
1989.89-5809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2711.08,2715.734,"And... and in your view, is that the new aspect of the... of Caldwell rule?"
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2715.734,2718.251,"Excuse me, Your Honor, would you--"

1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2721.805,2731.827,"--I think the new aspect of the Caldwell rule is the application of Eighth Amendment to argument, prosecutorial argument, which is... it's such a different entity, never would we have--"
1989.89-5809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2731.827,2737.065,"You mean it's simply... it's simply the... the... the constitutional source of the rule, but not its application?"
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2737.065,2738.398,--Exactly.
1989.89-5809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2739.849,2742.218,In application it's essentially the same as Donnelly?
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2742.218,2746.936,--It's essential... it incorporates Donnelly.
1989.89-5809,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2750.055,2751.657,"Well, that sounds to me like an old rule."
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2751.657,2761.096,--But the new rule part is that we have never before raised argument of counsel to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation.
1989.89-5809,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2761.096,2768.184,"Well, isn't a new consequence of Caldwell that if there is a Caldwell violation, there is no further prejudice inquiry."
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2772.238,2773.188,Exactly.
1989.89-5809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2773.188,2783.961,"Well, that means the rule isn't the same, that just labelling it Eighth Amendment isn't the answer."
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2786.413,2787.863,The test would be different--
1989.89-5809,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2787.863,2788.779,What is your position?
1989.89-5809,1,21357,dorothy_a_pendergast,,2788.779,2803.539,"--My position is that the test is different for an Eighth Amendment violation, and that we go to... once we find that there is this error, then there is no test for prejudice and that would be the difference in a Caldwell."
