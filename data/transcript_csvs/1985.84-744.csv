1985.84-744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.326,We will hear arguments next in United States against Lane and the consolidated case.
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,68.832,83.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the defendants in this case were each charged in five counts of a six-count indictment alleging mail fraud, conspiracy, and perjury in connection with three arson for profit schemes."
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,407.508,410.928,"Mr. Kuhlik, may I just raise this question before you get too deeply into the argument?"
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,416.504,416.878,--Yes.
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,416.878,425.969,"Is it the government's position that misjoinder does not affect substantial rights, or that even if it does affect substantial rights, the harmless error inquiry is--"
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,425.969,432.31,Our position is not that joinder under Rule 8 is not a substantial right.
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,464.64,468.42,"--Well, I still don't... I am not quite sure what your answer is to my question."
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,472.185,477.588,"We say there may well be a substantial right, but--"
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,477.588,479.462,And then you say that misjoinder does not affect that right?
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,479.462,493.581,"--That is the inquiry to be undertaken in this specific case, did the misjoinder affect the substantial right, the substantial right being the right to a jury verdict untainted by whatever error took place."
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,493.581,500.923,"In the McElroy case as I read it, they said there was a substantial right affected, and that for that reason it was reversible error."
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,500.923,517.634,"In the McElroy case, which was decided in 1896, the Court responded to the government's argument that the error of misjoinder in that case did not affect the verdict by saying that they could not say that the verdict wasn't affected there."
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,518.821,521.523,The government confessed error in that case.
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,521.523,522.32,--They confessed error--
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,522.32,523.194,They didn't make that argument.
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,527.739,545.623,"--But the portion of the Court's discussion to which you are referring referred, I believe, to the part of the judgment in which the government had not confessed error, which was on the basis of the fact that the three defendants who were charged in all counts had not had their rights affected."
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.62,561.882,"Yes, but Rule 52(a) expressly picks up the substantial right language, and that is why I am just not entirely... still not entirely clear what you are saying."
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,567.568,593.089,"Well, perhaps the best way to put it is that the substantial right in any case is the right to a jury verdict that has not been affected by error, and in that respect we would say that if there has been misjoinder, the Court must inquire into whether the substantial right which is to the untainted jury verdict has been affected in the particular case."
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,597.587,604.631,"Well, wouldn't that make the rule read exactly... what you really do, as I understand your interpretation, the rule then should simply read,"
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,618.516,619.172,--Exactly.
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,827.978,836.663,"I know it is not true in this case, but supposing you had a case in which the evidence on Count 1 were overwhelming, and it was a very close case on the other five counts."
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,840.676,846.548,--That is the standard inquiry that the Court of Appeals would make in reviewing whether the error was harmless.
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,851.11,858.638,But if you would think... so our duty is to see how overwhelming the evidence is on the five other counts.
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,858.638,859.341,"Well, it is not--"
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,859.341,863.325,"I mean, how does the harmless error inquiry proceed?"
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,863.325,873.413,"--Well, I would point first to the fact that we do believe that the evidence of Count 1 would come in on retrial under... at least under Rule 404."
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,873.413,874.459,As to the son?
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,874.459,883.69,"No, it would come in as respect to the father, and the son would get exactly the same limiting instruction on retrial that he got here."
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,893.936,894.342,Right.
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,894.342,900.621,"And at such a trial, I would expect the government to offer evidence of the Count 1 arson."
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.621,904.962,Wouldn't the government be free to elect to try 1 through 6 together as against the father?
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,904.962,905.931,One through Five.
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.618,908.804,"One through Five, excuse me, because Six was just--"
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,908.804,909.929,--They could do it either way--
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,909.929,910.725,"--They could do it either way, yes."
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,910.725,922.814,"--that they wanted to, but I would think that any time that the same evidence would be admissible on retrial, that would be an extremely strong consideration favoring the harmlessness of the error."
1985.84-744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,937.543,971.295,"Mr. Kuhlik, what would happen in the event of a misjoinder of parties defendant in a criminal case when a defendant joined in the action, makes a Rule 14 motion for severance, for example, and the trial court determines, well, you didn't established prejudice, and I am not going to sever, and after the trial there is a harmless error inquiry, if your position is adopted?"
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,978.433,984.554,"--Of course, the first inquiry for the Court of Appeals, Justice O'Connor, will be whether Rule 8 was violated at all."
1985.84-744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,984.554,987.164,"Let's assume it was, or is."
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,987.164,1010.702,"Well, the... I think that the District Court's determination that there was no prejudice would be a factor of some moment, but it would not be controlling, because at the time that the District Court makes its Rule 14 determination, that is before trial, and we would ask that the Court of Appeals would make the standard harmless error inquiry, which is on the record developed at the trial itself."
1985.84-744,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1010.702,1025.727,"Rule 14 deals... isn't that the situation where there is a proper joinder under Rule 8, but the defendant claims that there is some prejudice which entitles him to a severance even though he wouldn't be entitled to it under Rule 8?"
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1025.727,1027.178,"That's right, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.973,1039.627,Is the showing of prejudice in that context different from the showing of prejudice necessary to defeat a harmless error claim?
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1047.624,1070.27,"Well, the showing of prejudice is basically the same, but the burdens and the standards applied by the courts would be somewhat different depending on whether you are in the District Court or the Court of Appeals, and... but the generic inquiry into the sort of prejudice that can take place is the same, Your Honor."
1985.84-744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1281.891,1284.031,"I do have a question, Mr. Kuhlik."
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1307.115,1308.208,"--The latter, Justice O'Connor."
1985.84-744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1329.199,1335.024,Do you think the lower courts are in total agreement with that view?
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1335.024,1361.358,"--In my research, I have not seen a single lower court decision requiring an intent to defraud, and among the cases that we cite in our brief on Page 32 I would point specifically to the Jones and Toney cases as cases that involve lulling mailings, where this Court expressly said that no intent to lull was required--"
1985.84-744,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1361.358,1365.717,I guess we don't have to really decide that in this case.
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1365.717,1371.823,"--No, you don't, because the mailings did not... the funds had not been completely received."
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1371.823,1374.04,May I... I am sorry.
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1390.315,1400.28,"Had the father been tried alone, then Rule 8(a) would have been applicable, and Count 1 would properly have been joined with the other counts."
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.28,1404.513,How can he claim that there was claim error out of the misjoinder?
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1412.666,1415.259,To claim that there has been an error at all--
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1415.259,1416.962,That affects the judgment as to him.
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1416.962,1424.692,"--Well, certainly, as we point cut in the brief, we don't see how the judgment could possibly have... how the misjoinder could possibly have--"
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1424.692,1426.098,Misjoinder of Count 1 could have--
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1426.098,1430.362,"--Right, because he would get virtually the same trial on remand."
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1438.375,1445.918,"--I just don't even... I must confess, I have some difficulty seeing how there is any even error as to him on that... on this misjoinder as to--"
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1454.821,1457.835,"Well, there is clearly an error with respect to--"
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.835,1458.554,The son.
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1458.554,1464.677,"--the son, which would lead the Court to have to reach the harmlessness issue on which there is a conflict in the circuits."
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1466.707,1480.748,"But looking at it from the point of view of the son, if you prevail in this case and the law is as you advocate now, do you think if the same facts that were present in the McElroy case arose again, the case would be decided the same way or differently?"
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1480.748,1490.869,I think I would have to know... I certainly think that the Court would undertake a more complete harmless error inquiry than it professed to do in McElroy itself.
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1490.869,1492.368,"Who didn't do any, in fact."
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1492.368,1493.618,"Well, I think it--"
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.618,1495.226,It just said that misjoinder is obviously prejudicial.
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1495.226,1501.584,"--Well, I think saying that it was obviously prejudicial was a truncated means of saying that the error was not harmless."
1985.84-744,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1501.584,1510.064,But the reason it was obviously prejudicial is that a person who is defending his own case was being tried with somebody who had a lot of evidence of guilt as to him.
1985.84-744,0,17773,bruce_n_kuhlik,,1515.375,1527.603,"If there was a misjoined count that had nothing to do with one of the defendants, and the evidence on that count was extremely strong and prejudicial, I would fully expect the Court of Appeals might well find the error not harmless."
1985.84-744,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1536.101,1536.867,All right.
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,1541.584,1555.485,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in the beginning I would state that the government's statement of the case appears to me to be complete and accurate."
1985.84-744,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1563.371,1568.12,"Do you mean by that, Mr. Brown, that you agree that the evidence of guilt here is overwhelming?"
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,1568.12,1570.837,"--No, I do not believe that."
1985.84-744,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.822,1692.461,You said it doesn't apply to the misjoinder in this case.
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,1695.88,1698.926,"My position is exactly that, Justice White."
1985.84-744,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1706.361,1708.344,No matter what the evidence turns out to be.
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,1708.344,1709.11,--Beg pardon?
1985.84-744,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1709.11,1711.046,No matter what the evidence turns out to be.
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,1711.046,1741.066,"Yes, and the reason that I say that, Justice White, is because I believe that the rules to make proof have carefully placed the boundaries under Rule 8(b), and they have established standards, and they say beyond this standard you shall not go, and they say in effect that misjoinder is reversible."
1985.84-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.453,1864.812,What makes you think that?
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,1864.812,1875.418,I think that it is because it continues to be cited by the differing authorities throughout the land.
1985.84-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.207,1898.83,You think under the Court's decision in McElroy it is perfectly consistent with the terms of Rule 52(a).
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,1898.83,1924.679,"Yes, and let me tell you, Justice White, why I believe that, because the... because I believe that the reasoning that McElroy confronted exactly the same issues as involved in Rule 52(a), and Your Honor, I apologize."
1985.84-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1927.833,1930.223,I don't know to whom the apology is due--
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,1931.395,1935.691,"I hesitate to say, Your Honor."
1985.84-744,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1940.219,1943.483,What do you say about the Kotteakos case?
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,1943.483,1944.545,I say--
1985.84-744,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1944.545,1947.139,It has not made any dents in McElroy?
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,1947.139,1953.527,"--I say that Kotteakos... no, I do... well, let me say this."
1985.84-744,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2156.384,2157.915,When was that said?
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,2157.915,2172.736,"That was cited out of the D.C. Circuit in 1961, Your Honor, and that which I read was a direct quote from Ingram, which Your Honor cited along with Schaffer and Welch and McElroy."
1985.84-744,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2173.799,2179.968,Has McElroy been cited favorably by this Court in a Court opinion in recent times?
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,2179.968,2185.248,"--Your Honor, unfortunately, memory escapes me of the name of any."
1985.84-744,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.027,2265.777,"Mr. Brown, can I ask you a question?"
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,2290.563,2295.702,"I cannot think of any right now, Your Honor."
1985.84-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2690.73,2697.867,"Well, couldn't some of that evidence come in as the government says... pattern or practice and things like that?"
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,2697.867,2701.507,"Well, some of it might, Your Honor."
1985.84-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2712.221,2718.906,"I mean, the misjoinder rule isn't designed to prevent relevant evidence from being introduced against a defendant."
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,2718.906,2722.014,"No, I would admit to that, Your Honor."
1985.84-744,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2736.195,2737.961,That otherwise would be inadmissible.
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,2737.961,2738.522,Yes.
1985.84-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2890.352,2896.819,"Well, the government relies, counsel, on the lulling of the victim cases."
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,2896.819,2898.145,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2898.145,2911.047,"And so it seems to me that is what you have to deal with, and of course the government takes the position that merely having the effect of lulling is enough without intending to do so."
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,2911.047,2917.498,"And, of course, we join issue with the government, Your Honor, at that very point."
1985.84-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2917.498,2917.889,All right.
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,2930.822,2932.822,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2932.822,2938.085,"Did you object on that ground at the time, to those--"
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,2938.085,2938.695,We did--
1985.84-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2938.695,2940.552,--instructions for that reason?
1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,2940.552,2947.58,"--Your Honor, that objection does not find its way into this record to the best of my--"

1985.84-744,1,18529,clifford_w_brown,,2948.752,2949.393,--to the best of my knowledge.
1985.84-744,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2949.393,2960.763,"And you really didn't raise any question here, did you, in your cross petition with regard to the sufficiency of the instructions to the jury."
