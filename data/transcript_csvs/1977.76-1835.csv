1977.76-1835,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.751,"We'll hear arguments next in 1835, Slodov against United States."
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,11.019,14.32,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1835,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,57.233,67.457,"At anytime after he took over did he ever have control its funds, when any fund for the purposes involved in this case?"
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,67.457,75.496,"So far as the petitioner is concerned the petitioner slowed off, came into no funds when he took over the corporation."
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,84.305,91.649,But did have -- that the company has some gross income that was subject to liability for the tax?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,91.649,94.149,At that time even at the time --
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,94.149,97.321,"Time when he took over, did the corporation has some gross income?"
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,97.321,99.1,Corporation had gross income that was correct.
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,99.1,101.843,Which was subject to the tax liability?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,101.843,102.393,No.
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,107.956,110.448,There was a decision to face and build besides the tax?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,110.448,111.714,That's correct.
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,116.309,119.792,And he could have applied that money to the tax instead of some other liability?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,119.792,120.771,He could have.
1977.76-1835,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,121.956,130.715,"Let me ask in another way, these funds are not available at that time were not encumbered otherwise?"
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,130.715,149.735,The funds which came into the corporation after the petitioner took over were not encumbered expect for the fact that the corporation and the fact so indicates was required to pay COD for any inventory which it had purchased which incidentally gave rise to the gross income of the corporation.
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,161.204,166.309,"Had a lien matured, a tax lien matured --"
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,166.309,170.639,I am not aware whether a text lien had been placed upon the assets of the corporation.
1977.76-1835,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,173.281,180.229,Then I take it that there was some net income realized too?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,180.229,181.962,I do not believe there was any net income.
1977.76-1835,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,199.064,210.722,Then I take it your answer to one of the earlier questions is that he did not give first priority to the hold withholding taxes because he had to pay COD for everything?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,210.722,224.354,"It is part of our argument, yes Your Honor, but it is also part of our argument that there was no obligation on anyone's part to give priority to those payments of taxes out of funds which were acquired by the corporation at a later date."
1977.76-1835,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,272.057,276.659,"What kind of an account, you said all the bank accounts were drawn to zero."
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,276.659,279.48,"Overdrawn, overdrawn."
1977.76-1835,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,279.48,284.419,Was there a segregated account for these funds at anytime prior to his take over?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,284.419,289.181,"So far as the record shows no funds had ever been segregated, which had been withheld or collected --"
1977.76-1835,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,289.181,293.743,In other words they took the money from the employees and just put it into general revenues of the corporation?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,293.743,294.408,That is correct.
1977.76-1835,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,299.084,301.353,"Well, how long a period did that go on?"
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,301.353,312.625,Well this went on for a quite a period although the taxes with which we are involved here are the few quarters before the time that Dr. Slodov took over.
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,312.625,314.169,Letter was filed (Inaudible)
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,314.169,318.546,There were no funds available and that is clear from all of the evidence the court found.
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,383.685,396.765,"Mr. Kleinman, do you concede that Mr. Slodov -- Dr. Slodov during the period of his control of the corporation which were few months in 1969 was such a person?"
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,396.765,397.039,Yes.
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.351,411.729,But you concede that.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,411.729,412.516,We concede.
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,412.516,418.128,-- during the time that he was in control of the corporation he was the kind -- the person described in 6672?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,418.128,419.624,Correct.
1977.76-1835,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,461.584,468.796,"Now the interpretation you have just given, the distinction between and/or is the distinction the Fifth Circuit made."
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,468.796,470.877,Fifth Circuit like wise made the same distinction.
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,505.97,515.708,Then the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit went on to explain the difference between this case and the Fifth Circuit case in terms of whether or not they were after acquired assets.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,515.708,518.318,The Fifth Circuit didn't reach that point and specifically said that they don't --
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,518.318,519.589,I am talking about what the Sixth Circuit --
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,519.589,548.961,"The Sixth Circuit said -- the Sixth Circuit said, as I understand there decision that when funds came in afterwards not collected or withheld, but as in this case from wending machines, from catering fees, from whatever the gross income was that some how a trust was engrafted upon those funds, so that his violation of those requirements to hold those funds or pay them over to the government somehow made them -- made him liable, that is this petitioner liable for those taxes."
1977.76-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,746.704,753.62,"Mr. Kleinman, if I understand the government's theory correctly, every dollar that came in after the takeover would have been impressed with this trust."
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,761.093,763.985,"I understand that to be government's position, not only couldn't you pay --"
1977.76-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,763.985,771.887,"If this record show whether they ever objected, they were aware what was going on I guess, did they ever object to paying ordinary expenses of operations during the period."
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,771.887,827.061,"No, as a matter of fact as far as the record shows and I think the findings were that they permitted the corporation to continue to do business; permitted, in fact insisted that they pay not only the salaries and other debts but these withholding taxes as well, and in fact had the government not done that, had they insisted, had internal revenue insisted and said, look every dollar that comes in from here on has to be applied to the old taxes that have been due before, the corporation would have seized functioning and as a matter of fact the internal service would have been further behind the ball than they were because there would have been no more money coming in out of which they could get any money and they did get paid every single dollar of withholding taxes for which this petitioner was responsible, from the day he took over until the corporation went into bankruptcy six months later, every dollar that was owed the Internal Revenue Service for withholding and social security tax was religiously accounted for and paid."
1977.76-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,827.061,832.436,Does the record show whether they made any effort to collect from prior individual officers of the corporation?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,832.436,839.4,"The record is not clear and so far as we know, they have not at least been persistent in attempting to collect."
1977.76-1835,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,942.064,948.42,I take it the net of your argument is no matter how the Sotelo case comes out your case is a different kind of a case?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,948.42,952.976,"Well it deals with the same sections of the law, but it is a different case, that's true, our --"
1977.76-1835,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,952.976,954.166,Factually different?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,954.166,954.452,Pardon?
1977.76-1835,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,954.452,957.031,Factually different?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,957.031,957.798,"Factually different, yes."
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,957.798,963.82,"Mr. Kleinman, you certainly inferred I suppose the Sotelo could win and IRS could lose and you could win?"
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,963.82,966.387,"Oh yes, yes."
1977.76-1835,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,978.231,978.416,So.
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,978.416,980.337,And when the so called trust fund was paid out.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,980.337,982.068,"And when the trust fund was paid out, that is correct."
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,982.068,985.336,"It is quite a different issue, the Sotelo case involves whether or not something is discharged."
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,985.336,987.177,Discharged under Bank -- that is correct.
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,987.177,988.103,This doesn't involve the Bankruptcy --
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,988.103,989.477,Now it's a completely different issue.
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.518,1004.945,Whether he is liable at all?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1004.945,1010.876,"Whether he is liable in the first instance for those taxes which are already been collected, already been dissipated."
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1010.876,1013.601,And that issue was ? that wasn't being argued in Sotelo.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1013.601,1015.223,"That wasn't argued in Sotelo, no."
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1015.223,1018.634,"What was the Metropolis Industries, is that involved here?"
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1018.634,1021.263,"Metropolis Industries may have been one of the creditors, I am not sure."
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1021.263,1025.442,I will find that -- there were three corporations here.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1025.442,1036.141,"Well yes, I might point out that the three corporations were joined as one, because the issues were same as to all three, there happened to be three separate corporations all of which were controlled by Doctor Soldov."
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1036.141,1041.114,But that's about the Metropolis Industries thing coming up that's not --
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1041.114,1044.096,I don't think it's relevant.
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.049,1084.519,"What if when he came in the company, the company's bank accounts were in d order and the so called trust trend was intact?"
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1084.519,1093.41,Then his obligation if the Court please would be under the provisions of the general trust law that there was a trust fund over which he took control and now he dissipated.
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1103.742,1110.294,"It is a disjunctive between the collect and the accounting and paying over, it is an or, it does say or --"
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1110.294,1125.799,"Once you have determined the responsible officer then when he fails to perform any one those acts, he is liable, but to hold him as a responsible officer the statute says, any person required to collect, truthfully account for and pay over."
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.799,1128.459,"Swell, I know, it says, collect or."
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1128.459,1139.508,"No, it says, or who fails to collect, truthfully account for or paid, but we are talking about whether he is the person that they are referring to."
1977.76-1835,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1174.154,1176.551,Such person is the word the statute uses.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1176.551,1193.721,"Any person required to collect, truthfully account for and pay over, I am reading from the statute, any tax imposed by this title, willfully fails to collect such tax, or truthfully account for and pay over such tax."
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1284.531,1287.156,No but you would say even if the money was there?
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1287.156,1290.093,"No, I am saying he could be liable but not under 6672."
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1290.093,1293.51,I know but that's what I mean under I mean the statute he would not be liable.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1293.51,1296.289,"Would not be liable, under the statute, under 6672."
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.289,1300.43,Even if he had the money in the bank when he came in and dissipated himself.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1300.43,1302.857,He would not be liable under 6672.
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1302.857,1305.443,"But the liability would be what, under 7501?"
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1305.443,1308.886,"Possibly 7501 more than likely general trust provisions, Your Honor."
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1308.886,1310.136,The combination of the two.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1310.136,1310.765,Combination of the two.
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1310.765,1312.574,7501 says it is a trust and then trust law.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1312.574,1316.659,"It says it is a trust, but it's the trust in the hands of the employer."
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1319.878,1329.127,"I know but in answer to let's stick with my brother White's question, you concede that the new comer would be liable if the funds were there but you say not under --"
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1329.127,1331.215,If they were there and he dis.
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1331.215,1332.686,Not dissipated.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1332.686,1334.087,"If they were there, he would be liable."
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1334.087,1340.947,"But not under 6672 you insist and my question was would that be then under 7501 and you say, well may be."
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1340.947,1344.962,The only other provision that could be was 7501 and I would concede that there is an argument to be made.
1977.76-1835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1344.962,1350.949,"7501 which calls it a trust fund and then you import general principles of trust laws, right?"
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1350.949,1354.177,"Right that's correct, that's true."
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1436.831,1448.987,"When your client came into the company was he a person who at that very moment, was he from then on was he required to collect taxes?"
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1448.987,1454.803,"Yes, he was a we concede he was the person required to collect, account for and pay over the taxes."
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1454.803,1457.39,So he satisfies that for sentence of the.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1457.39,1459.289,"From then on, are we speaking now."
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1460.513,1462.181,But as of that time he does satisfy.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1462.181,1466.823,"Correct, we concede that he was a responsible officer from and after the day he took over the responsible."
1977.76-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.823,1471.48,And after that he does any one of the things.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1471.48,1474.711,"As to which tax Your Honor, the government seeks to mix up these taxes."
1977.76-1835,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1481.214,1483.107,And then you rely on the word such tax.
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1483.107,1487.473,"Such tax, the tax he is required to collect the withheld, such tax."
1977.76-1835,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1543.637,1545.34,If you wish to save any time for rebuttal --
1977.76-1835,0,17780,bennet_kleinman,,1545.34,1545.899,Yes I do.
1977.76-1835,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1545.899,1556.165,-- you can do that.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1579.082,1581.052,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1835,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1589.205,1596.591,"Then if you would at some point pursue whether there is an obligation on the part of the government to pursue them, you don't need the record for that purpose?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1596.591,1616.377,Well the government takes the position Your Honor as was stated in the Sotelo argument this morning that it never will collect more than a 100% of the taxes due and thus the government would not go after the predecessor and the successor and try to get more than 100%.
1977.76-1835,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.254,1629.026,"Well isn't there -- if there is any default here, are they not the primary defaulters?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1629.026,1654.895,"As between the predecessor and the successor they maybe as matter of private law between those parties, but we will say that under the internal revenue code each is liable to the government and the government like any creditor who has two debtors liable for the same debt can take its choice I should think as to which one to go after first, so long is it does not collect more than the total from both of them."
1977.76-1835,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1710.935,1715.149,What significance should we attach to that?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1715.149,1720.333,"Well, simply that it makes quite clear that he knew of the liability and thus it could not be suggested --"
1977.76-1835,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1720.333,1721.257,Of the corporation?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1721.257,1723.73,"-- of the corporation's liability, yes."
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.575,1727.239,Mr. Barnett what was his duty at that point?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1727.239,1734.869,Well his duty at that point and thereafter was when the corporation came into funds --
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1734.869,1742.478,"Say he get a $100 check and he had a employee there or into $100 in wages, he should not have paid the employee and given all of that money to the government?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1742.478,1745.482,It isn't a question of a $100 --
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1745.482,1748.755,"Every cent that came in should have immediately been turned over to the government, is that your position?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1748.755,1751.423,That was his statutory liability before --
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.423,1753.471,Did the government ever assert that position to him?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1753.471,1756.067,No the government didn't assert that position to him.
1977.76-1835,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1807.916,1814.352,"Placing him in A terrible dilemma, if you let him go along and he goes under bankruptcy then you are sticky?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1814.352,1815.906,Yes.
1977.76-1835,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1832.698,1835.574,Well then it is your position that he should liquidate immediately?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1835.574,1838.656,"Well, that is his statutory liability."
1977.76-1835,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1840.914,1842.747,Hobson choice you have given --
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1842.747,1845.279,"Well, in a sense it's a Hobson's choice."
1977.76-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1860.746,1888.155,"So was the revenue service as you describe it in its flexible position wasn't it Mr. Burnett that if they did bail this thing out which was a real looser at the time the petitioner took over, the government would eventually get all of its tax money, so it has the same incentive as lots of creditors do to have let him try to hang in there and pull the thing out."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1888.155,1897.176,"Well that is true, but it is not asserted there that was any agreement on the part of the government that if you carry the business on we will absolve you of the statutory --"
1977.76-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1897.176,1904.063,"But under your theory it didn't take an agreement, he was under an immediate duty that liquidate under the statute."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1904.063,1910.765,"Well, as soon as he had money available that would have paid the government he was under the duty to pay the government first and if that required litigation --"
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1910.765,1916.757,"Mr. Barnett why do you say as soon as he had money available, I take it that you mean as soon as the corporation had money available."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1916.757,1917.48,Yes.
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1917.48,1919.512,Why does that affect his personal liability?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1931.21,1934.079,Because he is liable only for a willful failure you to do that.
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1934.648,1936.26,"Well, if he established he knew about it?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1936.26,1941.016,"Yes, but a willful failure means that you prefer other creditors --"
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1941.016,1944.099,there is nothing about preferring other creditors in word willful as I understand --
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1944.099,1949.006,"Well, the cases are clear on the meaning of willful that it means you have to have a choice, you --"
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1949.006,1951.361,But he had a choice he had personal assets he could have used.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1951.361,1951.985,"Oh, no!"
1977.76-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.252,1955.557,Why if it's a personal liability --
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1955.557,1957.344,The statute doesn't say that.
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.344,1959.249,"Yes, but there has to some failure."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1975.299,1976.556,That's right it is after all a corporate tax.
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.556,1979.098,At the time he has to go -- he has to be --
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1979.098,1982.172,"But Mr. Barnett this was a corporation with substantial assets, was it not?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1982.172,1982.861,Yes.
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1982.861,1990.517,"Fixed \assets and he had the wherewithal to liquidate and pay that debt right away, he didn't have to wait for incoming receipts, did he?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1990.517,1991.862,The record doesn't indicate that.
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1993.364,1998.217,"Generate income of $130,000 a month wasn't it and you say there were no assets to do that."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,1998.217,2000.022,I don't know the record doesn't indicate it.
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2017.35,2020.012,Mr. Barnett when did he become liable for this?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2020.012,2028.057,He became liable when the corporation obtained sufficient funds that would have paid the tax liability and he decided not to use them for that purpose.
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2028.057,2030.195,"Well, why wasn't he liable when he first took over?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2030.195,2033.421,Because the corporation at that point did not have sufficient funds to pay the taxes --
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2033.421,2036.126,How much funds are there now ?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2036.126,2038.662,"The bankrupt now, I assume it has none."
1977.76-1835,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2038.662,2040.583,What you are saying is --
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2040.583,2044.483,I don't see the difference expect that he gets caught.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2049.9,2055.552,"Well, we couldn't have said that he must put it up out of his money at that point, but once he had corporate money available --"
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2055.552,2059.509,And his money got involved when corporation went bankrupt.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2059.509,2063.565,When the corporation went bankrupt he becomes liable under 6672 ?
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2063.565,2064.437,Automatically.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2064.437,2078.936,-- because he was the person in control of the corporation who willfully failed to have the corporation pay its taxes and he did that by having the corporation use the corporate funds and prefer other creditors over the government with those funds.
1977.76-1835,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2078.936,2093.918,"Now are you saying that the first $177,000, the amount that's involved here, it came into the corporation after the the moment of his take over, had to be formal right to the government."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2093.918,2096.483,"Technically as matter of statutory liability, yes."
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2103.112,2112.457,"If you say it is his risk, if he uses for something else even with -- even though the United States stands aside and lets him do it, if he uses for something else that's his risk."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2112.457,2114.075,Yes and the cases are clear on that.
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.796,2154.344,Well that might be and the other.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2154.344,2155.272,"-- and so forth, there are others."
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2155.272,2162.999,Your friend might agree with you expect that his position is that he never does become liable under this particular statutory section --
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2162.999,2163.673,"Yes, well that --"
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.673,2167.524,"You pay any tax that had accrued prior to that time, you haven't addressed that?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2167.524,2172.593,"No I haven't had an opportunity to Mr. Justice White, I'll try to now."
1977.76-1835,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2219.297,2223.068,He concedes that he was required to do all three things once he became in control of --
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2223.068,2226.167,With respect to taxes that accrued after he came into control --
1977.76-1835,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2226.167,2234.646,Thereafter but he simply is not a person identified in 6672 with respect to taxes that were collected before he took over.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2234.646,2235.127,Yes.
1977.76-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.984,2360.348,"Even if you are right as to your generic interpretation of any tax imposed by this title and the first clause of Section 6672 that still doesn't answer your opponent's contention that the phrasing is in the conjunctive, that before that liability was imposed on him, he has to be are required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2360.348,2362.209,I think it does answer that Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2379.732,2381.626,But he couldn't do all three?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2381.626,2386.364,Well that goes back to the other point and whether he used to be --
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2386.364,2389.359,"He couldn't do all three, he couldn't collect?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2389.359,2390.649,"Well, he could collect withholding."
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2390.649,2392.906,He can collect the tax withhold --
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2392.906,2399.516,"Well, if you read it as tax withholding taxes, our reading is that it means withholding taxes continually."
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2399.516,2402.974,Didn't he pay all from the time he took over?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2404.173,2408.358,"He paid most of those, the record appears to indicate, but our argument --"
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2408.358,2413.934,He did not collect anything that he didn't pay over.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2413.934,2414.394,All right!
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2414.656,2415.513,Is that correct?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2415.513,2417.999,That is correct if you read tax as the particular dollar.
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2417.999,2421.143,"No, no (Voice Overlap) as a fact."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2421.143,2421.631,He did not --
1977.76-1835,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2421.631,2423.126,(Inaudible)
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2423.126,2423.536,Yes.
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2423.746,2427.824,"And whatever he collected as taxes, he paid over."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2427.824,2430.721,"I think that is correct, but our reading of the statute --"
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2430.721,2435.745,And so there is no way that he can collect the other money --
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2435.745,2443.506,"There is no way that he could collect the earlier money, but the statute doesn't require that he had been in the position to collect the earlier money."
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2448.024,2449.969,I am just trying to be as technical as you are?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2449.969,2454.427,"Well we were only trying to as technical as petitioner actually, but --"
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2454.427,2455.518,It makes a lot of it --
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2455.518,2455.996,Yeah.
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2487.259,2491.831,"Mr. Barnett the word title, it just occurred to me, doesn't have to refer the whole Internal Revenue Code?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2491.831,2492.675,Yes.
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2492.675,2494.475,"Well, that would include corporate income I suppose?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2494.475,2494.864,"Oh, yes!"
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2499.792,2503.926,You mean the treasury of the corporation isn't required to collect and pay over the corporation's income tax?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2503.926,2508.408,I don't think it's required by the Internal Revenue Code to collect the tax from the corporation.
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2508.408,2511.922,"It just occurred to me, it seems to me your reading would impose personal liability on the officer --"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2511.922,2519.545,"Well if it -- I don't think there is that requirement to collect, but if it would we will take the same position that he is the person required to --"
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2519.545,2527.325,"But from whom was Doctor Slodov required to collect a tax for the past period before January 31, 1969."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2527.325,2531.928,"No one for the past period, but we do not agree that this refers to the past period."
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.421,2591.195,"His answer to that is that if he is collected and accounted for it he has an ongoing obligation to be sure it is paid, so there is an obligation on him."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2591.195,2593.869,"Well, yes, but his answer is I am afraid -- he is not correct."
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2596.253,2598.059,"Tiffany, Teal and Tiffany."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2598.059,2599.587,And we read them differently.
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2601.026,2604.008,The cases say you could certainly -- you could read the statute the way you want --
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2604.008,2607.54,"Well, but those positions say -- those cases, particularly Teal and Tiffany --"
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.54,2615.604,"And I feel sure if the government had that problem with the person, say, you had the predecessor before you, I am sure the government would be asserted that the predecessor had an obligation to."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2615.604,2635.015,"Well, yes and Teal and Tiffany so hold, but our position is that supports our argument because the only basis on which they could so hold the only basis on which the predecessor can be held liable when in fact he was not around at the time of paying over must be that our interpretation of the statute is correct otherwise those cases would have to be decided differently."
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.152,2695.792,Now his argument is that specifically he was required to be sure the taxes which he had collected and accounted for got paid?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2695.792,2697.735,But unfortunately we see no support for that.
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2699.159,2704.18,But I am saying as your the interpretation isn't a necessary one to reach the contrary --
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2704.18,2705.584,"Well, I think it perhaps is."
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2711.592,2714.022,(Voice Overlap) law you are again talking about successor.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2723.371,2729.138,How is he require to pay over when the time that those taxes are required to be paid over has not yet come?
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.138,2731.405,Well --
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2731.405,2732.86,You see we think that the --
1977.76-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2732.86,2737.371,The time of payment is one thing the liability for making sure that there is a payment is another thing.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2737.904,2753.765,"Well, that might be a nice liberalization of the statute, but we think that on petitioner's reading all three requirements did not converge in the case of the predecessors there and yet they were held liable under the Internal Revenue Code, not under some trust law."
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2753.765,2755.979,You are talking about the clear language of the code.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2762.521,2763.274,"Well, yes."
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2763.274,2764.227,Isn't that right?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2764.227,2766.898,"Yes, but not in respect to particular dollars."
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2766.898,2768.529,"Well, I mean that's what they were talking about --"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2768.529,2770.338,"No, no I must disagree."
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2777.525,2801.491,"So if you have a corporation where one man is in this responsible position, he takes all the money and instead of putting it in the banks, the corporation's bank account, he puts it in his bank account and then he is succeeded by another man and you know this fact and you go after the second man and don't even look at the first man, is that what the statute envisioned?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2801.491,2802.649,"Well, we are assuming that --"
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2802.649,2804.321,Is that what the statute envisioned?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2804.321,2809.302,"No, you are assuming that the second man has funds available, has corporate funds available, to pay the taxes."
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2809.302,2811.03,"No, he has money in his own bank account."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2811.03,2812.382,"No, it has to be corporate funds."
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2816.092,2820.385,"Well and then the company goes broke bankrupt, can you go after this man?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2820.385,2826.062,What if he diverted corporate funds to creditors other than the United States knowing of the obligation to the United States --
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2826.062,2830.117,The second man did not misappropriate any funds.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2830.117,2833.513,But he did divert corporate funds to other creditors.
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2833.513,2834.002,"No, no."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2834.002,2835.1,Then he did not willfully fail.
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2835.1,2837.039,(Inaudible) what was done right here.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2837.039,2837.397,No.
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2841.366,2842.117,That's right.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2842.117,2843.57,And here the corporation was getting --
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2843.57,2848.084,So far as we know somebody stole this money.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2848.084,2848.681,"Well, that maybe."
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2848.681,2850.808,And instead of trying to find that out you just take --
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2850.808,2855.442,We have no evidence in the record Mr. Justice Marshall in the case so we did not try to find that out.
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2855.442,2859.51,The only thing that happened to the record as you found one person that had no money to pay it.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2859.51,2861.395,We don't know we didn't try to find the other guy.
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2861.395,2864.32,The only thing your record shows is that you have one man that could pay.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2864.32,2865.561,We don't know that he can pay it.
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2866.304,2870.549,Well you found one man that you could try to collect from.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2870.549,2873.257,"Yes, but we're doing it on the basis that the corporation --"
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2873.257,2874.685,(Inaudible) Congressman.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2874.685,2874.99,Yes.
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2899.371,2901.361,Because he couldn't get credit?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2901.361,2902.93,"We don't why it is, the record does not indicate --"
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2902.93,2905.515,I said he was paying the COD that's what the petitioner says --
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2905.515,2922.917,"Well the record doesn't indicate why that loan was paid, but as those cases indicate the cases are clear that the fact that you might have to go out of business if you don't pay the debt to the government is not an excuse for liability under the statute."
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2922.917,2931.025,"The petitioner is not complaining about going out of business or the bankruptcy, he is complaining about you putting your hand in his pocket."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2931.025,2941.638,"Because he when in control of the corporation and when the corporation had money available that would have paid the government decided to pay other people instead, that is why."
1977.76-1835,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2941.638,2992.564,"Mr. Barnett you said a little while ago as understood you that the case had to be decided on the language of the statute and I think we all agree with that, that Section 7501, oh you said not on trust law, the Section 7501 and you and others have to guess that the (Inaudible) amount of taxes collected is to be held in special trust fund and one of the problems with your case is that trust fund was dissipated, there was no reece left at the time of acquisition of this corporation and I am not familiar with any trust law that requires that where the trustee had dissipated the funds of trust someone who is not party to that to restore them, I see no language in the code that imposes that obligation."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,2992.564,3011.131,"Well, Mr. Justice Powell one thing we don't think we have to relay on 7501 since the language of 6672 is clear, but in addition it is not the case as petitioner claims that there is no law that supports the notion that the trust still exists even though the money has been dissipated."
1977.76-1835,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3048.837,3055.799,"The bankruptcy judge found here that no reece existed, is there anything in the record that suggests the contrary."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3055.799,3058.85,"Well, that's a conclusion of law I would suggest."
1977.76-1835,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3060.147,3068.818,"Also it's a matter of fact, isn't it because there was nothing as of the date of take over, that could be identified as a reece of the statutory trust?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3068.818,3076.393,Now there is no requirement under section 7501 of segregation that the employer segregate the money being withheld.
1977.76-1835,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3077.066,3083.929,You would not construe the language requiring that the funds be held in a special trust to require segregation?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3083.929,3086.438,Apparently it has not been so construed but I --
1977.76-1835,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3086.438,3089.073,Our corporate officer would certainly view it that way?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3089.073,3093.993,"Well, I was too a corporate officer, but apparently the legal authorities have not viewed it that way."
1977.76-1835,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3093.993,3095.197,Yes.
1977.76-1835,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3095.197,3106.927,"And there -- I think it there is no criminal statute anywhere that imposes criminal sanctions for failure to -- trust funds, is there?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3106.927,3107.764,Well I don't know.
1977.76-1835,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3111.436,3114.924,Applicable to this petitioner or to the --
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3114.924,3121.101,"Well, it's a counterpart to 6672, it might be applicable here, but the government did not proceed under criminal statute of course."
1977.76-1835,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3143.994,3149.654,Isn't there when there is specific crime for not paying over withholding taxes?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3149.654,3156.63,That's 7202 which is the criminal counterpart of 6672.
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.161,3172.634,"Mr. Barnett just to make clear, the government in this situation like this isn't helpless I take it?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3172.634,3174.795,"Well, I think it would be rather helpless under petitioner's --"
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.795,3186.762,"Well, I know, but let's assume that -- let's assume the government knew what was happening and that the withholding taxes hadn't been paid and here comes a new man on the horizon."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3191.451,3196.741,"Well, lien had accrued, I am talking --"
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3196.741,3199.692,If it hadn't the government could easily have perfected it.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3199.692,3200.78,Yes I think that's true.
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3200.78,3203.664,With respect to any of the assets of the corporation?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3203.664,3204.734,I assume that's true.
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.734,3214.423,So that was in position to tell the company -- tell the company and I know if you are as money comes in you pay it over because we have a lien on these things you have got.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3214.423,3216.251,"Yes, but exercising (Voice Overlap)"
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.251,3216.797,I know but.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3216.797,3218.124,-- prefer to see the corporation --
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3218.124,3221.732,All I am saying is -- all I am saying is they can protect themselves.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3221.732,3223.702,Well they could protect themselves.
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3223.702,3226.635,"First 1770000, they could get if they wanted to."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3226.635,3227.048,Yes.
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3227.048,3228.178,And they could take some risk.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3235.436,3251.037,"Well, yes that's what they do in practice or what they apparently did here, but they made no agreement here it is not asserted here that they made any agreement that they would not -- that they would absolve the petitioner of the liability for this if the petitioner --"
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3251.037,3258.156,They certainly if they had lien or could it had it they certainly didn't assert it with respect to certain moneys.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3263.424,3263.834,"Well, that's."
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3263.834,3270.426,Now you are saying well that money they paid out the risk didn't turn out and we are going to collect it from the man himself.
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3270.426,3275.551,"Well that's right and that's what Congress had in mind here, because otherwise there would be."
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3275.551,3279.545,"Well, that's a question -- the question is whether that's one thing had in mind or not?"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3279.545,3286.52,And that the fact that the government takes a risk in a situation like this doesn't mean that 6672 liability doesn't not apply --
1977.76-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3286.52,3296.386,"Of course in your view the government really isn't taking a risk, because if the corporation succeeds, it gets it from the corporation and if the corporation fails it gets it from the person --"
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3296.386,3299.976,There is no reason to think that it can't get it from the person in charge after all.
1977.76-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3299.976,3303.723,If the person in charge doesn't have it then it's only to that extent --
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3303.723,3311.107,Yes and one might well assume that the government would have a better chance to get it from those first bills that came into the corporation and from the individual.
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3311.107,3317.959,"Well, can't you concede that it shouldn't be interpreted that failure to pay over it's a government says you'll go ahead we are waving around lien pay it to somebody else."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3317.959,3321.643,"The government did not, he doesn't claim to the government made any such express agreement here."
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3321.643,3323.196,Suppose it did?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3323.196,3326.819,I think that will be different case if it were claimed that the government had.
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3326.819,3336.084,"I call up the government -- they call at the government on the telephone, the government on the telephone, the IRS says here is our situation and the government says we got a lien on a every dollar you get."
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3348.503,3351.05,Without that's simply is not claimed to be the fact here Mr. Justice --
1977.76-1835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3351.05,3352.246,If it were what would you say?
1977.76-1835,1,20580,deputy_solicitor_general_barnett,,3352.246,3357.499,I think that will be an interesting case in the estoppel of government and well the government can be equitably estopped.
1977.76-1835,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3359.78,3361.763,You have nay thing further Mr. Kleinman?
1977.76-1835,2,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3361.763,3375.244,"If the Court please, in terms of analysis of the Section the individual petitioner or the party being charge its charge with such tax."
1977.76-1835,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3456.39,3459.068,The funds were available because they had withheld them from the employees.
1977.76-1835,2,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3459.068,3461.509,But they no they were to be in the bank.
1977.76-1835,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3461.509,3465.636,"No, no, but after he came on he continue to withhold."
1977.76-1835,2,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3465.636,3467.874,I am not talking about that withholding.
1977.76-1835,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3509.23,3515.817,I think you opponent would answer you before and after cases well as this one by emphasizing the word willfully in the statute.
1977.76-1835,2,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3515.817,3518.854,"Well, willfully he could have paid it, he could have paid the money."
1977.76-1835,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3518.854,3522.512,But on your after situation we didn't know what happen later it could be willfully.
1977.76-1835,2,17780,bennet_kleinman,,3522.512,3524.887,Now but the willful point is if you knew the tax was liable.
1977.76-1835,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3550.621,3552.204,Thank you gentleman the case is submitted.
