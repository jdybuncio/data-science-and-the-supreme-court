2010.09-9000,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.337,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-9000, Skinner v. Switzer."
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,9.189,12.141,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-9000,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,53.135,66.542,"May I ask you about -- Wilkinson was parole, parole eligibility, so it didn't touch the conviction or the sentence, where this one does."
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,69.81,93.224,"Justice Ginsburg, the reason that we argue our case does not touch the conviction is that the relief that we are seeking, access to the evidence for testing, if we won, if we win in district court and we get that access, it does not necessarily imply -- which is the language this Court used in Heck and repeated in Dotson -- that the conviction is lawfully invalid."
2010.09-9000,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,93.224,116.487,"I understand that argument, but there is the distinction of the type of case of where the -- the one, conviction and sentence were never going to be questioned, only parole eligibility, where here, the discovery that you seek in 1983 is not a destination."
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,121.641,122.557,"That's true, Your Honor."
2010.09-9000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,164.534,178.607,"It does seem odd, though -- and I don't want to jump into your argument too much, because you have got planned out what you want to tell us -- it does seem odd that if your suit for DNA testing is not attack -- an attack on the sentence, that you asked for a stay."
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,190.232,210.829,"I think it's an irony -- I -- I accept the Court's point that that -- that that seems unusual, but I think that the reason that the Court's cases, at least as to the relief that we're seeking and not the stay that the Court entered in order to hear this case and decide the question, that the relief we are seeking does not necessarily imply the legal and validity--"
2010.09-9000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,210.829,213.597,"Well, we don't grant a stay in order to decide a question."
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,225.588,226.205,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.09-9000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,248.168,250.537,"If that's all it means, we shouldn't have granted a stay."
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,250.537,264.344,"I don't -- I don't think so, Your Honor, because I think once we had demonstrated that we were likely to prevail on the merits of the case, I think the Court was within, you know, appropriate judgment to -- to make sure that the case didn't become moot by Mr. Skinner's execution."
2010.09-9000,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,278.871,291.947,But that disconnects the irreparable harm alleged with respect to a stay and your claim that you now say -- you say now that your claim is not going to necessarily affect the -- the sentence.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,306.04,317.229,"Your Honor, I -- I guess I don't have a better answer than the one I gave Justice Kennedy, and that is: I think the stay standard doesn't have to link those two things."
2010.09-9000,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,327.287,334.607,"In the real world, a prisoner who wants access to DNA evidence is interested in overturning his conviction."
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,334.607,335.107,Absolutely.
2010.09-9000,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,335.107,335.757,Do you deny that?
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,335.757,336.226,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-9000,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,336.226,348.2,And isn't the emergence of the Rooker-Feldman argument in this case an illustration of the absurdities that pursuing the 1983 path produces?
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,351.818,352.552,No.
2010.09-9000,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,352.552,354.27,It's not subject to Rooker-Feldman?
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,354.27,355.654,"No, it's not subject to those, Your Honor."
2010.09-9000,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,355.654,359.758,"But since you've squeezed this into 1983, now have you to deal with both of those issues."
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,359.758,382.422,"I think that the -- the reason that -- I think the reason the Rooker-Feldman issue has arisen at this juncture in the case is that the pleadings in the district court were not permitted to -- because of the sort of -- the fact that we were dismissed at a very early stage in the process, essentially on the threshold of the case, there was no opportunity to develop in full what the legal arguments are for both sides."
2010.09-9000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,382.422,404.37,"Except that at page 18 of the yellow brief, where you did have time to explain your doctrine, you say a Federal constitutional issue arose only because the Court of Criminal Appeals' decision regarding the State law issue turned out to be so arbitrary and unreasonable as to denying Mr. Skinner's Federal due process rights -- correct me if I am wrong, but I think--"
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,404.37,405.287,"No, that's correct."
2010.09-9000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,405.287,406.353,--I thought that's Rooker-Feldman to a tee.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,407.505,412.893,"No, I think, Your Honor, that's -- I -- I don't agree about the Court's reading of Rooker-Feldman if you think that -- if the Court believes that that would preclude it."
2010.09-9000,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,464.909,467.778,"Mr. Owen, as I read -- as I read -- I'm sorry."
2010.09-9000,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,467.778,468.911,I'm sorry.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,472.014,492.326,"Your Honor, the rule that we are challenging is that when the Court of Criminal Appeals construed the faults provision of the Texas DNA testing statute in our case, it created a wholesale classification that said everybody who falls into Mr. Skinner's situation who did not ask for testing at trial is forever foreclosed from getting testing."
2010.09-9000,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,492.326,500.146,Could you tell me how that's different than what Alaska did in the Osborne case that we upheld their procedure?
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,504.484,506.034,I think -- I'm sorry.
2010.09-9000,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,506.034,509.352,"That if you had an opportunity to ask for it and gave it up, that you lost."
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,514.589,522.511,"I think in Texas we have -- the difference, I think, Your Honor, is the difference between a substantive due process claim, as I understand it, and a procedural due process claim."
2010.09-9000,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,556.499,561.367,Osborne expressly considered both procedural due process and substantive due process.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,561.367,571.509,"But the reason, Your Honor, as I -- as I read Osborne, that it did not reach a decision on the procedure, or it didn't -- that it rejected Osborne's procedural due process claim was because he hadn't tried at State court."
2010.09-9000,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,589.535,590.001,Are you--
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,590.001,590.535,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-9000,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,590.535,610.098,--Are you -- one of the criticisms by your adversary of your proposal to bring these actions via 1983 is a prospect that the courts will be used to collaterally attack convictions by all sorts of due process allegations concerning discovery disputes.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,616.752,619.97,"I don't agree with them, Your Honor, and for a couple of reasons."
2010.09-9000,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,675.557,682.397,The critical formulation in Heck necessarily implies -- is a little difficult.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,692.418,699.906,"I think if that word were in isolation, Your Honor, there might be more uncertainty about what ""implies"" means."
2010.09-9000,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,719.303,725.89,"Well, you -- you read ""necessarily implies"" to mean ""conclusively establishes"", right?"
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,725.89,727.509,"--Not that strong, Your Honor."
2010.09-9000,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,745.221,750.273,"So you are asking for an expansion of Heck from ""necessarily implies""--"
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,750.273,750.989,"--No, I think we are -- I think--"
2010.09-9000,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,750.989,751.958,"--to ""demonstrates""?"
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,751.958,752.625,"--No, Your Honor."
2010.09-9000,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,752.625,767.134,So if 1983 claim would not establish innocence but would still be covered by Heck.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,767.134,777.073,"I think that -- I think Edwards is an example of that, Your Honor, where -- in Edwards, the defendant, the prisoner, was suing in Federal court, alleging that, in his words,"
2010.09-9000,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,813.329,815.781,Necessarily implies or conclusively establishes?
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,815.781,822.102,"I think necessarily -- with bias, perhaps that would be conclusively established, because I think there is no harmlessness test there."
2010.09-9000,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,831.974,833.442,What would you do with the Brady violation?
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,837.98,841.115,"--For a couple of reasons, Your Honor, it is not akin to our claim."
2010.09-9000,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,886.894,890.929,"Mr. Owen, could I take you back to Rooker-Feldman with that as the premise?"
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,920.846,925.684,"--I think, Your Honor, that we are in the territory of talking about the judgment."
2010.09-9000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,951.132,954.686,I don't -- I don't understand the argument you are making.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,960.405,964.392,"--As interpreted in our case, or as construed, I think is the right -- is the better word."
2010.09-9000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,964.392,965.192,"Why ""as construed""?"
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,990.359,992.942,"I think, Your Honor, we are challenging the statute."
2010.09-9000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1002.917,1003.334,Okay.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1005.536,1006.036,"Yes, sir."
2010.09-9000,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1013.891,1020.461,I assume that this whole case focuses on paragraph 33 of your complaint; is that right?
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1020.461,1024.329,"There's been a lot -- yes, but -- I mean, I think there's been a lot of--"
2010.09-9000,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1024.329,1024.929,"What is the ""but""?"
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1024.929,1030.233,"--I think there has been a lot of discussion about the allegations in the complaint, particularly those paragraphs."
2010.09-9000,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1045.243,1057.383,"What's -- look, 33 says the District Attorney has violated my rights under the law by refusing to give me the DNA evidence, so make them do it."
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1059.333,1061.752,"That's the relief that we are asking for, Your Honor."
2010.09-9000,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1061.752,1062.452,But not the relief.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1071.893,1077.345,"I think there is the constitutionality of the statute, because that is the basis on which the DNA--"
2010.09-9000,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1077.345,1080.13,But that's why you are entitled to the relief.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1080.13,1080.916,--All right.
2010.09-9000,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1081.416,1083.451,Is there anything else in the case that you want?
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1083.451,1083.851,No.
2010.09-9000,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1085.018,1087.32,You want the DNA evidence?
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1087.32,1087.953,--That's correct.
2010.09-9000,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1108.983,1131.015,"Well, you say in -- the rest of paragraph 33 is that you want the biological evidence because by refusing to turn it over, he prevented you from gaining access to exculpatory evidence that could demonstrate he is not guilty of capital murder, which is usually what we -- what habeas corpus is for: To show you are not guilty of what you are in prison for."
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1131.015,1145.608,"I think ordinarily, Your Honor, if that -- if we knew today that this evidence in fact was exculpatory, if they had already done the testing and they mailed us a report that says it's excluded your guy, then we wouldn't file a 1983 action."
2010.09-9000,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1151.845,1154.964,"You didn't agree with what the Chief Justice just said, did you?"
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1159.332,1159.916,--No.
2010.09-9000,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1159.916,1162.118,"--I mean, would you agree with that?"
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1167.522,1168.422,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-9000,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1182.447,1183.264,I understand.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1220.906,1227.993,"I think when we are seeking access to evidence which has never been tested for testing, that could be brought under 1983."
2010.09-9000,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1244.853,1252.856,"Mr. Owen, you are putting your case into our decisions about the line between 1983 and habeas."
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1293.349,1307.926,"The whole -- I agree, Your Honor, that the whole purpose for seeking this evidence and pursuing this lawsuit is so that Mr. Skinner can have a meaningful opportunity to pursue the liberty interest he has under State law in trying to secure release based on innocence."
2010.09-9000,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1314.447,1323.353,"Could you have sought habeas, is it 1983, the exclusive relief, or could you have sought habeas relief?"
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1323.353,1333.826,"--I think, Your Honor, that since our allegation is that the Court Of Criminal Appeals decision denying us DNA testing, which is not the judgment that results in Mr. Skinner's custody, is the problem."
2010.09-9000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.53,1381.456,"Couldn't a habeas court say the conviction was invalid because of the failure to turn over this -- this DNA evidence, which was relevant to the defense and which was unconstitutionally denied?"
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1384.574,1396.216,"Your Honor, this Court has never said, as -- I know the Court's aware of this; I want to make sure I'm clear on that -- this Court has never said that it would be a constitutional basis for habeas relief if you could demonstrate that, factually, you were not guilty."
2010.09-9000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1433.753,1436.405,I'll tell you what the problem is.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1450.414,1459.77,"--I think to the extent, Your Honor, that the question goes to the opportunity that we had to raise this issue in the State court, that's a preclusion issue, and there may be preclusion issues back in the district court."
2010.09-9000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1475.13,1477.482,"But, but that would be an obstacle to habeas."
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1477.482,1478.315,Yes.
2010.09-9000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.315,1481.767,Because in habeas you would be seeking to set aside the State court judgment.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1482.384,1483.052,That's right.
2010.09-9000,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1485.302,1490.972,"That's why it's so unrealistic to handle it that way, it seems to me."
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1490.972,1495.46,"--Well, Your Honor, I think -- I'm not sure I agree that it's unrealistic."
2010.09-9000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1508.0,1523.677,"Why isn't a correct formulation of your answer to Justice Scalia to say what we are seeking is a determination that the State court's judgment, the State court's decisions, State court's order was a violation of due process?"
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1524.379,1527.664,"That's a much simpler answer, Your Honor, I will adopt that answer."
2010.09-9000,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1527.664,1528.797,--But that's Rooker.
2010.09-9000,0,40115,robert_c_owen,,1528.797,1540.305,"That's not -- no, Your Honor, I think, again, that's where we started and I'm not trying to bring us back full circle, but I think that our understanding of Rooker-Feldman is that that is not one of the things that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine prohibits."
2010.09-9000,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1551.077,1552.16,"Thank you, Mr. Owen."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1562.818,1566.837,"Good morning, Chief Justice Roberts, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-9000,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1595.289,1601.093,He says exculpatory evidence that could demonstrate that he is not guilty.
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1613.0,1622.606,"There are two points in response to that, Chief Justice Roberts, and the first is that this is the classic statement of a Brady claim."
2010.09-9000,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1637.349,1646.705,"Substantive right in Brady was to have that material at trial, so that is the substantive constitutional right."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1662.73,1669.8,--I'm not saying that legally that there isn't some difference to be made from Osborne.
2010.09-9000,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1709.961,1725.554,"To -- to -- to win a Brady claim in habeas, wouldn't you -- you have to show not just that it was withheld, but that it was, indeed, exculpatory, and could have affected the outcome of the trial."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1726.787,1728.173,--Yes.
2010.09-9000,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.576,1738.044,But he doesn't have to make that showing here.
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1754.054,1755.09,--There is some ambiguity.
2010.09-9000,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1766.214,1767.414,That's what he is going to do with it.
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1777.086,1799.769,"I disagree; with respect to the relief that he is ultimately seeking, the question is, if you are saying that the 1983 suit is simply a retrying of the article 64 proceeding, than I -- I would have to concede that article 64 does not require the same showing as habeas claims."
2010.09-9000,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1800.769,1806.589,"Well, aren't -- aren't the -- the exculpatory nature of the evidence and its materiality elements of the Brady claim itself?"
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1806.589,1820.765,"--Well, as the Court and your concurring opinion in Osborne made clear, that -- that exculpatory is really defined as demonstrating that you were innocent and that it's material."
2010.09-9000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1820.765,1828.221,I agree think that sounds like -- I would interpret his complaint is what he wants is the DNA.
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1862.009,1878.869,Justice Scalia -- Justice Scalia also makes the point at the end of his Dotson concurrence that the question -- the real question is whether you could make out this type of claim or this -- make out this type of proceeding in habeas.
2010.09-9000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.887,1896.314,"No, not whether you -- what he's worried about -- he can speak for himself but as I read the concurrence, he was worried that if you win and take 1983 away, all kinds of things will be stuffed into habeas, which don't belong there."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1929.451,1938.639,"--Because I disagree that the two words ""necessarily implies"" are in fact sort of the end of the battle and the end of the test."
2010.09-9000,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1964.772,1983.335,"Mr. Coleman, if you could answer Justice Breyer's question, because there are two phrases, necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction and necessarily spell speedier release; and either you think that your case fits one of those or both of those standards, or you are asking us to abandon that standard."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,1983.335,1985.401,--I don't think that that's true.
2010.09-9000,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2020.507,2023.909,Filed in the -- in the court of conviction?
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2023.909,2028.547,"--It's not in the court of conviction, it's under the docket number of the case."
2010.09-9000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2028.547,2043.306,"So that's a totally different area, because in Dotson when -- I think what we did do was go through every of these -- every one of the prior cases, and they did involve for the most part the attack as you say on prison procedure."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2082.281,2092.287,I think Prieser and Heck both stand for the fundamental proposition that Congress set up habeas as a means of allowing collateral attacks.
2010.09-9000,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2118.871,2121.239,But how could this be brought in habeas?
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2129.178,2134.732,"Well, the habeas petition -- we know it can be brought in habeas because one, he has already brought it."
2010.09-9000,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2184.147,2198.573,"Mr. Coleman, the habeas statute says, 2254(a), a Federal court can entertain a habeas petition only on the ground that the petitioner is in custody in violation of Federal law."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2224.39,2232.146,"Well he -- he's stood before the Court today and explained how he would write that complaint, and as I mentioned to Justice Kagan--"
2010.09-9000,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2232.146,2236.098,Why is he in custody in -- in violation of Federal law?
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2237.884,2243.168,"--Because he believed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and that he can make--"
2010.09-9000,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2243.168,2244.037,--But that's not his claim here.
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2253.309,2275.39,"--That's correct and the -- the last part of my answer to Justice Kagan I think is the answer to your question, and that is if you make out either an ineffective assistance claim or an actual innocence type claim, the congressional intent that you observe and show deference and exhaustion and all those things, require that to be given to every step of the process."
2010.09-9000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2275.39,2276.925,In the particular--
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2276.925,2326.374,"But the moment you file the complaint through discovery, through every substantive aspect of that, what Mr. Skinner wants to do is say, I want to engage in artful pleading, and so I'm going to make attacks; today they are on DNA evidence, tomorrow they may be a Brady claim, next week it may be a claim against procedures used in State habeas; but as long as I don't expressly ask that my custody be undone, I -- I expect those claims to be allowed to go forward in 1983 without any of the protections of habeas, and then -- then if it looks after a year that they are going pretty well, then I will flip it over to habeas and go forward with my habeas."
2010.09-9000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2326.374,2328.374,--I see your point.
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2435.574,2449.131,"I think the approach is if these things may be properly made the subject of a habeas corpus claim, then congressional intent and the habeas statute require that it be brought in habeas."
2010.09-9000,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2450.083,2460.105,"Then you are -- you are asking for a modification of the Wilkinson-Dotson formula, because the formula is, I think, quite clear."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2505.217,2507.733,"--I disagree with that, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-9000,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2522.827,2525.512,So you are asking for something in addition.
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2544.592,2554.798,"--I think that that is correct, in the sense that if you look at Dotson, which was -- involved a specific claim for process -- which is not what they are asking for."
2010.09-9000,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2615.604,2625.71,"Maybe -- maybe we need -- I mean, we've never had a case like this and it's conceivable to -- to me that we have to expand what we said in Heck and Prieser."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2662.752,2668.573,"--Well, as you noted in your concurrence in Dotson, the question is not whether you win, but whether you could."
2010.09-9000,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2679.929,2695.038,"Well -- well, that doesn't quite give us the added formulation that some of the questions suggest we need, if we were going to adhere to Dotson and still rule for you."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2699.875,2705.596,"--Well, I'm not sure exactly what you are angling for there."
2010.09-9000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2789.083,2803.076,"But if -- in Heck itself, you said a 1983 action, where it is, even if successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2815.3,2815.883,Well--
2010.09-9000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2815.883,2832.143,"Even though it will not demonstrate that the judgment was wrong, it still should not be allowed in 1983 if it is, quote, ""related to"" the criminal case itself."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2834.345,2835.745,--What about -- where it--
2010.09-9000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2835.745,2837.897,"Say what it is, then."
2010.09-9000,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2838.53,2845.403,What about where its only purpose is to demonstrate -- is to be able to demonstrate the invalidity of the judgment?
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2845.403,2852.14,"--Well, ultimately, the only reason it can be brought is to demonstrate the invalidity of--"
2010.09-9000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2852.14,2854.592,It's part of a process where you hope to demonstrate.
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2859.579,2866.566,"--You could bring a claim in habeas, alleging, for instance, Brady."
2010.09-9000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2866.566,2867.083,"No, no."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2885.495,2890.699,If you are alleging some underlying constitutional invalidity of your conviction and you need to--
2010.09-9000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2890.699,2896.252,Does a federal law -- is there a federal statute that -- you can't say yet whether it's invalid.
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2907.976,2916.666,"--The discovery provisions of habeas allow you to seek that as part of your habeas claim, and when you do that, all the safeguards and protections of habeas apply."
2010.09-9000,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2916.666,2931.926,"So that means FOIA requests, where your only purpose is to seek out the police files because you are hoping, just like you are in DNA testing, that those files will show exculpatory material."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2935.044,2936.328,I think FOIA is different.
2010.09-9000,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2937.311,2938.08,Where--
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2938.08,2938.596,--You can ask for it.
2010.09-9000,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2941.865,2949.119,"Well, take the case, Mr. Coleman -- I think there was one recently in the Fifth Circuit where a prisoner asked for appellate slip opinions."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2959.076,2967.932,"I don't know the specifics of that claim, but -- but I would tend to think if -- if a person generally had access to slip opinions, then--"
2010.09-9000,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2967.932,2976.788,"No, he said he didn't have enough access to slip opinions and he needed more slip opinions in order to be able to obtain a quicker release from prison via habeas."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2976.788,2978.121,--I -- I would say no.
2010.09-9000,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2979.688,2980.39,No what?
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2980.39,2984.292,--That that would not have to be brought as a habeas.
2010.09-9000,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2985.644,2986.294,Why is that different?
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,2986.294,2987.027,Excuse me?
2010.09-9000,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2987.027,2987.91,Why -- why is that different?
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3000.301,3009.675,"I think because there is no rights specific to him -- for instance, if I seek DNA evidence, it's because I want to attack my conviction."
2010.09-9000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3021.233,3021.733,The library.
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3034.356,3034.958,--That's a condition--
2010.09-9000,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3034.958,3035.875,--provided.
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3036.825,3038.327,--That's a condition -- that's just a prison condition.
2010.09-9000,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3091.895,3095.996,I -- I was going to ask if you have a few moments to address the Rooker argument.
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3101.833,3103.185,There -- there is a way.
2010.09-9000,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3215.375,3223.631,"So, then, can you give us your best modified statement of Wilkinson against Dotson?"
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3257.185,3273.278,"Well, first, I don't believe the Court has ever acknowledged the existence of a cause of action for discovery separate and apart from the merits of what you are seeking to do."
2010.09-9000,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3333.417,3334.019,So -- so the--
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3334.019,3334.519,--the way.
2010.09-9000,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3334.519,3337.136,--Justice Ginsburg's question I think is an important one.
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3346.342,3364.621,"We think given the nature of the Article 64 proceeding, which is itself an attack on the conviction, it is a request that the Court declare that the conviction is probably invalid, that because that is what he is attacking, he is saying the result that is--"
2010.09-9000,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3364.621,3365.071,"No, but just--"
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3365.071,3385.034,"--that -- that we do fit within the 64 ruling is an attack, but that within the broader context, if the Court feels a need to rule on the cases in criminal proceedings, then -- then it should recognize it should be brought in habeas."
2010.09-9000,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3385.034,3397.342,"But -- if I could have just one minute -- then if you do not file an article -- in a State court at all and you just go to 1983, you are back under Heck and you haven't given us a qualification that works under Heck."
2010.09-9000,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3397.342,3399.492,--Briefly.
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3399.492,3400.877,"Very, very briefly?"
2010.09-9000,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3426.676,3427.576,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-9000,1,25151,gregory_s_coleman,,3427.576,3428.626,"That's Dotson, not this case."
2010.09-9000,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3428.626,3433.162,"Mr. Owen, take five minutes -- or you have five minutes."
2010.09-9000,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3433.162,3445.653,"--Mr. Owen, I know I am pushing you, but I really would like a clear statement of what the procedural due process violation which you are claiming occurred here is?"
2010.09-9000,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,3445.653,3464.032,"Your Honor, our -- our claim is that in its construction of the statute in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals construed the statute to completely foreclose any prisoner who could have sought DNA testing prior to trial but did not from seeking testing under the post conviction statute."
2010.09-9000,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3464.615,3465.301,You are not--
2010.09-9000,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,3465.301,3466.051,--that speaks too broadly.
2010.09-9000,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3466.051,3467.901,--Then let me follow this through.
2010.09-9000,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,3477.006,3483.076,"Your Honor, this -- this came up as we were preparing for our presentation, and I think there's -- there's -- here's what I would like to say."
2010.09-9000,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3496.034,3498.336,We chose to construe it the way it construed it.
2010.09-9000,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,3503.222,3504.157,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2010.09-9000,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3504.157,3505.39,You are attacking the statute.
2010.09-9000,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3505.39,3509.192,Are you saying -- and that's -- this is where I have difficulty.
2010.09-9000,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,3518.749,3519.499,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-9000,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3520.066,3530.224,That that was a good enough excuse to excuse the fact that he didn't do DNA -- DNA testing at the time of trial?
2010.09-9000,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,3554.007,3561.326,"--Your Honor, I think it's not the specific question to whether in our case they didn't consider our ineffective assistance of counsel arguments."
2010.09-9000,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3573.568,3574.034,Wait a minute.
2010.09-9000,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,3600.201,3605.188,"Once the Court of Criminal Appeals construed the statute, that's what the statute means and we are challenging that."
2010.09-9000,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3605.971,3606.805,And so what do you think--
2010.09-9000,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,3606.805,3607.807,--And that's what Your Honor described as facial.
2010.09-9000,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3607.807,3612.092,--What is it about what they said it means that is unconstitutional?
2010.09-9000,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,3612.092,3630.904,"That it is not -- that it is not admit of any exception and it doesn't have any references to the purposes of the statute, the reasoning the testing might not have been sought in a particular case or the fact, particularly in our case, Mr. Skinner at the time of his trial this -- the post-conviction DNA testing statute was still six years in the future."
2010.09-9000,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3639.759,3649.717,"I'm not even sure what that argument ties to, because I thought what the court said was, this DNA testing was available then."
2010.09-9000,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,3670.464,3678.718,"I -- I have always felt it was intuitively, especially unfair to accuse him of laying behind a log when there was no log to lie behind."
2010.09-9000,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3700.03,3711.838,"So, Mr. Owen, if I understand you correctly in how this understanding of the claim relates to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, what you are saying is that the statute as construed was unconstitutional?"
2010.09-9000,2,40115,robert_c_owen,,3711.838,3712.288,--Yes.
