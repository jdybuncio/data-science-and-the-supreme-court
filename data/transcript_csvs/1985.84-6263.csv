1985.84-6263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.935,We will hear arguments next in Batson against Kentucky.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,17.775,18.056,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1985.84-6263,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,77.375,78.594,Were you trial counsel?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,78.594,79.516,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,134.165,139.523,"Well, the court could have, without regard to Swain, could have proceeded under state law to regulate."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,139.523,143.114,"Your Honor, that was not raised in this particular case, although it certainly could."
1985.84-6263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,179.21,184.379,"Mr. Niehaus, Swain was an equal protection challenge, was it not?"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,184.379,184.8,Yes.
1985.84-6263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.8,189.658,Your claim here is based solely on the Sixth Amendment?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,189.658,190.142,Yes.
1985.84-6263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.142,190.533,Is that correct?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,190.533,191.906,"That is what we are arguing, yes."
1985.84-6263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,191.906,197.904,"You are not asking for a reconsideration of Swain, and you are making no equal protection claim here."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,198.951,201.199,We have not made an equal protection claim.
1985.84-6263,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,212.697,218.614,Why do you fall short of a direct attack on Swain on equal protection?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,218.614,237.904,"Swain within the conventional interpretation simply states that no attack can be made on the exercise in one particular case, and as the record in this case shows no more than what happened in this one particular case."
1985.84-6263,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,237.904,243.542,"But Swain preceded the time, did it not, when the amendment was made applicable to the states?"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,243.542,244.277,Certainly.
1985.84-6263,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,246.916,247.619,Yes.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,247.619,248.041,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-6263,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,248.041,250.914,"So I ask again, why don't you attack Swain head on?"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,250.914,265.222,"I believe that we will be attacking it in the course of our argument, Your Honor, because I think that the bases that underlie the proof standard in Swain have been eroded somewhat by a reexamination of the historical--"
1985.84-6263,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,265.222,271.623,"I though you just answered Justice O'Connor by saying, no, you weren't really attacking Swain except by implication."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,271.623,283.729,--We have not made a specific argument in the briefs that have been filed either in the Supreme Court of Kentucky or in this Court saying that we are attacking Swain as such.
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,303.394,316.543,"Are you saying the Sixth Amendment right requires that the actual petit jury that tries the case must be representative, or have our cases talked about the panel?"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,316.543,320.058,No case specifically holds what we are asking for today.
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,329.867,347.86,"I would suppose until peremptory challenges are just out entirely, you would have to just be talking about the panel, because even if you win this case, there are going to be a lot of peremptory challenges exercised for other reasons that might well eliminate identifiable groups in the community."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,347.86,361.026,"I think that that is quite so, and as long as these peremptory challenges are exercised for some reason related to the matter at hand, I think that the cause for objection is going to be removed."
1985.84-6263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,413.77,419.315,"As I understand the California rule, it also applies to peremptories by defendants?"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,419.924,420.252,Yes.
1985.84-6263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,422.611,425.111,And that would follow along with your argument?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,425.111,432.231,"--Your Honor, we have not put that argument forward simply because it is not necessary to obtain the relief we desire in this case."
1985.84-6263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.231,449.849,"Well, but I think at least speaking for myself I would like to know what the consequences, the logical consequences of adopting your rule are, and I take it if most state courts have adopted it and felt obliged to extend it to defendants, that might well be a logical consequence."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,449.849,452.598,"Oh, I think that it could be, Your Honor, but the Court could also consider--"
1985.84-6263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,452.598,455.425,"Well, how can you do that under a Sixth Amendment claim?"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,465.718,508.608,"--This is quite right, Your Honor, but the courts that have addressed the matter and more recently the case in Booker versus Jade from the Sixth Circuit, which we have not had time to file with the Court, simply talks about fairness between the parties, and that it does tend to diminish the perception of fairness in the eyes of the public, and those courts have perceived a... I guess you would say a right emanating, although not specifically state, out of the Sixth Amendment, wherein the courts may impose the same rule on the defendant in order to bring out the confidence necessary for--"
1985.84-6263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,508.608,513.714,"Well, it certainly is doctrinally difficult to justify under the Sixth Amendment, isn't it?"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,513.714,514.074,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-6263,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,514.074,526.976,"So I come back again to my question why you didn't attack Swain head on, but I take it if the Court were to overrule Swain, you wouldn't like that result."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,526.976,530.771,Simply overrule Swain without adopting the remedy?
1985.84-6263,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,530.771,531.16,Yes.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,531.16,533.816,"I do not think that would give us much comfort, Your Honor, no."
1985.84-6263,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,533.816,538.534,That is a concession.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,538.534,539.471,Pardon?
1985.84-6263,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,539.471,542.47,"I said, that is a concession."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,542.47,550.623,The Court has always recognized that a jury must be representative of the community in order to discharge its function.
1985.84-6263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,550.623,555.042,"Are you speaking now of a petit jury, the trial jury, or the grand jury, the array?"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,555.042,562.306,The cases that have been decided by this Court in particular speak about the panel that is set up.
1985.84-6263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,567.616,568.225,And you must.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,568.225,569.178,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,579.939,580.751,"Well, I just should go back."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,586.483,588.716,"--No, it was equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1985.84-6263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,707.465,709.401,But of course you want us to go further than that.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,716.118,720.038,"Yes, we want a representative petit jury if that is possible."
1985.84-6263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,751.166,753.634,"As a practical matter, how does the judge go about this?"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,765.332,767.628,I do not find any cases talking about that.
1985.84-6263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,767.628,770.923,I am asking how you would ask the judge to go about it.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,770.923,777.312,"I would ask the judge to take note of the persons in the jury, the actual panel who was brought from the pool to the room."
1985.84-6263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,777.312,786.824,Are you asking him to take judicial notice of the composition of the state or the county or the district so that he knows?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,792.493,795.976,I think that he does not need to know those facts.
1985.84-6263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,813.75,822.809,"Is there any difference in the end result if they, to take your term, disappear or they are cone from the jury on challenges for cause than for peremptories?"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,822.809,828.416,"--I think so, because if they are challenged for cause, that means that they have some reason that they have articulated--"
1985.84-6263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,828.416,831.977,But then your end result might not be representative.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,831.977,836.084,"--Certainly, but again, that is a question of securing an impartial jury."
1985.84-6263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,858.608,861.497,How do you give the judge a chance to correct this?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,885.628,895.389,"I think that under the Kentucky system, that that is probably the way the relief must be done, because peremptory challenges are exercised all at once at the close of challenges for cause."
1985.84-6263,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,925.158,930.875,"Well, Mr. Niehaus, suppose he has six peremptories and he exercises four."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,930.875,931.484,Yes.
1985.84-6263,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,932.531,936.794,"And there are two others, blacks who are on the jury."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,939.418,940.246,--Two are left on the jury?
1985.84-6263,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,940.246,941.308,"Two are left, yes."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,941.308,943.931,I think probably so because of the--
1985.84-6263,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,943.931,944.431,Probably so what?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,944.431,951.881,--Probably that there is reason for complaint because he has used a disproportionate number in order to--
1985.84-6263,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,951.881,952.522,"Well, let me change the number then."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,957.832,958.488,--Remain on?
1985.84-6263,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,963.001,963.486,All right.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,963.876,967.501,--I believe that it is still a close situation.
1985.84-6263,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,970.687,971.311,Why?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,971.311,985.384,"One, under the doctrine of chances that we have articulated in our brief, it gets to be a very narrow matter, and perhaps you cannot make any inference from that as to noninnocent intent unless there are other--"
1985.84-6263,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,985.384,986.071,You say perhaps you may not.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,986.071,989.256,--It depends on whether there are other facts known.
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.223,1007.953,"How can a prosecutor answer your... if you adopt a California rule or Massachusetts, how does a prosecutor answer your doctrine of chances?"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1017.668,1022.259,He can point out what it was about these particular juries that he did not like.
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.476,1032.146,But it wouldn't turn it into a challenge for cause?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1032.146,1040.752,"I don't believe so, and I don't believe that has been the experience in the jurisdictions that have adopted this rule, that he must state some reason."
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1043.548,1053.575,"Like this black is too well educated, or he works for the wrong company, or something like that?"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1053.575,1058.37,--Those are reasons that are not tied to the fact that this juror is simply a black.
1985.84-6263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1063.415,1065.834,Even though they wouldn't succeed as challenges for cause?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1065.834,1066.397,True.
1985.84-6263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1066.397,1080.75,"One thing he can't say, I suppose, is that this venire person is black, and the defendant is black, and therefore I would rather have a white juror than a black juror."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1080.75,1096.604,"I think so, because it is... the fact that the prospective juror is a black rather than any reason why, any articulable reason why there is a specific suspected bias that is the motivating cause for removal of this juror."
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1096.604,1104.243,How about the black defendant striking white jurors?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1104.243,1106.679,I think that presents a different--
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1106.679,1139.275,"He could say, well, the history of the death penalty in this community is such that there is prejudice against blacks, there is prejudice against blacks especially if they kill a white, and so I think that whites... there is a reasonable possibility that whites on this jury will be prejudiced against this defendant, and that is why... so I am going to strike all the whites I can strictly on a racial basis, assuming that... not assuming, but I think that they will be prejudiced against my clients."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1140.414,1156.47,"--Well, the harm is there, perhaps, but maybe not as severe, because in most areas of the country I believe that even if a defendant exercises all of his challenges, he will not succeed in eradicating all white persons from the jury."
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1156.47,1166.529,"But nevertheless, as you answered Justice Brennan a while ago, you think it is the reason that is bad, the reason for striking, so that would be a racial reason for striking a white."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1166.529,1167.451,Yes.
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.451,1169.653,"And you say, but that is permissible."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1169.653,1174.151,I think that it is not as serious a problem.
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.151,1176.275,That isn't what I asked you.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1177.993,1179.228,Pardon?
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1179.228,1185.116,"Would that be constitutionally permissible, to strike the whites because of the--"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1198.172,1206.263,"I think that is exactly the point, that there is no state action involved where the defendant is exercising his peremptory challenge."
1985.84-6263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1206.263,1214.041,But there might be under an equal protection challenge if it is the state system that allows that kind of a strike.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1214.041,1218.228,I believe that is possible.
1985.84-6263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1227.66,1254.665,"But if a prosecutor strikes whites because he is afraid that the whites... let's say the principal witness for the prosecution is a black, although the defendant is white, and the prosecutor strikes whites because he is afraid they are less likely to believe the black witness than perhaps a substitute black juror."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1257.243,1261.709,I think that it is because it is specific to the matter at hand.
1985.84-6263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.818,1267.098,"Well, that is all the facts you have."
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1267.098,1272.782,I think that that is specific enough to the proceeding at hand.
1985.84-6263,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1272.782,1277.375,That whites as a class tend not to believe blacks as witnesses?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1279.342,1281.576,"If that is all that is known, then I think not."
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1305.785,1312.001,Do you think peremptories by the defense are constitutionally required?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1312.001,1314.032,By the defense?
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1317.374,1317.89,I know you have.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1317.89,1331.775,"--that I believe that because they have been in existence for such a long time, that they may be, even though they were not specifically incorporated into the document, they may be of such importance along an analysis like Williams versus Florida and--"
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1331.775,1333.713,But the prosecution is strictly statutory.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1333.713,1334.291,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1338.101,1339.023,Or by practice.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1339.023,1339.773,Yes.
1985.84-6263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1339.773,1345.91,You don't think there is any requirement that the number of peremptory challenges be the same for both?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1345.91,1346.723,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-6263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1346.723,1349.315,In most states they are not.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1349.907,1358.904,"As far as I have been able to tell, the defendant usually has anywhere from one to two to several more, depending on what the state has decided to provide."
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1489.321,1489.883,How many of them are there?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1489.883,1492.335,--I believe there are six now.
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1492.335,1493.757,California--
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1493.757,1503.784,"California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Florida, New Mexico, and, I believe, Delaware, and two federal appellate circuits, the Second and the Sixth."
1985.84-6263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1503.784,1507.953,--May I ask you one question about the theory of your case?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1545.063,1546.454,Several others are left on?
1985.84-6263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1546.454,1546.782,Yes.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1553.575,1557.215,"I think not, although I think not--"
1985.84-6263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.215,1561.245,So you questions about the numbers then go to the difficulty of ascertaining whether that is true.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1561.245,1561.541,--Yes.
1985.84-6263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1561.541,1564.244,Not whether there is a constitutional violation or not.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1564.244,1579.581,"The use of numbers shows what the prosecutor is about, so that the more jurors that are removed, the greater the certainty is that he is doing so for some nonrelated reason."
1985.84-6263,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.581,1583.142,What would be wrong with the judge's asking the prosecutor?
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1585.251,1591.638,"Yes, I think that the whole rule is premised on the fact that the lawyers involved will tell the court the truth."
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1591.638,1606.694,"There are five blacks, six blacks, and the prosecutor strikes these five of them on the jury, and he doesn't strike the other one, or he does, he strikes the one, and why did you strike him, as Justice Stevens asked you?"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1628.858,1635.916,"I think that it would be a violation, although perhaps not under the theory that we are advancing here today."
1985.84-6263,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.463,1640.041,With a cross section.
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1640.041,1650.037,"--with what the jury is, and so as long as the jury is more or less representative of the community under this theory there are other means to attack."
1985.84-6263,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1650.037,1657.971,"You have to make an equal protection challenge to take care of the single strike in the example given by Justice Stevens, don't you?"
1985.84-6263,0,32231,j_david_niehaus,,1657.971,1658.189,Yes.
1985.84-6263,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1704.843,1710.761,Mr. Pearson.
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,1710.761,1720.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue before this Court today is simply whether Swain versus Alabama should be reaffirmed."
1985.84-6263,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1723.71,1728.442,"Well, now, that isn't what the other side says at all."
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,1732.659,1741.281,"--We believe that it is the Fourteenth Amendment that is the item that should be challenged, and presents perhaps an address to the problem."
1985.84-6263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1816.969,1819.202,"May I interrupt, Mr. Pearson?"
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,1836.976,1847.3,That would not be constitutionally impermissible because under Swain the petitioner would have had to show that the particular prosecutor had struck blacks over a period of time.
1985.84-6263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1847.3,1848.877,I understand it wouldn't have violated Swain.
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,1860.42,1863.872,"No, sir, I would not concede that that would have been a constitutional violation."
1985.84-6263,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1863.872,1871.01,"What if his answer was, I struck them because I always strike them in every case I try?"
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,1871.01,1887.221,"I think under Swain that would have been permissible, because here we are talking about over a period of time, not in a particular case, and we have to realize that there are assorted reasons for exercising peremptory challenges."
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1905.464,1914.351,"Well, all this long period of time, I assume... well, how long would he have to be a prosecutor before he could have that protection?"
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,1914.351,1919.318,"Justice Marshall, no one knows."
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1924.816,1926.455,"Well, what is over a period of time?"
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,1926.455,1929.986,"--This Court has never stated, and I dare not speak for the Court."
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1929.986,1933.265,"That is a good constitutional rule, isn't it, without any time at all."
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,1933.265,1933.953,Absolutely.
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1934.968,1936.593,You think that is what Swain said?
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,1936.593,1939.902,"It says over a period of time, but it does not state what the period of time is."
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2013.733,2016.092,--denied peremptories to both sides?
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2016.092,2035.396,"--Well, Justice Marshall, in that case you might well move more toward a more balanced system, but when you propose the total elimination of peremptory challenges for the prosecution, you move more toward an imbalance."
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2035.396,2037.067,I said both sides.
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2037.067,2037.347,"Yes, sir, I understand."
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2038.128,2040.44,That violates what section of the Constitution?
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2040.44,2043.876,--If I understand your question--
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2043.876,2046.297,Would that violate the Constitution?
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2046.297,2049.233,--If both sides could exercise peremptory challenges?
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2049.233,2055.762,If both sides are denied peremptory challenges.
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2055.762,2058.277,"No, sir, it would not violate the Constitution of the United States of America."
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2058.277,2058.449,Perfectly all right?
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2058.449,2059.183,That would be all right.
1985.84-6263,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2068.555,2072.1,"Well, it was a system prevailing at the time, was it not?"
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2072.1,2076.628,"It was, based on... even in colonial times and... to some extent and based on the common law."
1985.84-6263,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2144.009,2152.739,"Mr. Pearson, really this is kind of an extra argument, because if the explanation couldn't harm the prosecutor anyway, it doesn't really make any difference whether it is required."
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2171.373,2172.342,"If I understand, that's correct."
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2183.855,2185.103,Let's examine that.
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2193.13,2194.271,Yes.
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2194.271,2202.236,"And you are building that that you can give it for a violation of the Constitution, and those are two different animals."
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2202.236,2202.861,"No, sir, I--"
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2202.861,2212.326,"If a state officer says I am using race in my enforcement of my law, doesn't that violate the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2212.326,2217.059,"--If the state does it over a period of time, yes, it does, but in a particular case--"
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2217.059,2217.793,I didn't say over a period of time.
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2217.793,2219.121,--But in a particular case--
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2219.121,2219.948,He does it once.
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2221.792,2222.54,--We don't believe so.
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2222.54,2224.572,"Well, how many times?"
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2224.572,2234.801,"Well, I think there based upon how many times it has been done, it has to raise a reasonable inference that he is practicing invidious discrimination."
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2237.502,2246.89,Can you give me any case that says that a constitutional right has to be denied a number of times?
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2246.89,2253.872,"As I understand your question, I don't know of a case to that point, but I do know that Swain says that--"
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2253.872,2256.372,Including Swain.
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2256.372,2256.716,--Pardon?
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2256.716,2258.387,Including Swain.
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2260.401,2262.057,"No, sir, not as you put it."
1985.84-6263,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2264.462,2267.305,What were you about to say that Swain provides?
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2269.178,2288.171,"--I was going to say that Swain provides that whenever peremptory challenges have been utilized over a period of time that the petitioner has or the defendant has to prove that they have been exercised for the purpose of excluding, like in this particular case, blacks."
1985.84-6263,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.92,2301.478,"Counsel, what do you think... under Swain, what if it is proved that over a period of time, whatever that is, the prosecutor just strikes all blacks?"
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2305.43,2308.664,I think it raises a reasonable inference that he is doing it for racial reasons.
1985.84-6263,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2308.664,2316.784,And that he thinks that just all blacks... there isn't any black that is qualified to sit on a jury.
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2318.939,2320.376,"I agree, it is the inference."
1985.84-6263,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.376,2328.67,"So what if the... do you think under Swain that if that is proved, that the conviction would be set aside?"
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2328.67,2331.059,"I think if that is proved, that--"
1985.84-6263,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2331.059,2346.476,"If striking people because of their racial characteristics, if that is a justifiable inference in the case, the judgment is going to be set aside, isn't it, under Swain?"
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2346.476,2347.679,--Under Swain it would.
1985.84-6263,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.679,2355.643,"Now, what if the prosecutor gets up and says, now, look, we don't have to wait for a period of time to rely on some inference from statistics."
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2369.044,2370.059,"Yes, sir, it did."
1985.84-6263,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2370.059,2370.434,It did?
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2370.434,2371.028,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-6263,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.028,2373.652,What makes you think that?
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2373.652,2379.259,Because the test in Swain is that you must show that the prosecutor did it over a period of time.
1985.84-6263,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2379.259,2387.178,"No, it says that if you show that these strikes have taken place over a period of time, there is an inference of racial discrimination."
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2387.178,2387.865,Right.
1985.84-6263,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.865,2390.646,What if there is another way of proving racial discrimination?
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2390.646,2392.91,Then of course--
1985.84-6263,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.91,2399.688,"And I just suggested to you, and my example is clear as a bell, the prosecutor can seize it."
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2405.388,2417.212,"--We will submit that over the period of time test, which is the one that carries the day, when you have... petitioner has proposed a remedy on the Wheeler which we believe to be a subjective test."
1985.84-6263,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.212,2549.096,"Well, counsel, a token black left on a jury isn't going to satisfy the theory of the other side, their statistical approach, as the exchange with Justice Brennan indicated."
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2551.799,2565.793,"The token, I think if you leave the token black on the jury, based on petitioner's theory, it probably wouldn't satisfy him, but I am thinking that that is a problem where you are headed if you adopt Wheeler."
1985.84-6263,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2584.91,2618.553,"You have mentioned or referred to the difficulty of trying to find out what the pattern or practice is, but suppose there is a manual in the prosecutor's office and the section on selection of juries says categorically that you should always strike any minority representative from the panel with a peremptory challenge if the defendant is a member of some minority, whether Catholic or Jewish or Puerto Rican or whatever."
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2626.362,2627.425,I don't think you would.
1985.84-6263,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2631.892,2632.938,In the instruction?
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2632.938,2634.125,"--Yes, sir."
1985.84-6263,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2634.735,2641.949,I suppose you would need to show that there was at least some compliance with that manual.
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2641.949,2644.808,I think that would be most persuasive for a defendant.
1985.84-6263,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2658.63,2673.265,"How do you distinguish the instruction in the manual from the hypothetical Justice White asked you earlier, namely, when the prosecutor in a given case says, I always do it, I don't want any blacks, I have a black defendant?"
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2675.203,2683.136,"I think the difference would be that the manual would be policy, policy that would affect the entire office over a period of time."
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2710.016,2713.202,"Well, suppose the policy man wrote the book."
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2713.202,2717.81,"If I understand your question, the policy man--"
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2717.81,2722.058,Wrote the manual that the Chief Justice is talking about.
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2722.058,2722.244,--Right.
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2722.244,2726.805,"The same man that you said didn't do it right, he did it this time right."
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2729.46,2735.927,"I think that... well, I see the difference probably moving more toward--"
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2735.927,2737.13,Make me see.
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2737.13,2744.048,"--the difference moving more toward him being a discriminatory type individual, and that that is a basis--"
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2744.048,2747.859,"Well, suppose a prosecutor reads a piece of paper saying that."
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2749.922,2753.529,--That wouldn't be a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
1985.84-6263,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2753.529,2756.294,Does all policy have to be in writing?
1985.84-6263,1,40149,rickie_l_pearson,,2756.294,2760.121,"No, sir, all policy does not have to be in writing."
1985.84-6263,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2818.237,2828.39,Mr. Wallace.
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2828.39,2849.162,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the theme of the brief we have filed in this case is that far from standing as an aberration in the law, Swain against Alabama fits into a consistent pattern with all of this Court's related jurisprudence."
1985.84-6263,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2970.097,2984.654,"Mr. Wallace, if the challenge here were being made to Swain itself under the equal protection clause as opposed to the Sixth Amendment, would you be here and making the same argument?"
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2984.654,2985.451,"Oh, yes."
1985.84-6263,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3014.407,3027.402,Even if the prosecutor openly admits that he is striking all jurors of a particular race because of their race?
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3027.402,3031.37,Because of their race in the context of the case.
1985.84-6263,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.271,3050.112,"Mr. Wallace, wasn't Swain just a case that says what it takes to make out a prime facie case of racial discrimination?"
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3050.112,3051.799,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-6263,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3051.799,3065.762,"And over a period of time if you could prove that the prosecutor struck blacks because of their race, and there never could be a black, as far as he was concerned, who could sit, that makes out a prima facie case."
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3077.522,3079.257,It would not.
1985.84-6263,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.952,3099.623,"Yes, but that has always been true of racial--"
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3099.623,3100.451,That's correct.
1985.84-6263,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3100.451,3102.872,"--discrimination on petit juries, panels."
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3102.872,3103.762,That's correct.
1985.84-6263,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3112.728,3115.07,"Mr. Wallace, let me take you one step further."
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3132.719,3137.966,"Well, there probably would be in that case, Your Honor, although--"
1985.84-6263,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3137.966,3138.482,Just probably?
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3138.482,3141.825,--it is an inartful answer at best.
1985.84-6263,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3141.825,3144.042,"Well, let's take it one step further."
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3158.287,3159.506,Swain says it is.
1985.84-6263,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3159.506,3160.161,I don't care about Swain.
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3161.474,3170.313,We take the position that that is a permissible basis for exercising peremptory challenges.
1985.84-6263,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3172.749,3177.56,Would it be permissible for a judge to challenge a jury for cause on that ground?
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3177.56,3179.497,"--Oh, no, no."
1985.84-6263,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3179.497,3182.527,"The state can do it through the prosecutor, but not through the judge."
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3182.527,3194.991,"Well, there is much virtue in the present system in the fact that judges are not asked to say aye or nay to the various reasons that counsel have as litigation decisions about why they want to exercise their peremptories they way they do."
1985.84-6263,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3194.991,3197.303,Why wouldn't it be permissible for a judge do to that?
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3206.408,3212.218,Because that is a matter of litigation strategy in the particular case.
1985.84-6263,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3246.814,3265.681,"Mr. Wallace, don't you think saying that I think there isn't any black who wouldn't be more likely to acquit, all blacks are more likely to acquit, so I am going to keep them all off the jury, is that really very much different from saying I am striking this man because he is a black?"
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3269.43,3277.786,If it is put that way rather than related to an affinity between these jurors and the particular defendant or the particular kind of crime it is about.
1985.84-6263,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3277.786,3288.656,"Well, all right, I say these black jurors are more likely to acquit black defendants, and therefore... I am not sure that that is even very sound."
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3288.656,3300.776,"Well, the experience of federal prosecutors is that they don't think in such broad brush stereotypes for the most part because there are many other--"
1985.84-6263,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3300.776,3316.535,"Under Swain, say that over a period of time the prosecutor is proved to have struck all blacks off the juries, and the reason he constantly gives is blacks just won't acquit... they are just more prone to acquit."
1985.84-6263,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3322.3,3324.173,--And I agree with you.
1985.84-6263,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3420.836,3423.164,"Your time has expired, Mr. Wallace."
