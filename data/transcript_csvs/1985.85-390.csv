1985.85-390,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.022,"The Court will hear arguments first this morning in City of Los Angeles against Preferred Communications, Incorporated."
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,13.058,16.093,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,206.365,216.388,How does that... how was it anticipated that the franchisee in this area would have constructed the system?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,218.09,219.54,"--Your Honor, that is not in the record."
1985.85-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,220.507,223.911,"Was it going to be on poles, or underground, or both?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,223.911,225.611,"--A combination, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,233.682,235.282,And who owns the poles?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,235.282,236.984,"It's a combination, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,242.122,248.526,"So, a good share of the system will occupy public property?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,248.526,263.0,"The majority of the system will be on public property, Your Honor, and if it's not, the fact that it's on city rights of ways, we control the rights of ways so I don't think the fact that a private pole involved really is important in this case."
1985.85-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,313.933,323.372,But you don't... you are only going to award one license in each area?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,323.372,325.823,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,325.823,329.375,And you're going to tell us pretty soon why that's reasonable?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,329.375,333.846,"I will tell you in my reasonable arguments exactly why we do what we do, and that it is reasonable."
1985.85-390,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,333.846,342.702,"Is that a permanent and final decision, or could you later award similar rights in other areas?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,342.702,348.237,Our franchise process envisions... it is not exclusive.
1985.85-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,382.243,391.199,"Mr. Perez, doesn't this case come to us as a result of a 12-B-6 motion?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,391.199,391.999,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,391.999,399.705,And don't we have to take the allegations in the complaint as true for purposes of our inquiry?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,399.705,405.442,"Well, I don't think, Justice O'Connor, that you have to take all the allegations in the complaint as true."
1985.85-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,434.395,460.26,"Well, my concern is that apparently you concede that there are some First Amendment values at stake here, and that there has to be some weighing process which goes on, and faced with the allegations and the complaint that are made, I wonder how that can be done properly in a 12-B-6 motion, frankly."
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,460.26,469.718,"If you were to accept just the allegations in the complaint, Your Honor, I think you would see that at least in our view he did not sufficiently allege content regulation."
1985.85-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,471.835,479.507,"Well, the complaint alleges that the City will award the franchise only to the single company it deems best?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,479.507,480.224,--That's correct.
1985.85-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,480.224,485.061,Which would appear on its face to be some sort of a content based determination.
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,485.061,506.074,"Well, if there is any content considerations incidental to the process, Your Honor, and I would suggest that as this Court held in the Rentgen case, if you look at the predominant intent of the document or the process and really see what the City was trying to do, and in the reasonableness argument I will show you what we were trying to do here, and there's really no allegation--"
1985.85-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,506.074,521.234,"But, isn't that the kind of thing that you go to trial on and let the City prove its interests, and whether those interests are sufficient to overcome the First Amendment interests of the company."
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,521.234,524.203,"--The short answer to that, Your Honor, is in this case you don't need to."
1985.85-390,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.743,540.564,"Mr. Perez, what exactly is the standard by which the City would award the franchise?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,547.451,550.003,"It's the highest responsible bidder, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,575.116,580.887,"Well, is there some room for content and regulation in there, or determination on the basis of content?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,580.887,590.311,"There are certain areas where I think arguably, someone could allege, as the Ninth Circuit held, the impermissible risk of covert discrimination."
1985.85-390,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,607.171,631.888,"Well, Mr. Perez, the complaint, though, alleges that it is entirely feasible to string another cable on the poles, and that according to the allegations of the complaint it would not be a burden to city-owned property to enable another cable to be strung, and serve the same areas of the City that the City wants served."
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,645.379,657.004,"Well, Your Honor, let me get to the reasonableness portion of my argument, and I think I'll address that for you, and I appreciate your concerns and I appreciate the fact that this is a 12-B-6 and you want to look at the face of that document and make a determination."
1985.85-390,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,765.641,771.711,"Well, how does that legislative history, Mr. Perez, bear on the constitutional issue?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,771.711,778.449,"--Well, what it does, Your Honor, is give you some facts to dispute what might be in the complaint that's troubling Justice O'Connor."
1985.85-390,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,802.397,804.016,"Well, are you arguing for an"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,813.205,823.561,"Well, clearly, Mr. Chief Justice, because even though we've had two decades worth of experience, it's still changing rapidly and we know that there will be greater changes in a couple of years."
1985.85-390,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,849.478,855.549,"Mr. Perez, it will be helpful to me if I understand the status of legislation."
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,862.953,866.921,What Government Code Section 5306-C does--
1985.85-390,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,866.921,868.671,Expressing--
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,868.671,873.559,--It says that local governments can grant franchises.
1985.85-390,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,875.761,878.146,--It does not express and limit you to one?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,878.146,879.013,That's right.
1985.85-390,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,879.013,889.168,Does any city in the State of California have a policy different from that of Los Angeles with respect to multiple or dual licensees?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,889.168,891.103,"If they do I'm unaware of it, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,891.103,891.62,Unaware of it?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,891.62,892.37,Yes.
1985.85-390,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,892.37,903.678,"Is there anything in the federal legislation that would restrict you, assuming the validity of that legislation, to licensing only one cable television company?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,903.678,911.1,"Well, Section 621 of the Cable Act says that it's up to the discretion of local governments to make a decision to grant one or more."
1985.85-390,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,912.367,915.319,"So, you do have the right under the legislation to grant more?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,915.319,917.171,"As we see it, Your Honor, yes, we do."
1985.85-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.171,923.241,But you also have the privilege to grant only one under the federal statute?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,923.241,924.943,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1985.85-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,924.943,928.311,You also have the privilege of granting only one under the federal statute?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,928.311,930.145,That's correct.
1985.85-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.145,934.549,Does the record tell us how many Los Angeles has granted?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,934.549,937.001,"How many franchises currently, I don't believe so."
1985.85-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,947.357,948.809,Is it a matter of public record?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,948.809,950.242,"It is a matter of public record, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,950.242,951.511,Can you tell us what it is?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,951.511,953.911,It's 14 franchise areas in the City of Los Angeles.
1985.85-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,953.911,957.681,"So, it's conceivable you might be dealing with working different franchisees?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,959.531,957.681,That's correct.
1985.85-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.566,969.22,"Well, I mean whether you get lawsuits or not, you could have... each one, they're all allocated separately?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,969.22,969.839,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,976.993,983.879,"Well, I mean, forgetting competition, if you have 14... 14 separate licensees simultaneously in different areas of the City?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,983.879,984.414,That's correct.
1985.85-390,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,984.414,988.2,And you'd only have problems if one wanted to expand into his neighbor's area or something?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,988.2,989.3,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,989.3,991.918,And do you actually have 14 licensed--
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,991.918,993.604,"We have 14 granted now, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,993.604,994.437,--Granted now?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,994.437,995.404,Not all are completed.
1985.85-390,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1036.864,1037.716,Mr. Perez.
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,1037.716,1038.633,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1038.633,1040.585,Excuse me for interrupting you again.
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,1052.309,1052.876,"Well, Your Honor, I--"
1985.85-390,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1052.876,1054.943,"Nothing in the record to support it, is there?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,1054.943,1065.2,"--Well, if the Court does not take into consideration the references of the material that we have in our brief and the other briefs before this Court, there might be some problem with that."
1985.85-390,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1065.2,1074.989,"In other words, you may very well have a substantial City interest, but do we have the facts before us in order to decide that question?"
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,1074.989,1078.71,"Only if you consider the information that we have referenced in our brief, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1082.995,1084.697,Would that indicate a remand?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,1084.697,1086.18,"No, that would not indicate a remand, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.329,1123.072,Is there anything in the record with respect to whether economics was a factor in deciding to have only one franchisee per area?
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,1123.072,1124.439,"Economics in which sense, Your Honor?"
1985.85-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.107,1136.88,"Well, no, whether the market would support more than one cable system in an area."
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,1136.88,1138.582,"Well, that is not in the complaint."
1985.85-390,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1155.71,1156.71,"Well, that may be so."
1985.85-390,0,22975,edward_j_perez,,1162.947,1165.482,"Well, a second company might want in for two reasons, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1371.731,1373.231,Mr. Farrow.
1985.85-390,1,26999,harold_r_farrow,,1373.231,1376.183,"Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court:"
1985.85-390,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1382.856,1385.808,"Mr. Farrow, It is difficult to hear you."
1985.85-390,1,26999,harold_r_farrow,,1389.425,1394.877,Is that better now?
1985.85-390,2,22975,edward_j_perez,,3167.735,3169.401,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.85-390,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3215.981,3218.581,May I ask you one question that occured to me.
1985.85-390,2,22975,edward_j_perez,,3245.666,3248.618,I think I'm a little confused at one point.
1985.85-390,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3252.237,3268.247,"Assume that you couldn't prove a natural monopoly, but rather the City just thought that it would be in the interest of the public if they were able to manage an operation and it met all the standards that you've got here, to be sure they have good management and adequate programming and the right kind of programming."
1985.85-390,2,22975,edward_j_perez,,3274.251,3275.186,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3282.006,3283.606,"--And I say, put to one side all of that."
1985.85-390,2,22975,edward_j_perez,,3284.641,3286.993,"--You've just got one, yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-390,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3286.993,3307.824,"--Do you think the City of Los Angeles could have said, we're not going to grant any franchises, we're going to run our own cable television operation in the whole city, it will be the sole operator of cable television in the City of Los Angeles?"
1985.85-390,2,22975,edward_j_perez,,3311.943,3316.161,I think the City if they wanted to could operate a cable television system.
1985.85-390,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3322.5,3326.885,"You would be deciding all the time what the program was, the City would be?"
1985.85-390,2,22975,edward_j_perez,,3326.885,3329.654,You'd have to divorce it and have a separate--
1985.85-390,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3329.654,3336.741,"I take it there are a lot of... aren't there a lot of cities that run their own cable system, or not?"
1985.85-390,2,22975,edward_j_perez,,3336.741,3338.843,"--There are some, Your Honors."
1985.85-390,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3347.882,3350.318,"Well, yes, but how about your operating it?"
1985.85-390,2,22975,edward_j_perez,,3356.305,3357.471,That could cause some problems.
1985.85-390,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3363.541,3364.375,"Thank you, gentlemen."
