1964.443,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,10.517,"Number 443, Hughes Tool Company et al., Petitioner, versus Trans World Airlines Incorporated."
1964.443,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,12.18,16.03,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1067.034,1071.006,May I just interrupt you for a moment and ask you one question?
1964.443,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,1081.601,1099.33,"Yes, Your Honor, I am although when you refer to the entry of default judgment, I was -- I'm going to explain the circumstances which lead to that order, the question which the Court of Appeals limited itself in interlocutory -- has never been reviewed by the Court of Appeals."
1964.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1111.137,1125.866,"If that's to say then that you can't accept on the basis of error in the -- either the two questions decided on the interlocutory appeal, you can't really address yourself otherwise on the default judgment here?"
1964.443,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,1125.866,1133.089,"Well, Your Honor, I think that this Court probably has a power to address itself to any question which it do, and I'm prepared to address myself to any -- to any questions."
1964.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1148.529,1148.678,"Well my, my --"
1964.443,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,1148.678,1150.323,-- under the antitrust laws.
1964.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1150.323,1156.787,My hypothesis is that we may not agree with you on your supercession argument.
1964.443,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,1156.787,1156.904,We'll I don't --
1964.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1156.904,1171.211,"If we disagree with you on that argument, now, what else -- I don't read your brief, really as I'm sure you haven't enough of it but I don't read them as dealing otherwise with the propriety -- the entry with the default judgment."
1964.443,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,1171.211,1172.103,It is correct Your Honor.
1964.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1181.334,1183.248,Independently of the supercession argument?
1964.443,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,1183.248,1184.212,Yes.
1964.443,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1187.98,1197.596,Would you ever have a plan and under what circumstances would you have a chance to have reviewed the question of the propriety of the entry of the default judgment?
1964.443,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,1197.596,1210.047,"Well, presumably if the matter went a damage hearing, and the final judgment entered, I suppose that that time I would have a rather review of the circumstances on which it was entered."
1964.443,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1323.859,1329.295,"Well, may I just make clear the difficulty that I'm having."
1964.443,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,1360.234,1360.506,Yes.
1964.443,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1541.775,1542.733,You may.
1964.443,0,18814,chester_c_davis,,1542.733,1545.753,Thank you.
1964.443,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1545.753,1547.297,Mr. Sonnett.
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,1547.297,1551.59,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1560.953,1561.354,Yes.
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,1561.354,1566.307,Your Honor will find that at page 1416 of the --
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1566.307,1568.703,That's because the appeal was an interlocutory appeal --
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,1568.703,1569.164,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1569.164,1570.877,-- that was it limited to the two issues.
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,1570.877,1572.277,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1582.588,1601.5,"So your position is that other -- I gather, that except this -- the petitioner prevailed on either of these two arguments, if there is anything else that he is entitled to address to the default judgment, they will have to do that after a final judgment has entered?"
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,1601.5,1614.483,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan, but I have one preliminary point which will suggest and I will come to it right now that perhaps this Court should not even reach the questions presented in the petition for certiorari."
1964.443,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1770.594,1772.294,I don't see at briefs Mr. Sonnett.
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,1772.294,1779.221,"It is not accepted as suggested, Mr. Justice Douglas, in the first two or three pages of our brief."
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1842.368,1845.107,"Now, this is the fourth judgment presented in your brief?"
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,1845.107,1856.645,There was an order Mr. Justice Brennan in this case for the entry of a default judgment subject to the computation of amount of damages.
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1864.029,1864.05,"Well, my question was --"
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,1864.05,1865.636,-- of an exercise of discretion.
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1865.636,1870.938,"My question whether was, is that the judgment you say rest on the ground which suppose to lead us to (Voice Overlap) --"
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,1870.938,1879.147,"Yes, and as well that the decision of the Court of Appeals is clearly correct."
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2341.01,2345.704,"I take -- I take it Mr. Sonnett, it's really has nothing to do with the issue that are hereof?"
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2345.704,2353.362,It has to do with my first point Mr. Justice White and that is I think that you should dismiss the writ of certiorari.
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.362,2354.047,Why?
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2354.047,2362.085,"Because the court below had sufficient jurisdiction to deal with this case, sufficient on its face to issue the discovery orders, to implement them by --"
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.085,2362.676,That the entry of judgment --
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2362.676,2363.695,-- default.
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2363.695,2364.803,-- were perfectly alright.
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2364.803,2365.457,"Yes, Your Honor, regard --"
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.457,2366.435,So that's the point here.
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2367.79,2374.055,"Yes, Your Honor, regardless of the answer to the questions presented in the petition for certiorari."
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.055,2378.405,"Well, the propriety of the default judgment, we think is here (Voice Overlap)."
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2378.405,2381.319,"To that extent, Your Honor, yes."
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2393.594,2396.903,"But if want to reach that question, do you have any objection of the ruling?"
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2396.903,2400.588,"Oh, none whatsoever Your Honor, none whatsoever."
1964.443,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2412.924,2426.489,"Are you thinking the position that we do reach the question of the default judgment is either we should affirm it, make it a final judgment subject to no further attack."
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2426.489,2428.072,"Yes, Mr. Justice Black."
1964.443,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2428.072,2431.152,That issue you think would have to be reached?
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2431.152,2431.345,Well --
1964.443,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2431.345,2442.085,It would result confines -- the District Court would be compelled to accept your argument to that final default judgment stayed?
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2442.085,2446.746,"May I say, Mr. Justice Black, I don't think that you need reach that point --"
1964.443,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2446.746,2447.529,But what if we do?
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2447.529,2468.98,"But if you do, certainly I am prepared to stand on your decision and I think it would be quite proper for this Court in the exercise of its supervisory powers of the administration of justice in the federal courts to have a look at that question even if the Hughes Tool Company may not have standing to raise it because of their default."
1964.443,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2468.98,2482.457,"Assuming we do not reach but would dispose of it on some of the ground it advanced do you still take the position that when you get back to the District Court, this powers to relieve the defendant from the default judgment?"
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2482.457,2489.94,"I would -- depending on what Your Honors decide and write, and I would think that it neither would nor would not."
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.72,2504.585,In what ground before the matter was found.
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2504.585,2506.739,The computation as to the amount of damages to be paid.
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2506.739,2516.698,(Inaudible)
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2516.698,2517.435,"Well, in a --"
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2517.435,2521.365,(Inaudible)
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2521.365,2524.4,I think there is a very respectable authority.
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.797,2540.817,"Now, the assumption is that default judgment is entered on what was alleged conduct."
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2540.817,2547.292,"That is correct, subject only to our proof based on what will be, obviously expert evidence --"
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2547.292,2547.69,How would you --
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2547.69,2548.897,-- as to the amount of damage.
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2548.897,2568.459,"How would ever prove if as a matter of fact, what the complaint said, what the whole judgment said that actually happened didn't happen, how would you ever prove that the judgment was false if as a matter of fact, what is alleged to have happened didn't happen at all?"
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2568.459,2574.809,"Well, I would have difficulty, that of course, I'd have difficulty proving anything in this case without discovery."
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.809,2579.762,How can you prove that -- probably how can (Inaudible)
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2579.762,2589.191,"Well, may I suggest this Mr. Justice White, the pleadings in this case, the complaint and the counterclaims agree on one point."
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.82,2633.259,"So, the actual conduct then is admitted."
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2639.041,2639.7,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2658.354,2666.03,"Well, if it's also admitted that in fact, I didn't understand this Mr. Sonnett, that this agreement at least 45 million of damage being suffered?"
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2666.03,2666.7,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2666.7,2670.273,Well then what is this purpose for Mr. Rankin that will accept multiplied by three?
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2670.273,2673.446,"Well, these are unliquidated on both cases."
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2674.419,2677.755,"I thought you said it was an -- well, are going to ask for more than 45 million?"
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2677.755,2678.81,"I think so, Your Honor."
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2678.81,2679.868,Oh.
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2679.868,2680.308,Of the studies --
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2680.308,2682.766,But you tried at least for fourth of 45 million?
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2682.766,2685.498,"No, these are unliquidated, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2691.643,2692.011,But only in terms --
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2692.011,2692.944,-- well over a year --
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2692.944,2693.313,Only in terms --
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2693.313,2694.257,-- that would be substantial.
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2694.257,2700.54,"Only terms of amount, not as Mr. Justice White suggest in terms of causal connection?"
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2700.54,2707.886,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I think the lawyers -- although this Court has not really so far as I know written on it, the first circuit has."
1964.443,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2721.961,2724.005,"A pretty expensive business decision, isn't it?"
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2724.005,2735.516,"Well, when you consider that the value Mr. Hughes' investment in TWA since the new management took over in 1961 has increased by over $250 million."
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.866,2746.077,"I though what you said is this -- I thought you said that the -- that in making their business decision, they thought that the damage would be less than cost examined?"
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2746.077,2747.754,That is what they said.
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2747.754,2748.959,"Well, that was just inconsistent."
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2748.959,2760.263,"Well, they said that what they were going to have to wind up paying us they thought was going to be last because my friend Mr. Davis will of course not agree with me as to whether or not causation is open."
1964.443,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2771.332,2777.627,"So that I gather it would be helpful to both of you, to get this question so as to not criticize whether it really is open or not?"
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2777.627,2789.388,"Well, may I -- may I say that in terms of this Court's having responsibilities, my own conception of what should be done is that I think the court order dismiss, the writ is improvidently granted."
1964.443,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2790.342,2791.555,Then what would happen?
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2791.555,2800.452,-- I think that the Court of Appeals' decision Mr. Justice Black which is in opinion by Mr. Justice -- by Judge Lombard is an excellent decision --
1964.443,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2800.452,2800.764,What would --
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2800.764,2805.221,-- I think it states the law perhaps as this Court would state it but that is on the jurisdictional points.
1964.443,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2805.221,2806.828,What would happen in practical --
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2806.828,2807.316,We would --
1964.443,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2807.316,2819.278,I'm asking this question because you fail here the idea was 45 million or $35 to $45 million default judgment because the lawyer may have made a mistake about filing the papers.
1964.443,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2821.688,2824.643,Nor would it be to me Mr. Justice Black if that were the fact.
1964.443,2,18814,chester_c_davis,,3375.848,3384.455,"Well, Your Honor I think that perhaps, I ought to address myself to this business decision because it seems to be the most important thing that's being discussed here today."
1964.443,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3502.336,3512.27,"Mr. Davis, outside of this argument therefore the jurisdiction, you (Inaudible)"
1964.443,2,18814,chester_c_davis,,3512.27,3514.409,"No Your Honor, no Your Honor."
1964.443,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3514.409,3514.922,(Inaudible)
1964.443,2,18814,chester_c_davis,,3514.922,3520.334,I never had a review of that decision of the propriety of the discovery orders because the Court of Appeals did not review them.
1964.443,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3526.68,3547.11,"But there's -- you still have a question on what's scope of your (Inaudible) judgment law whether in doing this, you wanted us to say that the District Court (a) could enter a default judgment or (b) that default judgment would foreclose everything except for mathematical computation of damages."
1964.443,2,18814,chester_c_davis,,3547.11,3549.64,"No, I never went this mathematical computation."
1964.443,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3569.711,3585.952,"This judgment, I take it, it didn't include or conceding that the allegations and the complaint were true or -- were true or that you have been damaged by the allegation -- by the conduct alleged in the complaint or in how much?"
1964.443,2,18814,chester_c_davis,,3585.952,3595.677,"Well, the motion of dismiss was obviously based upon the face of the complaint as to whether or not the face of the complaint alleged the course of conduct which did conclude jurisdiction upon the District Court."
1964.443,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3619.845,3631.434,"Well, how can you -- apparently then they get a review you're -- perhaps they're willing to -- not only to default but also to force the District Court to enter default judgment?"
1964.443,2,18814,chester_c_davis,,3631.434,3634.356,"Well, I never -- in my way I never defaulted here --"

1964.443,2,18814,chester_c_davis,,3634.918,3657.372,"Your Honor, I just said after the District Court denied my motion of dismiss, denied my interlocutory, my certification for review, then I said I rested on the merits of my position and indeed invite that the District Court is correct at that time to enter whatever it thought was an appropriate judgment that would give me an appellate review of this legal question."
1964.443,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3667.909,3677.142,"Well, Mr. Davis, Mr. Sonnett, I must confess in my total suprise, he tells us that we can get to an issue to the propriety of that default judgment."

1964.443,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3706.528,3711.527,"But except for the -- except the default judgment, you never would have gotten your review on the Court of Appeals?"
1964.443,2,18814,chester_c_davis,,3711.527,3712.163,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1964.443,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3712.163,3717.201,"Although, you think there was another way of the District Court giving you that review without entering the default judgment?"
