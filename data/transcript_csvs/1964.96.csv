1964.96,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,12.045,"Number 96, Reserve Life Insurance Company, Appellant, versus Stanley J. Bowers, Tax Commissioner of Ohio."
1964.96,0,28362,harris_k_weston,,13.68,18.528,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, Mr. Lindley."
1964.96,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,448.533,451.151,A domestic company doesn't have personal property tax?
1964.96,0,28362,harris_k_weston,,451.151,452.192,No sir.
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,1295.461,1299.516,"Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices."
1964.96,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1404.064,1406.367,Could you speak a little louder please Mr. Lindley.
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,1406.367,1407.902,Yes sir.
1964.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1407.902,1412.736,"Could it -- a large enough difference where Ohio to be interested in it, as I gather?"
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,1412.736,1416.579,"Yes it is, certainly."
1964.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1615.089,1617.645,That is because of the real estate tax --
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,1617.645,1617.684,Yes sir.
1964.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1617.684,1618.769,-- is that you're telling us?
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,1618.769,1619.113,Yes sir.
1964.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1619.113,1624.76,"Because as a matter of fact, the domestic companies likely to own more real estate, is that what you're telling us?"
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,1624.76,1625.195,But I'm saying is --
1964.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1625.195,1626.069,Is that your point?
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,1626.069,1634.35,"-- Mr. Justice Stewart is that, these I think are logical basis of assumptions on the part of the Ohio legislature in enacting this in lieu of provision."
1964.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1634.35,1640.35,I just want to be -- I'm not sure I understood the supposed legislative assumption that you are telling us about.
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,1645.969,1651.954,"I think that is one of the possible justifiable assumptions, yes si8r."
1964.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1651.954,1664.354,"And with respect to real estate, are insurance companies taxed in the same way and at the same rate as any other real -- owner of real estate in Ohio?"
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,1664.354,1665.885,They are taxed in the same way.
1964.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1675.526,1680.842,"But in any given tax, the taxing district there tax as any other owner real estate in Ohio?"
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,1680.842,1681.608,Yes sir.
1964.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1683.468,1698.399,"And if a foreign insurance company does own real estate, that company is taxed with the same rate and in the same way at any given taxing district as a domestic insurance company or as any other owner of real estate, is that right?"
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,1698.399,1702.443,That is correct.
1964.96,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1933.874,1952.624,"Is there anything in the Wheeling Steel opinion to suggest that the Wheeling had come in after 1944, that seems to be -- have been different here?"
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,1952.624,1954.295,"I think, yes Your Honor."
1964.96,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1972.849,1982.181,"Well, is there any reference in that opinion, I've forgotten frankly, to the dates of admission to do business of either Wheeling Steel or in the other case, the Distillers case?"
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,1982.181,1982.609,No.
1964.96,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2005.696,2020.241,"Quite aside from that brief, the statement a little broad that the state can impose any condition it sees fit before admitting the corporation?"
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2020.241,2025.946,I think -- it's my understanding that as to the admission --
1964.96,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2025.946,2030.814,"Oh, I'm talking about uncon -- are there not some unconstitutional conditions, does they?"
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2030.814,2031.561,"Well, the obvious --"
1964.96,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2031.561,2032.279,(Voice Overlap)
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2032.279,2040.794,-- qualification is that it cannot require surrender of constitutional rights as a condition of admission.
1964.96,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2040.794,2042.141,Our federal constitutional rights (Voice Overlap) --
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2042.141,2042.206,That's correct.
1964.96,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2042.206,2043.207,(Inaudible)
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2043.207,2046.399,Yes sir.
1964.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2163.55,2170.055,"But it's a little bit -- at least conceptually or a matter of principle, it's a little more than just that, isn't it?"
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2242.448,2253.882,"Well, Your Honor, I really don't think the difference is very great because in the first place, this is not a change which was made after the company was admitted."
1964.96,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2282.788,2283.876,I see your point.
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2287.9,2288.301,That's right.
1964.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.47,2309.396,(Inaudible) when they are domesticated to a -- that they could maybe treated differently from other domesticated -- domestic corporations?
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2312.201,2312.479,I think --
1964.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.479,2320.19,"In Wheeling, although it said that once you admit them, you must be (Inaudible) you can get them to agree in advance that -- to waive that --"
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2320.19,2331.507,I think essentially the admission of a foreign corporation Your Honor is a matter of contract providing the contract does not go so far as to deprive the foreign corporation of their fundamental federal constitutional rights.
1964.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2331.507,2333.153,"Well, that's the question here."
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2333.153,2333.996,That's right.
1964.96,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2365.252,2390.207,"(Inaudible) foreign corporations is concerned, (Inaudible) to getting to a state, they make a contract anyway and that the state can require them to make a promise that they will pay more taxes than the other whatever the state's motive."
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2390.207,2390.227,This --
1964.96,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2390.227,2392.817,Do you say (Inaudible) constitution doesn't permit that?
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2392.817,2398.181,This was exactly the case in the Lincoln Insurance Company case in Oklahoma.
1964.96,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2415.316,2426.703,"You agree I suppose that if it had tried to attach a condition that courts held couldn't be done, they would not enter into the Federal Courts although the federal law gives them the right to do so."
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2430.012,2432.512,"I think that's true, they could not go that far."
1964.96,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2432.512,2449.203,"But you say here that they need a federal constitution nor provision nor federal law which permits the state if it wishes to the other corporation you can't come in here unless you agree in the interest of our businesses to pay a little more tax than they do, that's what you are saying in substance."
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2449.203,2459.795,"No, what I'm saying Justice Black is that it is not every distinction of degree that is unconstitutional."
1964.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2477.914,2489.286,What you're saying is the state may just ignore (Inaudible) of a foreign corporation as long as it (Inaudible)
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2489.286,2496.644,"No, I don't think that I would go that far Justice White."
1964.96,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.565,2515.097,So you're(Inaudible)-- you're really saying (Inaudible) --
1964.96,1,22705,edgar_l_lindley,,2515.097,2524.338,"That's true, with one minor exception, which I'd like to comment on in the close of my argument."
1964.96,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2753.928,2755.766,Mr. Weston.
1964.96,2,28362,harris_k_weston,,2755.766,2762.331,"Mr. Chief Justice, other justices, I'll be very brief in my reply."
1964.96,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2846.238,2867.272,"Well, suppose that in the -- suppose Ohio had a law, they had a law at that time provided generally that every foreign corporation that comes into the state to do business, every one of them must pay a little larger personal property tax."
1964.96,2,28362,harris_k_weston,,2886.51,2887.96,"Yes, Mr. Justice Black, it would."
1964.96,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2887.96,2889.221,I thought you would have to go to that.
1964.96,2,28362,harris_k_weston,,2889.221,2890.393,"Yes, I would."
1964.96,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2891.231,2903.221,That is because you would say that after they get in -- don't the -- didn't make any difference was the law was or what contract has been made or what the reasons were.
1964.96,2,28362,harris_k_weston,,2907.92,2909.272,Yes Mr. Justice Black.
1964.96,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2923.651,2925.138,That wasn't discussed but --
1964.96,2,28362,harris_k_weston,,2925.138,2926.173,That's right.
1964.96,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2972.167,2975.391,"Well, that's a -- that's not disputed is it?"
1964.96,2,28362,harris_k_weston,,2975.391,2985.294,"Well, it seemed to me that perhaps the state were saying that if they agreed in advance to pay a higher real -- property tax, that would be alright."
1964.96,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2985.294,2989.589,But that -- you still get back to whether the condition is an unconstitutional.
1964.96,2,28362,harris_k_weston,,2989.589,2990.234,That's correct.
1964.96,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2990.234,2996.27,"I do not understand that he contests with the idea, the state (Inaudible) power to do that."
1964.96,2,28362,harris_k_weston,,2996.547,2996.809,No.
1964.96,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2996.809,2999.288,-- with it -- this condition would not be an unconstitutional?
1964.96,2,28362,harris_k_weston,,2999.288,3000.23,Yes sir.
