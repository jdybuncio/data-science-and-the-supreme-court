1996.96-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.918,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 96-126, Walker Chandler v. Zell D. Miller, Governor of Georgia."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,11.13,15.05,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,53.826,54.447,Mr. Chandler--
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,54.447,54.727,Yes.
1996.96-126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,54.727,74.869,"--you say that the petitioners ran for office in '94, and in the petition you brought here there's no assertion that any of the petitioners plan to run again in the future, is there?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,74.869,80.663,"Not in the... as I recall, not in the actual pleadings in the lower court."
1996.96-126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,81.044,81.324,No.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,83.706,94.745,"--Your Honor, I believe this case would not be moot, because it would be capable of repetition and yet evading--"
1996.96-126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,94.745,98.796,"Well, how would it be if none of the petitioners plan to run again?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,98.796,101.568,"--Your Honor, I plan to run again."
1996.96-126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,101.568,103.391,But that was not stated--
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,103.391,104.941,That was not stated below.
1996.96-126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,137.571,162.528,"--Well, that's a merits argument, certainly, but normally we would look to see if there's some situation in a case like this of being capable of repetition and avoiding any review, and normally we would look to see some avowal that yes, indeed, these petitioners or at least one of them intends to run again."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,162.528,164.519,"--Yes, I understand that."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,164.519,170.293,And you didn't seek to bring this on behalf of a class of candidates.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,170.293,172.644,"No, sir, Your Honor, I did not."
1996.96-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,172.644,173.746,Mr. Chandler--
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,173.746,174.627,Yes.
1996.96-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.627,186.055,"--I'm wondering why, if you want to raise this issue, you don't have to refuse to take the drug test, rather than go ahead and take it and get on the ballot and then challenge it later."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,186.055,197.792,"Your Honor, we filed this action prior to submitting to the test, prior to qualification by having this little piece of paper that certified us as being drug-free."
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,213.34,216.903,"When did you file the suit, before the election or after the election?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,216.903,218.986,"Before the election, Your Honor, in May of--"
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.986,222.106,So at that time there's no doubt that the case was not moot.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,222.106,222.937,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,222.937,225.078,At that time it was very much alive.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,225.078,225.588,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,225.588,233.836,"So the complaint is that you... what, that you didn't amend your complaint in order to assert repetition after the election?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,242.759,244.291,"I don't know, Justice Scalia."
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.291,246.392,I don't recall we've ever required that.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,253.197,253.758,"Yes, sir."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,275.682,283.237,"Suppose that a State agency said, in the interests of all of our employees, everyone once a year must take a physical exam."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,291.012,296.185,"Yes, Your Honor, I would think that would be a search."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,296.185,299.487,"When does a search arise, when you go into the doctor's office?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,299.487,303.59,"I would think so, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,303.59,305.661,Even though the results are disclosed only to you?
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,305.661,314.347,"I would think that it would be a search, because if the result of that search is that you can no longer serve in that agency, then--"
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.347,314.707,"No, no."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,322.841,329.897,"--Well, I would think, Your Honor, that's... with all due respect, that's not before the Court, and... but the--"
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,329.897,341.034,"Well, there are a lot of things that are not before the Court that are going to be before the Court based on this opinion, and so we have to write an opinion that covers more than your particular case because we're interested in the general principle."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,341.034,341.695,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,342.296,344.026,So I'm asking why this is a search.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,344.026,350.471,"--I would think that it would be a search if, as a result of that search, a person could lose employment."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,350.471,352.532,That's not my hypothetical.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,367.251,367.622,"Yes, sir."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,367.622,368.994,"The agency pays for it, or whatever."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,370.223,383.333,"I would think it would be a search under the principles of... that were announced in Schermberger, which drew a distinction between bodily searches--"
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,383.333,384.893,"That is to say, Schmerber?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,384.893,385.684,"--Yes, sir."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,385.684,400.272,"Well, there the... involuntarily a needle was inserted in the... with the patient by a doctor who was not of his choice at a time that was not of his choice."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,408.648,411.79,"It may well be, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.79,412.451,It may well be?
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,418.155,418.906,"Yes, sir."
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.906,426.029,"And you're saying that that's not a search, requiring you to go to somebody else and strip down and have that person examine your body?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,426.029,426.53,I think it's--
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,426.53,429.044,What possibly could be a search if that's not a search?
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,429.044,429.973,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,429.973,435.827,"I mean, you might want to argue about whether it's an unreasonable search, but you don't have any doubt it's a search, do you?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,435.827,436.508,"No, sir, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,436.508,470.729,"Mr. Chandler, would you have any problem if what the State did instead of requiring a drug test within 30 days of filing your nominating petition is require every candidate for the State office to file an affidavit certifying that the candidate is not now and has not in the past used or ingested illegal narcotic drugs?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,470.729,474.121,"I would object to that, Your Honor, because that would--"
1996.96-126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,474.121,475.073,There's no search.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,475.073,476.533,"--There is no search, but I--"
1996.96-126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,476.533,480.896,It certainly wouldn't... you wouldn't be here on the basis that you are here today.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,480.896,482.365,--That would be true.
1996.96-126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,482.365,489.482,"And a State has wide latitude, does it not, to define qualifications for State office?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,489.482,496.985,"Yes, so long as those... so long as they do not violate people's constitutional protections."
1996.96-126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,496.985,507.243,"And what constitutional protection would be violated by requiring such an affidavit, that to be a candidate for State office you certify that you're not a drug abuser?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,507.243,511.227,"Or never have been in your hypothetical, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,516.941,519.741,I'm asking on what constitutional basis.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,519.741,526.945,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, I fail to know of a constitutional basis that that might fit within that hypothetical."
1996.96-126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,526.945,528.277,You just wouldn't like it.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,528.277,529.579,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,536.014,563.703,"Well, if you had to take an oath that you have never been disloyal to the Government of the United States, of a State, or you've never been a member of, say, the Socialist Party, then you might have an objection under a different amendment than the one you're claiming, but you are claiming the Fourth Amendment, and you are doing it in relation to a bodily intrusion."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,586.096,597.943,--I think that there the Court has drawn distinctions in the past between bodily searches and financial disclosure.
1996.96-126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,603.049,615.726,"But the Fourth Amendment does say persons, houses, papers, so why would you say that it's all right to demand papers but not have anything to do with the person?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,615.726,626.395,"Because I think there is a strong, compelling privacy interest in the person that goes far beyond the compelling... any compelling interest--"
1996.96-126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,626.395,629.376,Where do you get that from in the Constitution?
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,629.376,635.24,"--Justice Ginsburg, I do not know."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,635.24,635.87,"Well, isn't--"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,651.129,652.812,"I think it's the former, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,657.294,669.551,"So you think most people would think that that's more of an invasion of privacy, just going to the doctor once a year, than having to disclose all of your financial records, all of your holding, all of your poverty or all of your wealth, as the case may be?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,669.551,676.206,"--There is a big distinction in this case, Your Honor, and that is that if I disclose my wealth I cannot be kept off the ballot."
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,676.206,679.558,"Mr. Chandler, every invasion of privacy is not a search, is it?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,701.272,703.973,"Yes sir, I would deem it a search."
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,703.973,704.775,You think it's a search?
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,704.775,705.395,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.395,709.647,"So when I ask you, you know, are you a drug addict, I'm searching you?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,730.102,735.966,"I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor, I'm not exactly sure of the contradiction that I've voiced here."
1996.96-126,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,735.966,773.299,"Mr. Chandler, going back to Justice Ginsburg's question, assuming that you had actually to disclose papers, produce papers as distinct simply from producing information, so that there really were... in the same sense that we're talking with here, there really were a search involved, I take it that your answer would... I take it that your answer to the question would not necessarily be the same as your position here, because the governmental interests involved are different."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,799.466,799.846,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,801.897,819.619,"And your real argument before us, I take it, doesn't go to the scope of what is or is not a search, but the scope of what is permissible on the grounds that the government does have a justification which is sufficiently weighty to make that search a reasonable one."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,821.232,832.569,"Well, I certainly felt like it was a... that a financial search or a financial disclosure was a more reasonable government requirement than a drug test."
1996.96-126,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,832.569,837.28,"All right, and what is your reason for saying that this particular search is not a reasonable one?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,841.473,846.456,"First, there is no real evidence of a real problem."
1996.96-126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.496,916.355,"Mr. Chandler, at the outset of your argument you mentioned that there was a... the statute originally applied to all State employees, and that that was held invalid."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,918.945,922.177,"Federal court, but that was a companion statute, not this statute."
1996.96-126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.177,924.539,"I understand, but who held it unconstitutional?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,924.539,925.938,The district court in Atlanta.
1996.96-126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.938,928.79,"A State district court, or a Federal district court?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,928.79,929.511,"A Federal district court, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.511,930.672,Was that case appealed?
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,930.672,931.992,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,931.992,934.123,When was that?
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,934.323,936.026,That was in 1990.
1996.96-126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.026,936.777,--1990.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,936.777,937.335,"Yes, sir."
1996.96-126,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,937.335,938.367,Thank you.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,938.367,942.09,This... a very similar case was brought in the district court.
1996.96-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,977.113,992.243,"Well, the statute here, Mr. Chandler, does single out certain high-ranking State offices, and I think... I would think you're in a position... you ran for what, lieutenant governor?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,992.243,992.804,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,992.804,997.236,You're in a position to challenge the requirement for lieutenant governor.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1015.207,1021.802,"First, Your Honor, the... my coplaintiff, Sharon Harris, ran for commissioner of agriculture."
1996.96-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1029.286,1036.943,"Well, Georgia, then you feel can't adopt a prophylactic rule that says we want to make sure it doesn't become a problem?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1036.943,1038.862,"No, sir, I do not think they can."
1996.96-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1046.807,1056.745,"What if the Georgia statute, instead of reading the way it does, had said everybody has to take this drug test but anybody can get on the ballot."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1059.777,1070.593,"Your Honor, that might be more permissible in my opinion, because then it would at least leave it to the voters to decide whether they want to choose a person who submits to a test, who passes a test--"
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1070.593,1070.844,Why--
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1070.844,1072.156,--or who refuses a test.
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1072.156,1074.496,--I thought you were complaining about the search.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1074.496,1074.707,Yes.
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1074.707,1076.86,"The search would be exactly the same in that situation, wouldn't it?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1076.86,1077.01,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1077.01,1079.131,So how would it be any better?
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1096.311,1101.494,"I certainly object to the search as a prerequisite to being... to ballot placement, Justice Scalia."
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1101.494,1103.006,"Well, isn't there a search in this other case?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1104.426,1106.169,In which other case?
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1106.169,1113.703,"In the case the Chief Justice put to you, where you had to undergo the same search, but you could run whether it came out positive or negative."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1113.703,1120.008,"Well, I'm just saying that there's... that that would not... I think it's for the people of Georgia to decide whether or not you can be on the ballot, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1120.008,1124.542,"I'm sorry, I just don't understand, given that your objection is to the search--"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1124.542,1124.97,Yes.
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1124.97,1127.254,--why you would not... if it is to the search.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1127.254,1127.444,Yes.
1996.96-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.444,1128.093,Maybe it's not.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1135.569,1140.571,"Well, obviously, Your Honor, I have objected to the search."
1996.96-126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1140.571,1142.273,Or take another example.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1158.803,1166.677,"I would object to that because, Justice Ginsburg, there's no showing that there is a problem."
1996.96-126,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1166.677,1173.262,"--Well then, how does that differ from in between the time that you're on the ballot and the time that you're elected?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1180.207,1191.865,"I believe this Court has held, at least since the Carroll case in 1925, that blanket searches are intolerable, and that that would just be a blanket search."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1191.865,1196.928,And would that be the same if every employee was required to get a physical examination once a year?
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1196.928,1198.59,"Yes, sir, I believe it would be."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1216.91,1223.896,"And that's because you object to the intrusion of going into the doctor's office, not the disclosure of the result?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1223.896,1228.989,"--Insofar as that intrusion is forced upon me by the State, yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1228.989,1237.453,"Mr. Chandler, I guess the test under the Fourth Amendment is whether the search is reasonable."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1269.706,1287.406,"I do not think so, Justice O'Connor, because there's a difference between the contractual relationship between employee and an employer and the political relationship between the government and candidates, and people who wish to be a part of that government."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1293.481,1306.55,"You'd have no problem with the law saying... or maybe you do, but if a high official, say the Governor, uses drugs, he is immediately disqualified from office, illegal drugs?"
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1306.55,1308.881,"Your Honor, for one thing, that--"
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1308.881,1310.052,Would you have a problem with that?
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1310.052,1311.122,"--I would even have a problem with that, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1311.122,1311.412,Why?
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1311.412,1318.808,"For one thing, that presupposes that the person that's in the high office has broken the laws of the State of Georgia."
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1353.56,1364.276,You think drug use is irrelevant to the abilities and the qualifications of a public officeholder?
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1364.276,1370.932,"--Your Honor, I would think that that would be a matter of a question of how long ago was it, the frequency of use--"
1996.96-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1370.932,1373.583,"Let's just suppose, during his term of office."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1373.583,1380.027,"--During his term of office, Your Honor, again it might be a question of frequency."
1996.96-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1384.451,1385.45,If they're illegal drugs--
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1385.45,1385.801,--If--
1996.96-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1385.801,1389.173,--would you distinguish between illegal drugs?
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1389.173,1395.058,"--Your Honor, we would like always for our elected officials to be people who obey the law."
1996.96-126,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1412.829,1424.115,"But Mr. Chandler, I think the issue that's been raised is at least so far not an issue of search, as such, but an issue of substantive qualification."
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1445.35,1449.174,I do not think that would be unconstitutional.
1996.96-126,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1449.174,1449.464,Okay.
1996.96-126,0,44301,walker_l_chandler,,1449.464,1460.922,"One of the issues here is, are there adequate protections that the people and the governments have to answer these questions?"
1996.96-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1505.858,1507.09,"Very well, Mr. Chandler."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1510.172,1519.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1542.485,1543.795,Does Georgia think this case is moot?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1543.795,1553.933,Georgia thinks that the injunctive relief that Mr. Chandler and the co-petitioner sought with respect to the 1994 election is certainly moot.
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1568.532,1579.769,"Even in the absence of... that the petitioners would seek office in the future, and in the absence of a class action?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1579.769,1584.152,"Justice O'Connor, we would admit that that question is close."
1996.96-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1622.76,1623.558,I hope we didn't say that.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1630.294,1631.095,I believe--
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1631.095,1635.747,"How could we say, even if it's moot we have jurisdiction?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1635.747,1639.19,"--If it is not... if it is moot, the Court does not have jurisdiction."
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1639.19,1641.541,You said that's what we have said.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1641.541,1649.265,"To be truthful, my reading of those cases makes it unclear as to what the Court was saying in each particular case."
1996.96-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.265,1656.791,"Do you think it's a pleading question, Ms Guilday, that whether a case is moot or not depends on what has been pleaded, as opposed to what exists?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1663.854,1668.107,Your question asked whether it was a pleading--
1996.96-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1668.107,1672.89,"I mean, it seems to me it's moot if he has no intention of running again."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1677.374,1678.055,"--No, we do not."
1996.96-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1678.055,1678.814,It seems to me the case is not moot.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1698.979,1706.994,"That is correct, but in the elections context, whether this particular candidate decides to run again, certainly there will be other candidates who may make--"
1996.96-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1706.994,1709.124,But he didn't ask for a class action.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1709.124,1709.926,--He did not.
1996.96-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1709.926,1714.568,And he has represented in Court today that he does intend to run again.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1714.568,1715.689,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1715.689,1719.142,"So if it's a pleading defect, it's a curable one."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1719.142,1722.525,"Correct, and that was going to be my response to Justice Scalia's question."
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1731.12,1732.79,So how does this work?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1766.964,1778.39,"--It works, Your Honor, in fact that Mr. Chandler and the other petitioners pled in their complaint, or they requested in their complaint for declaratory relief as well as relief--"
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1778.39,1786.105,"I don't see why that matters if it isn't a class action, and if there's no claim that he is going to run again."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1795.261,1797.052,--This Court--
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1797.052,1797.983,--how does this all work?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1807.5,1814.783,"--This Court has responded to that very argument in the series of cases that I've just cited, which are in the elections context."
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1823.258,1827.853,Isn't it a class action on behalf of other people who are clearly going to run?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1827.853,1830.665,--I do not believe that all of those were class actions.
1996.96-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1831.836,1841.781,"Ms. Guilday, as I understand it, when this complaint was filed he didn't have to assert that he intended to run again because the election had not yet occurred."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1846.025,1846.936,--That is absolutely correct.
1996.96-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.936,1852.328,So the only issue is whether he had some obligation after the election to amend the complaint.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1859.322,1861.214,Because we believed that the--
1996.96-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1861.214,1862.154,Did the State do that?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1862.154,1862.754,"--No, it did not."
1996.96-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1862.754,1865.267,So why would he amend his complaint?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1874.582,1875.162,The district court--
1996.96-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1875.162,1879.837,"I can't imagine why he would have amended his complaint, no one having raised this issue."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1936.755,1940.075,"--There is no such record evidence in this case, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1940.075,1943.488,Was any offered by the State and rejected?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1943.488,1944.529,"No, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1967.042,1977.31,Is there any indication anywhere in this record that Georgia has a particular problem here with State officeholders being drug abusers?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,1977.31,1982.744,"No, there is no such evidence, Your Honor, and there is no... to be frank, there is no such problem as we sit here today."
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1982.744,2002.607,"Has this Court, in dealing with suspicionless searches, looked to what special needs there might be that would be an indication that a suspicionless... a blanket, suspicionless search would be appropriate?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2006.823,2009.585,I think the question as to whether there is a special--
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2009.585,2011.195,"Have we looked to that, or not?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2020.991,2021.552,--Absolutely.
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2021.552,2023.153,--for a suspicionless search program?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2023.153,2024.972,"Absolutely, the Court has looked at special need."
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2024.972,2025.152,Okay.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2029.226,2040.703,The special need that Georgia asserts is that in Georgia the elected officials that are included in this statute are by constitution trustees and servants of the public.
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2049.509,2067.44,"Could Georgia require, instead of a physical search, an affidavit of a proposed candidate that that candidate is not now and has not been in the past a drug abuser, or user of illegal drugs?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2067.44,2072.464,That requirement would raise issues involving the Fifth Amendment.
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2092.079,2100.163,And you think a State could not ask a candidate to make some affidavit or certification regarding illegal drug use?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2100.163,2101.084,--I believe it could not.
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2101.084,2106.237,Even if the State offers criminal immunity for making that statement?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2106.237,2115.623,"That would then raise questions as to Federal law, would that State immunity affect any Federal drug enforcement--"
1996.96-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2115.623,2126.079,What is your reason for saying that the State could not require an affidavit that you had not used illegal drugs as a candidate?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2126.079,2140.449,"--I think the question would, one, put in... it would be more intrusive and be more violative of the First Amendment rights of the individual to say, I have or have not in my past used illegal drugs."
1996.96-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2140.449,2143.821,What First Amendment right is violated there?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2143.821,2153.718,The compelled... the State is compelling him to make a statement which he may or may not want to make.
1996.96-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2153.718,2164.484,"Well, what if the State were to require a candidate to file an affidavit saying that he had complied with the financial disclosure laws of the State, and--"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2164.484,2166.087,I think the State does require that.
1996.96-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2166.087,2170.218,"--And would that, too, be a violation of the First Amendment?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2170.218,2170.879,It would not.
1996.96-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2170.879,2172.802,Why is one different from the other?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2172.802,2179.886,"The difference is, this Court has upheld the validity of the financial disclosure laws in several cases."
1996.96-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.886,2182.777,But we've never upheld the validity of drug laws?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2182.777,2185.399,You've upheld the validity of drug laws.
1996.96-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2194.664,2198.647,"But why isn't the First Amendment issue, if there is one, the same in each case?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2207.343,2212.877,"The issue in the First Amendment is, how intrusive is that of the First Amendment right?"
1996.96-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2212.877,2219.85,So it's more intrusive to find out that a person has violated the drug laws than they've violated the financial disclosure laws?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2219.85,2225.276,The Georgia statute does not require a citizen to state that he has violated the drug law.
1996.96-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2225.276,2228.428,"No, but this is a hypothetical."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2228.428,2235.711,As to an affidavit saying I have not violated the drug laws?
1996.96-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2235.711,2235.981,Yes.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2235.981,2246.768,"I still think that is more intrusive, because it is covering a larger period of time than is a drug test on one specific day that discloses only the presence of five specific drugs."
1996.96-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2246.768,2253.473,May I ask in that connection whether it would be constitutional or not to require an affidavit?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2259.337,2262.509,"This Court has established that it is a search, so--"
1996.96-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2262.509,2289.516,"Now, similarly we go into the financial disclosure area and say an affidavit describing one's finances would not be a search, but do you think under the reasoning you're advancing in this case that Georgia could constitutionally require every candidate for public office to say not only what his finances are but say, you may examine all of my private papers in order to be sure I haven't committed a violation of law in the past, and you'd get a full picture of my finances."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2300.123,2301.254,--That would not be permissible.
1996.96-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2301.254,2304.597,"Why not, because it would probably weed out the unqualified candidates."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2304.597,2313.622,The test comes down again to balancing how intrusive is the nature of that infringement on First Amendment rights versus how intrusive is it in the Fourth Amendment context.
1996.96-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.622,2316.384,You'd rather have your papers searched than your body searched?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2321.717,2324.048,I'm not sure it's a question of which I would rather.
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2348.947,2357.832,"--Well, I suppose there are Federal laws that say income tax returns are not open to examination by third parties."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2357.832,2360.403,"--That's the point I'm making, that to compel--"
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2360.403,2374.622,"But there's no Federal law, is there, saying that a State may not require a proposed candidate to make certain certifications or affidavits before being a candidate?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2378.805,2379.254,--There's no--
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2379.254,2386.8,--restricting the qualifications that a State may set for its elected officials?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2386.8,2392.864,"--The same constraints that apply in this case, and that is the First Amendment, how in the elections context--"
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2392.864,2408.235,You think the First Amendment is violated by seeking... by a State requiring an affidavit of a potential candidate disclosing all criminal offenses of which the candidate has been convicted in the past?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2408.235,2410.566,--Perhaps we should look at the Tenth Amendment.
1996.96-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2425.146,2429.708,"Well, I wouldn't have thought you could derive all of that from the Tenth Amendment."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2434.412,2442.498,"This Court has used the Tenth Amendment to authorize the States to control their own elections, to regulate their own elections."
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2444.578,2459.317,So you take the position that a State cannot ask... make it a requirement for a candidate for State office to file an affidavit disclosing criminal offenses of which that proposed candidate has been convicted?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2459.317,2462.239,"--No, I do not take that position because criminal--"
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2462.239,2466.323,"You just did in response to my question, so what is your answer?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2467.615,2468.844,--My answer is--
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2468.844,2469.615,Yes or no.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2469.615,2473.388,"--Yes, if it is otherwise constitutional."
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2475.89,2480.012,"Well, what other constitutional issues does that raise?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2489.238,2489.729,--No.
1996.96-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2489.729,2490.9,--on a proposed candidate?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2490.9,2492.389,"No, and that was going to be my answer."
1996.96-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2520.008,2522.76,Can you... have you finished your answer to Justice O'Connor?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2556.162,2557.403,"--I'm sorry, your hypothetical--"
1996.96-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2557.403,2581.099,"My hypothetical is, the State requires not just a financial disclosure affidavit, but an opening up of the candidate's records for examination by a representative of the election commission, or whatever it is, to find out if this man may have committed some crimes or done a lot of bad things that the electorate would like to know about, such as possibly buying and selling drugs from time to time, which might be revealed by his financial records."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2592.466,2599.832,"--It comes back to the same balancing test, and that is, how invasive are those... is that restriction, or--"
1996.96-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2599.832,2609.297,They're invasive in that they reveal everything that's in writing in your private files about your correspondence with people and your financial transactions.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2609.297,2618.373,--I think that requirement would require the candidate to disclose much more information than would be permitted under the Fourth Amendment.
1996.96-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.373,2621.655,Do you think it would violate... that statute would violate the Fourth Amendment?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2621.655,2622.146,I do.
1996.96-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.146,2627.028,"And your reason for saying, this is different, is that the search is less intrusive?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2627.028,2630.091,"Exactly, just as this Court has held in Skinner, Von Raab, and Acton."
1996.96-126,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2630.091,2633.343,Because it is a body search as opposed to a paper search?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2633.343,2636.367,I don't think the distinction is body versus paper.
1996.96-126,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2639.166,2642.919,"Well, what about a case... let's take a building search."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2679.294,2680.804,I believe it certainly would violate the Fourth Amendment.
1996.96-126,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2680.804,2686.137,And why is opening the house less intrusive than opening the body?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2686.137,2691.062,The difference is in the information that is disclosed.
1996.96-126,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2691.062,2701.738,"Well, the information in the one case says there are no drug residues in the body, and the information in the other case is, there are no drugs in the house."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2706.873,2707.731,There's two distinctions.
1996.96-126,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2718.841,2733.17,"And he then has to pass it on... and I guess I was assuming... maybe I didn't state it carefully enough, but I was assuming that in my example he would have to pass on the certification from the private investigatory agency."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2746.937,2751.399,--The private investigatory agency has learned a substantial amount of information.
1996.96-126,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2751.399,2757.043,"Well, so does the laboratory or the tester in the case of the bodily search."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2757.043,2760.376,The tester learns only the presence of those five drugs.
1996.96-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2770.934,2773.606,Or the amount of what is searched also.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2785.143,2786.164,That's absolutely true.
1996.96-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2786.164,2788.435,Your point here is this is just a urinalysis.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2802.725,2810.109,"Not within some 30 days of your choosing, 30 days within the qualifying deadlines for the particular office that you were running for."
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2810.109,2813.09,"Is it a deadline, or is it when he files?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2818.665,2819.176,No.
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2820.497,2822.866,"It has to be... in other words, the deadline's September 30."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2824.238,2829.962,--The particular offices that are involved in the statute have particular times for qualifying.
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2829.962,2832.553,So you have to be 30 days previous to that.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2832.553,2832.924,Right.
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2832.924,2834.965,You find one day where you go in and you're drug-free.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2834.965,2837.696,That's correct.
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2837.696,2839.557,"All right, so how's that supposed to prove anything?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2844.582,2847.924,"As this Court held in Von Raab, perhaps the greatest druggie in the world could not."
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2847.924,2849.205,Is that right?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2861.984,2863.546,"That, of course--"
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2863.546,2868.99,"Suppose he stays off drugs for a month preceding, or 2 months preceding the test."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2868.99,2874.713,"--If that particular individual can do that, yes, you're right, when he goes in for his drug test, his drug test is going to become positive--"
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2874.713,2883.469,"How long in advance of the test do you have to stay off drugs if a moderate drug user, before the moderate drug user is drug-free on the day of the test?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2886.24,2893.266,--The cases before this Court have cited expert testimony giving a range of from 22 days until a month before.
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2893.266,2893.737,All right.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2896.338,2897.119,It's doing--
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2897.119,2901.942,Is it simply... what is the theory behind the statute other than making a political statement?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2915.558,2918.082,"--I think that is one purpose, to--"
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2918.082,2930.869,"Is that an important purpose, a purpose that we find those people in society who are not able to stay off drugs for 22 days and therefore... is that the basic idea?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2930.869,2933.072,"--That is not the primary reason, no."
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2949.603,2955.546,"Has this Court ever gone into the... I mean, I thought in Vernonia, for example they're like random drug-testing."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2958.458,2959.329,That's correct.
1996.96-126,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2959.329,2962.399,Have there been cases which are not random drug-testing?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2962.399,2974.828,"Von Raab involved pre-employment or pre-promotion testing, one-time basis, of individuals who sought positions in the various categories."
1996.96-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2976.431,2996.702,"Ms. Guilday, do I understand you correctly that your major reason, Georgia's major reason is symbolic to the extent I think you said they wanted the public... they wanted the people who were in public office to have what it takes to exercise their best judgment."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,2997.752,2999.414,That is our purpose.
1996.96-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3011.413,3012.945,"--This is my question, then."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,3049.807,3054.422,My way of answering that question is what I started saying in the beginning.
1996.96-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3061.404,3074.654,"But my question to you is, then, doesn't the Fourth Amendment always win on that balance unless you have a good reason, a reason beyond, we want to show that these people take tests."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,3085.972,3093.638,--The Fourth Amendment always wins out if in that balancing test the government interests are not sufficient to outweigh the privacy interest.
1996.96-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3104.073,3110.898,"Then go for... once they're in office, and they're going to be in and maybe run for election, so do this periodically?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,3117.603,3121.164,"--No, the balancing is no less in that context."
1996.96-126,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3128.31,3142.278,"But you could... as a matter of constitutional law, Georgia could say, annually, or even randomly, everyone in office in this State has to have a drug test."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,3142.278,3147.33,"--Everyone in the category of offices that are included in the statute, yes, I believe Georgia could have--"
1996.96-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3147.33,3160.14,"But if you rely on the public's right to know everything about the candidate, as I think you described it, it seems to me that that would justify a totally unrestricted search of the house and all private papers."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,3160.14,3163.883,--I said that and I... and that is a quote from one of this Court's cases.
1996.96-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3168.926,3174.279,"And the Constitution looks a little more closely at totally suspicionless searches, doesn't it?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,3174.279,3174.75,It does.
1996.96-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3174.75,3175.591,Yes.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,3203.928,3215.187,"The Tenth Amendment argument is, in this balancing test that's required in the Fourth Amendment, that in the usual context the scales start out even for both sides."
1996.96-126,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3221.131,3221.332,Why?
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,3221.332,3237.673,"--Because the Tenth Amendment in the cases this Court has held in the elections context say, we are going to give great deference to the State's own characterizations of its interest in the elections and in particular in the qualifications of its elected officials."
1996.96-126,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3237.673,3258.006,"Well, there's no question of there being an assertable Tenth Amendment interest there, but there's no question about there being an assertable Tenth Amendment interest to prosecute homicide, but that doesn't affect the balancing that goes on in determining... or that does not affect the Fourth Amendment analysis."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,3258.006,3259.506,I'm not sure I understand--
1996.96-126,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3259.506,3274.276,"Well, I suppose if someone challenged the right of the State to prosecute murder we would say, well, that certainly is not one of those powers that was taken away from the State when the national Constitution was ratified."
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,3274.276,3275.007,--That's absolutely--
1996.96-126,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3275.007,3288.236,I don't see how that would affect the Fourth Amendment analysis when somebody objected to an unreasonable search and seizure that had resulted in evidence that the State wanted to introduce in a homicide case.
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,3288.236,3297.222,--The distinction being that the Tenth Amendment and in particular the elections context has repeatedly been given by this Court special consideration.
1996.96-126,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3299.544,3306.958,"Well, we've said that a great deal of discretion over elections is within the State's power, but that's as far as we've gone, isn't it?"
1996.96-126,1,37916,patricia_guilday,,3309.89,3311.111,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1996.96-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3311.111,3312.633,"Mr. Chandler, you have 5 minutes remaining."
1996.96-126,2,44301,walker_l_chandler,,3312.633,3344.273,"An interesting aspect of the Tenth Amendment question to me is that that the States... that which was not granted to the Federal Government specifically was... the rights not granted to the Federal Government was reserved to the States or the people respectively, and when the States appear to jealously protect their rights, they are not so jealous in protecting the rights that the people reserved unto themselves, and one of those rights is that a citizen should be free from unreasonable searches and seizures."
1996.96-126,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3344.273,3349.278,"Mr Chandler, do you think this case would be stronger for the State if it was random drug-testing?"
1996.96-126,2,44301,walker_l_chandler,,3353.069,3356.511,"It would not comfort me, Your Honor, and I'm not sure--"
1996.96-126,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3356.511,3381.639,"This is stronger, isn't it, because it says... basically what she said was that this is the State's interest only in making certain that the really serious drug users who can't stay off drugs for 30 days, which you have to be quite a heavy user, that they want to identify those people, so she said that's a very important interest, identifying these very, very heavy drug users, and against that it's a fairly limited intrusion."
1996.96-126,2,44301,walker_l_chandler,,3385.682,3394.518,--The State might be in a better position if they had some sort of random search system for people who had been elected to office.
1996.96-126,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3423.356,3432.473,"Well, what if they show that there was a commission of agriculture in Alabama and a lieutenant governor in Alabama who turned out to drug addicts."
