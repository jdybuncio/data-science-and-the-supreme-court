1986.85-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.891,"We will hear arguments next in No. 85-766, Julia H. Tashjian, Secretary of State of Connecticut, versus Republican Party of Connecticut, et al.--"
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,56.253,100.615,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves a conflict between Section 9-431 of the Connecticut General Statutes which requires that persons be enrolled members of a political party when they vote in that party's primary election, and a rule adopted by the Republican Party of the State of Connecticut that would, contrary to that state law, allow unaffiliated voters to vote in Republican primaries for United States Senate, United States House of Representatives, Governor, and certain other state executive offices."
1986.85-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.785,236.653,"When you say enrollment, is that synonymous with registration?"
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,236.653,243.141,--It is synonymous with participation in a party primary.
1986.85-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,243.141,246.343,"It is enrollment for the convention, not for primary voting?"
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,246.343,249.628,It is enrollment for purposes of the primary.
1986.85-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,249.628,256.901,Does it differ in some way from what in other states would be called registration to vote in the primary?
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,256.901,258.384,"No, it does not."
1986.85-766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,268.089,268.505,"Oh, I see--"
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,275.909,276.793,That's correct.
1986.85-766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,276.793,281.647,"You have to say, I am a Republican and I want to vote in the Republican primary, for example."
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,281.647,293.388,"Justice O'Connor, a simple form simply requires statement of name and address and a desire to enroll in that party for purposes of that primary."
1986.85-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,293.388,299.709,So under Connecticut terminology you register to vote in a general election but you enroll to vote in the primary?
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,299.709,304.279,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.416,316.903,Do you have to be already registered to vote in the general election to enroll and successfully vote in the primary?
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,316.903,321.724,"You have to be a registered voter to enroll in a party primary, Your Honor."
1986.85-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,321.724,329.978,"If you have... to register to vote in the general election, may you say you are a Republican or a Democrat?"
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,329.978,333.032,You may be a Republican or a Democrat or unaffiliated voter.
1986.85-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.032,333.298,Or an independent.
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,341.036,355.278,"When you enroll in a primary you are then listed as a Republican or as a Democrat or as an unaffiliated voter for purposes of any other election unless one elects to disaffiliate from that party, which is also a very simple process."
1986.85-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,355.278,362.432,"But if you have registered as a Republican for the general election, in the last election, then your registration is still good?"
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,362.432,363.334,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,363.334,367.919,If you choose to vote in the Democratic primary it doesn't change that registration.
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,367.919,369.305,"That is correct, Justice White."
1986.85-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,493.519,495.388,What if this weren't a major party.
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,502.625,509.362,"Yes, Justice Scalla, this case would be a different case were a minor party or petitioning party involved."
1986.85-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.362,513.515,"Now, does the law apply equivalently to minor parties?"
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,513.515,519.503,"No, Your Honor, different laws apply to minor parties and petitioning parties."
1986.85-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.503,520.352,What is the test of minor?
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,520.352,530.811,The test of a minor party is whether or not the candidate in a previous election has received 1 percent of the vote for that office.
1986.85-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.961,532.827,That is not very major.
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,532.827,534.346,--That's correct.
1986.85-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.346,536.965,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Gerson."
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,536.965,537.148,Thank you.
1986.85-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.148,546.654,"You may resume, Mr. Gerson."
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,546.654,572.238,"Mr. Chief Justice, just to further elaborate on Justice Scalla's point about minor parties, as I stated, a party qualifies as a minor party by receiving 1 percent of the vote for an office, but remains a minor party generally until that party receives 20 percent of the vote in a gubernatorial election."
1986.85-766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,618.533,626.606,"Mr. Gerson, do you concede that a political party does have a protected First Amendment right to define its own membership?"
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,626.606,640.032,"--Justice O'Connor, it does have such a right to define its own membership, but membership in a political party is not equivalent to qualification for voting in a party primary."
1986.85-766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,651.304,657.042,So you reject the concept that there is any First Amendment right at stake here at all?
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,657.042,664.398,"Your Honor, a party certainly has First Amendment associational rights with respect to its internal affairs."
1986.85-766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,695.0,709.427,"Well, but I guess the party is taking the position that they want to have the votes counted of people who are interested enough to at least cast their vote with the party in the selection of candidates."
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,713.712,717.282,"No, Justice O'Connor, I don't think it is."
1986.85-766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,738.112,748.135,"Well, if the Court were to determine there is some First Amendment right to be protected here, what standard or test do you think we would have to employ?"
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,748.135,769.398,"--Justice O'Connor, in the context of a challenge to an election statute, a state statute such as this, the appropriate test would be that the state may adopt a neutral, nondiscriminatory restriction, and such a restriction is constitutional as long as the state has a reasonable regulatory interest with the burden being on the challenger."
1986.85-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.837,910.574,"What benefits, Mr. Gerson, did Charies Evans Hughes and the American Political Science Association think flowed from the closed primary?"
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,910.574,913.443,"A number of them, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1986.85-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,958.305,971.398,"But in your general election you certainly want the votes of the people not unless they registered in the primary, so anyone who becomes an elected official is almost surely going to become the elected official by virtue of votes other than from members of the party."
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,971.398,994.347,"Absolutely, Justice Rehnquist, but then again, given the role of major parties in our states, there is an important interest in the state ensuring that a candidate of a political party is the representative of that party for a citizen or for a voter to be able to go to that party about the accountability of that particular elected official."
1986.85-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.532,1028.984,"When you... how do independents get on the ballot in Connecticut, or do they?"
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,1028.984,1032.805,An independent candidate can get on the ballot by--
1986.85-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.805,1033.755,Petitioning?
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,1033.755,1035.138,--petitioning.
1986.85-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1035.138,1041.059,And he doesn't need to belong to a political party?
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,1041.059,1042.827,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-766,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1042.827,1048.648,He can get on the ballot and be voted for or against without ever being... belonging to a party?
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,1048.648,1049.748,"That is correct, Justice White."
1986.85-766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1093.193,1098.747,"Mr. Gerson, I am still concerned about the extent to which there may be a First Amendment interest."
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,1120.328,1122.428,"--No, Justice O'Connor, I don't believe it is."
1986.85-766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1153.549,1168.892,"Well, certainly there is language in the opinion to the effect that Democratic Party implicitly assumes that freedom of association creates a presumption that it may participate in deciding who votes in a primary."
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,1168.892,1202.613,"Justice O'Connor, that is correct, and I think it is also one reason why this Court has repeatedly recognized in election cases that any election code is going to inevitably affect the associational interests or at least the asserted associational interests of a political party, and if the opinion of the Court of Appeals were adopted by this Court, political parties would essentially have a veto over matters that are now the sovereign responsibility of the state with respect to election regulation."
1986.85-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1249.927,1265.27,"Well, Mr. Gerson, I think perhaps your opponents might argue that if the parties were to take that drastic a position there might be much more serious administrative or regulatory consequences to the state."
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,1277.477,1290.687,--The only thing in the record that relates to the administrative burden is the comment by... in the legislature by the elections attorney for the state that this system would be workable.
1986.85-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1433.197,1440.033,But by hypothesis don't we have to assume that some people are going to vote in the open primary that didn't vote in the closed primary?
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,1441.735,1446.539,"--That's correct, Justice Rehnquist, but we would have to say it is just by hypothesis."
1986.85-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.395,1458.181,"Well, the Republican Party thinks it is worth a lawsuit anyway."
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,1458.181,1459.397,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-766,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1459.397,1460.681,"I mean, you have to believe that they think it is important."
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,1460.681,1467.037,The state in no way is questioning the sincerity of the Republican Party's desire to open up its primaries.
1986.85-766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1486.295,1517.85,"Well, Mr. Gerson, it seems to me that you denigrate unnecessarily, perhaps, in your argument the strong interest that a political party may have in allowing independents in this case to vote in the primary because they are sufficiently aligned with the party to permit them to play a role in the party's decision-making process, and it would seem to me that that is an arguable position for the party to take."
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,1517.85,1519.033,--Justice O'Connor--
1986.85-766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1519.033,1531.241,"Now, there may be countervailing state purposes here that can outweigh it, but I just wonder whether you aren't giving too little credence to the interests at stake."
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,1531.241,1546.418,"--Justice O'Connor, again, we agree that the Republican Party sincerely and conscientiously is arguing its position that it desires this affiliation that it is now not allowed by the state party, by the state law."
1986.85-766,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1557.908,1563.962,"Well, but they want them to be involved in the most important function of all, which is nominating candidates."
1986.85-766,0,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,1563.962,1570.533,"--Justice O'Connor, precisely, but that most important function of all is a state function performed by a major political party."
1986.85-766,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1578.322,1579.905,"Thank you, Mr. Gerson."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1581.94,1605.305,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are two fundamental disagreements between the parties on the issues in this lawsuit, and one is involved with the questions that Justice O'Connor was just asking Mr. Gerson about the nature of the freedom of association issue in this case."
1986.85-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.209,1702.969,"Mr. Golub, you don't contest the... indeed, you welcome the action of the State of Connecticut in giving political parties a prominent role in their electoral process?"
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1702.969,1704.003,That's right.
1986.85-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1704.003,1707.755,"I mean, political parties are folded into the electoral process."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1710.457,1710.873,Yes.
1986.85-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1710.873,1723.299,"Now, isn't it reasonable for the state once it has let political parties in to assure that they are functioning as political parties?"
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1723.299,1723.632,Yes.
1986.85-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1723.632,1741.094,What if the Republican Party decided that the way it wanted to have its candidates nominated to be sure of winning in a state that is overwhelmingly Democratic or independent is simply to endorse each year whatever candidate the Democratic Party endorses?
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1750.117,1751.25,"Well, I think--"
1986.85-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.25,1753.152,Doesn't that make the whole party system a charade?
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1753.152,1773.03,"--I think that is the critical question in this case, because whether you take this case at the primary level, whether you take it at the convention level, whether you take it back to the town caucus level where no convention is necessary, the issue is what degree of involvement can the state have in the party's determination of the philosophy of its candidates."
1986.85-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1773.03,1793.211,"And what I am suggesting is, the only involvement it is asserting here is, all we want to be sure of is that this candidate is really the party's candidate, because we are running a party system, and what you, Republican Party, are telling us is that you don't want a party's candidate, you want whatever candidate the independent voters out there want because basically you want to win."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1800.633,1814.809,"Let me respond directly to that, because I think the state's authority to act is limited to ensuring a fair nominating system and a representative nominating system, and I say those two words because they are a little different."
1986.85-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.025,1843.627,"My first hypothetical, which you rejected, was fair and representative."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1855.267,1878.4,"I do, and I say that knowing that it involves what seems on its face to be an incredible position, and I do that because the party's right to pick its candidate, pick its candidates, and the method of picking its candidates has to be paramount to the state's rights to insist that a candidate reflect a certain philosophy, and taking that a step further, if the--"
1986.85-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.4,1880.419,It isn't a matter of reflecting a philosophy.
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1885.488,1892.159,"--If the party wants to abdicate, if the party chooses to put up no nominee, if the party chooses, as the party does in New York from time to time--"
1986.85-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.159,1892.609,Then it should leave the primary system.
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1892.609,1893.342,--I am sorry?
1986.85-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.342,1894.761,Then it should leave the primary system.
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1910.354,1922.846,"If the party in the State of... if any party in... if a major party in the State of Connecticut said at its convention, we unanimously endorse the Democratic candidate, the state would have no requirement of insisting upon a primary."
1986.85-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1922.846,1922.996,That is not my hypothetical.
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1932.803,1948.563,"If the party decides that that is the best way for it to get into power, if the party decides that that is the best way for it to attain is goals, the party may be 100 percent wrong, the party may be adopting a self-destructive course, but it is not for the state to come and say we won't let you do that."
1986.85-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.563,1950.598,I am not concerned about its being self-destructive.
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1956.05,1961.637,What the party has done in this case is open up its system to make it more representative.
1986.85-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.569,1984.502,"No, this is thoroughly representative."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,1990.306,1990.856,"Well, our position--"
1986.85-766,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.856,2000.948,"All I am saying is that maybe Connecticut has a right to ensure that it be, Number One, fair, Number Two, representative, and Number Three, a genuine party choice and not an abdication by the party."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2000.948,2026.146,"--Well, I certainly agree with Number One, fair, and Number Two, representative, and I respectfully have to maintain the position that if the party wants to abdicate or make a mistake, that is why we have voluntary private parties, so that other parties can grow up, so that other parties will develop, so that a majority of the people in the Republican Party who agree or don't agree with that particular course have the option of saying, okay, we will do that--"
1986.85-766,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2026.146,2035.419,"Well, Mr. Gerson, some of your answers suggest to me that one might fairly say that you are putting the cart before the horse."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2058.134,2088.386,"--Well, I think that that is the second disagreement between the parties in this case, parties with a small p.> [""] And I think that what the state has asserted within the rubric of ""public electoral function"" is a right to impact not only on the fairness, the orderliness of the primary procedure, but on the decisions as to who can participate in the primary procedure."
1986.85-766,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2123.243,2124.429,"You wouldn't agree that you were, but--"
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2124.429,2124.779,Yes.
1986.85-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2124.779,2126.895,--Do you agree--
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2126.895,2128.213,"I put the state's cart before my horse, or whatever it is."
1986.85-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2128.379,2133.748,"--Mr. Gerson, do you agree that the primary is an integral part of the election?"
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2133.748,2135.95,"I agree that it is, and I agree that--"
1986.85-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2135.95,2140.152,"Well, then, the state has the same right over that that it has over the general election."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2140.152,2141.052,--I don't agree with that.
1986.85-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2141.052,2141.854,Why not?
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2141.854,2182.995,"I think we agree that for the purposes of state action determinations the primary is such an important... can be such an important part of a general election that the protections of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments apply, but we don't think that the state can bootstrap its way into saying, we have the right to regulate you, we force you or we require you to participate in a primary, and now that we require you to participate in a primary, since that is a ""public electoral function"", we can now insist upon your participating substantively in the primary with the members or the voters that we think are appropriate."
1986.85-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2191.751,2193.453,Because the convention is not a primary.
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2193.453,2199.19,"That's right, and we don't contend it is, but it is part of the same nominating system that--"
1986.85-766,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2199.19,2203.725,What is there in a state primary that the state cannot regulate?
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2203.725,2212.414,--The state cannot regulate who may participate in the primary as the party wishes.
1986.85-766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.414,2217.735,May I ask if under your view the Republicans could invite 17-year-olds to vote?
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2217.735,2218.168,No.
1986.85-766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2218.168,2219.418,Why not?
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2219.418,2229.79,"I think that the state has a right to establish minimum voter qualifications, which have traditionally included age and residency and other similar kinds of things."
1986.85-766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.79,2241.581,"But if the theory, as Judge Kaufman explained it, part of it was to get the ideology of the party reaching out and getting other views that's necessary to vote to get, I don't know why that theory wouldn't apply to aliens and other unregistered voters."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2241.581,2244.331,"Well, I don't go as far as the Second Circuit opinion went in that regard."
1986.85-766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.331,2244.866,"You don't go... anyway, you don't go that far."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2244.866,2264.827,"The rationale that I would use, and I think it is an important rationale for the argument I am advancing, is, going back to the representativeness of the decision, what the state has the right to insist upon is that whatever decision the party ultimately makes through its primary is a representative decision of the wishes of its members."
1986.85-766,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2274.968,2287.543,"Well, Mr. Golub, then you would say in a state like Wisconsin where the state mandates an open primary the Republican Party could come up and say, no, we want a closed primary, and the state could not impose an open primary on that party."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2287.543,2288.793,I think that is a difficult question.
1986.85-766,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2288.793,2289.426,"I do, too."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2289.426,2290.928,"Fortunately, it is not posed in this case."
1986.85-766,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2292.028,2294.363,How does it differ from the question that is posed in this case?
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2294.363,2295.647,It differs in a fundamental respect.
1986.85-766,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2305.169,2308.138,"What is so good about that, other than its appeal?"
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2309.322,2311.908,--I have a flag in my pocket to wave.
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2370.53,2387.123,"Mr. Golub, if the state law said to each party, well, you may have an open primary for your party, or you may invite independents to vote and they may vote in your primary, but provided they do their enrolling the day before?"
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2387.123,2393.61,"Well, that is, to an extent, part of what is involved in this case."
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2393.61,2393.895,I know.
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2393.895,2395.928,I want to clarify one answer that was given--
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.928,2396.847,What's wrong with that?
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2396.847,2403.418,"--What we think is wrong with it is, it requires independent voters to make a public affiliation."
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2404.901,2405.351,Not any more.
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2411.774,2411.824,--No--
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.824,2413.24,I guess they enroll.
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2413.24,2419.778,--The answer that was given to you earlier on in this argument I don't think went far enough.
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2449.463,2449.982,Yes.
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2449.982,2452.249,But he is a full member of the party.
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2452.249,2454.451,That isn't my hypothetical.
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2469.111,2476.632,"Well, we think that would be a least restrictive alternative that might be applicable if the Court finds that the state has other compelling interests."
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2477.682,2483.12,"Well, I didn't ask... do you have a solid answer for that or not?"
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2483.12,2483.42,--Yes.
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2486.072,2486.838,"Well, would it be all right?"
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2498.194,2501.598,"--Well, I have trouble with the word ""enrolling"" in that context."
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.614,2503.764,"Use any other word you want, then."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2503.764,2504.014,--Okay.
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.383,2505.549,Yes.
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2505.549,2508.335,"--which could be for administrative reasons, to know how many machines to have--"
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.335,2508.468,Yes.
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2508.468,2509.435,--I have no problem with that.
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.435,2510.585,You have no problems with that then?
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2510.585,2515.072,The problem in Connecticut is that there is a traditionally historical--
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2515.072,2523.511,So the real... the real problem then is what?
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2523.511,2533.7,"--The problem is that the state is insisting on a public act of affiliation, leaving the independent status, joining the Republican Party as a condition of this association."
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.7,2536.818,"Yes, but he isn't... in my example they are not insisting on that."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2536.818,2539.068,"Yes, I am sorry, but in the example--"
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.068,2539.351,"Yes, all right."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2539.351,2544.888,"--I mean, I think your example, if it was necessary to administer the open primary--"
1986.85-766,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.888,2549.042,"Well, there's a law that says, go ahead and vote, but you have to sign up to do it."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2549.042,2554.244,"--Yes, as long as the state showed it was necessary for the administration of the primary I think that could be acceptable."
1986.85-766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2563.885,2566.837,"Mr. Golub, all they have to do is publicly enroll."
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2577.859,2579.811,--That's correct.
1986.85-766,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2579.811,2584.097,It's the difference between publicly doing it that way and publicly signing an enrollment form the day before.
1986.85-766,1,20922,david_s_golub,,2584.097,2597.857,"I think that there is a major difference philosophically between affiliating with a party formally and going into a polling booth and saying, I need a Republican ballot, and I think that that is a difference not only... I mean, it is... I mean, there are--"
1986.85-766,2,22374,elliot_f_gerson,,3361.858,3364.36,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
