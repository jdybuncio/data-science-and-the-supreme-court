1967.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,49.756,"Volkswagen, Petitioner, versus Federal Maritime Commission et al."
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,49.756,51.047,Mr. Chief Justice.
1967.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,51.047,52.7,Mr. Herzfeld.
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,52.7,56.152,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,510.626,514.342,"Mr. Herzfeld, is there a difference between a liner and a common carrier?"
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,514.342,522.246,"As I understand it, a liner is a common carrier having scheduled sailings where there might be a common carrier with sporadic sailings."
1967.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,522.246,523.957,Which are both -- they're both common carrier.
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,523.957,525.068,Both are common carriers.
1967.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,525.068,527.458,"As distinguished, you say, from a chartered carrier."
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,527.458,531.238,Right.
1967.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,543.871,552.789,"May I interrupt just a moment to ask you, is that difference between a liner and a common carrier has anything to do with this case?"
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,553.533,554.9,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1967.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,554.9,555.672,Why not?
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,555.672,557.324,The case would be the same if --
1967.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,557.324,557.514,Either.
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,557.514,561.124,-- common carriers be in control of PMA.
1967.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,842.606,852.34,"Mr. Herzfeld, if we were to agree with you on Section 15, would it be necessary to reach the 17 or 16 argument?"
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,852.34,863.991,"No, Mr. Justice Brennan, it would not be necessary but if the Court have to agree with this us on Section 15 at first, a proceeding would have to be started by PMA to get the agreement approved."
1967.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,872.541,874.488,On Section 17 and 16.
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,874.488,875.037,Yes.
1967.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,887.32,906.909,"But then again in Section 15 proceeding, might there not be considerations that the -- in the way of other evidence that might be brought before the Commission that might make a 16 or 17 expression from us premature?"
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,906.909,917.197,It seems to me that you have a complete record so far as the Volkswagen charge goes under 16 and 17 and I admit the Court certainly is not -- would not be compelled to pass on this but I believe it would --
1967.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,917.197,924.711,Why wouldn't it -- would there on a Section 15 proceeding perhaps be evidence that might bear on the application of 16 or 17?
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,924.711,930.938,"Certainly, because one of the arguments in 15 would be that the agreement violates as a provision of the Act."
1967.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,936.251,936.948,Already?
1967.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,936.948,949.497,But don't you think that if we agreed with you on 15 that we would have to say some things that would bear heavily on 16 and 17 even if we didn't get to them expressly.
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,949.497,951.546,Not necessarily.
1967.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,977.658,992.188,"Well, Mr. Herzfeld, if the Court should hold that this agreement does not require to be filed under 15, would that change your argument or would your argument be that 16 and 17 still apply?"
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,992.188,999.28,"In that case, I believe the Court must pass on 16 and 17 and it's indeed my contention that they would apply."
1967.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,999.28,1001.737,They would apply even though 15 did not.
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1001.737,1012.97,"Definitely and that's the case where I believe the Court will have to face the issue which was based either by saying, ""I believe as Mr. Justice Brennan's report, may or may not refer to Sections 15 -- 16 and 17""."
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1212.003,1237.154,"Well, is there a basic agreement as your -- are you telling us that there's a basic agreement among the PMA members with respect to a basic charge to be made and then in addition to that, there is this special agreement resulting from the circumstances of the agreement with the unions."
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1237.154,1241.227,"Well, I'm considering only the tax which follows the agreement with the unions."
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1241.227,1241.73,"Well, I understand that --"
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1241.73,1242.306,(Inaudible)
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1242.306,1253.574,-- but my question to you is whether the logic of your argument would not require that the basic agreement also be filed under Section 15?
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1253.574,1255.935,"The agreement with the union itself, I don't believe."
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1257.266,1266.497,Not the agreement with the union but any agreement among PMA members with respect to charges to be made.
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1266.497,1267.288,Absolutely.
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1273.477,1285.559,And not all -- and not only agreements that followed the agreement with the union of which you're now a complaining.
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1285.559,1289.869,Everything which was done by PMA after it made the agreement with the union which (Voice Overlap) --
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1289.869,1292.465,How about before -- how about before?
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1299.074,1300.867,"No, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1300.867,1301.062,Why not?
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1301.062,1307.368,The agreement with the union nearly upholds the liability of $5 million a year on PMA and its members.
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1307.368,1311.311,"Well, had he -- (Inaudible) before that was an operating organization, wasn't it?"
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1311.311,1312.193,"Yes, sir."
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1312.193,1318.567,"And it collected assessments or money in some form from its member, doesn't it?"
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1318.567,1320.818,That's right.
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1320.818,1329.97,"Is it your contention that that basic agreement to have it referred to as a basic agreement, does or does not have to be filed with the Commission?"
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1329.97,1332.104,He hadn't made any contention of that in this case (Voice Overlap) --
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1332.104,1332.9,(Inaudible)
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1332.9,1334.879,-- because the case doesn't require it.
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1334.879,1349.299,I understand that but that's what bothers me because what I'm really asking is whether the logic of your position here is not such as to require that all of -- all agreements be filed.
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1349.299,1368.274,"Well the Civil Aeronautics both acting on -- under a parallel statute, parallel to Section 15, found indeed -- said a collective bargaining association of employers as such had to file and it was formed and many took any action."
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1384.775,1399.031,But you're -- and you not say -- telling me that the logic of your argument would require this basic agreement to be filed as well as the agreement following the understanding with the union --
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1399.031,1399.157,Sub --
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1399.157,1404.4,-- but that it is de minimis and therefore can the -- they can be excused from filing.
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1404.4,1405.216,"Yes, sir."
1967.69,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1405.216,1406.073,That's your position?
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1406.073,1406.876,"Indeed, yes."
1967.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1699.381,1718.542,"Mr. Herzfeld, do you -- you answered me that as I recall it that in the event the Court felt that the -- this agreement need not be filed that 16 and 17 would be before us."
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1727.597,1735.215,The Courts would not be compelled to rule on Section 16 and 17 but I suggested in answer to a question from Justice Brennan --
1967.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1735.215,1735.589,Yes.
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1735.589,1746.176,-- that I think it would be highly desirable if the Court would express some opinion on this because the question will come up again in the Commission and I believe the Commission needs the guidance of this Court in order to decide it.
1967.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1746.176,1749.143,Just give you an advisory opinion?
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1749.143,1751.563,I'm only suggesting it would be desirable --
1967.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1751.563,1751.707,Yes.
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1751.707,1753.146,"-- and sure, the Court doesn't have to."
1967.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1753.146,1753.906,Very well.
1967.69,0,44994,walter_herzfeld,,1753.906,1766.359,Thank you very much.
1967.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1766.359,1776.854,"Mr. Posner, may I -- before you get into your argument, that may I ask you that question, in the event we should decide that this agreement should have been filed under 15."
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,1783.098,1785.537,"I think it -- Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1828.827,1833.041,"Well, I gather Mr. Posner, that's on the premise that there's already a full record?"
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,1849.525,1859.65,"Yes, there might indeed and we would see no impropriety to the Commissions taking additional evidence relating to the 16 and 17 issues."
1967.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1875.111,1882.519,It might not but end up in just an advisory opinion if there is a different record made on the claim?
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,1882.519,1886.421,Conceivably and we are not pressing for that course.
1967.69,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2011.831,2024.333,"You will not, would you -- you will not take the position would you that all collective bargaining agreements made by PMA have to be filed under 15?"
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2024.333,2031.364,We don't suggest that any collective bargaining agreement need be filed.
1967.69,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2043.75,2054.176,"Well, this is not -- what you're saying is that this is severable from the collective bargaining arrangement with the agreement."
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2054.176,2054.404,Yes.
1967.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2086.511,2091.98,How about the original agreement creating PMA?
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2091.98,2099.996,The agreement created the Maritime Association as a instrumentality for (Voice Overlap) --
1967.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2099.996,2101.301,For (Voice Overlap) --
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2101.301,2102.76,-- for collective bargaining.
1967.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2102.76,2103.881,For industry wide collective bargaining --
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2103.881,2104.296,Collective bargaining.
1967.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2104.296,2106.018,"-- any way in that area, wasn't it?"
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2106.018,2106.99,Yes.
1967.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2123.121,2127.897,"It certainly anticompetitive, isn't it?"
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2127.897,2129.343,It is a form of --
1967.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2129.343,2135.123,"Because it did -- the purpose of it is to prevent the unions from a so-called “Whipsaw collective bargaining”, is it not?"
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2135.123,2135.483,Yes.
1967.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2151.469,2155.423,"The CAB certainly took a different view back 20 years ago, didn't it?"
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2155.423,2163.471,"It has and it is conceivable that in a case which presented the issue, the Court might reach the same result."
1967.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.112,2342.925,"Well, Mr. Posner, didn't the Commission expressly find that the allocation of the tax would have no compete -- anticompetitive effect or any competitive effect on -- among those who entered into the agreement or in any other ways as far as I could see?"
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2346.063,2367.232,"The actual critical finding of the Commission on this point which we don't dispute although one could, is that there was no agreement, no further agreement among the members of the association to impose -- to pass on the tonnage assessment to the shipper."
1967.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.972,2438.981,"Oh, I understand that argument but the Commission nevertheless said that absent in agreement passed on which you didn't file, just the allocation agreement itself would not affect outsiders and would not affect competition and that is what you disagree with."
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2438.981,2439.175,Yes.
1967.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2440.09,2442.001,"So you knew to that effect, disagreement on --"
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2442.001,2442.673,Yes.
1967.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.673,2448.099,-- on the -- on assessing the consequences in disagreement.
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2448.099,2448.271,Yes.
1967.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2471.961,2475.088,So the -- is this -- and then is this a Universal Camera problem?
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2475.088,2496.153,I don't think so because the Commission adopted a -- it seems to me not a factual but a legal ruling that the -- that Section 15 simply has no impact unless there is -- unless shippers are expressly subjected to the burdens of an agreement.
1967.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.358,2526.764,"Well, Mr. Posner, let's assume that the parties had agreed expressly to do what happened here, namely, to -- that in the case of automobiles the -- they are to be done on a measurement basis and the tax passed on, would you understand the -- that the Commission would then hold that that agreement was fileable?"
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2526.764,2528.764,Definitely.
1967.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2528.764,2537.91,And how would you suppose the Commission would say that that affected competition when it applied to all automobiles alike.
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2537.91,2542.838,"Well, I think there are two separate points being mixed up here."
1967.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2573.413,2582.603,"Well, the Commission said a showing has been required that they have some impact upon the competitive relationships to those that are into them."
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2585.335,2595.755,"Well, the -- there, it would be referring to the members of the Association itself."
1967.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2595.755,2608.282,"Well, how would -- how do you suggest that if that -- if the -- what you're saying is that if that -- this -- that the facts are such that it -- that they are the same as though there had been an expressed agreement to pass on the automobile passed."
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2608.282,2609.621,Yes.
1967.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2609.621,2616.557,"Now, how do you say that that affects some kind of a competitive position?"
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2616.557,2637.242,"Well, I think anytime once the price of a service one is offering is changed when the price of unloading Volkswagen rises or fails to decline as much as it would but for the assessment, there can be a competitive impact."
1967.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.413,2647.356,To another port?
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2647.356,2650.365,-- common carriers or another port.
1967.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.236,2690.219,"So your standard is just an impact on outsiders not anything -- you don't need anything further in terms of the impact or extent of impact on competition, just on impact on outsiders, is that the Commission standard to you?"
1967.69,1,40232,richard_a_posner,,2690.219,2710.531,"The Commission articulated that standard but seems to have adopted the view which I think is clearly unsound that if there is no agreement which mentions an outsider, the outsider is not affected and we think that highly unrealistic."
1967.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2813.903,2822.427,Mr. Katz.
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,2822.427,2827.435,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, excuse me, may it please the Court."
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2937.938,2940.147,Why is United States here Mr. Katz?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,2940.147,2941.283,Why is the United State here?
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2943.594,2946.685,That's the Maritime Commission but I gather Mr. Posner is speaking for someone else here?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,2946.685,2949.72,"He is speaking for the United States, yes sir."
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2956.17,2959.258,But the United States is -- your opposing that as at least (Inaudible) --
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,2959.258,2959.626,"Yes, sir."
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3016.749,3021.97,I know but -- I'm not sure I understand.
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3027.309,3027.999,"Yes, sir, Mr. Justice White."
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3027.999,3033.462,And I didn't know that automatically -- that filing automatically brought an approval.
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3033.462,3034.601,"No, Your Honor but --"
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3034.601,3041.177,"I was sure, I thought the Commission considered that a competitive factor is involved in that agreement."
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3041.177,3042.415,"They do Mr. Justice White, (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3042.415,3042.679,(Inaudible)
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3042.679,3043.94,They inquired (Voice Overlap) --
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3043.94,3045.671,They inquired to that as one of the standards set forth.
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3045.671,3048.945,How do you know this agreement would be approved?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3048.945,3052.404,"I'll get to that in a moment Mr. White, if I'm -- Justice White if I may."
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3059.459,3065.58,And if it would approve it after considering these things why that's the pattern of the law.
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3065.58,3068.519,"They're within an antitrust exemption, that's correct."
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3068.519,3068.603,"Well, why --"
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3068.603,3068.825,Now --
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3068.825,3075.097,Why do you take it strange that the Department of Justice would want to follow what the statute requires?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3075.097,3080.021,"Well, the statute -- first, Mr. Justice White, does not require a blanket-wide exemption for the industry if --"
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3080.021,3080.129,Nobody --
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3080.129,3081.125,-- it's non-competitive --
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3081.125,3081.972,I didn't --
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3081.972,3082.781,-- or it's non-antitrust.
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3082.781,3085.835,(Inaudible) doesn't suggest that as far as I know it.
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3085.835,3093.822,"In their brief, they indicate that every matter posing a Sherman Act situation should be submitted to the Commission for prior approval."
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3093.822,3094.365,What's wrong with that?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3094.365,3095.066,We think not.
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3111.771,3119.432,Is that to suggest if it's not a submittable agreement then the parties to it might be vulnerable to antitrust problem?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3119.432,3120.233,"Yes, sir."
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3121.15,3130.617,"Well, even if the Act doesn't provide for any exemption for the antitrust law still -- unless there's an approval."
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3130.617,3133.244,"Yes, Mr. Justice White, that's correct."
1967.69,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3150.271,3183.281,What you're really saying as I understand it is that petitioner here must concede its remedy that not being the petitioner here is not a carrier or within the protected ambit of the Act as administered by the Commission that the petitioner here had available to him through it an antitrust action in the Courts and the defendants in that action would not be sheltered by any granted immunity.
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3183.281,3185.268,"Mr. Justice Fortas, that is absolutely correct."
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.7,3193.639,"So if you win, a couple of damage action may follow."
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3193.639,3198.651,That is correct.
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3202.478,3210.32,"Well, I suppose the real question for us to decide is whether you like it or not, the Act requires you to act on this agreement, does it?"
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3210.32,3211.387,Yes Your Honor.
1967.69,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3273.085,3278.885,"Well, in fact, that -- when you put it that way, I confess a -- you confuse me with that."
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3295.607,3296.579,"No, sir, Your Honor."
1967.69,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3319.474,3336.536,"Well, but you're saying to us now that it's a good thing that the Commission does not -- I think this agreement is not filed and that the Commission doesn't pass on this -- Commission did pass on it, that would give it an antitrust exemption."
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3336.536,3339.463,It would give an antitrust exemption.
1967.69,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3372.968,3384.533,"May I ask Mr. Katz, its just a matter of a factual inquiry whether this is still going on by its original terms if it's to expire about now after the accumulation of about the $29 million?"
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3384.533,3387.749,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I believe that it would be more appropriate for me to differ that --"
1967.69,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3387.749,3387.76,Alright.
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3387.76,3388.729,-- to Mr. Torre who is --
1967.69,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3388.729,3389.212,"Very well, fine."
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3389.212,3390.248,-- in the industry.
1967.69,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3390.248,3391.617,Fine.
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3391.617,3410.374,"Now in searching for justification for the position that the petitioners have set forth today, the petitioner and the Solicitor General have argued that the parties maybe hesitant to enter into agreements involving the maritime industry and may desire to remove the clout of antitrust violation from their activities."
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3423.183,3428.539,"Well, would the Commission be receptive if PMA had come in and said we want approval of this agreement?"
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3436.421,3440.103,"Your Honor, I'm not sure just what the Commission would have done in that situation."
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3460.709,3462.783,I thought you said earlier that's why I asked the question.
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3462.783,3463.291,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3463.291,3464.697,"Perhaps, I misunderstood you Mr. Katz."
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3471.97,3472.722,"No, they had not."
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3473.417,3479.367,"If I may -- I thought you have said, if they had done that, they might have got their approval."
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3479.367,3485.505,They may well have but it would be a moot if there is in fact no antitrust violation that they just would've gotten when they -- would be similar to a --
1967.69,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3485.505,3488.29,I don't see -- it seems to me that's a little inconsistent.
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3488.29,3489.983,"Well, it would be similar to them perhaps --"
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3489.983,3501.154,"If you're receptive to a request for an approval, it seems to me that of itself establishes that indeed it's an agreement of false (Inaudible)."
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3501.154,3509.952,"Mr. Justice Brennan, the Commission would -- could well say this is not the type of agreement that we must look at therefore we will -- it's not necessary if I will not accept it for filing, not grant the --"
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3509.952,3510.89,But if you would I --
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3510.89,3511.28,-- antitrust exemption.
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3511.28,3527.418,The Commission takes the view that a disagreement had not only allocated the burden that said it shall be passed on to whoever uses the facility that it would necessarily be fileable and if -- right?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3527.418,3528.045,Yes.
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3528.045,3528.618,"Now, why?"
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3528.618,3537.714,"Because in that event, there would have been a removal of the competitive situation which would have existed otherwise absent the agreement."
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3551.242,3572.568,"What standard does the -- in testing the fileability of these agreements as if the Maritime Commission used in this case was the standard that the agreement didn't call for any passing on that there was no expressed calling -- no expressed provision -- for an impact on outsiders, is that what you --"
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3572.568,3574.006,That is correct Mr. Justice White.
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3580.485,3585.176,"Now, what if a necessary impact had to be that it would be passed on in some circumstance?"
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3585.176,3588.727,Now that's the position that the Solicitor General in its brief urged --
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3588.727,3596.492,Let's assume that that was so that the necessary impact although one stated was that it had to be passed on.
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3596.492,3606.677,"Well, it's hard for me to say what the Commission would have done in that situation because it did not find that here but had it found that, it may well have said, yes, we -- that this does involve Section 15 situation."
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3606.677,3610.568,Without any further analysis as to the effect on competition or (Voice Overlap) --
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3610.568,3613.318,If it would remove the competition which would exist between the parties.
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3614.569,3615.669,Between what parties?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3615.669,3616.703,Alright.
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3631.401,3637.616,"Well, what if it didn't affect the competition among the shippers?"
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3637.616,3645.208,"I think if it did affect competition among shippers, I think that the Commission would be compelled to say, yes, this is --"
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3645.208,3647.857,And what about competition among carriers?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3647.857,3649.859,"In a competition among carriers, no question about that."
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3649.859,3651.409,And among stevedores?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3651.409,3652.005,And among stevedores?
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3652.005,3652.253,How about the (Voice Overlap) --
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3652.253,3653.048,"If they were party to this agreement, yes."
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3653.048,3654.985,How about between ports?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3654.985,3655.312,Between ports?
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3658.419,3659.256,"Well, how about the 15?"
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3661.845,3668.034,If an agreement between carriers was in derogation of the right of ports to compete for cargo?
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3673.718,3680.74,"Between -- a competition between charter, hire and common carriers?"
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3680.74,3682.624,I believe it would.
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3684.773,3686.422,"Well, it didn't really cover that much (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3686.422,3687.351,"Well, no."
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3688.419,3692.345,"Have you thought about the competition between the parties to the agreement, that's all --"
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3692.345,3692.483,Yes sir.
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3692.483,3693.613,-- it talked about.
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3693.613,3693.84,Yes.
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3694.346,3694.354,Although you concede --
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3694.354,3701.388,-- an extensive dissent filed at the Commission so the Commission did -- have before these contentions but they rejected them all.
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3701.388,3703.047,You mean Commissioner Patterson (ph)?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3703.047,3703.966,"Yes, sir."
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3703.966,3708.234,Did the Commission -- so how do you really deal this argument?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3708.234,3715.73,"They didn't answer them specifically but in so -- the voting and the way they did, they obviously rejected his contentions."
1967.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3715.73,3736.895,"Do I understand you to say that -- to Mr. Justice Brennan that if the association had presented this agreement to the Commission, the Commission could or could not in his discretion have considered the validity of it in relation to the antitrust --"
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3736.895,3740.48,"If the Commission determined that it did not affect the competitive relationship, it would --"
1967.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3740.48,3741.531,I beg your pardon?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3741.531,3749.241,"If the Commission determined that that agreement did not affect the competitive relationship they would otherwise have existed absent, the agreement."
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3758.8,3759.935,Yes.
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3759.935,3779.21,"What could happen if this -- the Commission did not have this discretion, parties in the industry -- companies in the industry could form an agreement between themselves, two or three carriers to engage in another type of industry perhaps a lumber industry or manufacturing or any number of industries that we alluded to this in our brief."
1967.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3832.759,3845.06,Is that the -- is that filing of the fact that if -- what you believe brings you under the Universal Camera case?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3845.06,3846.54,"I believe it would, Your Honor."
1967.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3846.54,3855.344,Isn't that an interpretation of the statute on which the whole thing is based rather than on finding of facts?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3855.344,3863.758,"Well, Your Honor, the Commission in reaching it's conclusion on this case relied upon the interpretation of the statute given by this Court in the Carnation case."
1967.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3863.758,3864.241,What?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3864.241,3864.369,In the Carnation case.
1967.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3864.369,3865.976,Carnation case?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,3865.976,3867.068,"Yes, sir."
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4016.031,4028.497,"Well, Mr. Katz, do you agree that -- or what is your position if -- that if we assume this Court finds against the Commission on 15, it says that the agreement should've been filed."
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,4036.954,4045.517,"I would think that if the petitioner is willing to rely on the record in 16 and 17, fine, because I do not believe they maintain the record to show violation of 16 and 17."
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4055.596,4061.922,You don't think the Commission has said almost to say about 16 and 17 (Voice Overlap)?
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,4061.922,4065.46,I believe on the record before it had found that there was no showing of a violation of 16 and 17.
1967.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4065.46,4068.908,"(Inaudible) It was tried out, both issues were tried out before."
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,4068.908,4072.45,They may well come to the same conclusion again.
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4072.45,4080.893,Even if they became significant if we were to say that this was a fileable agreement therefore you had to go through a procedure (Voice Overlap) --
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,4080.893,4083.039,It may well be a different type of case then.
1967.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4083.039,4084.783,"Well, that's why I wonder."
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,4093.261,4100.148,"If you disagree with us on 15, I would believe that this Court would want to remand for a different record on 16 and 17."
1967.69,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4100.148,4111.242,"The Commission itself has changed its mind since its decision in this case with respect to the necessity of having a competitive freight under 16, has it not?"
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,4111.242,4111.841,Not really.
1967.69,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4151.261,4152.49,Hold out your right.

1967.69,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4158.075,4166.484,The Commission itself should reconsider this case under 16 in light of its -- at least partial shift to position.
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,4166.484,4167.939,I could certainly understand Volkswagen.
1967.69,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4172.703,4176.404,And the Commission is perhaps should be given an opportunity to consider --
1967.69,2,39681,robert_n_katz,,4176.404,4190.42,"Well, of course, we feel that there's enough in the record to justify the decision reached by the Commission previously but the Commission is not reluctant to your case which should properly be before it."
1967.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4249.443,4257.994,We'll recess now.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4257.994,4268.982,"I'm speaking for the Pacific Maritime Association, the intervenor in this case and I hope I can clear up some of the confusions that obviously had been created."
1967.69,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4320.64,4323.405,Does it still have the rate of $5 million a year?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4323.405,4346.048,"It's at a slightly higher rate than $5 million a year but I'd like to explain that the $5 million a year is the maximum rate and it will never be and has -- in the first three years, it was collected at that rate but it cannot be collected at that rate and paid out at that rate, it will be -- always the lower rate."
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4478.805,4479.96,May I ask you if (Voice Overlap) --
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4479.96,4481.388,"Yes, sir."
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4481.388,4490.566,-- of the way you are operating this plan is because it took all an extraordinary burden on Volkswagen?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4490.566,4492.472,I do not think so Your Honor.
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4495.147,4499.033,Suppose it did?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4499.033,4505.939,If it did cause Volkswagen to be burdened -- I'm not sure I understand your question sir.
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4505.939,4513.502,"Well, what I'm talking about is it seems that at least the argument seems to be implicit if not stated open."
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4526.235,4528.487,"Well, Volkswagen has alleged that."
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4532.595,4532.828,But who --
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4532.828,4532.934,But --
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4532.934,4534.609,-- held -- they didn't prove it?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4534.609,4536.667,The trial examiner who --
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4536.667,4536.835,"Well, that might --"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4536.835,4537.516,-- listened to the evidence.
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4537.516,4539.115,But that might be wrong.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4539.115,4543.591,I think not because it is supported by uncontroverted evidence.
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4555.494,4562.299,Both -- it has been charged some other way than the way you charged it.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4569.8,4573.099,There is but that difference exist for everyone.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4645.249,4655.729,"Mr. Torre, is there a correlation in the sense that the space taken by a Volkswagen could carry nine times as much heavy stuff as --"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4655.729,4656.681,Yes.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4656.902,4658.005,That -- is that the correlation?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4658.005,4676.088,"It's 10 to 1 on an automobile -- on an automobile generally quicksilver, the weight to something like 14 to 1 which -- what I mean is that the weight measurement for quicksilver is 14 times the space it will take up just because quicksilver is heavier."
1967.69,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4761.503,4764.137,Is the dues passed on expressly --

1967.69,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4805.111,4805.549,Is this the rule --
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4805.549,4807.175,It is the -- pardon.
1967.69,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4807.175,4808.378,I beg your pardon.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4815.193,4815.539,"Yes, sir."
1967.69,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4815.539,4816.646,-- in that category?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4816.646,4816.867,"Yes, sir."
1967.69,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4816.867,4820.539,Are other automobiles that come into the affected ports?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4820.539,4821.581,"Yes, sir."
1967.69,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4821.581,4824.076,In substantial volume?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4824.076,4839.85,"I can't say in the substantial point as the Volkswagen do because they account from 66% I think of all foreign automobiles imported into the United States but we do have Fiats, Renaults, Mercedes-Benz, and Rolls Royce."
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4839.85,4842.118,Do they come by common carrier or by charter?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4842.118,4846.204,"The -- I think Volkswagen is the only one that comes in by charter, it does Your Honor."
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4846.204,4848.133,And Fiat coming by common carrier (Voice Overlap) --
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4848.133,4848.286,"Yes, sir."
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4848.286,4850.214,- at the same time (Inaudible)?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4850.214,4855.979,"No, Fiat -- Fiat does not hire stevedores."
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4859.432,4862.669,"Well, how about their law -- there are something else that does hire stevedores?"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4862.669,4874.397,No other manufacturer of automobiles imports them into such quantities that they have chartered ships that require them to hire stevedores.
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4874.397,4876.492,Do they send them into the Pacific Coast?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4876.492,4877.373,"Oh, yes, sir."
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4877.373,4877.834,They do.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4877.834,4878.846,"Yes, sir."
1967.69,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4879.73,4880.082,What is this?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4882.655,4883.491,Yes sir.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4925.84,4936.603,"But Mr. Torre, even if they don't come in by charter, one of your members must have some part that is -- is not in the unloading of a liner or of a carrier or --"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4936.603,4938.767,"Probably sir, not necessarily."
1967.69,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4939.476,4948.934,"Well, when there -- when it does happen, what is your member assessed, say for adoption or some other Japanese probability."
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4948.934,4951.157,I have the slightest idea.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4966.67,4970.083,But doesn't he make a contribution to this fund?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4970.083,4970.26,He --
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4970.26,4971.096,Who makes the contribution?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4971.096,4973.269,He makes the contribution.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4973.269,4973.383,Who does?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4973.383,4980.689,The -- any employer or dock workers which is -- would be a stevedore contractor or marine terminal.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4980.689,4981.435,"Alright, now."
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4982.427,4982.607,Alright.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4982.607,4985.937,-- is you bring a lot of Japanese automobiles coming in.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4990.211,4990.473,Yes.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4990.473,4991.701,-- isn't it?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4993.987,4994.947,Yes.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4994.947,4999.598,"Somebody has to pay an assessment, does he not in your association --"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,4999.598,5000.019,Yes.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5000.019,5002.191,-- for the charge of unloading this?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5002.191,5015.987,"If an association stevedore unloads the Datsun, he will have a charge measured by the volume of the Datsun that he will have to contribute to the mechanization fund."
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5019.331,5020.806,"Well, I'm not concerned with that."
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5023.764,5023.945,Yes.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5023.945,5027.458,-- collected by your association is on precisely the same basis for the Datsun --
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5027.458,5028.454,Exactly.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5028.454,5029.198,-- as it is for the Volkswagen.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5029.198,5032.524,"Exactly, yes."
1967.69,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5073.408,5075.711,That's much more a reason with that determination is it not?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5075.711,5081.024,"It came up -- yes, it came up in 1959 -- 1961 sir."
1967.69,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5081.024,5081.992,Right.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5081.992,5087.698,Now you've heard about coastwise lumber which does have a special rate.
1967.69,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5380.601,5387.618,Is there any chunk of the labor relations in maritime field or is there -- decided by Congress to the maritime cases?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5387.618,5391.201,"Never in the past Your Honor that I know of, never."
1967.69,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5391.745,5395.484,There is or was or wasn't there some conciliatory --
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5395.484,5409.311,The Maritime Labor Board that existed for several years in the late 30s and ended with the war when war shipping took over that I've referred the Court to in our brief had a conciliatory jurisdiction.
1967.69,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5409.311,5410.556,Is that nonexistent then?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5410.556,5411.323,It's not.
1967.69,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5434.284,5453.063,"Mr. Torre, do I understand you to say that there isn't any chance of holding an agreement to be fileable with the Commission unless it had some antitrust implications?"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5453.063,5457.227,That's correct and I want to be very clear.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5463.131,5463.271,But I --
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5463.271,5464.628,-- agreement.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5464.628,5476.81,I really -- let us assume -- you can't concede of the situation that wouldn't have antitrust implications if the agreement is held fileable.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5476.81,5479.196,"No, I won't go that far."
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5482.002,5493.609,"But the Commission's standard for fileability or it's -- or if its standard should be that just impact on outsiders requires filing, that doesn't necessarily raise some --"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5493.609,5494.169,I think --
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5494.169,5495.744,-- habeas antitrust problem.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5495.744,5504.416,"Excuse me sir, but I think outsiders will suffer an impact even though you're fixing the price of an insider."
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5519.428,5525.231,Do you say that that shouldn't be the test for fileability then?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5525.231,5529.201,I think it's inevitably always determines that.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5529.916,5533.761,"Well, that doesn't necessarily raise an antitrust problem?"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5533.761,5535.217,I think price fixing does.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5535.217,5543.635,"Oh, I agree with that but not just -- not just any kind of a general cost item that would necessarily raise the --"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5543.635,5543.683,Oh!
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5543.683,5544.726,-- question of service outside --
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5544.726,5552.372,"No, I don't think that agreements that create cost items create price fixing agreements."
1967.69,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5556.475,5556.921,Filed --
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5556.921,5563.886,"-- filed or approved either but certainly, in the labor field, not at all."
1967.69,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5563.886,5582.89,"Mr. Torre, in the event that the Court should determine that this was a fileable agreement and it remanded the case to the Commission to do whatever is necessary in such a situation."
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5588.695,5592.152,"Oh, I think it would be a disaster."
1967.69,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5715.8,5727.405,Would that danger be a much greater than to -- it would be faced with the possibility of a treble-damage suits in the event that we decide the other way?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5727.405,5734.834,"Your Honor, we've always had been faced with treble-damage suits and we avoid them by staying within the law in the Sherman Act."
1967.69,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5766.927,5767.063,Why?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5777.432,5777.769,We -- Your Honor --
1967.69,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5777.769,5779.218,What we do here --
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5779.218,5789.288,"Your Honor, what we did here, we've been doing for about 40 years and no one has suggested that we were covered by the Shipping Act."
1967.69,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5804.176,5807.803,Have you always had an agreement like this?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5807.803,5812.542,We -- this agreement is no different than our dues collection.
1967.69,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5812.542,5813.823,I beg your pardon.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5813.823,5825.308,"This agreement is no -- is not a bit different than the collection of dues to pay for our expenses except the money we collected here, we used to pay employee benefits."

1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5836.345,5840.136,Volkswagen is not contributing to our plan Your Honor.
1967.69,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5840.136,5841.551,Contributing to the fund.

1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5857.054,5860.019,(Inaudible) the one the burden falls on.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5860.019,5875.942,"Your Honor, whether the burden falls on it, I don't know because the record indicates their cost of discharge may have gone down and I may point out to you that they know what their cost of discharge are."
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5895.331,5908.275,"But did you say earlier Mr. Torre that they'd go bankrupt if they didn't reflect in their cost to service to Volkswagen, the $2 and 35 cent assessment that stevedoring member has to pay to your association."
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5908.275,5911.35,I don't know what savings they've incurred.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5911.35,5911.447,You mean --
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5911.447,5912.037,I've --
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5912.037,5918.888,"Are you suggesting that perhaps they're absorbing the -- the stevedore is the one who was committed to make the contribution, isn't he?"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5918.888,5933.582,"At page 627 of the record, the trial examiner found that that was the case and based it upon testimony of the marine terminals' vice president which was adopted by the Pacific Coast representative of Volkswagen."
1967.69,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5939.963,5943.013,"Well, what are they complaining about for heaven's sake?"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5943.013,5948.597,They're creating -- this case is here to retry and argue evidentiary matters.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5977.403,5986.628,"But Mr. Torre, certainly marine terminals charges Volkswagen a price that must include the $2 and 35 cents per unit, isn't it?"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5986.628,5987.935,It certainly does.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5987.935,5988.791,(Inaudible)
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,5988.791,5993.125,But that doesn't mean the price was higher than $10 and 45 cents.
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6061.253,6074.43,"If this had been applied to be filed that under Section 16, would the Commission have been compelled to hold a hearing and determine whether or not he may impose exceptional burdens on --"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6074.43,6075.635,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6075.635,6076.359,It would have.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6076.359,6077.085,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6077.085,6080.867,"That's what you're arguing, that -- and you get that passed on by the Commission, was it?"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6080.867,6082.929,I think the hearing was held though.
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6083.449,6086.028,A hearing on that -- under the 6 -- Sections 16 --
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6086.028,6087.583,He had full opportunity to produce --
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6087.583,6089.112,By this hearing under Section 15?
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6089.112,6090.15,From 25?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6090.15,6090.658,"Yes, sir."
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6099.153,6103.435,"Well, what does his sentence in the Commission's report means Mr. Torre?"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6110.441,6116.273,What that means is the $2 and 35 cents is 25% of $10 and 45cents.
1967.69,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6127.85,6130.924,But they say Volkswagen's cost of discharge.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6130.924,6140.084,I can't believe that the Commission in that statement is saying that the $2.35 is 25% of a figure that was never put into the (Voice Overlap) --
1967.69,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6140.084,6145.703,"Well, how are we suppose to read this opinion and act on it if a -- I mean, that's what it says that Volkswagen's cost was --"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6145.703,6153.826,I think that the finding of fact of the trial examiner on page 627 is not been overruled and he said the cost decrease.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6157.29,6157.85,So which one (Voice Overlap) --
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6157.85,6159.89,-- that's how this is ever been written.
1967.69,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6159.89,6161.632,Which one do we believe?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6161.632,6164.481,"Well, I think they can be reconciled Your Honor."
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6190.856,6195.498,"But as a matter of fact -- it did go up, isn't it?"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6195.498,6196.574,I don't know Your Honor.
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6196.574,6201.552,Doesn't it go up whether the amount that you had to pay the stevedore for this fund?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6201.552,6202.136,"No, sir."
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6203.926,6205.004,Why it didn't it?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6205.158,6207.193,Because there were savings.
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6207.97,6209.798,Do they have to pay it?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6209.798,6212.491,The purpose of this plan was to reduce cost.
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6212.491,6215.392,But do they have to pay it?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6215.392,6215.695,To pay --
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6215.695,6217.417,Volkswagen.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6217.417,6218.477,I don't see any statement --
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6218.477,6223.152,Do they have to pay the amount which is necessary to make up that (Voice Overlap) --
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6223.152,6223.708,"No, sir."
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6227.9,6229.904,"Well, then why -- what is that commodity rate?"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6229.904,6231.206,I do not know sir.
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6231.206,6235.31,"But you would know if it has been filed with the Commission, wouldn't it and they had the hearings on them."
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6235.31,6237.365,We had a hearing where they were given an opportunity.
1967.69,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6237.365,6238.958,Then why didn't you (Inaudible)?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6238.958,6241.077,They didn't put the evidence in.
1967.69,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6247.002,6249.99,"Mr. Torre, may I ask you this question."
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6261.704,6262.547,"Yes, sir."
1967.69,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6262.547,6262.967,Alright.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6272.577,6273.566,"No, sir."
1967.69,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6273.566,6274.985,Why?
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6274.985,6297.728,"The Commission had to give them a hearing on one of the questions that they raised certainly and that was whether or not they -- the stevedores were compelled to add to establish rates, a new cost because that would've been price fixing and they were given a hearing to find out that they could prove that and they didn't prove it."
1967.69,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6301.628,6312.514,"But do you -- do you mean from that that the Commission has the discretion to determine whether it will give a hearing under 15, 16 or 17 or to --"
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6312.514,6312.573,No.
1967.69,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6312.573,6313.29,-- ignore it.
1967.69,3,26172,gary_j_torre,,6313.29,6313.665,"No, sir."
1967.69,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6362.955,6363.644,Very well.
1967.69,4,44994,walter_herzfeld,,6364.246,6365.404,I have one thing --
1967.69,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6365.404,6369.168,We've taken all the time we could take for this case.
