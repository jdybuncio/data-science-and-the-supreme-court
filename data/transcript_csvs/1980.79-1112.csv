1980.79-1112,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.903,"We'll next hear No. 79-1112, Diamond v. Diehr."
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,52.027,53.963,"Thank you, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1980.79-1112,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,62.554,71.488,"Mr. Wallace, let me... since you've had a half-hour of argument and are going to have another half hour, I feel more at liberty to interrupt you at the very beginning."
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,89.136,96.556,I don't think it's different for computers.
1980.79-1112,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,120.405,124.591,"Incidentally, what is an algorithm?"
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,124.591,129.386,"Well, we've talked about this in the past."
1980.79-1112,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,163.013,165.979,The word has a much broader application.
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,165.979,168.558,There is a broader definition in Webster's.
1980.79-1112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,200.732,207.119,"Did Chakrabarty involve a process, a composition of matter?"
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,207.119,213.476,--It was a claim on a composition of matter rather than a process.
1980.79-1112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,213.476,219.022,"When you compose disparate elements, is that?"
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,219.022,222.755,"Well, in one sense, any machine or any composition of matter is a process."
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,231.502,237.297,But this is a machine patent in the terms of the patent law?
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,237.297,239.031,That was true in the preceding case.
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,247.214,247.948,To Flook.
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,247.948,252.774,"--to Flook, and differs in that respect from Chakrabarty."
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,252.774,257.944,"Now, in Flook the Court summarized its own holding by saying, very simply,"
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,275.219,281.903,That is the last sentence of Footnote 18 of the opinion.
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,281.903,282.247,Right.
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,282.247,287.198,And that is the sentence that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has accepted as the limit of the holding.
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,287.198,289.526,That's what the Court said its holding was.
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,289.526,290.649,"Well, I understand that."
1980.79-1112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,328.946,343.113,"Well, the Government thought that in the Chakrabarty arguments that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals hadn't followed Flook but really didn't seem to have the credence to go with that."
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,343.113,346.924,I'm aware of what the arguments were last term in Chakrabarty.
1980.79-1112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,355.296,359.202,"Well, what about the statement in Chakrabarty that"
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,368.931,377.865,"There's no such contention before the Court in the present case by any party, but I don't see that there's much bearing here."
1980.79-1112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,377.865,381.848,"Aren't you pretty close to that, your argument?"
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,381.848,411.523,"I thought what we were arguing is that this Court's interpretation of Section 101 in Flook requires an inquiry to be made in the processing of patent claims to see whether the claim of novelty inheres in a scientific principle, formula, or other aspect of what this Court has referred to as"
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,487.43,491.959,"Well, I don't see... Mr. Wallace, I didn't understand that was what was at issue in Flook and I'm not sure that the Court understood it that way."
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,534.208,534.63,"Well, it did."
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,540.893,544.533,"I'm not the best one in the world to say what Flook meant, because I didn't agree with it."
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,544.533,552.795,"The Court specifically addresses this question: ""Respondent argues that this approach""... namely, the Court's approach..."
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,625.78,635.121,"Well, isn't it pretty well settled that the scope of a patent is to be measured by the claims of the applicant?"
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,635.121,644.273,"Well, they do measure it by the claims but they analyze the claims in light of the prior art, and it's all part of the examination of the prior art."
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,644.273,647.523,The prior art has something to do with novelty and obviousness and things like that.
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,647.523,647.819,It does.
1980.79-1112,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,707.232,719.369,"Mr. Wallace, when would... when could you get a patent for a process or a machine that as one of its elements has unpatentable subject matter in it?"
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,732.644,733.098,No.
1980.79-1112,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,741.485,742.109,"Well, what if there's no novelty--"
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,742.109,745.576,--and then their question of obviousness and so forth is addressed.
1980.79-1112,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,745.576,762.179,"--Well, what if you take the elements apart and you don't find any novelty in any one claim or one element except in the unpatentable subject matter, but there's novelty in the combination?"
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,763.242,766.6,There can be novelty in a combination that will support a patent.
1980.79-1112,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.6,774.456,--You don't think either one... here you say there's neither novelty in any other element nor in the combination?
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,774.456,775.378,Nor in the combination.
1980.79-1112,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,780.234,781.078,It's another Flook.
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,781.078,782.375,--and that is our position.
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,782.375,799.556,"Well, what, Mr. Wallace, if an applicant for a patent said... it's a machine that previously, all previous machines had used spring-wind, spring-wound mechanisms to open a gate, say."
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,807.583,813.331,"Sounds to me as if it might not be, but it's hard for me to know--"
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,813.331,813.597,"Well, would it be... or not?"
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,813.597,817.814,"--just on the basis of that hypothetical, but gravity is not--"
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,817.814,820.109,Everything else is the same but I've worked out a way to use gravity to do this.
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,822.404,828.042,"--Well, then you say you've worked out a way, if that way is something different from the previous way--"
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,828.042,830.557,"--The difference is, it uses gravity and it used to be spring-actuated."
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,830.557,836.633,--But if the gravity is used in precisely the same way as the spring action and there's nothing novel except the use of the scientific principle for--
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,836.633,839.241,All for the same purpose: to open the gate.
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,839.241,841.647,--the same purpose may not be in the same way.
1980.79-1112,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,842.647,843.991,Would that be patentable or not under your argument?
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,843.991,849.192,--It would depend on the answer to whether it was being used in the same way as the spring.
1980.79-1112,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.08,899.779,"Does that distinction make any rational sense at all, to say that a known scientific principle can be patented but an unknown one can't be?"
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,899.779,903.543,"No, it isn't the principle that can be patented, it's only the new use of it."
1980.79-1112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,940.012,965.986,"Mr. Wallace, there are some writers who purport to be authorities on the subject who said that what the central element of Flook was that when the courts are dealing with areas not foreseen by Congress, the Court should go very slowly and that was reiterated in Chakrabarty."
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,967.954,969.671,That is not our position.
1980.79-1112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1004.174,1008.845,Then Chakrabarty was a dubious holding under your present view?
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1008.845,1018.638,"I don't see that Chakrabarty undertook to repudiate that interpretation of Section 101, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1112,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1036.646,1044.363,"Well, is the end result of the Government's position that no computer program is patentable?"
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1050.891,1051.406,"--Well, the program's been--"
1980.79-1112,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1051.406,1058.153,"--has so far said that it wasn't holding that, but your result sounds like you suggest that should be the new result."
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1058.153,1070.009,"--We refer to the prior art here, the Gould and Davis patent referred to on pages 8 and 9 of our brief in this case."
1980.79-1112,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1109.306,1113.305,"No, but... I understand that but you are now answering a different question than I asked you."
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1113.305,1119.052,"Well, the computer program itself would not be patentable."
1980.79-1112,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.052,1121.41,Nor any other computer program that you can think of?
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1121.41,1128.69,"For a digital computer, that is correct, because it involves a sequence of mathematical steps."
1980.79-1112,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1128.69,1132.53,Whether it was described as a machine patent or a process patent?
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1132.53,1137.263,"Whether the program was described either way, that is correct, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-1112,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.974,1358.517,"Well, before you sit down, let me just ask a question about the difference between this case and Flook."
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1411.199,1425.427,"--To the extent that was the claim, the Davis and Gould application referred to on page 9 of our brief had described the use of a computer to do this similar thing."
1980.79-1112,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.507,1468.786,As a case involving the creation of a new computer program to implement a well-known formula.
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1468.786,1470.239,That is what this case--
1980.79-1112,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1470.239,1471.222,That's what you'd--
1980.79-1112,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1471.222,1473.908,--Yes; in a conventional process.
1980.79-1112,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1494.339,1500.695,Mr. Wickersham.
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,1500.695,1501.881,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1546.286,1548.628,You're using it very effectively.
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,1548.628,1573.946,"This is the resultant... thank you, Judge... this is the product as it comes out to the mold, bonded to a metal ring and changed permanently, both chemically and physically to an entirely different shape which it will hold, and to a chemical state that will enable it to obtain the desired rigidity and other characteristics so that it will operate."
1980.79-1112,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1586.019,1589.502,"Well, it has other uses too, I take it?"
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,1589.502,1595.187,"Here is a small one, a piece of ""prets"", still substantially useless."
1980.79-1112,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1835.966,1836.981,Would you help me out at this point?
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,1836.981,1842.042,"--Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun?"
1980.79-1112,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1842.042,1851.116,"What is the difference between your claimed method for updating cure time, so to speak, and the method for updating the alarm limits held unpatentable in Flook?"
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,1851.116,1853.851,"Well, there are quite a few differences in there."
1980.79-1112,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1913.747,1915.56,"Well, that's an answer."
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,1918.683,1919.119,Very good; all right.
1980.79-1112,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1919.119,1925.773,I am having difficulty distinguishing this case from what the Court held in Flook.
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,1925.773,1926.43,I see.
1980.79-1112,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1951.528,1953.559,"Well, what's new about your process?"
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,1963.851,1965.711,Although novelty is not supposed to be a question--
1980.79-1112,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1965.711,1966.086,I understand.
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,1966.086,1967.57,"--on a 101 issue, I'll certainly tell you."
1980.79-1112,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.096,1983.939,Using the computer?
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,1983.939,1984.767,Using the computer.
1980.79-1112,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1993.543,2005.82,But if the only novel element in here was the use of the computer?
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2005.82,2008.741,"Well, Mr. Justice White, if that was it, I don't think I'd have gotten this far."
1980.79-1112,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2008.741,2009.428,"No, you certainly wouldn't."
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2010.599,2011.553,I wouldn't.
1980.79-1112,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2011.553,2019.533,"Mr. Wickersham, isn't it true that the process was all well known except the problem of knowing when to stop cooking?"
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2021.533,2023.641,"Not exactly, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1112,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2046.711,2053.411,"No, I understand that, but what the recalculation at frequent intervals does is tell you the precise moment when you should discontinue the curing process."
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2053.411,2053.974,--That is true.
1980.79-1112,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.974,2060.361,"Which in effect could be described as a number, because it's a certain number of minutes or seconds from the time you started the cooking."
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2060.361,2064.0,I don't think we ever know the number; we know the product.
1980.79-1112,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.0,2070.575,"They didn't in Parker against Flook either, until they got... they kept updating it and it's a constantly changing number."
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2080.369,2081.322,"It could be expressed as a number, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1112,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2085.054,2085.991,I understand.
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2085.991,2091.193,"Once our prime time is reached, the mold opens, it's done, and we take the thing out before it overcures."
1980.79-1112,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2095.333,2112.653,"Is it correct that if you had all the monitoring devices and they transmitted the temperature and time onto a screen, constantly changing so that you could always look at it, and you had a mathematical genius who could do this formula in a second or two, you wouldn't need the computer?"
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2112.653,2118.338,"That's true, that's true."
1980.79-1112,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2121.743,2122.992,I understand.
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2133.208,2134.941,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you are completely right."
1980.79-1112,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2189.418,2190.527,"Well, that's an indication of utility."
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2190.527,2194.979,"It is, it is."
1980.79-1112,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2198.633,2198.977,"Well, that's what utility is."
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2203.96,2213.066,"I don't think they would, the way our claims are worded, but it would be an interesting case."
1980.79-1112,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.023,2253.222,"No, and you make the assumption that Flook mandates, namely, that the mathematical formula is one to be assumed to be well-known, and here, in fact, it was."
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2253.222,2256.986,"Well, as far as I'm concerned, of course, we couldn't assume anything else here."
1980.79-1112,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.83,2445.069,"Suppose the claims of a patent clearly encompass some unpatentable subject matter and it's completely agreed that that unpatentable subject matter is a discovery in the sense that it's new and novel, but didn't Flook suggest or hold that if that's the only thing new or novel in the claims, that there is no patentable issue?"
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2445.069,2463.326,I think it suggested or held that; I do.
1980.79-1112,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2463.326,2478.212,"Well, then, mustn't you, if you find an unpatentable element in the claims, mustn't you inquire whether there's something else that would entitle you to a patent in the claims?"
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2478.212,2482.288,"I think that basically, of course, you're right."
1980.79-1112,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.991,2490.035,"And in that sense... well, in that sense, then, you do inquire into these other elements?"
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2490.035,2492.268,"In that sense and that sense alone, yes."
1980.79-1112,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2492.268,2496.797,"Well, all right, but don't say then that those elements are wholly foreign under Flook."
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2496.797,2504.637,"Well, the Section 102 and 103 considerations go much deeper than that, I believe."
1980.79-1112,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.637,2505.528,"Well, it may be, but they--"
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2505.528,2512.354,"Well, Congress at any rate thought they were separate and said that they'd split the statute in two."
1980.79-1112,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2652.252,2657.748,"--Do you think the issues in these two cases are pretty much the same, or different?"
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2657.748,2658.327,These two cases?
1980.79-1112,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2658.327,2658.655,Yes--
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2658.655,2662.871,I would say they're quite different.
1980.79-1112,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2709.229,2716.383,--You want to patent the idea of using that program or one like it to figure out how long to cook the rubber?
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2716.383,2724.55,"Well, any computer is useless without some program, once you get... that is, except as an object to sell or something of that nature."
1980.79-1112,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2836.349,2839.457,But he does apparently claim that no computer program is patentable.
1980.79-1112,1,40723,robert_e_wickersham,,2839.457,2840.754,He does; yes.
1980.79-1112,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2901.262,2901.262,"Please, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1112,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2901.262,2902.526,Six minutes remaining.
1980.79-1112,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2902.526,2905.072,I'll try to be brief.
1980.79-1112,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2981.308,2984.869,"Well, do you think the Gould and Davis patent was a good patent?"
1980.79-1112,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2984.869,2987.571,We have no reason to think otherwise.
