2004.02-1472,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,9.166,We will now hear argument in the Cherokee Nation against Thompson and Thompson against the Cherokee Nation.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,10.774,14.755,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.02-1472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,27.553,32.216,Would you mind explaining to us how these two cases relate?
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,46.19,47.038,"--No, Justice O'Connor."
2004.02-1472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,66.812,72.18,But they're certainly at odds on the legal theory.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,72.18,73.766,"--Yes, they are, Your Honor."
2004.02-1472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,104.706,113.623,"Are the circumstances any different in the two situations, the Cherokee Nation case and the one in the Federal Circuit?"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,122.994,124.935,"--No, Justice O'Connor."
2004.02-1472,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,217.277,224.13,Does the... do the actual contracts reduce the... the CSC's to a dollar amount or--
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,224.13,224.79,"Yes, they do."
2004.02-1472,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,224.79,229.537,--So... so we know... they... they knew at the moment the contract was signed what it was going to cost.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,229.537,231.273,"That is correct, Justice Souter."
2004.02-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,242.419,249.765,"I don't want to get ahead of you in taking us through the statute, so you can defer the question if... if you choose."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,274.907,277.629,"It... it is precisely, Justice Kennedy, what... what you stated."
2004.02-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.653,280.601,I... I stated an or.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,282.42,288.403,--The... the Government took money for its own Federal functions instead of... including contract monitoring--
2004.02-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,288.403,289.479,Including contract monitoring.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,289.479,290.344,--Including contract monitoring.
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,304.378,307.162,"These are strange contracts, of course, aren't they?"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,324.319,325.433,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,325.433,337.116,"Well, I... why would you expect that this strange kind of contract should... should, prima facie, be governed by the same rules as to appropriations as other contracts--"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,337.116,338.436,Because--
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.436,348.262,"--where... where an agency, having due regard to how much money is appropriated, will limit the number of contracts it enters into?"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,361.265,366.179,"--It... it is a unique contractual situation, Justice Scalia, but one that Congress fully anticipated."
2004.02-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,410.594,419.51,"But further to Justice Scalia's point, don't the contracts in question themselves contain clauses that say this is not a procurement contract?"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,419.51,422.566,The... the procurement contract... that is correct.
2004.02-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,427.395,429.214,"Oh, the act says that they're not procurement contracts."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,429.214,429.89,"--the contracts are not procurement contracts, Justice Kennedy."
2004.02-1472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,456.745,458.026,"Mr. Miller, do--"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,458.026,459.102,Justice Ginsburg.
2004.02-1472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,459.102,493.299,"--on... on the interpretation you've just explained to us, does that mean that the Secretary has no authority under this statute or generally to reserve some portion of this for what you call Federal functions, that it... every penny of the appropriation could go to the costs of this contract and nothing left in the till for the so-called Federal functions?"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,493.299,497.507,"Justice Ginsburg, I... I would put my answer in this context."
2004.02-1472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,522.753,525.891,"But your... your answer is, yes, if it came to that, they--"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,525.891,528.576,That's the duty Congress imposed upon the Secretary.
2004.02-1472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,537.204,542.915,"--Well, let me ask you another question related."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,549.974,551.171,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2004.02-1472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,551.171,572.431,"Do the ones who come to court to sue get paid in full even though there may be many other self-determination contracts out there, and that if you gave them all their fair share, none of them would be paid in full?"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,578.935,582.651,"Your Honor, we... we do not believe that that... that should be the outcome."
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.465,597.057,"I mean, you can't get blood out of a turnip."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,603.744,608.202,--If there were only sufficient money to pay half of the contract shortfalls--
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.202,608.368,Right.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,608.368,621.593,"--without violating the clause and the Secretary had the discretion not to reduce appropriations, or he could, for programs serving other tribes, and then the tribes would only be entitled to half of the shortfall, if there was only a sufficient amount of money."
2004.02-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,621.593,630.222,"Didn't the tribes get notice they might not get the full amount of the... the CSC, and so they had ample opportunity to cut back on their spending?"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,630.222,632.08,"No, Justice Kennedy, and... and to the contrary."
2004.02-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,642.376,644.401,So these... these are reliance damages in a sense.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,644.401,647.389,--The... the tribes expected to be paid.
2004.02-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,650.34,659.218,"I mean, they... they were out of pocket for money they spent before they knew, other than the statutory notice they had, that they wouldn't get the full amount?"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,659.218,659.856,That is correct.
2004.02-1472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,659.856,667.103,"Well, when do the tribal contractors know how much money the Government actually will have available to spend?"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,667.103,675.565,"The contractors don't know until the year is over because throughout the year, the Government reserves the power, although not exercised, but stated in a circular, to reprogram."
2004.02-1472,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,676.846,677.673,What... what do you mean by that?
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,682.624,690.592,"--When the Secretary prepares a budget to the Congress, it states usually a lump sum amount of, say, $1.8 billion."
2004.02-1472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,712.406,718.267,"Yes, but the... the tribes have to enter contracts not knowing how much money is going to be there at the end of the day?"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,718.267,727.184,"The tribes enter into contracts, as most Government contractors do when they enter into contracts before an appropriation is made, not knowing if the agency will have the money to pay them."
2004.02-1472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,738.95,739.321,All right.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,745.1,746.936,The Federal Government--
2004.02-1472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,746.936,748.422,There was the appropriation.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,748.422,748.96,--Yes.
2004.02-1472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,748.96,751.106,And the tribes had already entered into contracts.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,753.502,762.956,"The agency then, under this Court's teaching in Lincoln v. Vigil, has complete discretion over how it spends its appropriation except insofar as--"
2004.02-1472,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,762.956,763.533,Is that what you mean by programming?
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,763.533,766.755,"--Yes, thank you, Justice Souter, for taking me back to your question."
2004.02-1472,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,780.972,786.834,So programming is allocating various segments of the lump sum to various purposes.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,786.834,787.206,Correct.
2004.02-1472,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,787.206,787.66,Okay.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,787.66,790.882,And the Secretary retains complete discretion as this Court taught--
2004.02-1472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,790.882,797.009,And is that done without regard to the contract amounts that the tribes have entered into?
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,797.009,799.798,"--Well, it should not be done without regard to the contract amounts--"
2004.02-1472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,799.798,801.285,Is that in fact how it was done?
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,801.285,802.482,--That is in fact how it was done.
2004.02-1472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,802.482,804.135,And is it still done that way?
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,804.135,806.214,"Well, the times have changed."
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.878,830.186,"But didn't... didn't Congress, even before that, impose a significant limitation on how much the Secretary could pay?"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,865.026,872.457,"Justice Scalia, we read this... this clause with... keeping in mind the first sentence first of the sentence."
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.352,893.566,"Well, that's all very good, but--"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,893.566,894.847,But then there's an exception.
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,894.847,900.419,--then the last paragraph begins with the word notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,901.412,901.595,We--
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,901.595,903.807,"--it seems to me, overrides everything else."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,920.359,922.838,"--Justice Scalia, for... for two reasons we think it cannot."
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,946.01,946.382,Wait.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,946.382,948.49,--Page... sorry--
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,948.49,949.112,21 of--
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,949.112,950.802,--21a of our opening blue brief.
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.802,952.167,"--Okay, 21a, good."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,952.167,954.246,"21a, correct."
2004.02-1472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,967.232,974.458,"Oh, fine, but you still have to look at that last sentence in subsection (b) and grapple with what it means."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,985.436,986.362,--So what could it mean?
2004.02-1472,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,986.984,987.522,"Now, what does it mean?"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,987.522,988.47,We have to give it meaning.
2004.02-1472,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1016.334,1017.039,All right.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1069.916,1070.659,That is our position.
2004.02-1472,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1070.659,1076.026,"If that is your position, do you have to even grapple with difficulties about the notwithstanding clause?"
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1076.026,1086.966,"Well, we still need to provide some meaning to the... to the provision that says the Secretary may not... does not have to reduce funding for programs serving other tribes."
2004.02-1472,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1090.104,1096.625,But... but I thought you were saying you could... you could... the... the Secretary doesn't have to reduce funding for other tribes.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1104.139,1105.148,--It's going to be the bureaucracy.
2004.02-1472,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1105.148,1105.254,Just give them the... just give them the money.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1105.254,1107.937,It's not going to be the programs on the ground serving the tribes.
2004.02-1472,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1109.34,1109.978,Okay.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1109.978,1111.259,"Now, it may be felt--"
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1111.259,1125.682,"To put it... this is a competition between two bureaucracies, the tribal bureaucracy that is administering the program and the Secretary's bureaucracy which is administering the program of programs."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1141.602,1142.14,"--Well, I would... I would--"
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1142.14,1144.946,"--you... you paint it as though the... you know, who cares about the bureaucrats."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1151.223,1152.542,--I say that for two reasons.
2004.02-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.987,1196.359,Can I ask you a basic question--
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1196.359,1197.268,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2004.02-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1197.268,1198.754,"--which maybe others understand, but I'm confused."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1299.453,1304.804,The equivalent of the $10 million would be sums not spent on anything--
2004.02-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1304.804,1305.442,Yes.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1305.442,1306.828,"--in this case, up to $100 million."
2004.02-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1306.828,1307.859,"Yes, okay."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1309.224,1311.619,"Any of the increases, any of the sums."
2004.02-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1314.237,1317.109,"Well, forget this statute for a second because I'll stop you there."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1321.484,1322.865,--Why the purpose.
2004.02-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1322.865,1331.515,"Explain to me why it is one of the purposes for which those appropriations were made, i.e., the equivalent of the $10 million, to go pay for this."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1331.515,1334.737,"Well, that's one of the things the... the Government and we agree upon."
2004.02-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1334.737,1336.428,It was one of the purposes.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1336.428,1344.89,"One of the purposes was paying contracts, and that's because in this act, the appropriation says here's $1.4 billion or $1.8 billion to carry out the Indian Self-Determination Act."
2004.02-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1346.376,1346.748,All right.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1363.344,1364.597,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2004.02-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1364.597,1365.285,Okay.
2004.02-1472,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1365.285,1368.007,"Well, you can't say that the Government agrees to that."
2004.02-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1369.1,1369.472,"No, no."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1370.198,1371.145,The Government--
2004.02-1472,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1371.145,1372.51,--were it an ordinary contract.

2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1411.385,1412.023,--That is correct.
2004.02-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1414.607,1417.329,"Well, you did say the... these contracts were unique."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1417.329,1419.353,These contracts are unique.
2004.02-1472,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1436.36,1440.463,"Well, the Government says it's unique because the tribes are providing governmental services."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1447.301,1456.422,"But that's not unique either because the... the Government, the Department of Defense in Iraq contracts out governmental services, the provision of food to our troops in Iraq."
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1468.932,1477.31,"Well, they didn't contract it out to the government of Iraq."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1494.583,1495.697,Absolutely.
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1496.773,1499.745,That's... that's what makes it different from private contracts--
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1499.745,1500.217,--We--
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1500.217,1501.703,--even... even with Halliburton.
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1501.703,1502.241,--We--
2004.02-1472,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1502.241,1506.616,"I mean, Halliburton is not an Indian tribe and doesn't purport to be governing anybody."
2004.02-1472,0,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,1506.616,1509.755,--We submit that that difference was considered by Congress.

2004.02-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1630.621,1632.007,I'm asking... all right.

2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1651.326,1661.523,--it's been a background principle of Government contracting law that there are certain core agency functions that... that the Government is required to perform for itself and that it can't contract out.

2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1680.636,1683.115,"Well, you have to look at the particular context."
2004.02-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1683.115,1684.434,There must be a yes or no answer to that.

2004.02-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1694.947,1696.516,--to make... you see what I'm driving--
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1696.516,1716.661,"--If... if all that's at issue is a standard subject to availability clause in a contract and there were no reduction clause, as there is in this statute, and you're dealing with the standard procurement context, then there is a Court of Claims decision, the Blackhawk decision, that suggests, albeit in a footnote, that in that situation, there are funds available in the sense that they're legally unrestricted."
2004.02-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1716.661,1720.105,"--Correct, and which are the funds that are... that would be available here?"
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1720.748,1724.092,There aren't any funds that are available here in our view because--

2004.02-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1758.11,1758.481,Okay.
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1759.24,1759.695,--those particular provisos.
2004.02-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1759.695,1767.392,"You say if this were a classic, ordinary contract, the money would have been available legally speaking."
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1784.836,1787.558,"Well, first and foremost, the text of the statute."
2004.02-1472,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1798.128,1799.53,"Well, the language is the same."

2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1817.174,1821.882,--That particular phrase resembles the one that Justice Breyer posited in his hypothetical.
2004.02-1472,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1821.882,1822.137,Exactly.
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1822.137,1824.483,But the term available... and I think this is critical.
2004.02-1472,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1834.969,1846.403,But... but the other... the other side says you don't have to get to that because you could have paid the contract amounts here without reducing funds available for other tribes.
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1865.145,1867.458,I... I think that argument is incorrect.
2004.02-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.72,1902.956,I don't see that.
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1903.616,1903.882,--I'm sorry.
2004.02-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1904.359,1905.557,Not less.
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1906.567,1912.039,--Shall not... shall be not less than the amount that the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided.
2004.02-1472,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1945.864,1958.108,But... but I thought the submission of the petitioners' counsel was that some of these funds were used to monitor the contracts which are functions the tribes could have performed.
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,1960.353,1962.832,"I don't think so, Justice Kennedy."
2004.02-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1981.574,1982.029,It doesn't say that.
2004.02-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2008.695,2009.438,But... but--
2004.02-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2009.438,2012.699,So otherwise contractable sounds like a... a statutory question.
2004.02-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.699,2016.292,--But it... it's not talking about money that's otherwise contractable.
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2027.521,2028.143,Correct.
2004.02-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2028.143,2029.007,--not the use of funds.
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2029.007,2035.573,"Well, it's talking about both because the... the first part of subparagraph (1) is the amount of funds."
2004.02-1472,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2059.1,2088.699,"But how do you... how do you square that with the... on page 14a... reductions and, as Mr. Miller read to us, shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract managing... monitoring or administration by the Secretary, shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions, including but not limited to, and then a string of what I assume falls under the heading Federal functions."
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2088.699,2099.036,"Justice Ginsburg, the way we square that under the statute is that the leading... the initial sentence in subsection (b) says the amount of funds required by subsection (a) of this section."
2004.02-1472,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2112.394,2116.481,So are these noninherent Federal functions shall not be reduced to pay for Federal functions?
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2119.453,2120.651,"Oh, absolutely there are."
2004.02-1472,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2145.665,2148.265,Does it ever define them as noncontractable?
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2155.779,2156.977,It... it does.
2004.02-1472,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2156.977,2157.637,--the point of contractability?
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2157.637,2160.859,"It does, Justice Scalia... Justice Souter."

2004.02-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2326.0,2341.398,And you rely on the statement in (a) that the... the only funds that are available are funds that include funds to... to pay for supportive administrative functions that are otherwise contractable.
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2341.398,2342.496,--Right.
2004.02-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2343.322,2347.631,And not funds that are used to pay for administrative functions that are not contractable.

2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2750.829,2769.405,"Because, Justice Breyer, I think the core of it is that even if you think that they're right, that these funds are legally available, that's not enough under the ISDA because the ISDA specifically reserves to the Secretary the discretion that he not be required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in order to make funds available to another tribe under this subchapter."
2004.02-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2769.405,2774.978,"Well, there is... is... the kind... the money that's available to one tribe can't be taken for the other."
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2787.959,2788.602,No.
2004.02-1472,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2793.022,2795.455,"Well, I'm thinking the Board of Contract Appeals and the Federal Circuit."
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2795.455,2800.491,"--Well, I don't think the Board of... of Contract Appeals really wrestled directly with where the funds were coming from."
2004.02-1472,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2826.253,2832.957,"No, but if that's true, then everything... then every penny in the... in the IHS bureaucracy qualifies."
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2836.134,2839.932,"--Well, let's... Justice Souter, if I... if I could, let's look at the particular sources--"
2004.02-1472,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2839.932,2840.098,"No, no."
2004.02-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2843.83,2847.834,You... you can't limit it to inherent Government functions.
2004.02-1472,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2853.778,2854.233,Yes.
2004.02-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.233,2856.257,--if you read it as broadly as you've just read it.
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2856.257,2879.125,"--Well, I... I guess the way I'd like to make the point is to say that the sources of funds that they point to, which include inherent Federal functions and the... the noninherent Federal function bureaucracy that supports the administration of programs that serve tribes that are directly served by the Federal Government, those two are in fact programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe."
2004.02-1472,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2881.604,2907.322,"On... on that point... on that point, in the Federal Circuit Judge Dyke expressed considerable displeasure with the Government because he said three times I said, tell me what existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced if these contract support costs are paid in full."
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2941.335,2944.019,"--I don't... I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.02-1472,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2965.733,2965.983,"Now, what does that mean?"
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2965.983,2966.476,So--
2004.02-1472,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2966.476,2981.215,"I mean, one thing is existing contracts, things that are already ongoing, and then another thing is, well, we think that there's a new program that could be good for some tribe."
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3005.836,3017.253,"--We're talking about both existing programs and new programs, and with respect to new programs, there's... it's every bit as likely that those new programs would benefit contracting tribes as noncontracting tribes."
2004.02-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3018.905,3027.822,It's strange to talk of reducing... is... is not required to reduce funding for a new program.
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3032.197,3032.751,--Because--
2004.02-1472,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3032.751,3039.423,"That provision makes sense with regard to existing programs, but it doesn't make any sense with regard to proposed programs."
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3039.423,3044.745,"--Well, I don't think that reduce necessarily takes the existing year's appropriation as the baseline."
2004.02-1472,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3078.144,3092.671,"Mr. Srinivasan, you... you alluded a moment ago in... in answering Justice Ginsburg, I guess, to declarations on file on the Tenth Circuit case that... that specifically said we would have to reduce funds available for other programs."
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3117.729,3121.528,"Well, they... they make the point as a general matter, and they also give an example."
2004.02-1472,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3127.185,3129.004,Was that a new program or an existing program?
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3129.004,3131.372,--That's an... the... the particular example is an existing program.
2004.02-1472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3132.653,3141.403,It seems to me you can interpret those comments as saying we don't... they did not leave enough room in the budget for the programs we now want to support and our prior contractual obligations.
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3141.403,3145.823,"--You're... you're speaking with particular respect to the new programs, Justice Stevens?"
2004.02-1472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3145.823,3146.316,Yes.
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3162.663,3170.382,"Well, I don't think that even with respect to the current year there wouldn't be enough money to pay for the complete shortfall in contract support costs."
2004.02-1472,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3192.551,3195.811,Is there some way to avoid these problems now?
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3197.297,3207.411,"Justice O'Connor, Congress changed things by imposing a statutory cap, explicit statutory cap, on contract support cost funding beginning with 1998."
2004.02-1472,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3212.695,3221.795,"Why was there that difference between the BIA that got the statutory caps earlier and not till, was it, 4 years later for the IHS?"
2004.02-1472,1,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3221.795,3226.237,I think the difference lies in the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall.
2004.02-1472,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3337.543,3343.72,"Mr. Miller, you have about 4 minutes left."
2004.02-1472,2,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,3343.72,3345.039,"Justice Stevens, thank you."
2004.02-1472,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3368.779,3373.73,I think they disagree with you about the purpose in respect to the core Government function.
2004.02-1472,2,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,3373.73,3381.615,"--Secondly, with regard to the core governmental functions, in Blackhawk, the contractor had a settlement with the Veterans Administration."
2004.02-1472,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3591.773,3593.797,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
2004.02-1472,2,34817,lloyd_b_miller,,3593.797,3595.078,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."
