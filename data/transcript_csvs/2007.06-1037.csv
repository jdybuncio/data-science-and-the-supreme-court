2007.06-1037,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.451,"We'll hear argument next in Case 06-1037, Kentucky Retirement Systems v. EEOC."
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,9.356,18.322,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Retirement eligibility in Kentucky is based on 20 years of service or age 55."
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,69.191,84.514,"I guess the part that they are saying is arbitrary as I understand it, and I appreciate your correcting me if I don't understand it correctly, is that you get double your pension at 55 if you've worked 20 years as opposed to 10."
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,85.029,87.324,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice--"
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,87.324,93.369,"A worker who has been there, he's qualified, he has only worked for 10 years and now he's 55 years old."
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,108.753,116.484,"--If the EEOC's chart were... correct, that would be true, Your Honor, limited only to the amount of imputed service."
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,122.951,126.247,You would get 20 years rather than 10; is that right?
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,128.901,129.901,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,139.507,145.487,"So if a person works for 20 years, he gets more than if he worked for 10 years; is that right?"
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,145.487,145.831,That's right.
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,145.831,147.316,Now he is disabled.
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,156.968,158.812,"They impute... yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,161.138,162.606,Now I understand it.
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,195.843,198.341,"It's only partially right, Mr. Justice."
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,209.369,210.821,I didn't ask you for the reasons.
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,213.476,214.757,Your only partially--
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,214.757,216.756,Where am I factually wrong?
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,216.756,228.688,"--The difference is that the imputed service comes before 55, because you're not eligible for after 55 or after 20 years you are eligible for benefits--"
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,228.688,229.548,You're giving me reasons.
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,235.499,240.216,"--If you were disabled before normal retirement, you receive imputed service."
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,240.216,241.466,And not after?
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,241.466,242.122,Correct.
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,242.122,242.418,Okay.
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,281.823,294.429,"The reason for that, Justice Breyer, is as follows: The person who's 49 and gets disabled, assuming he does not have... he or she doesn't have 20 years of service, can't retire."
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,330.102,330.508,No.
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,371.085,373.241,"--My response, Justice, is this."
2007.06-1037,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,436.277,448.085,"This has been very helpful, but it does seem to me to raise a question about the fairness of your opening statement."
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,504.671,510.091,"Respectfully, Justice Kennedy, I think that's not entirely correct, for this reason."
2007.06-1037,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,526.74,528.615,You're saying you're one step removed.
2007.06-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,537.19,538.378,It's sometimes based on age.
2007.06-1037,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,538.378,539.643,--Huh?
2007.06-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,539.643,542.718,"It's sometimes based on age, sometimes years of service."
2007.06-1037,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.718,543.046,Right.
2007.06-1037,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,543.046,545.514,And always based on age plus service.
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,545.514,546.67,Right.
2007.06-1037,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,548.419,587.091,"But your answer, as I understand it, to Justice Breyer's question was, could be boiled down to this: The person whose disability benefit or total benefit following disability is calculated on the basis of age 55, is less likely to have worked or is likely to have worked less long than the person whose benefit is imputed and calculated on the basis of 20 years."
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,634.696,635.056,Yes.
2007.06-1037,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,635.056,635.634,Okay.
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,635.634,643.475,"As I noted before, it's about retirement eligibility, not about age."
2007.06-1037,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,675.82,683.974,"That would be a good argument if the sole basis for retirement under your system was years of service, but it's not just years of service, isn't that right?"
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,683.974,686.598,"--That's correct, Justice."
2007.06-1037,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,692.252,699.75,"You can't take your... you couldn't take your statute and erase all the references to age and have the statute work, could you?"
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,699.75,700.203,No.
2007.06-1037,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,705.919,709.418,Because the ADA expressly allows them to do that; isn't that right?
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,709.418,713.463,The ADA is designed to eliminate arbitrary age discrimination.
2007.06-1037,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,726.584,732.519,"That's... you're sticking in a word, ""arbitrary"", that appears nowhere in the body of the statute."
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,753.605,761.29,"Justice Ginsburg, I'm aware that the preamble alone doesn't direct, and I understand that the operative language is in 623(a)."
2007.06-1037,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.446,766.741,You'd be in better shape if it was in legislative history and not in the preamble.
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,769.053,775.957,"--I think, Justice, the legislative history is important for this reason."
2007.06-1037,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,807.07,827.218,"I think the Congress recognized that what they were protecting was not age as such, but old age, where in the other case they say it's the racial criterion and whether it's... or the sex criterion, whether it's a man that's adversely affected or a woman it doesn't make any difference; Title VII applies to them both."
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,839.072,849.646,"Justice Ginsburg, I understand this Court's holding in Cline was that the statute is intended to protect the relatively older as it relates to the relatively younger."
2007.06-1037,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,895.596,903.093,"There is one little piece of it that seems, that clearly does favor the younger retiree."
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,932.846,940.266,"That is correct, but Justice Ginsburg, that type of disability is not the disability which was at issue in this particular case."
2007.06-1037,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,953.79,958.554,I'm not sure that I follow that answer.
2007.06-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.554,965.958,Am I correct in understanding that your plan does not provide a disability benefit just as a disability benefit?
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,973.533,974.658,That's correct.
2007.06-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.345,988.76,So that for the old person who has already reached retirement age the fact that he doesn't get a disability benefit is common to everybody subject to the plan.
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,988.76,992.197,It is common subject to everyone in the plan without--
2007.06-1037,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,992.197,993.65,Isn't that the answer to Justice Breyer's question?
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,993.65,997.304,"--And I... you certainly said it better than I did, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-1037,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,997.304,1009.721,"But is there any reason... I think what you're saying is we should view this as a retirement plan and there are a number of ways you can be eligible for retirement: Age plus years of service, but another way you can be eligible is disability."
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,1009.721,1013.517,Disability fills in... it covers a gap.
2007.06-1037,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1056.157,1059.294,But let's take the one who gets over the five-year initial period.
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,1072.306,1074.742,"No, ma'am."
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1096.625,1097.75,"But that's the point, right?"
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,1097.75,1098.325,--point of eligibility.
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1098.325,1105.667,"There... that's what the complaint is, I think, that you say it's the second part that you just said."
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,1188.87,1201.068,"The answer to your question, Justice Breyer, is the person who has either 20 years or is 55 on the day they become disabled is already eligible to retire."
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1216.234,1218.14,You don't need anything to bring you to normal retirement.
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,1238.225,1241.802,--There's reasons why that isn't done.
2007.06-1037,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1279.552,1288.735,So the effect of this litigation is that policemen or firefighters who are injured and become disabled now get lower benefits for disability?
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,1288.735,1289.61,Much lower.
2007.06-1037,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1327.079,1331.89,"See, that's why I think the result in this case is just terrible."
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,1349.665,1369.267,"--You may get to this result in this way: If you determine that age is not the driver, that is, that because you have a plan that has normal retirement based on service alone, a 38-year-old employee who gets disabled with 18 years of service gets two years of imputed service."
2007.06-1037,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1376.247,1377.81,Suppose I can't make that assumption or adopt that premise.
2007.06-1037,0,39653,robert_d_klausner,,1394.679,1399.287,I think Your Honor you can reach the result in this way.
2007.06-1037,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1575.388,1576.201,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1585.102,1597.145,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In calculating the retirement benefits owed to disabled workers, Kentucky uses age as an explicit decisionmaking factor in a way that disadvantages older employees."
2007.06-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1598.503,1604.407,Let me ask you this sort of basic question: Does it use age any differently than it uses years of service?
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1604.407,1620.542,"--It does in the sense that, with respect to disabled employees, two employees who have the same total years of actual service but who are of different ages may receive dramatically different benefits."
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1620.542,1623.635,That's because of the period necessary to qualify for retirement?
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1623.635,1634.879,"It's... let me direct your attention to the relevant provision of the Kentucky statute, and it's at page 7a and 8a of the blue brief."
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1664.649,1665.819,Let me just interrupt you.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1671.067,1676.519,They... they are different in the sense that they are calculated differently.
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1678.345,1684.515,I thought that all that disability did was determine... help get a man who is disabled eligible for the retirement benefit.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1684.515,1685.172,--The program--
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1685.172,1686.577,That's the only function it provides.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1686.577,1687.405,--I think that's incorrect.
2007.06-1037,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.628,1714.753,"Well, why does that matter?"
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1755.191,1756.16,You can't.
2007.06-1037,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1787.162,1787.553,And--
2007.06-1037,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1787.553,1799.236,"It seems to me that what Kentucky is trying to do is to, at least in part, provide make-whole benefits for a police officer who becomes disabled below the age of 55."
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1834.706,1847.546,It is certainly not illegitimate for Kentucky to say: We want to be more generous to people who are forced to retire due to disability than to people who choose to retire voluntarily when they are physically capable of continuing to work.
2007.06-1037,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1877.674,1892.091,So if they want to do that and they have a case of a police officer who works beyond 55... the officer is 55-plus with 10 years of service and then becomes disabled... you say they have to give that person 10 years of credit.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1892.091,1903.413,"--If they are going to give the 45-year-old with 10 years of service 10 years of credit, they have to give the 55-year-old 10 years of service... with 10 years of service 10 years of credit, again, unless they can establish the cost-justification defense."
2007.06-1037,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1916.829,1918.094,But he is saying one thing more.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1945.663,1959.578,"Well, to go back to the question you were asking Mr. Klausner, I think if we were looking at the class of voluntary retirees, it would be an accurate generalization to say that those above 55 were likely to have fewer years of service than the younger people."
2007.06-1037,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1984.772,1985.943,--Just say that again.
2007.06-1037,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1988.16,1988.785,Yes.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1989.613,2008.575,"--If we're looking at the class of people who... including over 55-year-old and under 55-year-old... who want to continue working but who have been prevented from doing so by reason of disability, there is no reason to think that the older people within that class, as a group, will have fewer years in the line of fire than the younger people."
2007.06-1037,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.2,2009.794,Why?
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2012.995,2013.868,--No.
2007.06-1037,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2016.383,2017.368,Under their belt.
2007.06-1037,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2018.368,2019.382,They are exactly the same people.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2032.096,2049.964,"It's not just happenstance, because if you're guessing the likely tenure of service of people who take voluntary normal retirement before age 55, in a sense you are skewing the class, because the only people who can do that under Kentucky law are people with at least 20 years of service."
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2062.599,2082.998,"It seems to me your argument boils down to the claim that people who have already reached... become eligible for retirement by either age or period of service, the State has a duty to give them a chance to recover a disability benefit if they give a disability benefit to younger workers."
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2082.998,2083.686,No.
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2087.668,2094.197,The computation is for a different purpose in that... in... for the younger workers the purpose is to make them eligible for retirement.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2096.947,2103.132,"I think that's incorrect, and that was really the point I was making by quoting from the Kentucky law on page 7a and 8a."
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2129.199,2142.615,"The term ""eligibility for retirement"", as used in that part of the statute, is referring to actually the same thing as retirement achieved by getting their... getting credit for post-disability years."
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2142.615,2143.178,--Exactly.
2007.06-1037,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2183.583,2190.282,"So it's fine for them to use that, but you're saying it's not fine for them to use any element of age in making that computation?"
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2190.282,2191.079,--That's correct.
2007.06-1037,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2191.079,2196.937,"Even though, under the Federal law, they can use age as the exclusive requirement in determining retirement?"
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2196.937,2204.355,"Well, again, there is a an explicit exemption in the ADEA for a minimum retirement age."
2007.06-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2217.694,2218.818,What is wrong with using that as a benchmark?
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2227.473,2229.267,"--Well, again, I think the--"
2007.06-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.267,2238.029,The lesser or greater... this would be an instance where greater includes lesser for the reason that this lesser business has no stereotypes.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2262.599,2264.098,--There are a couple of things I'd say.
2007.06-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.902,2283.995,It doesn't say it's inapplicable.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2313.655,2316.935,There are several different answers I would give.
2007.06-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.165,2342.379,"No, because what you are looking at is to see whether the purpose of Congress is somehow implicated, a purpose designed to prevent stereotypical thinking from being used to put older people at a disadvantage."
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2346.782,2347.47,I think--
2007.06-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2347.47,2349.219,"Now, what's the response?"
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2349.219,2363.104,"--I think that's incorrect, that is, the two justifications that have been given for the disparate treatment of older workers are, first, younger workers as a group are likely to need more of a boost; and, second, the younger disabled person probably would have worked longer if he had not become disabled."
2007.06-1037,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2388.282,2397.309,The reason for that is that we accept the criterion at the outset that your pay bears some relationship to what you do.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2404.868,2412.444,"--Well, on the whole, the benefit bears a close... the retirement benefit bears a close relationship to what you have done."
2007.06-1037,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2438.481,2472.983,"And with respect to that, Mr. Stewart, the problem that Justice Breyer brought up, you... if you would look to your brief, page 30, footnote 13, the question is, so we have this... if we take your interpretation of the statute, how can we deal with a person in her 30s who becomes disabled when she is making a low salary and has only, say, 10 years of service?"
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2511.484,2513.609,--I guess there could be a range of alternatives.
2007.06-1037,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2539.318,2553.749,"But if do you that, aren't you going to be... you're going to be undercompensating the younger person who gets disabled and overcompensating the people over 55 who gets disabled who may not... it may not be realistic to think that someone's going to continue to work as a police officer until 65."
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2554.265,2566.603,"--Well, the other thing I would say about that justification, which rests on I think the valid statistical correlation between how old you are at the time that you're disabled and how much longer you would have worked."
2007.06-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2658.646,2662.566,"What about this idea, which is... would this wreck the statute?"
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2696.411,2702.659,"--I think, first, that would be contrary to the way that the word VII."
2007.06-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2702.659,2714.499,"I started out by saying, that's why I said that this is not an immutable characteristic, and it is... that's why I put all the qualifications in there."
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2714.499,2736.521,"Well, the court in Thurston has said the language of the ADEA should be construed similarly to that of Title VII because the basic anti-discrimination prohibition was drawn in haec verba from Title VII in the legislative history to the older workers's Benefit Protection Act when Congress amended the statute to cover fringe benefits, which the Court in Betts had held were not covered."
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2812.037,2814.271,May I ask this question right on that point.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2843.587,2845.368,"--Well, the discrimination is if you imagine--"
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2845.368,2848.506,"Well, first of all, tell me whether they're treated the same way under the plan."
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2848.506,2849.85,"--Well, it depends on other variables."
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2850.865,2853.269,What other variables?
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2853.269,2858.362,--As to the person who is five years away from qualifying by reason of--
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2858.362,2859.72,Years of service.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2859.72,2865.672,"--years of service, if that person is younger than 50, then they'll be treated the same, because each of them will have--"
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2865.672,2866.625,That's a hypothesis.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2866.625,2867.078,--But--
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2867.078,2871.638,So then how is that discrimination on the basis of age?
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2871.638,2873.341,--But it is a discrimination on the basis--
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.341,2875.246,It's not even discrimination as far as I see it.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2875.246,2881.494,"--Well, it wouldn't... there wouldn't be any claim of disparate treatment with respect to those two individuals."
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2923.836,2933.909,It seems to me that your claim boils down to an argument that the statute requires someone who is already qualified for retirement to get a disability benefit that the younger person would.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2935.346,2937.017,"No, I don't think that's correct."
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2968.1,2969.287,I see you talking about two benefits.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2969.287,2970.99,--they did use a more generous computation methodology.
2007.06-1037,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2970.99,2972.301,There not two benefits.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2973.692,2974.176,It's only one benefit.
2007.06-1037,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2985.562,2997.588,You prevent the State from taking into account the fact that younger disabled workers have not had the same opportunity that older disabled workers have.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3037.338,3042.211,"Well, first, we are not preventing Kentucky from imputing additional years."
2007.06-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3050.911,3060.016,Would it be the same as... I mean it seems to me now... I'm thinking the problem is we are going into the package; we are starting opening up the package that the 55-year-old retiree normally gets.
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3093.908,3098.719,"I'm not quite sure if I understand the question, but I don't think that there is any--"
2007.06-1037,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3098.719,3100.546,"That's fair, that you don't understand."
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3101.062,3108.826,"--I don't think there would be anything wrong with Kentucky saying we are going... in fact, this is what we are asking for."
2007.06-1037,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3227.198,3250.86,"Mr. Stewart, before you finish, that little piece that seems to be favoring the younger worker that you guaranteed at least... what was it, 25 percent of your final monthly salary, and you get 10 percent for each child... now that does seem to be something that's... that's not available for a regular retiree."
2007.06-1037,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3250.86,3260.106,"It's not available for a regular retiree, and it's not available for a person who is eligible for normal retirement but becomes disabled and is forced to retire for that reason."
2007.06-1037,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3303.215,3306.244,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2007.06-1037,2,39653,robert_d_klausner,,3309.009,3320.52,I'd like to start back where we just left off with Justice Ginsburg's question about the guaranteed benefit.
2007.06-1037,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3523.314,3524.627,Thank you Mr. Klausner.
