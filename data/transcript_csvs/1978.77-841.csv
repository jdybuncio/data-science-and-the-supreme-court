1978.77-841,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,64.299,"We will hear arguments next in 841, Quern against Jordan."
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,67.71,71.248,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,442.351,464.988,"How much of a case do you think we still have here in view of the majority of the en banc Seventh Circuit's opinion, which on the state's appeal, reversed the judgment of the district court, but said if the district court was so inclined, it could enter a more modest decree?"
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,464.988,468.225,"Your Honor, there is a case of controversy."
1978.77-841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,488.811,502.101,"Mr. Wenzel as a matter of Illinois law, would the state have the power or authority to give some retroactive relief for a period prior to April 8, 1971?"
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,502.101,521.839,"As a matter of state law, during this very period in time you mentioned, 1968 to 1971 and up through 1974 as a matter of fact, Illinois did participate in a federal state scheme of cooperative federalism known as the Aid to Aged, Blind and Disabled Program."
1978.77-841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,597.869,605.823,"Well, but the district, the Court of Seventh Circuit as I read its opinion, left that completely up to the state courts to determine."
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,619.966,629.366,"Your Honor, we view notice relief as very closely related to an actual award of benefits themselves, but our position goes further than that."
1978.77-841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,671.226,678.242,"Mr. Wenzel before you get too far into your argument, I want to be sure I got your entire answer to the question I put before."
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,699.213,700.965,That is correct.
1978.77-841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.965,705.951,But either result is possible as far as we know from the record and the law that you may be able to point out what is right?
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,705.951,711.888,Yes and I really did not complete my exposition of the state procedures.
1978.77-841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,795.22,808.889,"But isn't that just like various other claims that are asserted against the state that the claim maybe asserted before the court of claims or whatever it is called, I forget, and it may be established and then the legislation - the general assembly in its wisdom decides whether or not to pay the claim."
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,821.726,822.974,"That is correct, the next step --"
1978.77-841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,822.974,827.54,But they really won't have a chance to do this unless they initiate the claim in the first instance?
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,827.54,828.269,That is correct.
1978.77-841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.173,876.973,But the Court of the Appeals say that the one thing they can't do is order payment?
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,876.973,902.159,"That is correct, but I think that what they could do is at each step of the proceeding whether administrative or judicial [Voice Overlap] They can keep on intruding into legitimate state affairs and nudging this matter closer and closer to the point where payment will occur even though it couldn't be said directly that the Federal Court actually ordered it."
1978.77-841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,913.052,923.174,"I can understand why you would say that about the district court's order in this case, but the Seventh Circuit majority rather substantially modified it, didn't it?"
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,923.174,930.861,It said that it envisioned a notice which would not contain a predetermination of the liability of the state.
1978.77-841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,951.299,955.843,But that is by virtue of state law?
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,955.843,976.832,"But assuming that the Federal Court would retain power to enforce and protect its notice relief, it would seem to me that it - the court is not merely -- the court stands ready to intrude into state law and state procedure to see the desired result of an eventual monetary award realized."
1978.77-841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,976.832,986.754,"I would think if the majority of the Seventh Circuit felt the way you think it felt, it would simply would have affirmed Judge Will's order rather than reversed it."
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,994.565,1007.999,Maybe another way of approaching the problem is to attempt to delineate what Edelman precludes in the way of a Federal Court's remedial power for relief.
1978.77-841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.771,1084.854,"Would there be any objection if some community organization decided to -- say you win the case and then some community organization decides that well, these people, a lot of these are blind, disabled elderly people who were wrongfully denied some money about seven or eight years ago or ten, well, this community organization decides they ought to know what their rights are and send out precisely the same notice, would there be any -- would that have a different consequence and if the answer is no, are we really talking about who pays for the notice?"
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,1084.854,1086.985,The answer would be no.
1978.77-841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1097.311,1113.244,"No, my question is some do gooder, some organization says well, these people ought to know what their rights are and send out a bulletin in the same words as the notice that Court of Appeals apparently thought was appropriate, wouldn't that produce all the consequences that you are concerned about?"
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,1113.244,1121.638,"Yes, but it would not be as a result of a Federal Court's order over the objection of the state that it is in violation of its right to be free from suit under the Eleventh Amendment."
1978.77-841,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1121.638,1131.003,Seriously if a private association did it as they would when the court of appeals en banc does so?
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,1131.003,1171.19,"Well, especially in the very litigation in which the prohibition of an award of monetary benefits had been precluded by this very Court, we feel that very strongly that what is happening here is they are attempting to achieve the ultimate goal of retroactive benefits by indirection and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals is aiding and abetting this indirection, we feel, in violation of this Courts' decision and certainly inconsistently with the principles of sovereign immunity because, because of the federal order to grant notice relief, there will be a significant intrusion upon the state affairs."
1978.77-841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.65,1202.922,But the do-gooder could say there has been a federal decision that the state of Illinois wrongfully denied you money that you are entitled to and that the do-gooder could tell all that and in fact in this Court of Appeals' notice need not necessarily recite that it was ordered by the Court of Appeals?
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,1202.922,1204.454,There is one significant difference.
1978.77-841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.115,1247.601,"He might not be able to benefit the entire class, just those that don't know their rights would just let them fall by the way side and we just protect those that are on the surface, I see."
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,1247.601,1264.043,I think that notice relief under the circumstance of this case in any form cannot be deemed to be consistent with the principles of federalism which are embodied in the Eleventh Amendment.
1978.77-841,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1376.881,1379.489,"We will resume there at 1 o'clock, counsel."
1978.77-841,0,46483,william_wenzel,,1404.808,1407.431,Mr. Chief Justices and may I please Court.
1978.77-841,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1416.431,1419.003,Very well.
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,1426.159,1429.248,Mr. Chief Justices and may I please the Court.
1978.77-841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1521.017,1528.44,"Mr. Roodman, class action procedures have come into play largely since I left the private practice."
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,1540.829,1544.176,"Yes your Honor, this was a B2 class on the federal --"
1978.77-841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1544.176,1545.492,Injunctive --
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,1545.492,1554.523,"Correct, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and therefore no notice is required under the federal rules and no notice had been sent to these members of the class."
1978.77-841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.944,1631.89,You are talking now about an affirmative basis for the district court's authority to act.
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,1639.308,1640.272,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1758.292,1787.456,"What if the order had provided in addition to what the Seventh Circuit said it could provide that can't -- although Illinois law did not provide for any hearing in this situation, as a matter of federal constitution law under the Goldberg versus Kelly line of cases, a hearing was mandated by the Constitution and therefore regardless of Illinois law, the Illinois state system would have to give hearings?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,1787.456,1793.202,"Your Honor, we believe that that order is well would be permissible under the Eleventh Amendment."
1978.77-841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1812.228,1821.146,"Certainly it would be imposing a rather substantial aspect of retrospect of relief, would it not?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,1821.146,1828.372,"Your Honor, it would not necessarily be imposing such a burden, that question would be left to the state."
1978.77-841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1828.372,1832.108,Except that the state would be required to hold a hearing?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,1832.108,1844.114,"Yes your Honor, there is the fact that the petitioner has violated the federal rights of the members of the plaintiff class is central."
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1886.976,1887.796,Are you finished with Mr. Justice Rehnquist?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,1887.796,1891.303,Yes.
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.303,1895.797,"I just wondered if, what was the jurisdictional basis for this civil matter?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,1895.797,1902.843,The original jurisdictional base for the lawsuit is Section 13.43.
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.843,1906.875,And your claim was based on the federal law?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,1906.875,1912.199,"Your Honor, the original claim was based both on the Equal Protection Clause and the Supremacy Clause."
1978.77-841,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2006.343,2010.715,Who speaks for the state of Illinois in this Court?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2010.715,2015.751,"Your Honor, the Attorney General does represent the director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid before this Court."
1978.77-841,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2015.751,2020.512,"Well, should we look to hear the views in the state of Illinois."
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2020.512,2024.857,"Well that is the -- Your Honor, that is the sole person before the Court today I think."
1978.77-841,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2024.857,2028.519,I'm not sure and I understand your prior statement.
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2028.519,2030.676,Your Honor we think that the --
1978.77-841,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2030.676,2038.536,"I understood you, to say there is nothing to indicate or that the director is speaking for the Sovereign state of Illinois."
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2038.536,2046.77,We were maintaining your Honor that his interests and the interests of the Sovereign state of Illinois are not necessarily aligned.
1978.77-841,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2090.391,2094.799,How do we resolve this potential conflict that you are implying?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2094.799,2095.096,"Your Honor, I think --"
1978.77-841,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2095.096,2099.856,Do we decide what is good for what the state of Illinois thinks about this?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2099.856,2107.256,No the question is whether the state officer should be permitted to invoke the immunity of the state of Illinois.
1978.77-841,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2107.256,2110.911,Can the Attorney General invoke the immunity?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2110.911,2111.533,No.
1978.77-841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2218.429,2223.051,"The original district court decree in this case didn't speak in terms of damage, did it?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2239.896,2249.865,"Money judgments, Your Honor, are judgments that have a direct monetary impact upon the state for a past conduct."
1978.77-841,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2312.651,2322.209,"Now what if the state's executive branch pursuant to your suggestion, decides not to pay, then what?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2324.571,2325.224,Yes your honor.
1978.77-841,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2325.224,2330.078,"And what if the state court decides they should pay, then what happens?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2330.078,2335.141,Well I would assume if the state courts decide that they should pay that the state officer would respect the judgments of the state.
1978.77-841,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2335.141,2344.181,What if the Attorney General says that the purposes of illustration that violates the Eleventh Amendment and our holdings?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2344.181,2347.825,"The Eleventh Amendment would not apply in the state courts, Your Honor."
1978.77-841,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2347.825,2351.292,"And that's why I posed it, what if he asserted that?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2351.292,2359.002,"Our only remedy your Honor would be for within the state court system, we might pursue the remedies of contempt within the state court system."
1978.77-841,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2368.513,2376.628,"And conversely, if the state courts in that hypothetical decide no entitlement that's the end of it, is it?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2376.628,2379.415,"Yes your Honor, that is correct."
1978.77-841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2379.415,2399.489,"Mr. Roodman, what you do with cases like In Re Ayers and Hagood against Southern that was cited in Edelman against Jordan, where the Court refused to permit suit in federal court for specific performance of a contract which I take it could well not have involved monetary damages?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2399.489,2403.857,"Your Honor, those cases did involve collection on Bonds."
1978.77-841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2425.438,2444.934,"Would you allow -- would you think the Eleventh Amendment allowed a district court in a case such as this to order a state official to specifically perform a contract in which the state had engaged so long as it did not involve actual payment of money, supposedly to involve furnishing of supplies to a group of people?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2444.934,2449.349,"The question, Your Honor, we think would turn on principles of federalism."
1978.77-841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2589.354,2597.676,"Well, Mr. Roodman, in the tax cases wasn’t the claim of Ford motor company for example that the tax violated the federal constitution?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2597.676,2598.434,Yes.
1978.77-841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2598.434,2601.396,Would you say that was not of federal interest?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2601.396,2605.156,"Your Honor, there is certainly is a federal interest in the Fourteenth Amendment."
1978.77-841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2625.564,2638.669,"Well, I was puzzled by your statement that there were no federal interests about the same magnitude involved in the tax cases in the 40s as they were in this case."
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2644.858,2646.745,"I certainly would agree, Your Honor."
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2943.103,2946.536,Can I pursue my previous question with you for a moment?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2946.536,2947.1,Yes sir.
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.1,2955.396,"Suppose that in this complaint there had been only the so-called statutory issue, it is the claim of conflict no equal protection issue."
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2959.216,2961.623,"Your Honor, we believe there would be this question is --"
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2961.623,2963.637,Because?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2963.637,2969.376,Because the Supremacy Clause is an integral part of the Constitution.
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2976.584,2981.131,If you are wrong on that?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2981.131,2988.364,If we are wrong on that question that would not disturb in anyway the Court's affirmance of the order of the Seventh circuit.
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2988.364,2996.462,"Well, I didn’t -- just take my example, only the statutory claim, that is in the complaint?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,2996.462,2998.49,"Excuse me, you mean jurisdictionally?"
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2998.49,3000.922,Yes was there jury -- is there any.
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3012.705,3015.991,"Yes, Your Honor, to both the questions."
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.015,3032.565,"Under the -- any law as part of 1983, is that it?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3032.565,3043.779,"Yes Your Honor, there is a dual, both under the constitutional language of 1983 as well as the and laws."
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3043.779,3048.23,Let's assume that 1983 did not reach and laws?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3048.23,3050.21,Yes.
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3050.21,3053.526,Would there be a jurisdictional problem in my example?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3053.526,3056.131,"Your Honor, we would have jurisdiction under 1331."
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.683,3073.731,"Yeah, there your cause of action would be arising under the Social Security Act?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3073.731,3084.166,If we were then to claim that the cause of action for the violation of the Social Security Act was not a question also under 1331?
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3084.166,3108.772,"Yes, if 1983 does not reach all federal statutes and the Social Security Act isn't covered by 1983 and you went in under 1331 attempting to state of cause of action, you would have to successfully claim that the Social Security Act gives a private cause of action?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3108.772,3109.489,"Well, we would have to."
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3159.846,3163.039,"In any event, there has been no jurisdiction issue raised in this?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3163.039,3166.589,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3166.589,3171.215,"But I suppose, we are permitted to raise it on our own?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3171.215,3175.453,"Well, the jurisdiction of the Federal Court here is clear."
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3185.457,3197.025,"Well, you maybe properly in the Federal Court on the constitutional issue that you asserted under 1530 or 1543."
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3202.103,3209.647,"Well, Your Honor after seven years of this litigation, I think it is appropriate for the Court to exercise that pendent jurisdiction."
1978.77-841,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3209.647,3214.699,Did you say you thought that Edelman had sustained the cause of action under 1983?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3214.699,3216.716,"Yes, I did."
1978.77-841,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3216.716,3224.181,"Merely because, the allegation was in violation of a federal law, namely the Social Security Act?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3224.181,3226.001,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3226.001,3235.386,"You also allege a constitutional violation in your compliant, so that you would we presume we have an argument for pendent jurisdiction under Hagans against Lavine?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3235.386,3236.148,"Precisely, that --"
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3236.148,3238.19,"Yes, but there still has to be a cause of action?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3243.485,3244.334,Yes.
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3244.334,3250.069,"And if 1983 doesn’t reach the Social Security Act, there is no cause of action --"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3250.069,3251.097,"Well, declaratory judgment --"
1978.77-841,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3251.097,3254.556,-- and there is nothing to be appended?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3254.556,3271.241,"Well, if 1983 would be the proper cause of action for the constitutional claim, we would have a pendent claim under that Declaratory Judgment Act and under general equitable principles for what your denominating as solely the statutory claim."
1978.77-841,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3271.241,3279.319,"Yes, but would you under 1983 have a claim that is the question for a violation of the Social Security Act?"
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3279.319,3279.804,Yes it is –
1978.77-841,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3279.804,3283.951,You say and I think what you said was Jordan I said you did?
1978.77-841,1,41984,sheldon_roodman,,3283.951,3288.792,Precisely.
1978.77-841,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3289.928,3302.106,"Very well, if you have anything further Mr. Wenzel."
1978.77-841,2,46483,william_wenzel,,3302.106,3322.715,"In response to counsel’s comments, I’d like to return to what I think are two crucial facts that are particular to this case which are decisive of the issue of whether any form of notice relief is appropriate under this Court’s decision in Edelman under the Eleventh Amendment."
1978.77-841,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3359.082,3362.843,What he was now saying is the class was entitled --
1978.77-841,2,46483,william_wenzel,,3362.843,3373.858,"That is correct in fact, the plaintiff Mr. Justice Marshall if Mr. Jordan has received his retroactive benefits, he would not even be seeking."
1978.77-841,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3400.933,3423.148,"Well, both of these propositions are propositions that maybe, that will only be considered and maybe accepted by the state administrative agencies, of course ie, that there is no administrative remedy or B if there may have once been, now Congress is repealed the law, so there now no longer is, but that is a matter for the state courts to determine."
1978.77-841,2,46483,william_wenzel,,3428.504,3433.14,"Well, we back up to whether or not the notice."
1978.77-841,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3433.971,3442.98,"Maybe the notice is a vain thing, may be it's futility, but that again doesn’t directly bear on the Eleventh Amendment?"
1978.77-841,2,46483,william_wenzel,,3442.98,3465.597,"Insofar is noticeable trigger the request for hearings, the hearing themselves judicial review, possible action by the legislative is triggering governmental machinery, which is far as we are concerned substantially intrudes upon the Sovereign and violates the Sovereign’s freedom form suit."
1978.77-841,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3551.655,3552.392,Thank you gentleman.
