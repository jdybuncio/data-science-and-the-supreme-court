1992.91-1618,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.218,"We'll hear argument first this morning in number 91-1618, George Voinovich v. Barney Quilter."
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,12.509,16.343,"Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,194.559,201.802,"Is dilution the only issue in the case under the Fifteenth Amendment, as you see it?"
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,201.802,221.207,"Your Honor, under the Fifteenth Amendment, no, because the district court in passing seemed to say that because there was some political gerrymandering, which they felt was racially based, that there was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment."
1992.91-1618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,221.207,227.498,"Well, I take it you concede that race was an explicit factor in the redistricting?"
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,227.498,241.84,"Yes, Your Honor, it was, but not for an invidious purpose, and we believe this Court's opinion in Carey would support the use of race, which the apportioning persons did in this case."
1992.91-1618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,241.84,242.579,"Well, the--"
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,242.579,243.961,It was not for an invidious purpose.
1992.91-1618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,243.961,262.012,"--THe usual rule is that disparate treatment requires the State in this case or the apportioning authorities to bear the burden of proof to show that there was a compelling interest, does it not?"
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,262.012,277.852,"Well, Your Honor, we believe that the record shows that the use of race was not invidious and was, first of all, necessary because of the housing patterns of the African American community in our State."
1992.91-1618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,277.852,280.365,"Well, first, let's just first of all talk about the burden of proof."
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,302.79,318.808,"Well, Your Honor, we believe that there is a difference in the argument we make between the placing of the burden of proof under the Voting Rights Act, which was shifted to the appellants, and the burden which we believe we met with respect to the Fifteenth Amendment."
1992.91-1618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,318.808,322.641,"Well, would you agree that the burden should be placed on you in this respect?"
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,322.641,334.159,"We believe, Your Honor, that would be correct, that we do have an obligation to show... and we believe the record clearly does show... that the use of race was not for an invidious purpose."
1992.91-1618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,382.912,395.848,"Well, suppose that a State decided that it wanted better urban-rural balance, and it said we need to put some rural voters into the... some urban voters into the rural districts."
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,404.474,419.635,"Well, Your Honor, it would depend again if it were such as this Court's decision in Gomillion where we fenced out or minimized the political effectiveness of the black community, it would be a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment."
1992.91-1618,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,421.908,427.272,"But would there be a violation for using this kind of stereotype, this kind of shorthand?"
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,427.272,429.641,"--I believe not, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.682,477.523,"Mr. Goodman, you seem to be adopting the proposition that the use of race is perfectly okay so long as it is benign, it's intended for a good purpose."
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,484.777,485.769,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1992.91-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,485.769,488.03,--even though that had a benign purpose.
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,495.924,496.966,"--I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.222,524.333,"Well, you think that they're the wrong plaintiffs here."
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,528.377,528.735,--No.
1992.91-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.735,541.315,"If, in fact, some white Democrats had brought the suit claiming that this was diluting their votes, then the suit might lie."
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,541.315,542.106,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.931,582.753,They didn't violate the Voting Rights Act.
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,606.83,635.698,"--I think, Justice Scalia, my response would be that since Thornburg and the section 2 amendments focus on the results of a plan, that there is no way that the apportioning persons in this case could have drafted a plan with the housing and the location of the minority community in our States without taking cognizance of race."
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,668.099,672.641,plan... you intentionally used race.
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,686.381,687.002,--Yes.
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,688.322,689.444,Isn't that so far right?
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,689.444,689.824,--That is correct.
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,689.824,690.994,"Well, that is a discrimination."
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,690.994,692.526,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,692.526,694.616,That is a discrimination.
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,694.616,699.91,"Yes, it is a discrimination, Your Honor, but not for an invidious purpose."
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.91,717.931,"You seem to say that any time the black community agrees with you in creating a minority-majority district, that that's all you need for this purposeful discrimination."
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,717.931,728.837,"Well, Your Honor, we think that is clearly a part of what we are arguing, that there could be no injury for the protected class."
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.837,741.667,Why do you think the commission should be able to use just the totality of the circumstances test instead of the Gingles test?
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,741.667,747.531,"By the Gingles test, you mean, Your Honor, the finding of a majority of the political cohesiveness--"
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,747.531,751.024,"Yes, and racial block voting."
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,751.024,751.675,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,768.274,772.097,"I know you don't, but... because you don't want to apply the Gingles test."
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,772.097,772.327,No.
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,783.805,784.746,Well--
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,784.746,785.738,--that there was no--
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.738,789.548,--But you don't want... you want to reverse the district court on another ground.
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,789.548,792.169,--Well--
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,792.169,800.427,"You don't want to... I mean, the argument you've been making would reverse the district court not on the mistake on the... in applying the Gingles test--"
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,800.427,801.976,--We--
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,801.976,804.698,--but just on this more general view--
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,804.698,805.75,"--Well, Justice White--"
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,805.75,809.631,--that you can discriminate as long as you think you're doing it for a good purpose.
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,809.631,810.202,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,851.209,859.245,Do you accept the proposition that you have the burden to prove that your object was to comply with the Federal law?
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,866.178,866.919,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,888.734,890.274,Which is hard to show.
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,912.918,913.759,"Well, Justice Scalia--"
1992.91-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.759,916.251,That would be an extraordinary principle for us to adopt it seems to me.
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,916.251,922.605,"--Well, I would think it would not be extraordinary based upon how these apportionment plans are drafted."
1992.91-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.495,951.653,Administrative efficiency.
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,951.653,952.374,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1992.91-1618,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.374,954.695,Administrative efficiency demands it.
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,954.695,968.196,"Well, I think, Your Honor, we tried to follow this Court's Gingles opinion, and we tried to follow the Carey case which did, again as I say, note the fact that purposeful noting of race was taken into consideration."
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,968.657,974.37,What do you do about the district court's finding that there was no racial block voting in Ohio?
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,974.37,975.269,--Your Honor--
1992.91-1618,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.269,981.224,"Do we... to find for you, do we have to find that that was plain error or was what?"
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,982.015,982.415,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1026.655,1027.685,"--Yes, you may, Mr. goodman."
1992.91-1618,0,37127,n_victor_goodman,,1027.685,1028.255,Thank you.
1992.91-1618,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1028.255,1029.967,"Mr. Hungar, we'll hear from you."
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1029.967,1044.665,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1618,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1083.762,1084.671,"Well, Mr.--"
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1117.873,1119.845,"Justice O'Connor, in our view--"
1992.91-1618,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1119.845,1121.497,And who has the burden of proof?
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1121.497,1126.44,"--In our view, that's a very difficult question."
1992.91-1618,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1202.809,1215.338,"Well, in this case there was an allegation in the complaint that influence of black voters was derogated."
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1221.232,1231.73,"Well, Justice Kennedy, with respect I believe... we interpret the complaint to raise a dilution claim, that is, a claim that black voters were intentionally discriminated against."
1992.91-1618,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1258.626,1261.798,"Well, if there's an influence claim, are we remitted to the Gingles factors?"
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1261.798,1264.041,We don't believe so.
1992.91-1618,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1285.914,1292.789,"Well, suppose there's just a section 2 claim that they... which is an influence claim, rather than a dilution claim."
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1298.823,1299.905,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1346.665,1365.636,What is the justification for a State in reapportioning ever deliberately taking race into account in order to create a... intentionally to create a single-member district that will be controlled by a minority?
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1368.588,1375.173,"Justice White, again that's a very difficult question that raises sensitive constitutional issues in--"
1992.91-1618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.173,1375.433,Yes.
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1377.494,1387.091,"--In United Jewish Organizations against Carey, a plurality of the Court suggested that that would be appropriate certainly in section 5 cases where the Department of Justice has objected."
1992.91-1618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1391.743,1393.416,Why doesn't it raise the question?
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1393.416,1401.981,--Because there's no claim in this case that the State's failure to take race into... or decision to take race into account in itself violated the Constitution.
1992.91-1618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1409.897,1417.902,What if there has been a challenge to creation of any minority controlled districts in this case?
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1417.902,1420.413,--The United States--
1992.91-1618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1420.413,1421.202,What would have been your answer?
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1421.202,1430.909,--The position of the United States is that it is appropriate for States to take race into account in certain circumstances in order to avoid a violation of section 2.
1992.91-1618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1442.677,1449.882,"In short, if the Gingles... if the State can satisfy the Gingles factors, they may create these districts."
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1449.882,1456.377,"--If... we don't believe that the Gingles factors alone, Your Honor, are enough to establish a section 2 violation, but if the State has a--"
1992.91-1618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.377,1457.927,I didn't ask you that.
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1468.964,1479.062,"--If a State... if the State has a reasonable basis for believing that it is necessary to create majority and minority districts in order to avoid a violation of section 2, it is permitted to do so."
1992.91-1618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.385,1488.798,And that involves applying the Gingles factors?
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1488.798,1491.289,"Yes, that's part of the analysis in our view."
1992.91-1618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1504.808,1510.421,But then are you arguing that the proponent of the plan had the burden of showing there was no section 2 violation?
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1510.421,1518.478,"--No, Your Honor, because again there is no... this case does not involve the type of claim that we've just been discussing."
1992.91-1618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1526.422,1543.493,"No, but in performing their duty to prepare a proper plan, you say have a duty to avoid a section 2 violation, that would seem to me, if you're saying that, that they have a duty to decide for themselves that this particular plan is necessary and, therefore, assume the burden."
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1545.523,1552.88,"Well, certainly if a State chooses... Congress, in enacting section 2, commanded the States to avoid violating section 2."
1992.91-1618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1566.308,1567.67,"Sure, and give it a wide berth."
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1574.805,1575.393,"--Well, again, Your Honor--"
1992.91-1618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1575.393,1577.856,"So, it isn't just Gingles applied all the way."
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1582.479,1584.029,--As you know--
1992.91-1618,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1584.029,1584.91,Is that proper?
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1584.91,1594.598,--we have not addressed the precise nature of this type of claim in our brief and have not taken a formal position on that question because in our view it's not presented in this case.
1992.91-1618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1596.488,1597.429,Let me ask you this.
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1612.097,1614.979,"I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1623.535,1625.015,Your answer to my question is you don't know.
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1625.015,1625.576,--Yes.
1992.91-1618,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.269,1631.011,Neither does the Government I guess.
1992.91-1618,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1631.011,1633.493,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1634.482,1637.244,"Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,1639.905,1646.651,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1747.617,1749.447,"May I ask at that point, Mr. Gilliam?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,1749.447,1750.018,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1750.018,1758.165,"Suppose instead of saying they think we must do it to comply with the statute, they had said we think it would be good policy to create as many as we could."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,1759.455,1761.916,"On those facts alone, no."
1992.91-1618,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1773.633,1780.738,Why wouldn't it violate the Constitution to deliberately use race in this manner?
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,1780.738,1783.292,"Your Honor, I'm not arguing my opponent's case."
1992.91-1618,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.938,1796.639,"Exactly, exactly."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,1797.35,1800.092,And that's the only circumstances under which race can be used.
1992.91-1618,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.092,1809.017,"Well, the way you describe it, there would be no reason in Ohio to discriminate."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,1809.017,1810.537,"I misled you then, sir."
1992.91-1618,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.6,1821.827,"Well, you said that there had been no discrimination against blacks in all... anywhere in Ohio."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,1821.827,1822.506,"--Well, there had been no--"
1992.91-1618,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.506,1829.441,"And if prior discrimination is a predicate to satisfying the Constitution, it wasn't present in Ohio."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,1829.441,1831.952,"--That's correct, exactly."
1992.91-1618,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.515,1882.856,"What... Mr. Gilliam, what if the Apportionment Board had said we want to have a Republican reapportionment, and so we're going to try to cut down Democratic voting strength wherever we can, consistent with the Ohio constitution, and so forth?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,1899.526,1903.269,"The way you've said it, no."
1992.91-1618,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1941.344,1944.158,Under the Voting Rights Act or under the Constitution?
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,1944.158,1956.146,"--They would have to respond under both because, as the Court has observed, strict scrutiny is required because of racial classifications."
1992.91-1618,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1957.356,1968.652,"Well, but the argument on the other side here would be, you know, this is a disparate impact perhaps, but it is not done with intent to discriminate against blacks."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,1968.652,1978.78,"The argument is made, Your Honor, that there's no difference between a partisan gerrymander which has racial effects and a racial gerrymander, and I suggest they are one and the same because--"
1992.91-1618,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1978.78,1982.132,"Well, what do you do with a case like Whitcomb against Chavis then?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,1982.132,1988.047,"--Your Honor, with respect to Whitcomb v. Chavis, intent was not a factor in that case."
1992.91-1618,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1991.018,1991.469,Right.
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2002.076,2014.384,"Well, then we look to the effects under the Voting Rights Act and where you have a racial gerrymander, which is statewide, which packs and fragments black voters with dilutive effects."
1992.91-1618,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2014.384,2020.408,"Well, but you keep hypothesizing a racial gerrymander, intimating that it is with intent."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2024.308,2027.53,"Your Honor, I say it was racial because it's admitted that it was racial."
1992.91-1618,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2027.53,2031.794,"Well, but you're not answering my hypothetical question."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2031.794,2033.334,"Oh, I beg your pardon."
1992.91-1618,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2042.3,2045.752,But it's an important question.
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2064.857,2072.159,"Violation of the Fourteenth, the Fifteenth Amendment, and the Voting Rights Act if dilutive effects are shown."
1992.91-1618,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2072.159,2075.342,But not if dilutive effects are not shown?
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2075.342,2076.885,I think there has--
1992.91-1618,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2076.885,2077.483,So--
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2077.483,2082.449,--I think there have to be effects under both the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.
1992.91-1618,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2082.449,2083.766,"--So, it's just a Gingles... so, it's a Gingles case no matter?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2083.766,2084.308,No.
1992.91-1618,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2172.726,2173.397,"Well, Mr.--"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2178.349,2179.842,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2194.592,2203.076,"Mr. Gilliam, why do the appellants have to prove that the Voting Rights Act required their plan?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2210.88,2211.22,Yes.
1992.91-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2309.846,2316.89,"Are you saying, Mr. Gilliam, that it's perfectly okay so long as it doesn't dilute?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2329.909,2332.29,--No.
1992.91-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2333.782,2335.352,You're making some other claim besides the dilution?
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2335.352,2335.573,Yes.
1992.91-1618,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2377.059,2386.286,Let's assume that you had a very different political complexion in Ohio and the... at the time it was clear that they had to reapportion.
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2410.612,2412.074,No.
1992.91-1618,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2412.074,2413.544,Why not?
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2416.195,2417.857,I understand that.
1992.91-1618,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2437.53,2448.766,"But doesn't your answer to me also imply that you have got to... that you would have the burden to prove in the first instance that there was, in fact, a dilutive effect?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2452.229,2458.413,"Your question suggests that in those circumstances, I would have the burden of proof."
1992.91-1618,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2511.358,2523.956,"Well, would the facts in this case be different if your opponents had not taken the position that they had drawn the lines, as they did, for purposes of avoiding a section 2 violation?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2534.322,2542.717,"Your Honor, given the widespread implications of what they did, it would have been obvious what they did."
1992.91-1618,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2542.717,2546.31,"Well, that is simply to say that you might have had an easy job under your theory."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2546.31,2547.953,"I might have had an easier job, yes, but the answer to your question--"
1992.91-1618,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2547.953,2549.813,But you... would you still have had the burden in the first instance?
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2549.813,2551.383,"--Yes, I would in that... in your example, yes."
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2551.383,2552.405,Okay.
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2567.374,2568.356,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2570.607,2580.114,Would it violate if you had a racially homogeneous State and you're deliberately packing districts for the purpose of getting as many majority Republican districts as you could?
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2580.114,2585.137,"The racially homogeneous State is a much more difficult question, and I--"
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2585.137,2586.726,"Well, it certainly wouldn't... it couldn't violate section 2."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2586.726,2587.046,--answer... I would probably answer it no.
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2596.773,2597.735,"No, but you could pack Democrats."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2597.735,2599.215,You could pack Democrats.
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.658,2608.861,But here you would say it's the same violation... maybe I'm asking the same question the Chief Justice did.
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2614.855,2615.236,Yes.
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2615.236,2616.205,--that would violate section 2.
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2616.205,2618.028,That would violate section 2.
1992.91-1618,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2618.028,2621.31,On the grounds that it diluted the black vote?
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2621.31,2624.142,On the grounds that it diluted the black vote.
1992.91-1618,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2624.142,2625.972,Why do you have to say dilution?
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2634.818,2636.341,"It is, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2636.341,2639.172,"Well, why do you have to talk about vote dilution then?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2639.172,2642.876,"Well, let me put it this way."
1992.91-1618,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2670.142,2678.796,"Does... can your complaint be construed... did you allege, as one of the theories of your complaint, that influence of blacks was diminished in some districts?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2678.796,2679.708,"Yes, and that's an effect."
1992.91-1618,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2679.708,2681.598,"And this would be different than dilution, wouldn't it?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2681.598,2682.63,"Well, it is different."
1992.91-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2709.588,2728.789,"Mr. Gilliam, in the response that you gave to, I guess it was, Justice Stevens' question where you... your object is to pack Democrats, but an easy way to do it is that since you believe that the... that blacks are largely voting Democratic, you've packed blacks as a means of packing Democrats, you said that would be bad."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2728.789,2729.54,--Yes.
1992.91-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.54,2737.455,That would only be bad I think you would say if you can establish block voting.
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2740.148,2741.237,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.237,2744.23,"Well, how would it be violating... how would there be any dilution?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2745.692,2751.406,"Well, because a racial gerrymander may be a new dilution."
1992.91-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2778.253,2781.723,"Right, right, so long as they don't vote as a block."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2781.723,2782.654,"Well, no, no."
1992.91-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2782.654,2784.066,That's wrong.
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2784.066,2787.617,Voting as a block is different from polarized voting.
1992.91-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2883.461,2886.413,Even if it does not produce any dilution.
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2891.095,2892.957,--If it does not produce dilution--
1992.91-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2892.957,2894.888,It still violates section 2.
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2894.888,2901.313,"--then you've got... then I have to fall back on my argument which I made to you earlier, which is that there's a misuse of the Voting Rights Act."
1992.91-1618,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2919.265,2928.963,What is the forbidden effect that you're trying to prove... that you have to prove?
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2930.535,2931.774,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2931.774,2934.296,--to tell us when there's a section 2 Voting Rights--
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2934.296,2935.618,The forbidden effect--
1992.91-1618,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2935.618,2935.928,--violation?
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2935.928,2940.248,--of a gerrymander is multiple.
1992.91-1618,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2971.24,2974.934,May I ask you just one question?
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,2987.77,2996.756,"But your... the answer would be no, if I understand you correct... your answer correctly."
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2996.756,3001.301,"But if that's your answer, then really you should focus on the other districts to see if they're diluted--"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,3001.301,3001.959,"That's the issue, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3001.959,3005.172,"--because the packing itself is not enough, as I understand your theory."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,3005.172,3007.585,"Well, I think packing is dilutive."
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3007.585,3010.785,"Well, it's evidence of dilution in other districts."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,3010.785,3015.36,"It's evidence of dilution, and it is dilution under my theory, Your Honor, if I may."
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3015.36,3017.491,"Well, then you seem to be giving a different answer than you gave to Justice Souter."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,3017.491,3019.423,"Well, in that case, I'm mistaken."
1992.91-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3023.374,3025.744,"But dilution of what, Mr. Gilliam?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,3032.189,3032.93,It is dilution--
1992.91-1618,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3032.93,3034.78,--or Republicans for that matter.
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,3034.78,3038.644,--It's dilution of the black vote that we are talking about.
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3061.218,3073.306,"But that's the only harm because if you go from 85 to 95 in district 1, and you go from 15 to 10 in district 2, and 15 to 10 in district 3, your harm is strictly in districts 2 and 3, isn't it?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,3073.306,3082.142,"Well, the harm is felt throughout the State because the number of legislators who have to respond to black interests is diluted."
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3096.792,3101.426,Because there's 40 percent Democrats instead of 30... 40 white Democrats instead of 35 percent.
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,3125.9,3136.989,"Well, unless I misunderstand your question, Gingles itself says in footnote 11, page 46, that racial gerrymanders are bad."
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3176.674,3179.786,May I ask you what you mean by the term racial gerrymander?
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,3179.786,3182.788,"All right, sir, yes."
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3191.383,3193.186,I'm asking you what you mean by gerrymander.
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,3193.186,3194.305,"--Yes, I think."
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3201.351,3207.374,And is every redistricting that's motivated in part by partisan purposes a partisan gerrymander?
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,3207.374,3208.814,--No.
1992.91-1618,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3208.814,3211.648,"Well, when is it and when it is not?"
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,3211.648,3226.788,"When you use race for partisan purposes, you are engaging in an invidious use of race because a racial gerrymander and a partisan gerrymander using race, as I have said, is one and the same thing."
1992.91-1618,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3231.15,3247.77,"It's not the same thing under Whitcomb against Chavis, Mr. Gilliam, if there was no intent... if the intent is only to discriminate against Democrats so far as the Constitution is concerned, unless you're just talking about the Voting Rights Act."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,3247.77,3253.146,"I am talking about the Voting Rights Act, and I am also talking about the Constitution, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3258.499,3275.299,"So that just disparate treatment of Democrats and Republicans, even though it also involved black Democrats, as well as white Democrats, would not automatically rule something out under the Constitution at any rate."
1992.91-1618,2,16055,armistead_w_gilliam_jr,,3275.299,3278.802,"That would be my understanding of the law, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3394.696,3397.38,"Thank you, Mr. Gilliam."

1992.91-1618,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3592.498,3593.138,Mr. Goodman--
1992.91-1618,3,37127,n_victor_goodman,,3593.138,3593.749,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-1618,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3593.749,3602.405,--do you acknowledge that the reason race was used in particular was in order to assure compliance with the Voting Rights Act?
1992.91-1618,3,37127,n_victor_goodman,,3602.405,3603.336,Yes.
1992.91-1618,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3603.336,3604.355,All right.
1992.91-1618,3,37127,n_victor_goodman,,3604.355,3605.447,That is correct.
1992.91-1618,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3607.159,3608.21,"Thank you, Mr. Goodman."
