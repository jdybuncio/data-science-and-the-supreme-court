1957.276,1,25167,george_cochran_doub,,1954.381,1962.498,Our position is that the language is in the statute by using the words “United States”.
1957.276,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1981.277,1983.626,You mean -- I don't follow that.
1957.276,1,25167,george_cochran_doub,,1998.172,1998.457,Yes.
1957.276,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2001.136,2006.696,"Well, then it doesn't add enough because it doesn't take corporation."
1957.276,1,25167,george_cochran_doub,,2006.696,2014.674,"Before discussing the 1918 Amendment, I would like to emphasize just a few things."
1957.276,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2317.926,2329.278,"Mr. Doub, what's -- what's the relation of this Corporation to the Department of Agriculture, is it the fact that the constituent of the department --"
1957.276,1,25167,george_cochran_doub,,2329.278,2337.169,"Well, it has no -- officers or employees independent of those of the Department of Agriculture."

1957.276,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2359.898,2362.972,Who were the policy makers for the corporation?
1957.276,1,25167,george_cochran_doub,,2362.972,2369.537,The policy maker -- makers -- maker rather is the Secretary of Agriculture.
1957.276,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2390.878,2401.385,Who actually -- who actually authorizes the loans or the advances?
1957.276,1,25167,george_cochran_doub,,2401.385,2416.212,"Well, I would say that first, you have the Secretary making an announcement of the price of which he is going to boycott for example."

1957.276,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2441.752,2447.188,He -- of course Congress sets the policy and he implements the policy.
1957.276,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2447.188,2464.999,"Yes, but -- well, are you suggesting that the word “department” would include all its constituent units and that this is sufficiently a constituent of the Department of Agriculture that comes within the 1878 description of a department?"
1957.276,1,25167,george_cochran_doub,,2464.999,2475.408,"Well, as I said yesterday, our first contention would be, a much broader one that the False Claims Act should be applied to all wholly owned Government corporations (Voice Overlap)."

1957.276,2,34202,leon_b_catlett,,3418.118,3419.087,"Thank you, Your Honor."
