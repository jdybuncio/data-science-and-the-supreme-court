1982.82-256,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.215,We'll hear arguments next in Michigan against Long.
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,51.525,54.367,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,339.001,340.626,Mr. Caruso--
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,340.626,341.172,Yes.
1982.82-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,341.172,356.836,--Do you think that the officers could have arrested the Defendant in this case for speeding or for driving while intoxicated or perhaps even for carrying the weapon which they found?
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,356.836,361.976,I believe that at that time a violation of Michigan Vehicle Code for speeding--
1982.82-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,361.976,363.134,Before all this search occurred?
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,363.134,363.618,--Yes.
1982.82-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,371.943,376.549,"But, it is your position or you would concede that that did not occur?"
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,376.549,377.766,That did not occur.
1982.82-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,383.778,385.295,How about driving while intoxicated?
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,387.669,395.118,"--Well, they would have to go through a process to make a determination as to whether the party is intoxicated and then go from that point."
1982.82-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,566.801,574.374,"Mr. Caruso, would you address the question of whether there is an adequate and independent state ground in this case?"
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,585.606,604.626,"The Supreme Court in its decision that reversed the Court of Appeals made a reference to Article 1, Section 11 of the Michigan Constitution, but did not discuss it at any time in the opinion."
1982.82-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,613.124,614.983,"Well, they cited the Michigan Constitution."
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,614.983,615.654,They did cite the Michigan--
1982.82-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,615.654,628.808,"And the cases and statutes in Michigan and the Michigan Constitution, in fact, require a higher standard in this circumstance than would be required by the Federal Constitution?"
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,628.808,659.981,"--In People v. Moore, a Michigan case, it was held that the particular clause in the Michigan Constitution which permits the introduction into evidence of evidence found that is not subject to the strict requirement of reasonable search and seizure is inconsistent with the 4th Amendment of the United States Constitution and, therefore, it doesn't obtain and it doesn't endure."
1982.82-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,674.568,676.615,"Well, I am not sure I understand your answer."
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,686.204,686.579,"Yes, yes, it would."
1982.82-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,687.577,694.436,"And, it would allow in your opinion clearly a Terry type search of the--"
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,694.436,696.37,"Yes, it would allow a Terry type search."
1982.82-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,696.37,696.889,--auto interior?
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,696.889,697.342,"Yes, it would."
1982.82-256,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,697.342,698.73,And you base that on what?
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,698.73,712.241,I base that on the proposition that the Michigan case law with reference to the reasonableness of a search really relates to the 4th Amendment of the Constitution.
1982.82-256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,722.344,734.044,"May I ask you if you are familiar with the case of People against Secrest, a 1982 Michigan case which relied only on the Michigan Constitution?"
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,734.044,736.777,"I am not that familiar with it, no, Mr. Justice."
1982.82-256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,736.777,746.647,"Do you have an explanation of why in this Court, in this particular case, the Michigan Court specifically said it relied on the Michigan Constitution if it didn't mean that?"
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,746.647,750.586,I think it was just simply... just added to it as just an afterthought.
1982.82-256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,751.959,757.409,"Well, didn't Justice Coleman in her dissent also say there was no violation of Michigan Constitution in her view?"
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,760.501,776.81,"Well, she did find that there is not necessarily any violation of the Michigan Constitution, but just a statement in that sense and then the majority opinion that reversed the Court of Appeals did not really discuss the Michigan Constitution."
1982.82-256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.32,789.023,"But, of course, it did squarely say we find the violation of the Michigan Constitution."
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,789.023,789.71,"Yes, Mr. Justice, it did."
1982.82-256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,789.71,797.301,"And, is it not true that the text of the Michigan Constitution provision is rather different from the text of the 4th Amendment?"
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,797.301,803.486,"There is a clause added to that that is totally different than the 4th Amendment, yes, Mr. Justice, that is correct."
1982.82-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,803.486,810.825,"Mr. Solicitor General, you several times say the Terry type search of the automobile."
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,814.338,817.665,"No, there wasn't and this is what we are asking the Court to--"
1982.82-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,817.665,820.024,"Well, why do you keep saying Terry type search of an automobile?"
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,820.024,826.77,--I say to frisk or search the automobile based upon the Terry rationale.
1982.82-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,841.358,843.573,"Well, they put him up against the side of the car."
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,843.573,845.012,--Pardon?
1982.82-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,845.012,849.15,They put the man up against the side of the car and patted him down.
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,849.15,849.605,Yes.
1982.82-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,849.605,850.916,That is a Terry search.
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,850.916,852.086,That is a Terry search.
1982.82-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,852.086,853.759,Then you went further.
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,857.99,860.646,"Well, we are asking that the Terry rationale--"
1982.82-256,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,860.646,861.397,Be extended.
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,861.397,877.047,--be extended to go into the passenger compartment of an automobile because on the totality of the facts in this case we feel that the police officers were justified in continuing the search into the passenger compartment of the automobile.
1982.82-256,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,877.047,882.826,What about Belton and Robbins and the cases that came after this case was decided?
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,882.826,890.383,"Well, in those cases I don't recall that that really involved a protective search for the benefit of police officers."
1982.82-256,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,890.383,893.179,It sure did.
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,895.71,897.227,"Oh, the examination of the trunk."
1982.82-256,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,897.227,900.241,"Once this car was stopped, he was ultimately arrested, was he not?"
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,900.241,900.662,Yes.
1982.82-256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.728,1244.053,"May I ask you, Mr. Solicitor General, one other question about our jurisdiction?"
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1264.155,1288.612,"Yes, I do believe that you have jurisdiction under this... in this case simply because the Court did apply down below, and the Court did apply in the Court of Appeals the 4th Amendment and the case law, the U.S. case law, pursuant under the 4th Amendment with reference thereto; to wit, specifically the Terry case."
1982.82-256,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1288.612,1292.562,You say that is true even if Michigan imposes a tougher standard than the Federal--
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1292.562,1295.249,"Even if Michigan imposes a tougher standard, yes."
1982.82-256,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1295.249,1335.656,"--Well, suppose the Court had started out and said we are going... we are interested in deciding whether there was an illegal search under the Michigan Constitution and then said it might help us to decided that by talking about the federal law and they went through exactly the same discussion of the federal law and then said, as they said, we therefore conclude that the search violated the 4th Amendment and the Michigan Constitution?"
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1335.656,1342.387,"Well, under the decision... I believe it is Delaware v. Prouse."
1982.82-256,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1354.459,1374.031,"Yes, but suppose it is clear that the state, as Justice Stevens suggests, doesn't necessarily follow... in applying its own constitution doesn't necessary follow or feel compelled by the federal rulings, have their own view of their own constitution?"
1982.82-256,0,34272,louis_j_caruso,,1376.812,1381.62,"I don't believe it was the case here, Your Honor, Mr. Justice."
1982.82-256,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1414.138,1429.257,Mr. Strauss is going to have the lectern next.
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1432.505,1435.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.82-256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1491.403,1495.447,"Well, the Belton... That Belton rule doesn't accrue until there has been an arrest."
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1495.447,1496.445,That is right.
1982.82-256,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1506.614,1516.421,"But, if this gentleman had tried to walk away shortly after the police got there but before there was anything said about an arrest, what would have happened to him in your view?"
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1516.421,1520.45,"The officer testified, I believe, that he would not have allowed him to walk away."
1982.82-256,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1520.45,1525.652,"So that under what we have said many times, if he can't walk away, he is under arrest."
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1525.652,1527.591,"Well, he is not necessarily under arrest."
1982.82-256,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1556.388,1569.807,"The search of the trunk came some significant time after the bag of marijuana was discovered on the front seat, is that not so?"
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1569.807,1570.525,That is right.
1982.82-256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1580.082,1583.444,I thought Belton was passenger compartment.
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1583.444,1587.752,"It was Justice Rehnquist, but in this case we have an unlocked trunk."
1982.82-256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1587.752,1589.596,So you say that can be treated like the passenger--
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1589.596,1593.0,At least as accessible to the suspect as the passenger compartment.
1982.82-256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.0,1599.419,--Assume they discovered the marijuana in the passenger compartment and they arrest.
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1602.917,1606.684,I think that certainly would give probable cause to search the--
1982.82-256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1606.684,1609.367,Under... Not necessarily under Belton.
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1612.21,1614.444,--If under Ross would give probable cause to search the entire car.
1982.82-256,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.74,1620.317,Yes.
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1620.317,1629.141,"But, the initial discovery of the marijuana was the result of what one might call a car frisk, a search for weapons only in the car."
1982.82-256,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1629.141,1630.908,But after that it was no frisk?
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1630.908,1633.142,Once the found the marijuana that is right.
1982.82-256,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1634.218,1634.967,They could have handcuffed him?
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1634.967,1635.747,That is right.
1982.82-256,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1635.747,1637.56,And he could have hurt whom then?
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1638.138,1640.044,"In fact, they did at some point and--"
1982.82-256,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1640.044,1648.042,They could have done it before they searched the trunk and they wouldn't have had to search the trunk to find whether there were weapons in it.
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1648.042,1648.556,--That is right.
1982.82-256,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1663.052,1669.641,"The difference in the Belton case as I remember is there was one officer and four men, three men or something."
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1671.404,1674.375,"I believe those are the facts of Belton, Justice Marshall."
1982.82-256,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1674.375,1677.371,"I mean, I think that two officers ought to be able to take care of one man."
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1677.371,1690.476,"Well, that is precisely the sort of thing, Justice Marshall, as the Court in Belton refused to inquire into and I think that is exactly the sort of thing, that it is very dangerous for a court to try to assess after the fact, to go back and to say, well--"
1982.82-256,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1690.476,1691.771,Just leave it up to the officers.
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1691.771,1713.655,"--Well, when the officers were acting with a reasonable apprehension of danger, as no one seems to deny that they had here, and take the step precisely analogous to what the Court said they could take in Belton in a situation that is, as I said, even more dangerous than the Belton situation because the suspect is not arrested, he is not in handcuffs, he is not held at gun point or locked into the back of the car."
1982.82-256,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1713.655,1715.811,"But he was told, whoa, and he stopped."
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1715.811,1718.775,He was told to stop and his hands were placed on the roof of the car.
1982.82-256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1734.475,1764.134,"Mr. Strauss, if the Court were to adopt this wingspan approach to a Terry search, does the expanded search of the interior of the car of necessity involve a more extensive search than would be the case for a pat down of an individual where we have said you just pat them down and see if there are weapons?"
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1783.063,1785.423,"It is an analogous search, Justice O'Connor."
1982.82-256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1785.423,1791.59,Would you concede that it would of necessity be more extensive than the pat down that we approved in Terry?
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1791.59,1798.387,It would be a search for weapons and it couldn't reach places where a weapon could not be concealed or from which it could not be obtained.
1982.82-256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1802.712,1803.289,Yes.
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1824.265,1838.12,"If in the course of the pat down an officer were to find an unidentifiable, unidentifiable by touch, hard object beneath the outer clothing of the suspect, yes, he certainly could reach in and pull it out and take a look at it which is all that--"
1982.82-256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1838.12,1841.945,"But, not a marijuana cigarette or a little baggie or something of that sort, right?"
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1841.945,1845.1,"--If it were something that didn't feel like a weapon from the outside, that is right."
1982.82-256,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1873.964,1881.038,"Well, it may be less intrusive in a personal sense, but you may be able to get more objects and make a more thorough search."
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,1884.321,1887.787,"I think the principle, the leading principle is exactly the same, Justice O'Connor."
1982.82-256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1996.198,2006.27,Do you think that Belton applies where the search is not a custodial arrest or where the arrest is not a custodial arrest?
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2006.27,2007.783,I am not sure there is--
1982.82-256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2007.783,2017.174,"If the search incident in Robinson and Gustoferson applies only to custodial arrests, do you think Belton nonetheless applies across the board?"
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2017.174,2021.514,--I am not sure I understand the difference between custodial arrests and other sorts of arrests.
1982.82-256,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2021.514,2030.027,"Well, I think a custodial arrest is where the police plan to take the person arrested into custody as opposed to simply give him a ticket."
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2030.027,2041.225,"If they don't plan to take him and remove him from the scene subsequent to the arrest, I think there is some question from the face of the Belton opinion whether Belton applies to such."
1982.82-256,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2053.517,2063.293,"There is the crucial question whether they do, in fact, intend to take him into custody or whether they are lawfully authorized to do it, whether they do or do not take him into custody."
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2063.293,2079.554,"Well, for purposes of what happened in this case, even if there were certainly no probable cause and no grounds to take him into custody and only reasonable suspicion to stop him, they would be authorized in taking these limited measures necessary to protect their safety."
1982.82-256,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2079.554,2085.13,Isn't it true that custody is always taken when you arrest a person?
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2086.986,2089.532,"Well, that is why I asked Justice Rehnquist the question."
1982.82-256,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.719,2096.576,"If it is an arrest by hypothesis he is in custody, isn't that right?"
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2096.576,2098.934,"It is a matter of definition, Justice Stevens."
1982.82-256,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2098.934,2108.839,"Then he may be released on sort of a ""parole"" to drive his own car home if he is not drunk or if he is not injured."
1982.82-256,1,21501,david_a_strauss,,2119.395,2124.191,Certainly it would be an odd result if the officers have probable cause to arrest him.
1982.82-256,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2141.623,2151.524,"Counsel, you may proceed."
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2151.524,2153.774,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2216.446,2235.736,"But, if that is true, as I don't doubt it is if you say it is, how does that apply to this particular case where the Supreme Court of Michigan simply mentions the State Constitution in part of a sentence and all of its analysis is in terms of the Federal Constitution?"
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2235.736,2238.735,They only mention the Federal Constitution in part of a sentence.
1982.82-256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2241.028,2244.358,But all the cases are federal cases.
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2244.358,2246.905,The case was Terry v. Ohio.
1982.82-256,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2270.395,2272.844,Can you give us any reason why they didn't say just that?
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2272.844,2275.031,I don't think they felt it was necessary.
1982.82-256,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2276.186,2277.438,"Well, didn't we ask them?"
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2277.438,2278.779,--I beg your pardon?
1982.82-256,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2278.779,2280.156,Didn't we ask them the question?
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2280.156,2282.453,"No, this Court has never asked the Michigan Supreme Court--"
1982.82-256,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2282.453,2285.56,I think it comes up every other week.
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2286.605,2288.856,--That is true.
1982.82-256,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2291.527,2303.019,"Don't they know the only thing they have to do is to say this is being decided on the Constitution of the State of Michigan, period."
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2303.019,2304.208,--They didn't say that.
1982.82-256,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2305.035,2307.114,"I know, but couldn't they have said it?"
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2307.114,2308.237,"--Yes, they could have."
1982.82-256,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2308.237,2310.002,"And that would have been the end of the case, wouldn't it?"
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2310.002,2311.737,I believe it would have been.
1982.82-256,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2311.737,2316.156,"Well, how do we persuade them to say whether they do one or the other?"
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2316.156,2317.86,Tell them.
1982.82-256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2317.86,2318.843,I see.
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2321.404,2331.633,"I wish they had decided it solely on Michigan constitutional grounds, but evidently the Court felt that the search was barred... as I feel the search was barred under both the federal and state grounds."
1982.82-256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2331.633,2351.781,"But, if, as Justice Marshall has suggested, if the State Constitution affords an adequate ground, why isn't that the end of the case or is the Court trying to share the burden with the Federal Constitution?"
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2351.781,2356.153,"I can't read the minds of the Justices of the Michigan Supreme Court, of course."
1982.82-256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2362.934,2364.369,"Well, we have reversed them often enough."
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2365.341,2368.168,--There have been many cases where you haven't reversed them.
1982.82-256,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.46,2387.252,I suppose those reversals just confirm your view that Michigan takes a broader view of the protections provided by the 4th Amendment and its Constitution.
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2387.252,2388.142,I believe that it does.
1982.82-256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2568.586,2580.363,Do you feel that articulable suspicion cases turn on the subjective impressions of the particular officers involved rather than kind of an objective standard?
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2580.363,2584.969,I think it is a difficult mix of objective standards and subjective factors.
1982.82-256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2597.042,2599.837,Do you think our cases support you in that?
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2607.866,2612.913,Terry discusses the officer's well-founded belief of fear for his own safety and that is why I say I think it is a difficult mix.
1982.82-256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2619.487,2621.296,"Yes, I think that is probably it."
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2627.466,2636.04,"Even if that is a given, I think that the objective facts that were here... There was very little that distinguished this case from most traffic stops in Michigan."
1982.82-256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2636.04,2638.618,"Well, how about the knife on the floorboard?"
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2640.759,2641.258,No.
1982.82-256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2681.274,2685.271,"Well, is that all bad when you are talking about a search for weapons?"
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2685.271,2697.251,I personally don't believe this was a search for weapons as evidenced by the fact the officers never treated the Defendant as a dangerous person and ignored very obvious tools that could have been used to hurt themselves and instead concentrated on a billfold.
1982.82-256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2697.251,2702.407,"But that isn't the ground that the Supreme Court of Michigan went on, that it really wasn't a search for weapons?"
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2702.407,2703.421,"No, they did not say that."
1982.82-256,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2728.034,2731.52,"Well, the question is whether the 4th Amendment prohibits this."
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2731.52,2732.768,--Exactly so.
1982.82-256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2768.066,2772.784,What did they do with the knife?
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2772.784,2774.001,I wish I knew.
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2801.379,2807.252,"Well, does the record show where he was going when he turned around and walked away?"
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2807.252,2807.724,Not very clearly.
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2809.565,2814.423,But they had asked him for his registration statement which he didn't have.
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2818.203,2820.094,He didn't say anything.
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2821.591,2834.65,Do the officers say that they anticipated that he was going to go back into the car to hunt for the registration statement to see if he had one?
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2834.65,2842.582,"My recollection of their testimony is that they made no assumption as to what he was doing, just described his acts rather than... They didn't say what they thought he was about to do."
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2842.582,2850.782,I understood from your colleague that the testimony of the officer was that they thought he was going back to the car to find the registration statement.
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2850.782,2861.233,"Well, I can't complain... They had just asked him for the registration statement and that is the only logical explanation, but I can't recall anything in the record where the deputies specifically testified that they thought that was what Mr. Long was doing."
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2862.185,2868.323,Sometimes people keep them in the glove compartment.
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2868.323,2871.602,"--As a matter of fact, they never did get the registration papers for this particular car."
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.073,2920.708,What do they call it in Michigan when you stop a fellow for speeding and insist that he stay there until he gets a ticket?
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2924.564,2925.376,A traffic stop.
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2925.376,2928.422,"It is a traffic stop, a detention for the purpose of giving a ticket."
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2928.422,2931.721,I think it would be pretty clear that he is not arrested as Michigan courts use that word.
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2946.181,2947.292,Or his car.
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2947.292,2948.166,Or his car.
1982.82-256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2954.381,2957.021,Even after they found marijuana in the car?
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2957.021,2958.349,--I think that is correct.
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2970.563,2973.25,"I know they didn't, but let's assume we disagree with you."
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2973.25,2975.169,--They would have lost as a matter of state law had they made that--
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2975.169,2999.583,"Well, let's assume that we disagree with you and that the... looking under the armrest was defensible and was not unreasonable and that finding the initial bag of marijuana was defensible and suppose he had been arrested right then, could they have searched the car?"
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,2999.583,3002.703,--We would lose under U. S. v. Ross and New York v. Belton.
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3002.703,3003.674,And you would lose under federal law.
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,3003.674,3007.998,And I think we would win under People v. Hilber which is Michigan law which was exactly that case.
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3014.577,3015.591,Without a warrant.
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,3015.591,3016.683,Without a warrant.
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3018.387,3023.23,Does Michigan follow Carroll at all if you have probable cause to search a car?
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,3023.23,3028.522,"There are some Michigan Court of Appeals cases, including some recent ones, that say that they follow Carroll."
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.522,3031.255,What does the Supreme Court of Michigan say?
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,3031.255,3035.002,I can't recall the People v. Hilber case well enough to know if they even discussed it at all.
1982.82-256,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3035.002,3045.859,"Well, it seems to me if you make that arrest we have just described and then say that you can't search the trunk of the car you must not follow Carroll."
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,3045.859,3047.578,I don't believe that Michigan does.
1982.82-256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3075.409,3077.457,I am not sure I know what you mean when they produced on inventory.
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,3077.457,3080.58,--There was no list of the things that was found in the car.
1982.82-256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3091.748,3096.713,You mean they didn't write out a description of items when you say they had no inventory?
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,3096.713,3097.216,--Yes.
1982.82-256,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3119.438,3129.355,"May I ask you... You may be repeating, but you said that as a matter of Michigan law the search of the trunk would have been improper under the Hilber case."
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,3129.355,3130.701,"I believe that it would have, yes."
1982.82-256,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.701,3140.305,Is that because the presence of marijuana in the car does not establish probable cause to believe there is marijuana in the trunk or assuming there is probable cause you still can't open the trunk?
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,3140.305,3148.817,"I think that... My recollection of Hilber is the former, proving there is marijuana in the passenger compartment is not probably cause to believe that there is marijuana in the trunk."
1982.82-256,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3148.817,3149.394,I see.
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,3154.424,3155.626,I wish I had read it just before I came today.
1982.82-256,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3156.566,3157.346,Okay.
1982.82-256,2,30433,james_h_geary,,3157.346,3162.095,I have nothing further unless there are further questions.
1982.82-256,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3162.095,3162.688,Very well.
