1966.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,24.542,"Number 54, Immigration and Naturalization Service, petitioner, Giuseppe Errico."
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,25.777,29.968,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,196.429,200.427,"Mr. Solicitor, has all of these been changed by each provisions or something?"
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,200.427,214.807,"The recent provision of course changes the whole quota system that's gone and as of now he could qualify to come in but there's still would be I think it's 20,000 for Italy."
1966.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,221.906,226.754,"Well, I was just wondering how big a problem is this in number any idea?"
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,226.754,241.796,"Well, the number, it's pretty hard, the best example, I don't know how we do it these figures there, there are some 3 million resident aliens in the country as of now."
1966.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,298.81,303.188,Could he (Inaudible) re-enter under the (Inaudible) Act?
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,303.188,305.619,He could.
1966.54,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,343.951,349.42,Why should that not that have been determined without coming all the way up here in this Court?
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,349.42,352.099,He never applied for it.
1966.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,423.096,426.287,"Now, let's see he is the parent of the United States citizen."
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,426.287,426.977,Yes.
1966.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,426.977,428.987,That's the child born to the marriage.
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,430.767,438.171,"Came here with him and his child was born 10 months after their arrival, clearly an American citizen."
1966.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,438.171,442.277,"If he is otherwise admissible then he comes within 241 (f), is that it?"
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,442.277,446.06,"If he's otherwise admissible no question about that, he comes on --"
1966.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,446.06,451.643,And he has also had a son of at least to the aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residents.
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,451.643,455.517,"Yes, both the mother and father are lawfully --"
1966.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,455.517,457.995,So he'd come under that way too even if there were no child.
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,457.995,461.161,But the -- oh you mean as to his existence?
1966.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,462.42,463.595,He'd come out of the statute --
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,463.595,470.382,There's no question that he has the familial ties efficient to qualify under that section.
1966.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,501.795,504.798,"Well, let's seem -- I just want to get this clear."
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,513.361,513.868,No sir.
1966.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,516.207,518.057,Because it was oversubscribe.
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,518.057,518.663,It was oversubscribe --
1966.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,518.663,522.49,"Now, what is -- what is -- why does he say he was otherwise admissible?"
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,522.49,530.27,He says because otherwise admissible providing you deliberately misstate a fact.
1966.54,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,548.296,549.24,I see.
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,549.24,552.279,And we say that Congress couldn't possible have meant that.
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,552.279,571.096,But General on the other hand can you suggest a type of misrepresentation or fraudulent statement that would be material and that would not affect his admissibility as in the time of entry.
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,578.072,586.633,We have some set out in our brief in page 34 and 36 in our brief.
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,611.765,645.908,"Alright, I read that but it seems to me that these categories would or might very well affect his admissibility as of the time of entry and in circumstances are very much like this case or the next case the Scott case that were treating up next when he says pass activities well, suppose there's a misrepresentation about his communist party affiliation in the past."
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,650.564,653.527,It certainly would but we try to explain it.
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,664.047,664.891,"Well, --"
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,664.891,670.282,It could be -- I'm not sure but these are possibilities we -- we're not certain of them --
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,670.282,678.621,"Well, I know but here this fellow said that he is a good mechanic on foreign cars, that's what he said."
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,678.621,679.764,That's right.
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,679.764,689.165,And I suppose there's been a finding that makes it clear that he wasn't a mechanic -- automobile mechanic or something like that.
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,689.165,692.122,"As I read the record, it wasn't contested."
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,692.122,693.187,Alright.
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,702.594,704.587,"Well, I assume."
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,704.587,717.891,So the agency started out as the (Inaudible) on foreign cars but why is that different from some -- any of these other situations?
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,717.891,724.055,"It's because but for this misrepresentation, he couldn't have gotten in."
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,724.055,737.836,"Alright, now, suppose a Mexican says that he's got a thousand dollars or whatever to acquire him and he then get but for that misrepresentation, he couldn't get any either."
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,737.836,741.912,"Yes he could have because -- well, let's put it this way."
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,748.607,749.688,"Well, then --"
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,749.688,754.496,"But this man, you couldn't have handed him the knowledge of this cause."
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,754.496,775.15,"Well, you mean to say that if this statute, the statutory provision and should be confined misrepresentations that are not material and not important because they are subsequently corrected."
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,775.15,775.416,No.
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,775.416,777.216,But there was a misrepresentation that would affect his eligibility for entry as of the time he made it.
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,777.216,783.661,"Yes, the line we are trying to draw which is the only line we submit you can draw when you look through."
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,798.908,803.229,"The next case is not a quota case, the Scott case."
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,803.229,806.009,"Oh, yes."
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,817.091,820.797,But she made some misrepresentations about her marital status.
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,820.797,845.829,She said her marital status which gave her the preference under the quota and in this we say that Congress insists on drawing the line on the quota because if the misrepresentation there's no way for him to be otherwise admissible if he is not an automobile mechanic.
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,845.829,850.198,I don't want to take a lot of your time but let me see if I understand this now.
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,882.475,891.571,It says so if the language is but specifically says on misrepresentation and it's limited only by otherwise admissible so I think --
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,891.571,903.681,You say the only limit -- is it the Government's position that the only limitation is the -- is that the person must have been eligible for entry as a numerical manner under the quota.
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,903.681,908.815,I think that that would be our position because we saw clearly that's what this case is.
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,914.386,924.442,So far as I am concerned that's a kind of an importance as to say whether the Government says that that language is limited only by a quota consideration.
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,924.442,936.518,"In all of the other questions, Mr. Justice Fortas, in every one that we were able to think of, the attorney general can waive most of the other provisions where you."
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,936.518,940.336,"I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about what does this statute mean and what does this statute says."
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,940.336,950.238,This statute says on the ground that and otherwise admissible as it only two features that we think of here.
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,950.238,951.053,"Well, I will --"
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,951.053,954.462,It's on page -- the statute is on page 4.
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,954.462,982.125,"Well, I assume there wouldn't be any misunderstanding so far as I am concerned, I would assume a lesson until otherwise advised by you that the Government's position is that you don't -- there are no other, in no other situations where you go to the basic circumstances at the time of entry except as to a matter of quota."
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,982.125,986.396,"I -- Mr. Justice Fortas, I can't comment the Government that far."
1966.54,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1004.178,1016.648,"Well, that would seem to me that would describe the statute that it's the only kind of a misrepresentation that a person is likely to make as one that relates to in the terms of admissibility."
1966.54,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1016.648,1024.617,Not at all Mr. Justice Fortas and one that brought these statutes about was whether people lied about the country they came from.
1966.54,1,24134,frank_m_ierulli,,1578.498,1586.393,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Associate justices and may it please the Court."
1966.54,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2367.246,2369.226,How old was he you say when he came?
1966.54,1,24134,frank_m_ierulli,,2369.226,2376.589,He was 32 when he entered but he was over 21 when his folks came so he stayed behind.
1966.54,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3121.445,3124.613,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.54,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3128.085,3131.978,We're not going to use qualitative.
1966.54,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3131.978,3140.53,"Well, quantitatively we have covered those points and started on page 26 of our brief."
1966.54,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3144.778,3160.318,"But doesn't this come down to this Mr. Solicitor General, your argument as I understand on the other side is, if you lie about something as having a characteristic which is something we desire and you in fact don't have it, the statute excuses it."
1966.54,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3160.318,3161.224,That's right.
1966.54,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3161.224,3169.566,But if you lie about something which is as to the characteristic which we don't want you to have then the statute doesn't excuse it.
1966.54,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3173.556,3176.156,We say that that cannot stand in the whole theory of immigration.
1966.54,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3176.156,3179.86,I know but you say -- is that what the other side says?
1966.54,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3179.86,3181.082,That's how I understand it.
1966.54,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3181.082,3183.85,"Well, that's not the qualitative or quantitative role."
1966.54,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3183.85,3188.356,But if you don't agree with but you don't think would excuse lying about these other things?
1966.54,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3188.356,3189.033,Some of it.
1966.54,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.704,3195.401,Right.
1966.54,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3195.401,3200.556,And I used -- I have about three more minutes if I --
1966.54,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3200.556,3201.788,You might well finish this case.
1966.54,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3201.788,3224.2,I was just pointing out the very touching and I agree with the situation of this family in the Errico case and it's a type of case that should get discretionary relief but the language of the Ninth Circuit is not limited to a family of that size.
1966.54,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3253.947,3258.629,Naturalization Service.
1966.54,3,29188,julius_c_biervliet,,3260.508,3265.526,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1966.54,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3567.614,3581.615,Do you say -- I gather does that mean or not and that persons presented are those characteristics are disqualified from entry or excludable from entry or whatever?
1966.54,3,29188,julius_c_biervliet,,3581.615,3584.522,They may be disqualified or excludable.
1966.54,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3584.522,3586.54,"And if they allow, whichever?"
1966.54,3,29188,julius_c_biervliet,,3594.424,3595.586,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1966.54,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3596.21,3605.61,Whereas you are talking about -- what we're talking about the former who are characteristics that Congress thought so desirable that we wanted people like that to come into the United States.
1966.54,3,29188,julius_c_biervliet,,3605.61,3606.476,Exactly.
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4697.287,4701.257,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4789.033,4790.068,Which brief?
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4790.068,4794.448,Of our brief in the Scott case the brief on the merits.
1966.54,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4973.526,4989.308,"As I understand their adversaries in these two cases, they say that it's used in these other places, so as not to include the quota and the corner case of restrictions, --"
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4989.308,4994.664,I don't know a single statute where it deliberately eliminates the quota system.
1966.54,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5010.902,5014.262,You mean in connection with the use of the phrase otherwise admissible.
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5014.262,5015.613,"No, sir in the general discussion."
1966.54,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5015.613,5016.607,Oh that's what I am talking about.
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5016.607,5017.076,In the general discussion.
1966.54,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5017.076,5028.557,"As I understand your adversaries, they are saying that wherever this phrase has been used, otherwise admissible, it refers to these qualifications other than quota."
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5028.557,5040.498,"And then the Act also, the real section relied on the act restricts the quota deliberately and I think you have to take the two together."
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5040.498,5046.956,Mr. Solicitor General how long -- how does the quota system operate?
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5051.087,5053.062,You mean on the past or in the future?
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5053.062,5054.03,In the past.
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5054.03,5056.206,"In the past, I think it's on an annual basis."
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5062.222,5066.749,"How do they -- how do they accuse the first come, first served?"
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5066.749,5070.102,"First come, first served in the bracket of preference that you're in."
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5073.252,5080.931,"So in any year, -- so the -- when you say that he's ineligible because the quota is over subscribed."
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5080.931,5082.265,That's for that year.
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5082.265,5083.058,That's for that year?
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5083.058,5085.927,"Yes, sir."
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5085.927,5093.738,"And if you're on -- if you're in the quota for one year, can you come any time during that year?"
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5093.738,5096.677,You mean your number might come up?
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5096.677,5099.719,Well is that -- you wait for your number to come up during the year and --
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5099.719,5101.068,That's right.
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5102.637,5108.892,Let's say I'm on the quota.(Voice Overlap)
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5112.115,5112.587,You're listed.
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5112.587,5114.445,I'm waiting for my number to come up.
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5116.293,5117.689,Right.
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5117.689,5122.922,So then I lie about my -- then I go through a phony marriage with an American citizen.
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5122.922,5126.542,"Yes, sir."
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5126.542,5130.435,And then have a child over here and then illegitimate child.
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5131.642,5132.261,"Yes, sir."
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5132.261,5133.778,Section 7 will accept me.
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5133.778,5136.443,"Yes, sir."
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5145.993,5148.645,You don't send them to wait for his number?
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5148.645,5148.966,No.
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5153.817,5163.5,Well you so don't send him back and wait for his number to ever come up and yet if he did -- and yet his brother who did not have a number you send him back.
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5163.5,5165.924,Oh I don't think the number matters too much.
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5166.158,5180.007,"Now, wait a minute, you're saying that he's deportable here because he wasn't otherwise admissible and he wasn't otherwise admissible because he -- because the quota was oversubscribed and he wasn't honored?"
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5180.007,5180.457,That's it.
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5180.457,5182.893,"He wasn't entered, he didn't have a number."
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5182.893,5184.975,Well so far as we know he didn't have any number.
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5184.975,5185.676,Yeah
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5185.676,5187.526,But in here she --
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5187.526,5194.054,But in my example if I got a number even if I wont be here for a hundred years.
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5202.623,5208.552,"I assume that in both cases, the applicant lied."
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5208.552,5212.907,Sure I assume both cases the applicant has lied and one of them goes home and the other one doesn't.
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5212.907,5224.715,"Well, the first one would not have been -- I would not consider that the person who was on the list is eligible to be admitted."
1966.54,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5224.715,5225.372,He isn't?
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5225.372,5229.837,He's not eligible until his number comes up.
1966.54,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5229.837,5231.554,"Well, so now --"
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5231.554,5237.437,"As long as -- no sir, as long as the quota is there I am not defending the quota."
1966.54,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5250.011,5254.762,"Yes, but you satisfied quota eligibility, haven't you, if you get a number?"
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5254.762,5255.924,Oh no sir.
1966.54,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5260.348,5265.565,Some people can't even get in the quota can they?
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5265.565,5266.743,I -- but it does.
1966.54,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5271.203,5272.667,They have some qualifications.
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5272.667,5275.056,Criminal records and stuff like that.
1966.54,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5275.056,5277.99,But they're eligible -- it means that they're eligible for entry?
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5277.99,5278.697,They're not eligible --
1966.54,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5278.697,5280.154,At some time?
1966.54,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5280.154,5280.721,"Yes, sir."
1966.54,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5291.145,5291.563,Alright.
1966.54,5,29188,julius_c_biervliet,,6327.806,6346.9,"Your Honor, I just want to answer your question there is a quota system for Latin America and that it is specified in the law that these people are special immigrants and in order to be a special immigrant they have to comply with certain formalities."
