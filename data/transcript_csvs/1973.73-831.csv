1973.73-831,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.54,Thank you Mr. Justice Douglas.
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,1738.629,1742.558,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court?
1973.73-831,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2414.262,2426.952,Do you think that the decision in Bradley about the factors consider there raises the same sort of constitutional question that you say would be raised by a denial for period the parole eligibly here?
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2426.952,2450.22,"Well You Honor, I believe the similar questions are raised except there was a rational purpose to be served by the construction adopted by this Court in Bradley because I believe it was rational to conclude that Congress did not intended -- did not intend that 1970 Act either reopen prior criminal proceedings or that it would treat unequally persons convicted of violations of prior law."
1973.73-831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2512.842,2520.329,That in Bradley I think that the Court looked upon ineligibility for parole as part of the sentence?
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2520.329,2521.922,"No Your Honor, I think not."
1973.73-831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2529.69,2539.194,"Well then it said at the Trial Court acceleration of it was under Bradley, the Trial Court could not do that?"
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2539.194,2540.947,That’s correct Your Honor.
1973.73-831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2540.947,2546.628,So he could not interfere with the ineligibility for parole under the existing?
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2546.628,2552.522,"Well, he could not exercise his discretion that was granted to him under Section 4202 to accelerate the eligibility date."
1973.73-831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.522,2562.929,I am just saying the reason that Trial Court didn’t have this power is because under the prior law he didn’t have that power.
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2562.929,2563.938,"Yes Your Honor, that's correct."
1973.73-831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.938,2574.451,"And he didn’t have power to interfere with ineligibility for parole will be granted, eligibility for parole where it wasn’t present before."
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2574.451,2578.917,"Well, I think that mischaracterizes the parole process Your Honor."
1973.73-831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.094,2596.652,"Well, I understand that but the prior law with respect to parole was held to apply in that?"
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2596.652,2610.723,"Your Honor, I believed what this Court said was those decisions of the Trial Court which were made at the time of sentencing and therefore, were essentially part of the sentencing process were caught by the word prosecution is used in 1103."
1973.73-831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.723,2619.272,And its then ineligibility for parole was part of that and the Trail Court could interfere with it?
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2619.272,2623.36,"Your Honor again, I think not because what this Court said was the trial court could not accelerate."
1973.73-831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2623.36,2625.856,I agree with you the Court said it was leaving the question open.
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2625.856,2626.387,Yes.
1973.73-831,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2626.387,2627.98,"Well, it could not be right."
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2629.52,2638.918,"Well Your Honor, I think perhaps the problem is the Government’s argument and that the argument Your Honor is directing himself to."
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2714.636,2718.99,Only three are better purpose is this a pusher or an addict?
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2718.99,2720.105,Your Honor --
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2720.105,2721.751,I cannot find them in the record.
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2721.751,2722.866,It is not in the record.
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2722.866,2723.609,Was not in the record?
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2735.822,2738.955,"You made the same -- if it was a plain pushing, you made the same argument?"
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2738.955,2746.84,"Yes, Your Honor because congress -- the Government’s argument in -- with respect to congressional intent rest largely on Section 848."
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2746.84,2749.973,Rehabilitate a pusher?
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2749.973,2751.354,"Your Honor, I’m sorry."
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2751.354,2754.274,How do you rehabilitate a pusher?
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2754.274,2763.779,"Your Honor, the penal authorities have many programs including those of parole but prisoners are placed in supervised environments are given jobs, or given training."
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2790.009,2796.275,Is this legist act aim that rehabilitated pushers?
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2796.275,2797.974,Your Honor I think it is.
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2797.974,2802.381,"As I read it, its rehabilitating addicts, am I wrong?"
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2802.381,2805.886,Your Honor it’s very hard to say what the board pusher means.
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2806.895,2811.78,"Upon that, a pusher is man itself does not use those."
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2811.78,2815.868,"Well, then I think the statute clearly intends that many of them be rehabilitated Your Honor because the statute --"
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2815.868,2818.311,Those I thought it was addicts?
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2818.311,2824.205,"It is aimed that addicts and users, and I think also pushers unless they are in a supervisory position fopur to five persons."
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2824.205,2826.754,Where in that you can show me everything about pushers?
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2826.754,2828.4,Your Honor the only thing in the statute.
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2828.4,2830.896,"What you said it’s there, where?"
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2830.896,2836.418,Its -- By virtue of Section 848 which bars parole in one very limited instance.
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2843.268,2844.011,Other pusher?
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2844.011,2845.445,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2846.613,2849.746,And you say that show it was made to rehabilitate pushers?
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2849.746,2865.569,It was to rehabilitate the individual who sells drugs either because he is a user or because he is an addict or because he’s in powers and he is selling to a small group of people and he is the kind of person that hopefully society can salvage and make a useful person again.
1973.73-831,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2869.233,2871.77,That category so quite a bit.
1973.73-831,1,33669,john_j_witmeyer_iii,,2871.77,2872.885,"Your Honor, I do not know."
