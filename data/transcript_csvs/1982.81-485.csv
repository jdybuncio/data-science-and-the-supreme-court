1982.81-485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.26,We will hear arguments next in Hillsboro National Bank against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the consolidated case.
1982.81-485,0,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,68.44,73.436,"Mister Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,314.276,317.853,What about the corporate shareholders?
1982.81-485,0,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,317.853,324.429,"No, the money was delivered to the taxing bodies because the corporate shareholders were held to be liable for the tax."
1982.81-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,597.803,604.41,"Could I ask you, why was the deduction allowed in the first place, paying a tax on behalf of someone else?"
1982.81-485,0,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,604.41,608.47,It is specifically provided for under Section 164(e).
1982.81-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.47,609.329,It's a statutory--
1982.81-485,0,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,609.329,614.749,It's a statutory provision that allows corporations to pay taxes for its shareholders.
1982.81-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,614.749,620.497,--And the shareholders need not treat that as a dividend?
1982.81-485,0,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,620.497,626.604,The shareholders are precluded from treating that as income and also precluded from taking a deduction for the tax.
1982.81-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,649.251,654.733,How did the shareholders treat this return of the tax to them?
1982.81-485,0,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,654.733,656.279,--It was treated as income to them.
1982.81-485,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,663.168,666.26,So the taxpayers paid the tax on it.
1982.81-485,0,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,666.26,668.18,"They paid tax when it was received, yes, sir."
1982.81-485,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,668.18,673.74,"Mr. Stephens, suppose the Commissioner is right in your case."
1982.81-485,0,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,684.767,691.499,"In order for the tax benefit rule to apply, you would have to look at the two different years."
1982.81-485,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,728.61,729.187,Very well.
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,737.403,740.043,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,816.652,819.964,Who got the benefit when the corporation was liquidated?
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,819.964,822.056,"--No one received the benefit, Your Honor."
1982.81-485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,822.056,832.332,"Had this second event not occurred, would the stockholders have received more or less?"
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,832.332,847.28,"It really, in this situation, as I'll explain it, it really doesn't make that much difference, because the stockholders, when they received the assets, fair market value, the fact that it was depreciated or expensed made no difference to them."
1982.81-485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,847.28,848.92,Let me put the question another way.
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,852.107,855.105,"No, it would not have."
1982.81-485,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,873.846,890.95,"Mr. Silhasek, I'd like to ask you, if I may, what weight we should give to the failure of the 94th Congress to enact a change to Section 1245 to apply it to recapture of Section 162 expenses?"
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,890.95,894.152,"--They have had that opportunity, and again, they have avoided it."
1982.81-485,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,911.146,914.127,"Should we give any weight to that, one way or another?"
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,914.127,929.028,"I believe so, because in looking at the entire view of this transaction there really is not an avoidance, a tax avoidance, or a benefit that was recovered or recaptured by either party."
1982.81-485,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,960.749,963.123,"Right away, at the beginning of the next fiscal year?"
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,963.123,964.107,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-485,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,971.666,976.275,"Well, they did it right at the beginning of the taxable year."
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,976.275,981.991,"Yes, Your Honor, they did, although they purchased the feed... that was expensed throughout the taxable year."
1982.81-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1057.085,1067.004,Is there any doubt that what the Internal Revenue Service has construed the statute contrary to your submission?
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1067.004,1070.58,Any doubt in my mind?
1982.81-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1070.58,1074.484,That they have been construing it contrary to your submission?
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1074.484,1082.497,"Not... this is the first time that this case has ever come up in this situation, outside of Tennessee-Carolina, Your Honor."
1982.81-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1094.601,1101.958,"Well then, this subsequent Congressional history is irrelevant, too, then."
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1101.958,1110.814,"They have attempted to apply this in other types of liquidations, but they have had this problem--"
1982.81-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.814,1111.97,So this is consistent.
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1115.579,1116.344,--There are other cases.
1982.81-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1129.481,1144.099,"And you must convince us, to win, that the statute just won't yield to this kind of construction, that it's just not within the realm of statutory construction to apply it the way the Service--"
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1144.099,1145.115,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.115,1151.066,--And I take it you think your case is different from the one that was just argued?
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1151.066,1153.518,Hillsboro?
1982.81-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1153.518,1154.454,Yes.
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1154.454,1163.654,"As far as... it's totally different factually, but as far as the application of the tax benefit rule it's the same, because there was no recovery in this situation."
1982.81-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1168.169,1171.307,But you're relying on this being a liquidation.
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1171.307,1174.104,"Specifically on the statute, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1174.104,1175.728,Which is different from Hillsboro.
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1175.728,1176.618,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1210.058,1212.916,So it's just as though the stockholders had bought the feed from them.
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1212.916,1213.805,"Similar to that, Your Honor."
1982.81-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.805,1223.285,"If they'd have bought it... suppose this corporation hadn't gone out of existence, but the corporation had sold some feed to one of the stockholders."
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1223.285,1228.752,"If they had sold it to one of the stockholders, in that situation there possibly would have been gain to the corporation."
1982.81-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1228.752,1230.891,"Possibly, but there might not have been, either."
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1230.891,1239.716,"They would have had to pay a fair, a full... the difference is, though, in purchasing that feed they would have paid the full market value for that feed."
1982.81-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1239.716,1241.67,But the stockholders could have deducted it.
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1241.67,1246.198,"They could have deducted it, but they would have paid substantially more, that is correct."
1982.81-485,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1246.198,1254.32,"But they nevertheless have paid for the feed by turning in their stock, which was worth a certain basis."
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1254.32,1254.929,That's correct.
1982.81-485,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.165,1294.242,Do we know what that basis is?
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1295.867,1296.678,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-485,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1298.397,1307.534,"I mean, it could have been, I suppose, either, at one extreme they could have had a $1,000 investment in their stock, or a zero investment, in which case there'd be no basis at all."
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1307.534,1319.247,"Your Honor, in the lower court we were only concerned with the effect of the statute, the Government's position, to override Section 333 without taking into consideration the effect on the shareholders."
1982.81-485,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1334.835,1343.41,But am I correct that there's nothing in the record to tell us what the basis of the shareholders in the feed that they acquired after the liquidation?
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1343.41,1344.051,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-485,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1344.051,1344.91,It could be zero.
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1344.91,1345.473,I'm sorry.
1982.81-485,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1373.65,1374.508,"Well, what was it?"
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1374.508,1376.898,"Approximately $55,000, Your Honor."
1982.81-485,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1376.898,1377.46,I see.
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1379.849,1380.302,Excuse me.
1982.81-485,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.021,1394.937,"--If that feed had been consumed entirely in the prior year, what difference would it have made to the stockholders on liquidation?"
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1394.937,1408.463,"It would have meant... probably made no difference, because upon liquidation their basis in the assets that they received is, they take the basis in their stock and distribute it over the assets that they received."
1982.81-485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1419.662,1424.331,Are you saying that the tax benefit rule shouldn't apply because there was no benefit?
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1424.331,1427.313,"No benefit to the corporation upon liquidation, that is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1427.313,1430.36,How about benefit to the tax... to the stockholders?
1982.81-485,1,32893,james_silhasek,,1430.36,1437.842,"I see no benefit to them either, because they would have written off... when they received that feed, what they wrote off was the basis they had in the stock."
1982.81-485,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1646.603,1652.43,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Silhasek."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,1663.111,1665.798,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-485,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1710.656,1728.275,"Would that apply, Mr. Solicitor General, if let us say a tax had been paid and that had been deducted, and then later there was a recovery, a refund on that tax paid."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,1730.257,1732.522,"--In a later year, in a later year."
1982.81-485,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1732.522,1733.006,--A subsequent year.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,1733.006,1734.959,And offsets what happened during the earlier year.
1982.81-485,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1734.959,1736.754,That's the element--
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,1736.754,1737.895,Precisely.
1982.81-485,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1751.608,1760.308,"--If that's the case, if it's not... well, why doesn't the Government simply require the person to make out an amended return for the later year?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,1760.308,1762.494,I asked exactly that same question.
1982.81-485,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1762.494,1764.838,"Well, you probably know as little about tax law as I do."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,1766.181,1773.474,"But I have the answer from those who know more than either of us, and the answer is that the Government cannot require an amended return."
1982.81-485,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1776.769,1777.565,"General, wait."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,1784.158,1788.015,"--Yes, but what it does is to require the correction at a later point in time."
1982.81-485,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1823.969,1836.652,"Well, Mr. Solicitor General, in both these cases why didn't the Government merely throw or limit the deduction that was taken in the original year?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,1839.01,1865.25,"The reason is, and this goes, Justice Blackmun, right to the heart of the tax benefit rule, the problem is the annual accounting concept that was declared in 1931 by this Court in Sanford & Burnett against Brooks, the notion that we do not assess tax on the basis of a transactional approach and wait until all of the assets of the transaction have been finally completed."
1982.81-485,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1900.828,1905.624,Why is that a problem at all if the statute of limitations hasn't expired?
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,1921.742,1928.521,"--Well, in some instances, as I indicated... in some instances, I suppose that that would solve the problem."
1982.81-485,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1937.438,1945.888,"It seems to me again that what you're saying is that precision in annual accounting for income tax purposes is a secondary consideration, not a primary one."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,1945.888,1960.711,"Well, that is correct, and that what is the primary purpose is determining... but because of the annual accounting concept, there are these later balancing entries or correcting entries that may from time to time be necessary."
1982.81-485,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1994.729,2004.585,"I can understand that statement, but it seems to me that there's a lot less distortion if you put it in the original--"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2004.585,2005.366,In the earlier period.
1982.81-485,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2005.366,2005.991,--taxable year.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2005.991,2006.881,In the earlier period.
1982.81-485,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2022.405,2025.513,"It might not, depending on the taxpayer's particular situation."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2025.513,2026.341,"That is correct, that is correct."
1982.81-485,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2028.872,2032.683,I guess I'm a firm believer in accuracy rather than theory.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2032.683,2042.976,"And it would in fact... Alice Phelan Sullivan Corporation, for example, is one instance where there is a difference because of a different tax rate."
1982.81-485,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.937,2067.653,"Well, why shouldn't... if you say you're going to bring it back into income, why shouldn't it be income if you're going to bring it into income?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2067.653,2071.479,"--It is income, in the later period."
1982.81-485,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.479,2075.838,"How did this, how did Hillsboro, get any income in this later period?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2075.838,2076.916,Because--
1982.81-485,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.916,2082.679,"I thought you said a moment ago the whole point of it was not to recover income, but to recover a deduction."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2082.679,2085.052,"--To recover a deduction, but we do that--"
1982.81-485,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2085.052,2088.036,And therefore you have to treat it as income in the later year?
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2088.036,2088.505,--That's right.
1982.81-485,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.505,2089.441,Even though it isn't income?
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2089.441,2090.598,That is correct.
1982.81-485,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2099.968,2104.481,Why don't you merely reduce the deduction in the original year?
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2104.481,2111.557,"If it were feasible, the Government could require that we go back and reopen the period."
1982.81-485,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2115.789,2117.367,But don't they do that all the time?
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2117.367,2126.801,"--Well, they do, Justice Blackmun, in the sense of going back and requiring an audit."
1982.81-485,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2142.841,2147.402,They're closed until they're audited.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2147.402,2148.51,"--Well, that's right."
1982.81-485,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.888,2221.435,It never was anything it owed.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2221.435,2225.76,"Well, but it is... all right."
1982.81-485,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.959,2243.629,The statutory permission for a deduction just wasn't satisfied.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2243.629,2245.674,"That is correct, that is correct."
1982.81-485,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2245.674,2251.111,Let me see if I can get something that's at least simple to me.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2279.27,2280.661,That invokes the tax benefit rule.
1982.81-485,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2280.661,2282.801,How is that different from what we're dealing with here?
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2282.801,2286.893,"It is not different at all, Mr. Chief Justice, not at all."
1982.81-485,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2329.031,2342.901,"General, is it the Commissioner's position that in the hypothetical of the Chief Justice regarding the recovery of some money that had been written off as a bad debt, it would be treated under the tax benefit rule just as these matters have been treated that are now before the Court?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2342.901,2343.556,"That is correct, that is correct."
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2343.556,2359.659,"May I also ask, in view of your latest, if you agree with the hypothetical that your opponent suggested, that if instead of refunding the money to the shareholders the State of Illinois or the county just kept the money, even though not entitled to do so, that would still... the tax benefit rule would still apply?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2359.659,2359.925,That is correct.
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2368.969,2379.262,"Now, what in the Dairy case, what is the difference in the facts at the time the deduction was taken and the facts as they later materialized?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2379.262,2379.965,Let's turn to the Dairy case--
1982.81-485,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2379.965,2389.413,"Mr. Solicitor General, before you go on, Judge Pell characterized the result of this transaction as double taxation."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2411.544,2415.402,"--Clearly, it's double taxation, just like dividends are always double taxation."
1982.81-485,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2415.402,2415.605,Sir?
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2415.605,2418.37,Just like dividends are always double taxation.
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2418.37,2422.337,"That's not true, not in the bank stock situation, not under 164."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2423.54,2427.023,It is double taxation only in this sense--
1982.81-485,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2427.023,2433.598,"Well, that could be why this case is different from the established and rule that you rely on."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2435.253,2438.097,"--Well, it is not double taxation in this sense."
1982.81-485,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2485.592,2497.26,"Mr. Lee, before you return to Bliss, if I may, you've argued, as I understand it, that if we reverse in Hillsboro we will be giving the corporation a deductible dividend."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2497.26,2497.791,--That is correct.
1982.81-485,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2497.791,2498.479,All right.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2506.224,2523.904,"Not really, because in that circumstance it is not permission to distribute funds from the corporation to the shareholders which they can then use for their purposes."
1982.81-485,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2534.198,2545.944,"And also, if I understand you correctly, if the refund checks in Hillsboro had been stolen before they got to the shareholders, your position would be the same, is that right?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2545.944,2546.085,That is correct.
1982.81-485,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2546.085,2546.694,Still a tax?
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2546.694,2548.022,"That is correct, for the reason stated."
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2651.386,2664.74,"Yes, but Mr. Solicitor General, is it not true that if there were no basis in the stock... say they got the stock it $1,000, some nominal amount, so that there would be not a stepped-up basis but a stepped-down basis... your theory would be precisely the same?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2664.74,2665.693,That is correct.
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2665.693,2667.786,"So really, this is totally irrelevant."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2673.175,2673.816,That's exactly right.
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2673.816,2675.377,So inventory always has to be charged back.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2675.377,2677.845,"That is correct, and that's my second point."
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2685.717,2686.654,"Well, how do we know that?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2689.871,2692.041,We don't know in this particular case.
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2692.041,2694.822,"Well, I mean in any case, in the generality of the universe."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2694.822,2702.226,"Well, if there is a fair market value of the feed at the time of distribution there will be some allocation that will be made to the expensed items."
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.582,2717.173,"Well, supposing there's $55,000 worth of feed and that's the only corporate asset and that's the exact amount they paid for the stock."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2717.173,2718.047,Then they would--
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.047,2721.624,"Then they'd be paying $55,000 for it just as though they bought it."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2721.624,2723.436,"--That is correct, that is correct."
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2786.597,2789.018,May I ask you a hypothetical question.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2801.045,2809.042,"No, because I think what they have done is they have purchased his services for however long he lives."
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2809.042,2811.087,On the assumption that he'll be playing for five years.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2811.087,2823.271,"Well, I would regard that... I'm not sure how that would come out, but I would argue that that is a purchase of his services for as long as he lives, and that it would not--"
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2823.271,2832.377,"They made the payment because they expected to use his services before... say they go out of business and then he's still around, as with the case of the feed."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2832.377,2834.688,--Your question correctly shows--
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2834.688,2836.764,In that case then there'd be a tax benefit recovery?
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2836.764,2840.295,--Your question shows that you understand what we're saying.
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2845.73,2847.167,Why would you apply it differently?
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2847.167,2861.348,"Well, because you could say that what they had purchased was not his services for five years, that it was his services for five years or whenever he dies or becomes incapacitated, whichever comes first."
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2861.348,2865.736,"Well, say it's just two seasons, like the feed they expect to use up in 18 months or something like that."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2865.736,2869.689,"Well, except there may be slightly different assumptions in the case of feed and the case of football players."
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2869.689,2870.767,Why?
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2878.576,2879.248,That may well be.
1982.81-485,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2883.324,2894.273,"Well, do you think, in Justice Stevens' example do you think that in any event could the football team deduct the entire payment in one year?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2894.273,2897.412,"--Well, I'm just not sure."
1982.81-485,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2897.412,2901.535,"They basically depreciate those contracts, don't they?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2901.535,2902.472,I think they do.
1982.81-485,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3003.76,3011.053,"General Lee, certainly the literal language of the statute would support the taxpayer argument in Bliss."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3011.053,3012.147,That is correct.
1982.81-485,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3012.147,3016.832,And Congress has had an opportunity to correct it and hasn't done so.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3016.832,3026.422,"To the same extent, Justice O'Connor, the literal language also applies to the companion provision of Section 336, which is Section--"
1982.81-485,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3026.422,3029.109,And there has been a judge-made exception to that.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3029.109,3031.389,--A rather consistent judge-made exception--
1982.81-485,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3031.389,3031.639,"Yes, right."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3031.639,3035.044,"--that is uniform, well accepted."
1982.81-485,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3035.044,3037.543,At the urging of the Service.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3037.543,3038.715,"Oh, that's right."
1982.81-485,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3043.728,3045.65,This is an administrative interpretation.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3045.65,3047.461,This is an administrative interpretation.
1982.81-485,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3047.461,3048.866,Validated by the Court.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3048.866,3050.256,That is correct.
1982.81-485,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3126.225,3142.141,"Mr. Lee, it seems that you're arguing for a rather broad rule here and it concerns me a little bit, because normally somebody, for example, who takes property from a decedent gets a step up to fair market value."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3164.194,3170.004,"I do not understand our position to be that this has anything to do with a stepped-up basis on estate taxes, estate tax cases."
1982.81-485,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3183.093,3192.512,"But your theory, if broadly followed, would lead to some surprising consequences for decedents' estates or donors of property."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3192.512,3199.414,"--If it were applied to donors' property or decedents' estates, which so far as I know the Commissioner has never urged."
1982.81-485,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3199.414,3203.741,"Well, it's the foot in the door, I suppose."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3206.084,3207.522,But let me tell you about--
1982.81-485,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3207.522,3213.332,"General Lee, before you sit down... I notice the white light has gone on... somewhere would you comment on Nash?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3213.332,3213.957,--Yes.
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3279.413,3289.567,"Before you leave Nash, isn't it true that at the time they set up the reserve for bad debts they assumed the corporation would continue in business for such time as would be necessary to see who paid their bills and who didn't?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3289.567,3297.718,"Yes, but I think the assumption, Justice Stevens, is not the assumption that the corporation would continue; the assumption is about the collectability of the debts."
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3299.359,3304.138,"Well, but if you say that, the assumption here is about using the feed to feed the cattle, and presumably that's what they did with the feed."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3304.138,3312.307,--I simply take a different view as to what the relevant assumption is.
1982.81-485,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3341.279,3342.341,What is the recovery?
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3342.341,3347.698,"The recovery is a recovery to the shareholders, who in turn own the bank."
1982.81-485,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3347.698,3356.242,But in Bliss I gather under your submission the recovery is not limited to the extent that the shareholders get a basis?
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3356.242,3357.414,"That is correct, that is correct."
1982.81-485,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3357.867,3358.586,You go beyond that.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3358.586,3363.271,"That is correct, and that was precisely the rationale in Tennesee-Carolina."
1982.81-485,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3363.271,3369.706,"If it was so limited, Mr. Solicitor, would not that rather eliminate the double taxation problem?"
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3369.706,3374.579,"Well, that is not our preferred view of the case."
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3374.579,3386.621,"Mr. Solicitor General, the recovery, you say, to the shareholders, who in turn own the bank, but your rule would be exactly the same if they had all sold their stock and you had an entirely different group of owners, because it would then go to former shareholders."
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3386.621,3387.121,That is correct.
1982.81-485,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3388.339,3390.995,There really isn't necessarily any recovery.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3390.995,3394.274,"--Well, but what I'm saying is that you can find a recovery."
1982.81-485,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3394.274,3396.726,If you try hard enough.
1982.81-485,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3396.726,3398.085,If you try hard enough.
1982.81-485,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3436.725,3441.957,"Mr. Stephens, let me put this question to you."
1982.81-485,3,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,3482.988,3498.06,"That $800,000 is taxable to the jewelry company in the year of recovery because, as Your Honor correctly points out and we believe is relevant, there was a recovery, an economic recovery by the company."
1982.81-485,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3507.306,3509.071,Now let me change it a little bit.
1982.81-485,3,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,3523.191,3529.423,"Then that would be added to the income, because again, it would be a subsequent recovery."
1982.81-485,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3538.732,3547.259,Could the Service insist on amending the 82 return in the Chief Justice's example?
1982.81-485,3,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,3547.259,3555.053,The premise upon which the 82... wait a minute.
1982.81-485,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3557.41,3562.55,"No, the loss is in 82 and the recovery is the next year."
1982.81-485,3,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,3562.55,3564.08,Okay.
1982.81-485,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3569.297,3570.063,All right.
1982.81-485,3,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,3573.28,3574.218,No--
1982.81-485,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3574.218,3578.074,May the Service go back and recover it in the previous year or not?
1982.81-485,3,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,3578.074,3587.273,"--I would say that they could not, because the recovery occurred in 83, and remember, they were stolen."
1982.81-485,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3591.928,3592.944,There was a loss in that year.
1982.81-485,3,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,3592.944,3593.958,--And there was a loss.
1982.81-485,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3622.682,3626.851,"So you don't... you say the Service could not reopen the 82 return in the Chief Justice's example,--"
1982.81-485,3,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,3626.851,3630.24,"I believe under the procedures it could, but this is not the proper--"
1982.81-485,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3630.24,3640.939,"--But they would lose their case if they attempted to make anl assessment for 82 based on the recovery of the $800,000 in 83."
1982.81-485,3,28196,harvey_b_stephens,,3640.939,3656.042,"--Well, obviously, from an accounting point of view they would not lose the case, Your Honor, because if they show $1,800,000 deduction and an $800,000 recovery, they only have a million dollar loss."
