1995.95-6510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.317,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-6510, Coleman Wayne Gray v. J. D. Netherland."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,21.464,23.497,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1995.95-6510,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,74.79,78.051,"Well, I don't think the answer is that, so what?"
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,120.861,134.48,"Let me address that, Your Honor, first with the comment that I've searched the respondent's brief and can't find in there the proposition that this did not happen, that the prosecutor did not mislead on day 1 and then progress in the misleading on the subsequent days."
1995.95-6510,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,214.311,225.938,"Well, am I correct that trial counsel objected to the admissibility of the Sorrels evidence regardless... on the independent ground that it was improper--"
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,225.938,226.629,Both.
1995.95-6510,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,226.629,229.731,--regardless of the matter... of the amount of time he had to meet it?
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,229.731,230.831,That was one ground.
1995.95-6510,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,230.831,231.933,All right.
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,241.149,241.489,Well--
1995.95-6510,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,241.489,243.0,And that could be a strategic choice.
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,243.0,252.025,"--The direct quote, and to me the letter... at least the spirit, if not the letter of the request is on page 780 of the record, and this is after Tucker testified."
1995.95-6510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,273.369,275.029,Was there a motion for a continuance?
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,275.029,275.891,The words--
1995.95-6510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,275.891,277.591,You can answer that question yes or no.
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,277.591,286.988,"--No, there was... the words, we move for a continuance, were not spoken, but under the circumstances of the case, it could hardly be interpreted to me in any other fashion."
1995.95-6510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,292.822,294.545,"Mr. Olive, where did the district judge get this notion."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,309.945,315.986,--And those record citations are to the State court trial record that are in the opinion at that point.
1995.95-6510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,315.986,321.623,"But there was no explicit plea for additional time, as distinguished from exclusion."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,321.623,329.697,"It is quite true the words were not spoken, please continue this case, but I... the... it has the same effect, and let me say why--"
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,329.697,333.888,"But it's not just yet, it's that the words were spoken, please exclude this evidence."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,333.888,341.415,"--That's correct, but the court was placed... the court was observing defense counsel in a predicament, and the court had been there from the beginning of the predicament to the--"
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.415,345.705,Maybe the court should have sua sponte proposed this alternative.
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,347.979,353.392,"--I think that... that's true, and perhaps it is a due process violation when the court--"
1995.95-6510,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,353.392,359.426,Was that or any other series of arguments addressing this point developed in the Virginia courts?
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,359.426,366.8,"--On direct appeal, the issue of whether there should have been a continuance or not, or--"
1995.95-6510,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,366.8,372.984,"Yes, whether you were derelict, or trial counsel was derelict in failing exclusively to ask for a continuance."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,372.984,373.295,--No.
1995.95-6510,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,373.295,373.816,Was that developed?
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,373.816,394.238,"That was not developed, and the reason... to me, a fair reading of this record is, you turn to a judge and you say, Your Honor, we need a continuance in this case because we are not prepared, and in this case, the ruling is the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia, which is, that does not state a basis for a continuance because you are not entitled to be prepared under Virginia Commonwealth law."
1995.95-6510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,394.238,408.497,"Well, that would be clear, perhaps, if you had moved for a continuance, but I don't know that the trial court is required by the Federal Constitution to come to the rescue of an attorney who makes these statements but doesn't move for a continuance."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,408.497,428.12,"The Federal district court judge found as a matter of fact that what was being said, the spirit of what was being said was, we need more time to prepare, and under Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, even when the court is looking at a paper record, Federal district court is looking at a paper record--"
1995.95-6510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,428.12,428.62,But what is the paper record?
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,428.62,429.231,--It's--
1995.95-6510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,429.231,432.252,"I mean, there seems to be a request for exclusion."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,433.504,445.362,"--Well, you know, when I stand before a trial judge and say, I'm not ready, and the trial judge basically says this evidence is admissible whether you're ready or not, then a continuance is superfluous."
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,449.574,451.237,"You didn't argue this on appeal, either, though."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,451.237,452.697,On appeal to the--
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.697,461.232,"Was the objection on appeal that this evidence was not admissible, or was the objection that you should have been given more time?"
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,464.485,482.656,"--Oh, on the appeal record at pages... the direct appeal brief, at page 3 and maybe a little bit before that, again, defense counsel and appellate counsel brings forth the same comparison between the Watkins case and this case, and the comparison is on notice, an opportunity to be heard."
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.002,491.472,The question isn't whether there's notice or not.
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,502.049,525.055,"--The remedy that was sought... I don't know that you have to go to a State or Commonwealth trial court judge and say, please stop this from happening to me, it violates my right to a fair trial, and then because you say, please exclude this evidence, as opposed to please give me more time, that somehow the defendant's due process rights have been waived."
1995.95-6510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,525.055,535.321,Did you argue to the supreme court of Virginia that your motions or comments at this point in the trial were tantamount to a request for a continuance?
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,535.321,538.974,"It is... the language is, we were taken by surprise."
1995.95-6510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,541.514,547.669,But you... so you didn't argue... you didn't argue in the supreme court of Virginia that the trial court should have granted you a continuance?
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,547.669,553.392,"--That is not contained in the... the language of it, directly, is not expressly contained there, Chief Justice."
1995.95-6510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,553.392,553.842,But the--
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,580.721,589.027,The district court a tually dealt not with notice but with prosecutor misconduct or deception with respect to what the issues would be.
1995.95-6510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,679.564,693.275,"Well, but what the district court found was that the constitutional defect in the penalty phase hearing was that Gray was confronted and surprised."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,755.655,775.598,"--In the district court at page 352 of the Joint Appendix, the district court does talk about notice, but the district court also refers to the moral standards of fair play after describing what can only be described of, if you accept it as correct, not especially moral, a plan to violate a direct promise to defense counsel."
1995.95-6510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,775.598,781.973,"Yes, but it described the constitutional violation as the violation of lack of fair notice."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,781.973,803.475,"But when I go on in that sentence, the district court Judge Spencer is saying the Commonwealth's Attorney, Ferguson's tactics, and that's not a matter of notice, per se, violated the moral standards of fair play and violated the Due Process Clause, so to me that is... what went awry here was, indeed, notice, but this is notice plus."
1995.95-6510,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,814.073,818.506,"Yes, but it has to be that, because let's assume that there was deliberate deception."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,826.061,827.892,--Well--
1995.95-6510,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,827.892,829.364,Is there a request for a continuance?
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,840.761,853.117,"--I... my position on the State court record, like the district court's position on it, and I don't think it's an unreasonable one, is when I stand up and say, I'm not ready, the judge knows that I'm asking for a couple of things."
1995.95-6510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,870.01,884.759,"Well, with respect to your statement that the prosecutor made a certain avowal, I'm going to offer this and this only with respect to this aspect, ordinarily there's not much discovery in a criminal case in Virginia, is there?"
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,884.759,889.211,"You know whether you're going to have to try a murder case, but not what the specific items of evidence are."
1995.95-6510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,889.211,897.138,"So, I mean, was the prosecutor vouchsafing something to you that he was not required to do by law?"
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,897.138,898.638,The preferred--
1995.95-6510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,898.638,903.471,"I know that that case is the preferred approach, but--"
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,903.471,908.014,--He... the judge did not... the prosecutor did not have to say anything under Commonwealth law.
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,951.312,961.679,"--Now, you now know through discovery that even at the time he made that statement he intended to introduce additional evidence, right?"
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,961.679,962.879,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,962.879,964.882,But... and so you can make the sandbagging claim.
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,970.866,976.45,On direct appeal the claim that was made was that the prosecutor at the time withheld--
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,976.45,977.829,"Withheld, which is different."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,979.251,980.46,--Well--
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,980.46,984.214,"Not that he maliciously, you know, ambushed you."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,984.214,986.455,"--Well, there was no adjective on it, but what was placed--"
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.455,986.906,Well--
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,986.906,991.848,"--in the direct appeal was something to me that sounds relatively volitional, which is withholding."
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,993.34,994.572,--But you didn't know that at the time--
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,994.572,995.371,Well--
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.371,1006.617,--that you conducted the discovery that enabled you to conclude that he didn't just change his mind but rather intentionally told you one thing when he planned at the time to do the other?
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1006.617,1009.501,--I think that the proof of it came in the district court.
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.908,1021.888,He changed his mind.
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1026.321,1027.34,--Well--
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1027.34,1029.252,--not malicious and sandbagging prosecutor.
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1029.252,1030.773,--It could actually be a middle ground.
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1041.471,1054.699,"Can you give me any reference to the claim you are now making in the State courts, any reference to the fact that the prosecutor, knowing that he intended to introduce other evidence, misled you into thinking that he was only going to introduce one type of evidence?"
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1054.699,1056.211,I think on the direct appeal record--
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1056.211,1056.8,Knowing at the time.
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1056.8,1061.705,"--I think on the direct appeal record the best is that it was withheld, and in the trial court--"
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.705,1062.646,That's a notice claim.
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1080.287,1082.188,--I... no.
1995.95-6510,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1082.188,1082.949,All right.
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1104.251,1107.955,"I think it was more, but for purposes of your question, that was said."
1995.95-6510,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1107.955,1115.829,"Isn't it a... I... isn't it fairly... I mean, I'm handing you this, I know, but I want to get your response to it."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1124.506,1127.077,"I think it's both, yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-6510,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1129.859,1132.16,"You were misled, you're saying."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1132.16,1132.861,Completely.
1995.95-6510,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1132.861,1151.572,"And you... as I understand your answer to a previous question, you concede that under Virginia law, if you had said, I want to know what the evidence is, and the prosecutor had said, I won't tell you, that you would have no claim under... for a violation of Virginia law."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1151.572,1152.013,Correct.
1995.95-6510,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1152.013,1156.467,Would you have a claim... would you have a constitutional claim under the Due Process Clause?
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1156.467,1158.27,I think that you would.
1995.95-6510,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1159.021,1161.482,"But that's in fact not the claim that you're making, I take it."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1161.482,1161.683,--That's correct.
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1161.683,1162.043,Okay.
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1208.072,1212.356,"Well, actually it's what the district court held, and that's what we're trying to uphold."
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.465,1218.52,"It's what it held, and what it was reversed on, and the issue is whether it was rightly reversed."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1218.52,1238.212,"--The... Your Honor, I don't think that it is a Teague... there is a particular Teague issue to the claim of, I am not ready, with notice or not, to try a double homicide today."
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1270.784,1271.034,He doesn't need the case.
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1271.214,1272.086,--Pardon?
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1272.086,1272.724,He doesn't need the case.
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1273.665,1274.416,"Well, you know, that's--"
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1274.416,1279.269,"You're the one that has to show that this is not... you know, that this is standard law."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1279.269,1294.499,"--Well, it's an interesting battle of who needs the case, and I'll drop back to a few cases I think support my position from the fifties and sixties, but the fact that there is not necessarily a case on point isn't testimony to the rule of law, it's testimony to what prosecutors normally do."
1995.95-6510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1311.86,1336.977,"It's certainly not done intentionally, and to say that you did it intentionally, I'd have some... I'd have some difficulty saying that it might not be covered by Teague, but if it's not done intentionally, if he made one representation then changed his mind and put on something else, that's a quite different situation, and I have no doubt that we would be making new law if we find that that's a violation of due process."
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1336.977,1351.056,"--Let's address Ruffalo and Raley, when counsel comes in prepared to do one thing and, in fact, after that's done something else occurs without notice to them about what's going to occur in the case."
1995.95-6510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1395.896,1403.58,"Well, the... what did the district court do in order to conclude that it was intentional?"
1995.95-6510,0,36425,mark_e_olive,,1406.211,1412.135,"The best phrase for that is at page 350 of the Joint Appendix, that the prosecutor"
1995.95-6510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.324,1445.759,"Well, but that doesn't sound quite like the district court made a finding of intentional misrepresentation."

1995.95-6510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1457.726,1458.785,"Very well, Mr. Olive."

1995.95-6510,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1511.92,1540.881,"Well, if the finding were... and you may dispute this, but if the finding were that the prosecutor intentionally misled defense counsel as to what evidence he intended to use, and that that misleading was important in the preparation of the defense and was relied upon by the defense, that wouldn't be a new rule, would it?"
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1540.881,1559.882,"--Well, if it were a straightforward application of the Donnelly test... Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, where prosecutorial misconduct, if it infects the entire proceeding with unfairness, amounts to a due process violation... if it were simply a straightforward application of that standard, no, Your Honor, it would not be a new rule."
1995.95-6510,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1575.423,1578.865,"Well, he says it's that plus a lack of notice."

1995.95-6510,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1579.797,1581.857,"He tries to say, I have both here."
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1581.857,1600.4,"--He tries to make it a hybrid claim, and for that reason we submit it's a new rule, but even if it were simply a matter of applying Donnelly, not only is it contrary to what his conception of his rule is, it wouldn't be cert worthy for this Court to simply decide if the facts of this case met the Donnelly standard."
1995.95-6510,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1634.492,1636.344,Well... I'm sorry.
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1643.468,1643.779,"That's correct, Your Honor."

1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1667.854,1668.655,Well--
1995.95-6510,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1668.655,1669.737,Is that your argument?

1995.95-6510,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1670.205,1671.527,Do I understand you correctly?
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1671.527,1683.105,"--My argument, Your Honor, is that on this record, if you... even if you assume that it was intentional misleading, you cannot find that it infected the entire sentencing proceeding with unfairness for several reasons."

1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1759.915,1766.75,"He said it was unfair because this evidence came in, but he said that this evidence should have been kept out for different reasons than what he's saying today."

1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1776.147,1776.997,That's correct.

1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1780.939,1781.689,That's correct.
1995.95-6510,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1781.689,1782.329,May I--
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1802.214,1806.255,"In the district court, Your Honor, he wasn't talking about misleading."
1995.95-6510,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1807.637,1818.884,"Well, the judge... at least there is a way of reading the judge's... and I think perhaps a fair way of reading the district judge's findings as a finding of misleading, so let's get to the Fourth Circuit."
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1827.368,1852.506,"--We argued in the district court and in the Fourth Circuit that all he had preserved in the State courts was the claim that this evidence should not come in, because he had... it was unadjudicated misconduct, he had no notice of it in advance, and Melvin Tucker's testimony was too slender a reed to rely on to tie it to Mr. Gray."
1995.95-6510,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1867.606,1867.937,Okay.
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1877.623,1879.193,Not in the sense--
1995.95-6510,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1879.193,1883.157,And he waived any claim because he did not ask for a continuance.
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1885.007,1891.182,--I don't know that I specifically responded to those points because I didn't understand him to make those points.
1995.95-6510,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1891.182,1916.617,"No, but were you saying in the Fourth Circuit, you cannot sustain the district court's decision based on a finding that there was intentional misleading because a) he did not make a finding of misleading conduct as opposed to a notice claim in the State courts, and b) he did not ask for a continuance, and therefore waived any claim that he had?"
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1924.764,1934.379,I don't believe that we argued the... against the idea of misleading prosecutorial misconduct because we did not understand that to be his claim.

1995.95-6510,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1953.332,1953.853,All right.
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,1958.374,1958.815,Right.
1995.95-6510,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1958.815,1959.536,Okay.
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2004.864,2005.165,Yes.
1995.95-6510,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2005.165,2005.826,--and on direct appeal.
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2005.826,2006.356,That's correct.
1995.95-6510,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2006.356,2006.787,Okay.
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2032.864,2033.475,Well--
1995.95-6510,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2033.475,2039.379,"Or, I mean, I've never met in any case in any supreme court, or in any court that I've ever seen that people divided things that finely."
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2039.379,2039.919,--I--
1995.95-6510,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2039.919,2049.174,"I mean, and that's why it's difficult for me to see how we should go off on these procedural bars, and whether it was adequately raised and so forth."
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2050.054,2061.112,"--Well, because... because, Your Honor, whether you characterize it as an inadequate notice claim or a prosecutorial misconduct claim, or some hybrid combination of the two, the bottom line is, what effect did it have on the penalty trial?"
1995.95-6510,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2063.592,2072.32,"That's on the merits, and I thought we granted this case because we wanted to see whether the issue that they were trying to raise was Teague-barred."
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2094.735,2104.532,"Well, if the issue is the Teague bar to the notice claim, I think there are two aspects to the notice claim."
1995.95-6510,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2152.032,2186.776,"Mr. McLees, before we get to specific cases, there's one overall problem that's troubling me about saying, I told all the facts about what happened, and I pinned some kind of general due process label on it, but not necessarily the right one, and then I think about how civil proceedings are, where we know, if you don't ask for the right relief but you're entitled to it, Rule 54(c) says you get it, and yet we seem to be demanding this persnicketiness in proceeding on the criminal side, when it's a question literally of life or death."
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2193.599,2209.709,"--Well, if it's a question of whether the defense attorney had to expressly ask for continuance, there's a reason why we draw a fine line between asking for a continuance and objecting and asking for exclusion--"
1995.95-6510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2209.709,2210.911,"That's not going to get you there, Mr. McLees."
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2217.694,2218.866,"--More broadly, it is."
1995.95-6510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2218.866,2219.967,We don't have habeas corpus.
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2219.967,2220.476,Exactly.
1995.95-6510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2220.476,2226.69,And we don't have the problem of sandbagging the State courts by resolving issues that have never been fairly presented to them.
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2230.302,2231.283,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1995.95-6510,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2231.283,2238.747,"How, here, in fact, are we interfering with the State court when the State's own court on habeas said all these issues were presented?"
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2253.858,2271.77,"The petitioner in his State habeas corpus proceeding in fact on his petition for appeal to the supreme court of Virginia asked the supreme court of Virginia to revisit the claim, the decision that had been made on the direct appeal, and the issue raised on the direct appeal."
1995.95-6510,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2271.77,2273.549,Mr. McLees--
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2304.652,2305.673,"No, exactly."
1995.95-6510,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2313.156,2316.729,May I ask you a question about the whole notion of the continuance and so forth?
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2321.471,2322.222,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-6510,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2322.222,2333.449,"And if there were, is it customary in penalty hearings after a jury's been impaneled and heard the merits of the case and then sits down to hear the penalty, to grant, say, a 30-day continuance?"
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2335.301,2335.781,"No, Your Honor."
1995.95-6510,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2349.492,2354.504,Do you think there's anything... the lawyer for the defendant did say he was unprepared to meet the evidence.
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2355.295,2355.993,That's correct.
1995.95-6510,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2355.993,2362.099,Do you think there's anything in the record that suggests that the judge would have granted a continuance if he'd been specifically asked for it?
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2362.099,2370.815,"I don't think that there's anything that suggests that he would not have granted the continuance, but I think the shoe has to be on the other foot."
1995.95-6510,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2370.815,2379.01,"I mean, he does have a duty to terminate the proceeding as promptly as he can with a sitting jury right there, and if he thinks the evidence is admissible, as he ruled, why would he grant the continuance?"
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2379.01,2384.655,"If the defense said, we haven't had enough time to marshal rebuttal for this evidence, and we think--"
1995.95-6510,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2384.655,2387.747,"And then he'd say, how much time do you need, and the judge... and he probably would have said, I need at least 30 days, wouldn't he?"
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2387.747,2388.118,--Well--
1995.95-6510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2388.118,2389.269,Or he could have given him 3 days.
1995.95-6510,1,31636,john_h_mclees,,2389.269,2399.598,"--If you take Mr. Gray at his word, he would have said, Your Honor, no amount of preparation time would ever be adequate to meet this, because that's what they said in their State habeas corpus petition."
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3156.695,3189.377,"The respondent has not contended that the request or lack of a request expressly for a continuance, or the failure to have developed any information about the Sorrells crime after sentencing, or before sentencing, after the jury verdict, constitutes an adequate and independent State court ground for this Court to observe, because there are no cases that so state."
1995.95-6510,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3201.663,3203.015,"Well, do you feel we should be deciding that issue?"
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3203.015,3204.016,Pardon?
1995.95-6510,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3204.016,3210.741,"Do you feel that that is a decision that we should make as to whether, in fact, it would constitute a bar, or wouldn't constitute a bar?"
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3210.741,3212.443,I don't think it's in the cas.
1995.95-6510,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3212.443,3212.944,Okay.
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3229.624,3230.545,I don't recall.
1995.95-6510,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3272.932,3275.403,"Why didn't they make that argument on habeas, then, on State habeas?"
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3276.735,3277.125,Well--
1995.95-6510,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3277.125,3278.194,--no amount of time would have done us any good?
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3278.194,3278.945,--Well--
1995.95-6510,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3278.945,3279.496,That's what they said.
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3280.087,3281.167,--I think... no.
1995.95-6510,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3281.167,3282.289,That's what they said.
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3282.289,3288.323,"I know what that says, and I think that that was hyperbole about how devastating the case was about Sorrells."
1995.95-6510,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3293.285,3295.067,I don't think it was hyperbole.
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3300.031,3300.522,Absolutely.
1995.95-6510,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3300.522,3303.664,I don't think it would have made any difference to the defense if it had 3 more days.
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3303.664,3304.555,I think that--
1995.95-6510,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3304.555,3319.685,"I think they wanted above all things to keep that evidence out, and it's very important, it seems to me, that we not let an argument that wasn't made, a request that was not made to the States, later be made to Federal courts when it turns out that the trial strategy employed by the defense has not produced the result desired."
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3319.685,3326.37,"--They wanted it excluded, but if they had the evidence that was unearthed in the Federal district court, it would have been a powerful tool against it."
1995.95-6510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3329.61,3331.443,"Mr. Olive, can I ask you kind of a question about Virginia law?"
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3340.559,3343.672,"--At the time of this trial, there was no threshold."
1995.95-6510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3343.672,3344.62,No threshold at all.
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3344.62,3348.083,"No, and now there's no threshold, but there is a notice requirement."
1995.95-6510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3350.156,3356.16,"But could they put in, and just say give notice... I'm going to serve notice that I'm going to prove that the Unabomber committed a lot of crimes?"
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3356.16,3356.819,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-6510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3356.819,3357.54,That would be enough?
1995.95-6510,2,36425,mark_e_olive,,3357.54,3358.502,"Yes, Your Honor."
