1996.96-491,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-491, Inter-Modal Rail Employees Association v. The Santa Fe Railway."
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,46.195,49.731,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-491,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,105.833,117.791,"Mr. Schwartz, is it true that this employer could not use the change route that you say could have been used to accomplish this purpose?"
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,127.933,139.824,"Justice Ginsburg, these benefits were contractually vested as part of a Nation-wide multiemployer bargaining pattern with the Teamsters Union."
1996.96-491,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,139.824,144.359,That... so you are... the answer to my question is there was no amendment route here--
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,144.359,144.894,No.
1996.96-491,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,144.894,146.66,--because it was a multiemployer plan.
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,156.785,169.093,"It would be possible only if they were willing and able to go back and bargain for a change in the contractually agreed benefits and then, pursuant to that, make the necessary--"
1996.96-491,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,169.093,178.699,But the same thing that you are calling a conspiracy and... could have been done were this only a single employer plan as distinguished from a multiemployer plan.
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,178.699,187.654,"--I do not believe that's correct, because we're still dealing with the element of the contractual vesting of the benefits, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.96-491,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.654,191.089,"Mr. Schwartz, some of us are having difficulty in hearing you."
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,192.541,195.077,"Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, I will attempt to."
1996.96-491,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,195.377,205.183,"Now, if there were no union agreement the law clearly allows the employer to just get rid of these welfare benefits under the plan."
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,206.016,210.003,"--Provided that there is appropriate compliance with the amendment procedures, yes."
1996.96-491,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,210.003,221.043,"Right, and the problem here is that there is a union agreement under which the... under the terms of which the employer must provide these benefits."
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,222.061,231.416,"That's certainly an element in our contention, that they could not legally have gone about doing this had they not resorted to this subterfuge."
1996.96-491,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,231.416,241.872,"Well, they could have legally done it for purposes of the ERISA statute, but in so doing, would have violated the union agreement."
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,241.872,243.158,They would have run afoul--
1996.96-491,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.158,243.491,Is that right?
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,243.491,243.958,--Yes.
1996.96-491,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,243.958,270.041,"Well, then you're saying in effect that they could do in a... with a single employer plan, no contrary collective bargaining agreement, they could do in two steps what you're saying they can't do in one step here, because number 1, they could simply eliminate the benefits, and having eliminated the benefits they could then eliminate their division or fire all those employees who had been getting the benefits, and so the different... it seems to me that your argument is a very formalistic argument."
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,270.041,278.481,"Justice Souter, I believe that we need to make a proviso... and I believe that the Government may talk about this."
1996.96-491,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,292.491,299.895,"Well, but why is it a discriminatory purpose simply to say I am... you know that they can be eliminated, period, can't they?"
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,315.302,317.271,"--As a general proposition, yes."
1996.96-491,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,317.271,317.538,All right.
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,337.684,344.755,"We're dealing with a situation here, what is generally called a fire and hire situation."
1996.96-491,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,354.296,357.248,"Yes, but they... on your theory I guess they didn't."
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,359.95,363.902,"--Well, I think it's a great deal more complicated than that."
1996.96-491,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,368.888,388.516,"But if they wanted to go to the... oh, you are quite right there's a countervailing sort of political consideration within the marketplace because you then end up with a bunch of employees who are mad, but if, as a matter of law, they want to accept that burden, they can... the employer could do that and couldn't have... could have done it here, I take it, is that right?"
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,388.516,396.622,Certainly I do not think it is correct that the employer here could have done it without modification of their contract.
1996.96-491,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,396.622,399.074,"All right, because you had a CBA, yes."
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,399.391,400.208,That's absolutely correct.
1996.96-491,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,400.208,402.693,May I ask this question?
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,418.302,418.669,Justice Stevens--
1996.96-491,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,418.669,420.154,Which is your view?
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,421.104,427.491,--We believe that the rights are contractually vested for the duration of the collective bargaining agreement.
1996.96-491,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,428.843,431.259,"Oh, I see, being vested in an unusual sense."
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,431.259,431.759,--Yes.
1996.96-491,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,431.759,434.711,"And if you had a vested right, why don't you just sue to recover that right?"
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,446.185,448.335,Yes.
1996.96-491,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.335,450.387,And I'm not quite clear exactly what your position is on that.
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,450.387,458.742,"The position is that they were vested for a limited period under the terms of the CBA, Justice Stevens."
1996.96-491,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,458.742,458.992,All right.
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,472.05,472.586,Well--
1996.96-491,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,472.586,475.002,--the right in the future if he wants to go to the dentist it will be paid?
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,475.002,480.49,"--It's important to understand that within the context of the CBA, of course, we're dealing with section 301."
1996.96-491,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,492.048,514.828,"Well, Mr. Schwartz, the question presented in your petition for certiorari is based entirely, as I would read the question, on section 510 of ERISA, and that certainly was the basis for the Ninth Circuit's decision, and some of my colleagues I think are expressing the view what has the collective bargaining agreement and all that got to do with it if you're claiming under section 510?"
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,514.828,517.53,We are claiming exclusively under section 510.
1996.96-491,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,524.269,527.887,Those are kind of weasel words.
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,538.194,551.436,I believe the collective bargaining agreement has to do with evaluating the respondent's arguments relating to targeting their claim for a judicially crafted exception to section 510.
1996.96-491,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,551.436,561.144,"Well, as I read the respondent's brief they no longer support the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit in that respect, or at least they say you don't have to read the Ninth Circuit opinion in that view."
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,561.144,568.148,Our understanding is that they no longer support the Ninth Circuit's rationale for the decision in the case.
1996.96-491,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,568.148,593.865,"You mentioned something about the bankrupt Teamsters Union, and as I understand it both the old employer, the Santa Fe group, and the new employer, the ITS, both were units that had Teamsters representing the workers."
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,594.698,608.708,"These workers in large part were given a last minute opportunity to apply for reemployment with the substitute employer, respondent Internal Services."
1996.96-491,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,614.861,617.813,Is it... was it the same Local in both cases?
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,617.813,620.432,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it was."
1996.96-491,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,620.432,625.884,"And the union has not taken any position throughout these proceedings, these 510 proceedings?"
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,625.884,626.586,None whatsoever.
1996.96-491,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,626.586,639.827,"Strange, when you, whether for background or whatever reason, talk about labor law rights, and the union has not been heard from."
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,639.827,648.166,"I believe it has to do with the internal Teamster struggles locally in Los Angeles and nationally, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.96-491,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,648.166,660.64,"Well, what health and welfare benefits were actually reduced as a result of the restructuring of the work at Hobart Yard?"
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,660.64,664.961,The health insurance coverage was dramatically reduced.
1996.96-491,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,664.961,669.663,"Okay, but not for any coverage for things that had already occurred."
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,676.083,680.904,"It occurred within a matter of a space of less than 2 weeks, Justice O'Connor."
1996.96-491,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,680.904,691.195,But we aren't talking about people who had incurred an injury and wanted medical benefits.
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,697.432,708.304,"We... Justice O'Connor, we're talking about people who enjoyed for a period of at least 1 year longer before the implementation of this transaction an ongoing coverage of entire medical care."
1996.96-491,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,708.304,715.477,"Well, they had health insurance, but we're not talking about people who had gotten sick and incurred medical bills already, and then they weren't paid."
1996.96-491,0,40498,richard_e_schwartz,,718.679,729.285,As far as we are aware the multiemployer health plan which was administered principally by the union management group continued to pay properly accrued claims up until--
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1201.608,1202.091,Yes.
1996.96-491,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1227.176,1231.127,"Well, the respondent seems to pretty well agree with this much of your argument."
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1249.624,1257.361,"In our view, generally that situation would not show proof of the prohibited purpose, with one caveat."
1996.96-491,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1270.87,1272.937,"No, I'm assuming none of that... none of that."
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1278.924,1280.941,--In our view that would not be covered.
1996.96-491,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1297.636,1298.436,This happens all the time?
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1298.436,1328.322,"This is a very common scenario, where an employer has offered health care coverage with particular coverage levels, and when an employee becomes ill, although the employer would be free generally to amend the plan to eliminate coverage for an illness that seems too expensive or burdensome, instead, the employee keeps the plan in place with respect to other employees but discharges the employee to interfere with the attainment of the right to claim coverage under the plan."
1996.96-491,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1328.322,1333.476,"If you told me those are real life situations that happen often, you've answered a question I was about to ask."
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1345.617,1346.117,That--
1996.96-491,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1346.117,1353.389,--because I didn't know... the Chief Justice gave a hypothetical of a company that has a health plan but you only come under it after 1 year.
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1381.171,1383.623,"--It might with an experience-related plan, that's right."
1996.96-491,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1383.623,1392.646,And so the employer might have a motive to get rid of the employee who has a child that would cost a lot of health care benefits in the future.
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1392.646,1393.312,That's exactly right.
1996.96-491,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1393.312,1394.228,And that does happen.
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1394.228,1402.768,"And that motive would arise even with the prospect of the medical care being undergone, and therefore before the right had itself accrued and become--"
1996.96-491,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1402.768,1403.368,But Ms. Pillard--
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1403.368,1404.201,--an enforceable right under the plan.
1996.96-491,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1404.201,1420.711,"--It wouldn't be a violation... if I understand your interpretation correctly, it wouldn't be a violation if you fire the employee after the child has already received some benefits, or if you fire the employee who himself has a serious condition after he's already gotten some of the benefits."
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1420.711,1421.913,That would be a violation--
1996.96-491,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.913,1422.33,That would be.
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1422.33,1425.531,"--Justice Scalia, under the first clause of section 510--"
1996.96-491,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1425.531,1426.314,Ms. Pillard--
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1426.314,1427.649,--which prohibits discharge for the purpose--
1996.96-491,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1427.649,1429.016,--Attaining--
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1429.016,1430.435,--as a result of exercising a right.
1996.96-491,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1430.435,1431.968,--Of exercising a right.
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1481.118,1492.092,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg, and I do want to get to this case, but I would note that as a prudential matter we don't think the Court should reach the alternative grounds, because they were not argued in the court of appeals."
1996.96-491,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1497.211,1501.282,But aren't they troubling... isn't that issue troubling courts all over the land?
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1501.282,1508.868,"In fact, there's very little development on the issue in the courts of appeals, and so that's one of the reasons that we think the Court need not read that issue, but I do want to address that--"
1996.96-491,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1508.868,1511.97,"Well, but the question presented certainly covers that issue."
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1511.97,1516.374,"--As a... yes, I think you're right that it is encompassed, it's fairly encompassed within the question presented."
1996.96-491,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1516.374,1546.393,"And if we accept the argument... assuming that, and if we accept the argument or the distinction that I thought you were drawing before, that distinction seemed to be that the... at least with respect to welfare benefits violation or not turned on whether there was a specific employee in mind, whether there was a specific accrual of benefit in mind, and if that's the case, then I suppose what the employer did here would be perfectly permissible under the statute."
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1546.393,1553.964,"Justice Souter, in our view the core case includes the case where the employer has a specific employee in mind, but it also includes our case."
1996.96-491,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1556.682,1563.07,"Well, if it includes our case, then why do we bother about the specificity of the employee?"
1996.96-491,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1563.07,1571.409,--It's important to note that the court of appeals held that there was a claim for interference with pension benefits without any additional allegations beyond a general allegation of purpose.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1778.287,1782.839,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-491,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1823.566,1851.233,"Well, Mr. Holzhauer, you take the position that the employer may decide that the cost of welfare benefits under the Railway Labor Workers Act is just too expensive, and if we can get rid of that whole requirement, we will be better off economically, and so we'll have this termination here."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1851.233,1852.418,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.96-491,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1852.418,1855.62,And that that is not prohibited by section 510.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1855.62,1856.12,That's correct.
1996.96-491,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1872.147,1879.402,So what do we do with the attainment... for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right language in 510?
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1879.402,1899.899,"Well, the attainment language, interfering with the attainment of any right to which a participant may become entitled talks about becoming eligible, or in our view refers to becoming eligible, arriving at, or attaining a ripe old age is the way Black's defined it, citing some old cases, reaching or becoming eligible for a benefit."
1996.96-491,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1912.707,1916.092,So the act has to be specific to the employee?
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1940.124,1941.809,"I think that's generally correct, although I would say this."
1996.96-491,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1973.947,1977.899,But I don't see how this squares with your attainment argument.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2008.37,2014.191,"Well, I think that could quite likely be a violation of the exercising clause of section 510."
1996.96-491,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2032.503,2034.319,But isn't it equally clear... let me just be sure I get one thing clear.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2034.319,2034.636,Sure.
1996.96-491,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2034.636,2048.161,"That if you took my hypothetical and said, instead of health benefits, we're concerned that 90 percent of these people are about to reach 20 years of service and therefore have vested benefits, and you took out the whole division and substituted with a contract, that would clearly violate it, would it not?"
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2048.161,2048.661,That would be correct.
1996.96-491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.771,2115.405,But why is that any different?
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2120.342,2121.575,It's not like a lot of--
1996.96-491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2121.575,2126.245,--and you said earlier that if you have a lot of individual people who are about to vest--
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2126.245,2127.145,--Right.
1996.96-491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2127.145,2129.911,--that would be a violation if you closed down that plant.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2138.251,2150.158,"The reason why I think the Gavelette kind of situation, where people are about to vest, is different is because it focuses on the fact that a large number of people are about to attain eligibility for a benefit."
1996.96-491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.926,2153.043,"There's an exercise clause as well, as you've just acknowledged."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2153.043,2153.643,--There is--
1996.96-491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.643,2154.412,It's not just that clause.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2155.645,2165.151,"--There is an exercising clause here, and perhaps one could make an argument that if a particular group of employees were exercising their benefits in a way that were different from other groups, or so forth."
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2177.142,2194.253,"Suppose Joe Jones is a person who, the employer looks one day and says, I'm afraid that fellow is going to get wisdom teeth pulled out, and before he even thinks about it, I'm going to cancel this benefit in his plan, which is there, before he gets the wisdom tooth problem."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2205.478,2206.045,No.
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.045,2206.578,Why not?
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2206.578,2207.013,"No, he hasn't."
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.013,2207.48,Why not?
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2207.48,2221.773,"Attainment of a right to which an employee or a participant may become entitled to, that language, and using that language, and considering that language in light of the particular context Congress was concerned with, refers to becoming eligible for a benefit."
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2221.773,2240.401,"Is there any reason... assuming you could read it either way, and... I mean, I don't think it's contrary to English to say, I have a right to $2,000 of dental expenses if I get wisdom teeth pulled out, and my employer, before I have any toothache, says I'm going to fire him."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2249.524,2249.874,Yes.
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2249.874,2252.459,"So I mean, it's more natural to say obtaining a right."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2252.459,2252.859,Yes.
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2252.859,2253.926,But you can say attaining a right.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2253.926,2254.428,Well--
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2254.428,2255.661,"It's not English, not bad English."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2264.767,2271.836,"--Well, first of all I think that flip from attaining or obtaining is very interesting, because I think that is one of the differences between the kind of language we're using here."
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2288.898,2292.5,"No, but I mean, why wouldn't, as long as... you know, I mean, these things are written in Congress."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2298.921,2300.19,"Well, it applies--"
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2300.19,2301.323,And unless there's some reason why--
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2301.323,2301.756,--Sure.
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2301.756,2304.058,"--And it applies in my situation, the toothache situation."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2307.76,2310.062,"Well, it applies in welfare situations."
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2334.494,2337.113,And then what they've said--
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2337.113,2337.563,--Sure.
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2337.563,2340.498,"--I just would like your response on that point, is sure, you have a point."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2349.504,2350.137,Well--
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2350.137,2350.789,Reduce the benefits.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2362.346,2372.036,"--Well, of course, there's nothing in section 510 that talks about employers being required to amend or terminate plans, but in many situations that's not going to be practically possible."
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2392.365,2395.984,"So if you want to have this right, you work it out with the union."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2397.417,2397.936,Sure.
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.936,2398.953,"Well, all right."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2406.625,2406.959,Sure.
1996.96-491,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2501.087,2521.75,"--Mr. Holzhauer, I take it from your argument, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that the reasoning you've just developed, the motive is simply to cut cost, not to retaliate against any employees, would apply to pensions that haven't yet vested as well as health and welfare arrangements, is that right?"
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2521.75,2534.558,"It would apply to pension benefits generally in the sense that, suppose we had a workforce that had vested pensions, or not vested pensions, but were just accruing pension benefits rateably over time."
1996.96-491,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2549.068,2552.77,So you're rejecting the Ninth Circuit line in two ways.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2559.423,2562.106,No.
1996.96-491,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2562.106,2569.695,"No, and that as far as the pension plan goes, the Ninth Circuit was wrong, although you didn't take a cross-appeal."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2569.695,2589.942,"Well, the Ninth Circuit held... again, the Ninth Circuit's treatment of both of these issues was rather cursory, so it's really hard to understand exactly what their reasoning was, but quoting Ingersoll-Rand, the Ninth Circuit held that 510 protects plan participants from termination motivated by an employer's desire to prevent a pension from vesting."
1996.96-491,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2662.055,2676.648,"Well, do you say that it covers the individual situation, where the employer foresees that a given employee is going to be very costly in terms of medical care, either the employee or a member of the employee's family?"
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2676.648,2680.016,"If the employee is already eligible for those benefits, and--"
1996.96-491,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2680.016,2684.32,"Well, the employee is covered by a health plan."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2684.32,2684.67,--Right.
1996.96-491,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2684.92,2691.141,"The employee has a child, and the child then is diagnosed as having a very serious--"
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2691.141,2691.441,Right.
1996.96-491,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2691.741,2699.93,"--medical condition that is going to cost megabucks, and the employer says, I don't want to have that effect on my health costs."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2700.797,2704.817,I think under those circumstances the employer would already be eligible for those benefits.
1996.96-491,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2705.917,2708.935,"Not eligible, will become--"
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2708.935,2709.269,--No--
1996.96-491,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2709.269,2715.106,--eligible when the child goes to the doctor for surgery.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2715.106,2725.481,"--I think the attainment clause talks about whether the employer... the employee will become eligible for health insurance, will become eligible for dental insurance, will become eligible for a pension, or a vested pension."
1996.96-491,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2727.597,2728.733,Just answer my question.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2728.733,2728.999,--Sure.
1996.96-491,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2728.999,2737.372,"Under that circumstance, is section 510 violated if the employer says, you're fired because I don't want that obligation in the--"
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2737.372,2737.922,Yes.
1996.96-491,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2749.579,2755.899,"--I'm not sure that the exercise clause would kick in either, because the child hasn't gone to the hospital for the surgery yet."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2755.899,2769.141,"--Well, I think that a strong argument can be made, and it's not involved in this case at all, but a strong argument can be made certainly that... well, clearly it would violate section 510 to fire that employee just after they file that claim, because they filed that expensive claim."
1996.96-491,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2794.272,2798.743,But they're not... they're often less than what the plan would give.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2798.743,2801.862,--Often... more often they get exactly what the plan gives.
1996.96-491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2808.016,2822.609,"Mr. Holzhauer, given your response to Justice O'Connor's question, of what use is the application of the attainment clause to plans other than pension plans?"
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2822.609,2836.583,"Justice Scalia, earlier you asked whether it was ever... whether it was common to have plans that allow you to get health insurance after being there for a year, or after passing a probationary period, which might be 90 days."
1996.96-491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.247,2861.401,"And you think that's what Congress was worried about, that there are a lot of employers who keep--"
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2861.401,2862.484,I think--
1996.96-491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2862.484,2865.269,"--90 days, firing people after 89 days?"
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2865.269,2881.647,"--I think Congress was concerned about vesting pension benefits, but Congress talked about employee benefit plans, and I think there could be analogous circumstances under which section 510's attainment clause would apply to welfare benefits as well, and that's one very analogous circumstance."
1996.96-491,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2881.647,2883.547,But you insist it applies only to eligibility.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2891.753,2894.122,I was talking about circumventing the exercise clause.
1996.96-491,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2894.122,2894.872,The exercise clause.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2909.632,2926.891,"Well, I think the exercising clause was intended to deal with a kind of individual... not global plant closing or plan design situation, but an individual situation where you were focusing and targeting a particular individual and saying, that person's going to be too expensive."
1996.96-491,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2958.378,2960.48,So do it on the specific employee basis.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2960.48,2964.366,"The specific employee, rather than a global, cost-based organizational change."
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2977.157,2980.609,Which clause is it that covers if my pension benefit's vested.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2980.609,2981.192,Yes.
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2981.192,2982.026,I'm entitled to it.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2982.026,2982.478,Right.
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2982.478,2990.715,"And by the way, if I worked 2 more years and have a promotion, it doubles in amount, so they fire me so I don't get the doubling in amount."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2994.0,2994.551,Well--
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2994.551,2997.57,"Is that failure to attain a benefit, or do you think they could do it?"
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,2997.57,3011.145,"--I think that there certainly... there are circumstances... generally speaking, pension benefits are required under the statute to accrue rateably over time, not to have these kinds of cliffs in which you're entitled under the plan to additional money."
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3011.145,3012.58,You see what I'm driving at.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3012.58,3012.947,Yes.
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3027.923,3029.542,What you're saying the Court did say there.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3029.542,3029.925,That's right.
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3029.925,3030.892,It's an attainment matter.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3030.892,3031.425,That's an attainment matter.
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3031.425,3041.516,"And therefore the normal thing in getting an amount of money when a certain event happens under a plan that has vested, at least in the pension area, seems to be to call it an attainment."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3041.516,3042.132,Right.
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3042.132,3049.67,"Well, if you follow the same reasoning here, you're going to say getting that amount of money under a plan that has vested when the toothache occurs--"
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3049.67,3052.122,"No, no."
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3055.307,3055.64,--All right.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3055.89,3059.394,An employee who was not entitled to an early retirement benefit.
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3059.394,3059.861,All right.
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3068.515,3068.967,Yes.
1996.96-491,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3068.967,3075.954,"And maybe you'd be better to do it with facts, or with amici, or whatever, but if you did make a point about it--"
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3075.954,3098.236,"Well, I think the purpose of the overall statute was to deal with the vesting circumstance, and then to prevent people from circumventing someone from vesting, and I think when there are analogous circumstances like someone about to become eligible for early retirement benefits, under those circumstances that would be a similar eligibility threshold, and crossing that eligibility threshold would be involved, but nothing like that is going on here."
1996.96-491,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3099.769,3105.14,"--So are you saying that the D.C. Circuit approach in the Andes case, they didn't even need to get to anything like, what does the word discharge mean?"
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3105.14,3107.092,"Yes, I agree with that."
1996.96-491,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3165.594,3171.782,Would your attainment test have resolved the Andes case in favor of the employer?
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3171.782,3172.867,"Yes, it would have."
1996.96-491,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3172.867,3182.306,"I wonder, because in paragraph 30 they specifically argue, or allege that benefits... they suffered a reduction of benefits from their pension plan and health and welfare plans."
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3184.675,3185.108,Yes.
1996.96-491,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3185.108,3188.877,"And how do you... I mean, if that's true, that's a vested right that was--"
1996.96-491,2,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3188.877,3201.886,"Well, they claim that they suffered welfare... they claim that they were... that Santa Fe took this action in order to reduce a wide spectrum of benefits, salary, vacation, sick leave benefits, things that are not ERISA-included."
1996.96-491,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3201.886,3207.188,--It covered at least some hypothetical cases of individual vestings.
