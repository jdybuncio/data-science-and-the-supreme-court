1956.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,760.103,764.35,Why do you say out-of-state?
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,764.35,768.4,"I say that, sir, because the statute --"

1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,775.777,775.983,You mean (Voice Overlap) --
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,775.983,787.468,"I said out-of-state and then I -- in a series I said non-local, meaning to say that this is not confined to out-of-state and in Your Honor's point if I may presume to say so is very well taken."
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,798.037,798.83,Your argument --
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,798.83,798.894,-- is your interstate commerce.
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,798.894,813.989,"-- on this point in short is that the State can do what it will so long as it confines activities within the State, but you say even though it's a fence around Opelika as regard to Mobile or Montgomery on (Inaudible), it may do that absolute regard to Georgia?"
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,813.989,814.691,"Well, I would say --"
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,814.691,815.074,Isn't that your position?
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,815.074,848.144,"-- to Your Honor that of course we have here a City of Opelika tax and I will point out to Your Honors that in the Berwind-White opinion to which I want to refer in just a moment in Footnote 11, this Court through Mr. Justice Stone adverted to a law review article, your Berwind-White opinion was in 1940, adverted to a law review article pointing out that there were more than 800 municipal flatsum license taxes designed for the purpose of keeping out non-local competition."

1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,851.477,852.185,-- you're interested in Georgia --
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,852.185,852.466,That's right.
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,852.466,853.111,-- and Ohio.
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,853.111,853.782,That's right.
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,853.782,854.08,All right.
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,854.08,854.792,That's right.
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,954.999,971.204,"Suppose it also includes a flat tax, the same flat tax on the local grocery or on the local wholesalers sending to the cities such as one in Opelika, in the local little corner groceries."
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,971.204,971.685,That --
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,971.685,983.451,Would -- would the Commerce Clause preclude the imposition of a flat tax of precisely the same amount on the purely local man?
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,983.451,984.405,"I think, if Your Honor please --"

1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,984.888,986.561,-- that it clearly would.
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,986.561,987.134,Pardon me?
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,987.134,988.428,I think it clearly would.
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,988.428,989.38,It would?
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,989.38,992.958,"It would, based on prior authority by this Court."
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,996.829,1001.08,Was the tax of the local fellow the same as the one that's imposed on the interstate (Voice Overlap) --
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1001.08,1004.864,It was on the -- it was in the -- in the Nippert case.
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1015.057,1015.33,"Well, --"
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1015.33,1015.509,"Yes, sir."
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1015.509,1018.156,-- it's already a differentiation.
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1018.156,1022.78,"Mr. Justice Black, I believe it was or Mr. Justice Douglas."
1956.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1067.35,1068.432,How could they do it?
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1068.432,1069.269,Pardon me?
1956.478,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1069.269,1070.366,How could they do it?
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1070.366,1090.402,"I should think they could do it, if Your Honor please, either by a compensating use or property tax or if they want to follow what is perhaps the invitation suggested by this Court in -- in its Berwind-White opinion by a sales tax on the sales in the jurisdiction even though they'd be interstate sales."
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1149.615,1155.709,You would have no trouble if a gross tax was imposed on the sales within the State by the outside?
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1155.709,1156.409,"No, sir."
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1156.409,1157.276,The out-of-state?
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1157.276,1158.295,"No, sir."
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1158.295,1158.418,That's --
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1158.418,1158.881,No.
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1158.881,1159.514,That's --
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1159.514,1160.219,That's what --
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1160.219,1175.113,"Now, I suppose the other thing is clear by our decisions that a mere license to do business just as -- they aren't outside, they come in and do business flat or the flat rate unrelated to the rest of the case."
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1175.676,1176.477,"No, sir."
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1179.165,1180.64,I'm not talking about -- I didn't say it measured --
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1180.64,1181.228,"No, sir."
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1184.67,1201.226,"Now, this is -- this is not -- not quite either of those, is it, for the simple -- this also would be bad if no outside or no -- if -- if there weren't equality between the Georgia and the Birmingham?"
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1202.923,1210.944,"No, these flatsum taxes had never -- I don't think ever been in terms of the discrimination between state and interstate commerce."
1956.478,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1343.955,1347.757,What was your page number in the 187 citation?
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1347.757,1350.794,That was 187 U.S.622.
1956.478,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1350.794,1352.67,Thank you.
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1352.67,1358.181,"And the Crenshaw case, if I may repeat Mr. Justice Douglas, was 227 U.S.389."
1956.478,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1358.181,1358.634,Thank you.
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1358.634,1367.393,"Now, these delivery cases -- in those cases when the tax is -- not the delivery but the solicitation cases."
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1372.782,1374.033,I think that's true.
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1377.501,1377.75,"No, but (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1377.75,1378.801,-- in an awful or bothersome but I'm just doing something.
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1378.801,1383.377,-- so that this was a means of getting permission to do business in the State?

1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1391.466,1393.516,"It's the same -- I think it's the same thing, it's in terms --"
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1393.516,1394.976,I'm just trying to find out what the --
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1394.976,1395.946,It's the same thing.
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1395.946,1399.071,-- what the events were without getting into the law.
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1399.071,1400.137,"Yes, sir, you're --"
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1400.137,1406.346,"That is if a -- if a fellow from Atlanta wants to ship in some grocery, what does he do?"
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1407.896,1411.516,He pays $250 and then he can ship for the balance of the year.
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1411.516,1412.951,"Well, when does he pay?"
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1412.951,1415.39,He pays that at the beginning of the year because under --
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1415.39,1418.26,That's if he's engaged in the business of sending in?
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1418.26,1419.043,"Yes, sir."
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1419.043,1429.279,"But suppose -- suppose the first, somebody discovers there's a grocery in Atlanta and he wants a good from them, what happens to state that concretely?"
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1429.279,1429.569,Concretely --
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1429.569,1439.01,"A grocery in -- in Opelika hears about a desirable wholesaler in Atlanta and he writes further, will you send me in the following goods?"
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1443.618,1458.06,"The wholesale grocer in Atlanta makes out his check for $250 to the City of Opelika and he pays on the barrelhead before he may make the shipment, and if he doesn't there's a penalty in Section D which is before Your Honors."
1956.478,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1458.06,1459.876,It doesn't get it?
1956.478,0,36749,m_r_schlesinger,,1459.876,1476.421,"Well -- now, in furtherance of this proposition that although a tax on delivery is -- although a tax on solicitation is good, a tax on delivery as in this case is all right."
1956.478,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1676.329,1678.023,Mr. Cope.
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,1678.023,1682.234,I may -- may it please the Court.
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2200.009,2213.673,"If no tax were paid on this, if the good were just brought in from Georgia and unload it at some grocery store in Opelika, could the city -- is there a penalty provision for this (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2213.673,2215.821,"There -- there is a penalty provision, yes."
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2215.821,2217.006,What is penalty?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2217.006,2218.328,A penalty?
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2222.508,2222.766,"Well now, would the --"
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2222.766,2223.965,-- a $100 in municipal corporation.
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2223.965,2229.043,Would the grocery store in Opelika -- could you go after the grocery store that received the good?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2229.043,2232.499,"No, sir, they -- they would not be the violator in this case."
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2232.499,2233.373,So --
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2233.373,2241.241,This -- this -- the -- the appellant would be the person who was unloading and delivering and who was making the change of possession --
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2241.241,2241.604,And that --
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2241.604,2244.427,-- the local grocery store would simply be accepting possession.
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2244.427,2247.774,And that's what makes this very different from Berwind and White.
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2252.83,2257.987,"Yes, but in -- in -- I believe that -- that is your so-called sales tax of course --"
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2257.987,2259.171,Was that -- but that was --
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2259.171,2261.6,-- which is in a different category.
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2266.673,2267.553,Yes.
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2267.553,2271.324,-- it had provisions whereby it might be passed on.
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2279.392,2283.712,Would you mind telling me how you differentiate the Nippert case from this?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2283.712,2288.342,The Nippert case is a case on solicitation.
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2306.167,2310.529,You mean the Nippert tax would have to be paid whether business has got in (Voice Overlap) --
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2310.529,2310.899,Whether you --
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2310.899,2311.582,-- or not?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2311.582,2323.709,"Whether you ever sell anything, whether you ever deliver anything you are responsible for that tax if you so much as go to a man and solicit his business."
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2323.709,2332.824,"But -- but if he -- if he's been getting business and stuff they send in and then the flat tax called, you say that's different?"
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2332.824,2333.823,"Perhaps, that is correct, Your Honor."
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2333.823,2334.181,That's the point.
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2334.181,2351.492,"We say that -- we say that the tax is levied on -- on a local incident which is at the end of the journey in interstate commerce, that is the local incident of delivery which is the change of possession and which a taxable event."
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2351.492,2357.453,But you don't tax the $200 on that because thereafter you can do business for a year?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2357.453,2361.409,It's -- it's on all deliveries which may be made during the year.
1956.478,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2370.368,2392.994,"So talking in terms of the cases about tax event, the tax event isn't -- the tax event isn't completed or that's merely a condition on which the tax falls, namely, if he sends in any goods then he must pay $200, would lead to sending goods thereafter everyday on, how does he plead with that?"
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2392.994,2406.141,"Well, we might say it is a tax on the continuous incident of delivery but without change in possession and without a delivery within the municipal corporation, there can be not tax."
1956.478,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2406.141,2409.087,Suppose the railroad delivered?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2409.087,2422.774,"Now, I believe, Mr. Justice Black, that they have held in one of the cases and I -- and I think it was sales tax case and I -- I admit that I do not recall."
1956.478,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2888.891,2892.36,Doesn't the (Inaudible) it's too late to do that?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2892.36,2894.332,Not necessarily.
1956.478,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2910.054,2912.326,But from the limit of that?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2912.326,2915.484,There is a limit of course.
1956.478,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2935.109,2938.978,You just found in the middle of the brief then?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2938.978,2955.005,"I just found on the grounds of classification that -- that this is a valid classification, that in connection not for revenue, you can't justify the revenue but we justified under the exercise of the police powers."
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2955.005,2959.372,"Well, what -- what underlies the difference in classification?"
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,2959.372,2983.292,"The -- the fact that -- well, perhaps -- perhaps I -- I should, if I may give you an illustration which is not necessarily applies to West Point Wholesale Grocery Company, but which applies to transients in general."
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3035.12,3044.539,"Well, in that illustration you've given, I take it the Brooklyn rug dealer if he paid the $250 could ship in the shoddy rugs, couldn't he?"
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3044.539,3061.286,"He would have to -- he would to have to you, you have certain procedures in which you go to the -- in which you go to the clerk of course and you make your application, you make known all of your facts and you -- your police department has some opportunity to discuss it --"
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3061.286,3061.452,"Well, that --"
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3061.452,3065.291,"-- we know that that man is in town, we know that he is making sales, he is not --"
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3065.291,3065.557,And just what is --
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3065.557,3066.432,-- sleeping around.
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3066.432,3075.989,Just what is it that the out-of-town wholesale concern has to supply in the way of information?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3075.989,3087.136,"That -- that, Your Honor, I'm not prepared to say in the City of Opelika, it -- it varies from -- from city to city and I don't know if there is any -- any general rule."
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3087.136,3095.34,"Well, I mean is there anything in this ordinance that says anything except that you paid $250 if you're shipping in goods from out-of-town, we'll give you a license?"
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3095.34,3115.891,"I -- I do not think that record will disclose our answer to that for the simple reason that this was a part of a comprehensive ordinance which -- which covered the licenses of all businesses, all professions and trades and occupations and so forth and so on."
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3115.891,3124.899,Was there a difference in the burden of -- of municipal services in relation to an outsider than there is to a local merchant?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3124.899,3128.534,"I -- I would think -- I would think most definitely there is, Your Honor."
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3143.027,3150.032,"No, I mean in terms of -- in terms of municipal services, for example is there more fire service or a different fire --"
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3150.032,3151.616,"No, I --"
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3151.616,3151.708,-- service or different police service?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3151.708,3158.28,-- I wouldn't say that that was -- probably there is more prior service of course given to you -- to your local merchant (Voice Overlap) --
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3158.28,3159.276,How about police service?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3159.276,3160.88,-- established place of business.
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3160.88,3162.775,How about police service?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3162.775,3184.862,"I would say that the police service that she was on foot at least insofar -- of course insofar as protecting his place from breaking in.But insofar as protecting the public against irresponsible vendors, irresponsible tradesman, that your police -- your police problem is -- is quite a great problem."
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3184.862,3201.918,"Well, are -- are you suggesting that we should indulge a presumption that this higher rate, the out-of-towners is based upon the necessity for some kind of policing services to see that local residents of Opelika are not defrauded by out-of-towners?"
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3201.918,3204.5,"That is exactly a part of it, Your Honor, yes."
1956.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3212.514,3222.892,"Under the ordinance does anybody have in the City, have any right to any discretion to deny a license of this kind?"
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3222.892,3226.194,"Oh, yes, the -- the -- your mayor and -- and your city clerk duly --"
1956.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3226.194,3226.335,What --
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3226.335,3227.359,-- will have that discretion.
1956.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3227.359,3229.495,Under what circumstances does he --
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3229.495,3240.665,"If -- if the person or a person of bad character, if he was financially irresponsible, if he was a known criminal, if --"
1956.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3240.665,3242.942,Is that in the ordinance?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3242.942,3248.913,I'll say I'm not completely sure about the entire text of the -- of the -- of this particular ordinance.
1956.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3251.619,3266.048,Don't you think that's a rather important thing as to whether or not there is discretion to either to grant or deny or whether this is a matter of right that a person would have upon paying the $250?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3266.048,3267.745,"It -- it's entirely possible, Your Honor."
1956.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3267.745,3269.972,If it's a police ordinance?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3269.972,3273.116,It's -- it is of course a combination of police ordinance.
1956.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3276.88,3280.112,I thought you said it could not be sustained as a revenue ordinance?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3280.112,3299.34,"Well, I mean your entire ordinance, it's -- it's a combination police of power, you -- you levy a -- you levy a license for revenue in order to carry out and to pay the expenses of your -- of your police action which is involved."
1956.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3304.694,3317.308,"Well, where will we find the discretionary power in any city officer to deny a license of this kind if a man pays this $250?"
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3317.308,3327.252,I -- I would hesitate to answer Your Honor but for the simple reason that I am not familiar with the ordinance in the -- in the City of Opelika in its entirety or one of this clause which is in controversy.
1956.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3327.252,3327.483,Would you (Voice Overlap) --
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3327.483,3336.726,"I know that in my -- in my local City of Union Springs, we certainly have that provision because I wrote it, Your Honor, and I'm quite sure that it's there."
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3336.726,3346.177,"Well, I -- I don't know Mr. Cope but apparently on -- in this complaint, we're given the full text of the ordinance which appears to be an amending ordinance incidentally."
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3346.177,3348.248,That -- that is Section 130.
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3385.009,3394.478,"Well, it may be but the difficulty I have is where factually, do you support the -- the classification."
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3394.478,3394.69,That -- that --
1956.478,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,3394.69,3397.693,Merely to say it's within the police power doesn't help us much.
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3397.693,3420.004,"That -- that, Your Honor, is -- is a question that we raised, is that where it is within the police power granted by the State and the burden rests upon the person who is challenging the ordinance to allege the facts and to show the facts that it is a discrimination or that it is an abuse or is an improper exercise."
1956.478,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3436.461,3436.788,Are you saying --
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3436.788,3438.017,-- that's the facts in.
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3438.017,3445.798,Would you make that same argument if this be instead of $250 were $2500?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3445.798,3451.839,"Well, I think, Your Honor, that's rather difficult to say."
1956.478,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3464.552,3465.906,That is that local residency tax.
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3465.906,3468.234,"That's local -- no, that's local residence."
1956.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3476.037,3479.302,He doesn't have to do it all in one little city.
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3479.302,3480.147,"No, that's --"
1956.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3480.147,3483.502,He might be doing it in 100 or 250 cities.
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3483.502,3484.714,"That's -- that's true, Your Honor."
1956.478,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3487.942,3496.952,He might send a consignment of less than $250 to your city -- a little city and that might be the only one that he would send during the year but he'd still have to pay $250 --
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3496.952,3503.83,"Well, I -- of course our great -- our great -- one of our great problems is your transient merchant."

1956.478,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3547.649,3561.877,Is the last part of your argument in page -- the last paragraph in the Courts opinion which held that the complaint as a complaint was not sufficient under the Alabama rules of procedure?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3561.877,3564.526,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1956.478,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3564.526,3568.616,They held that the complaint did not allege sufficient fact?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3568.616,3569.206,Did not allege any facts.
1956.478,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3569.206,3573.347,Support the conclusion that the pleader has been charged with unlawful discrimination.
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3573.347,3573.568,That is true.
1956.478,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3573.568,3578.153,As I understand it you are saying that -- and that was the basis of their rule --
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3578.153,3578.913,And was the basic reasoning --
1956.478,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3578.913,3579.958,-- in this case.
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3579.958,3584.803,"The Supreme Court of Alabama has never said, “Well, this is a valid or an invalid ordinance.”"
1956.478,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3584.803,3585.874,Then no trial of it?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3585.874,3586.714,"Then no trial, it was --"
1956.478,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3586.714,3588.583,It was dismissed on the complaint?

1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3652.692,3653.383,That's right.
1956.478,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3653.383,3660.363,"Or he could instead of amending his complaint, choose to rests on his allegation as being sufficient under the law?"
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3660.363,3661.304,That's right.

1956.478,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3664.743,3666.303,-- took it to the Court of Appeals.
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3666.303,3666.714,That's entirely correct.
1956.478,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3666.714,3670.826,That Court held that that complaint was not sufficient under Alabama procedure.

1956.478,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3673.663,3677.848,And you're -- you're arguing that the complaint was not sufficient?
1956.478,1,38905,r_e_l_cope,,3677.848,3686.828,We are arguing that it -- that it is not apparent on the face of the complaint that it is insufficient and that's the only ground in which they could possibly stand.
