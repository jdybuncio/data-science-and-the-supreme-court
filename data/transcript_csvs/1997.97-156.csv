1997.97-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.608,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97-156, Randon Bragdon v. Sidney Abbott."
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,10.108,14.991,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.97-156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,78.994,98.135,"Mr. McCarthy, may I ask you to clarify at the outset whether you recognize that once the symptoms are visible, what is now described as AIDS, once a person has that disease, that that would constitute a disability?"
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,98.135,118.848,"I think that's very likely, Your Honor, but our position is that the definition applies for disability, and the definition is when there's a physical or mental impairment and here we're talking about HIV, that substantial limits a major life activity, if that comes into play, then the person's disabled, then it seems very likely it would come into play if a person had visible symptoms of HIV disease."
1997.97-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,118.848,121.941,"You concede there is a physical impairment, or don't you?"
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,121.941,127.123,"I don't... we don't concede that, although we see the force of the respondents' argument on that issue."
1997.97-156,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,136.801,151.97,"I thought it was curious that the American Medical Association took the position that it is a physical impairment under the act from the beginning, and the dental association, on the other hand, takes the opposite view."
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,151.97,157.626,"Well, I'm not sure what position the dental association takes with regard to physical impairment."
1997.97-156,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,177.729,184.474,"Well, the act seems to go further, and say if someone is regarded as having the impairment it's covered."
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,184.474,202.456,"I think that the language of the act says, if someone is regarded as having such impairment, and when they say such impairment they're referring to an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, so the regarded as only comes into play if you have an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity."
1997.97-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,202.456,205.518,"Was that issue argued in the First Circuit, the regarded as?"
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,207.839,213.653,"In our view it wasn't really argued aggressively, but the issue has appeared."
1997.97-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.745,219.898,--Had it been raised in the district court?
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,219.898,226.392,"I believe the respondent believes that it has, and the record is somewhat ambiguous on that."
1997.97-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,226.392,228.145,Really a pretty skimpy record on that point.
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,228.145,229.664,There's a very skimpy record on that issue.
1997.97-156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,229.664,247.196,"But you are contending that a rational Congress would draw the line and exclude from this protection a person whose symptoms are not yet visible, yet include someone who would pose perhaps at least equal danger whose symptoms are visible?"
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,247.196,247.757,No.
1997.97-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,294.189,303.776,"Well, do you say that we have to focus on daily public and economic life activities, as oppose to the more private activities that are the... really the basis for the respondent's contention?"
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,303.776,319.826,"We get to that language when we look at reproduction as a major life activity, and there are sort of two parts of that, and the first part is, well, this... how do you get away from the idea that it's so major... obviously reproduction is so major, it must be a major life activity."
1997.97-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.399,376.174,Are you relying on the regulations issued by the Department of Justice or those issued by EEOC earlier?
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,376.174,387.994,"We're... I'm making reference to the Department of Justice title III regulations, but it's also important to make reference in the sense that I just described to the regulations that issued under the Rehabilitation Act and the Fair Housing Amendments Act."
1997.97-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.994,390.025,Can I ask... and are they identical in that--
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,390.025,393.458,They are either identical or essentially identical in that regard.
1997.97-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,393.458,401.322,"--What function does the Justice Department have under title III, other than issuing regulations?"
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,401.322,405.883,I'm not sure exactly what you mean.
1997.97-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.465,408.675,Do they do anything else under title III?
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,408.675,409.376,--under title III.
1997.97-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.376,412.338,Do they administer title III in any sense?
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,412.338,414.031,I'm not aware of the Department of Justice--
1997.97-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,414.031,443.82,"Suppose you have a Congress that's been taken over by the Republicans after 40 years of Democratic control and Democratic judicial appointments and Congress, this Republican Congress does not like the kind of decisions that Democratic judges are going to be making, can Congress say that the interpretation of statutes shall be governed by regulations issued by the Department of Justice?"
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,446.983,453.457,"--It certainly was unusual, and we don't... and we don't really rely on it in that sense."
1997.97-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,484.719,487.08,The whole Congress said that through the committee report.
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,487.08,489.181,--They attempted to say it through the committee reports.
1997.97-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,489.181,490.302,--on those reports.
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,490.302,494.424,"Oh, no, certainly the whole Congress did not, but the committee reports made that argument."
1997.97-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,549.541,571.504,"If you stipulate that 3 or 4 years hence it is highly likely that major life activities of the kind you've been discussing will be affected, is the person disabled, have disability within the meaning of the act in the first year, when we know that it's inevitable that there will be an effect 3 or 4 years down the line?"
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,571.504,576.72,"Well, of course, in a sense it... we think of it as inevitable, but recent--"
1997.97-156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,576.72,577.389,Let's assume that it's--
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,577.389,588.468,"--But if we assume it's inevitable the definition of disability certainly does not seem to attempt to affect future disabilities, which is the question that that raises."
1997.97-156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,623.911,630.466,"--But it doesn't mean, does it, the major life activity, that the life activity has to be related to the performance of the job?"
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,639.61,642.431,I think that's correct.
1997.97-156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,642.431,642.962,All right.
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,643.843,644.744,I'm having a little bit of difficulty adjusting to a--
1997.97-156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,644.744,661.067,"--If that's correct, then let's take a person who had some eating disorder, or couldn't... that's not on the list, I don't think, eating disorders, but people are terribly frightened of getting it, so he can't eat except in very, very unusual ways, a very serious problem."
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,664.699,670.103,--I think it's entirely possible that eating is a major life--
1997.97-156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,670.103,670.834,"Well, I would think so."
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,686.903,696.55,--But that argument escapes from the idea that the term major life activities incorporates a definition that's already bounded by the regulation.
1997.97-156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,696.55,698.233,"Well, the regulation didn't refer to eating."
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,700.053,700.643,No.
1997.97-156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,700.643,705.336,"And what about a person who couldn't feel, some unusual disease where he can't feel at all."
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,708.378,711.911,"The regulation says, such as, so it's not excluded."
1997.97-156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,711.911,712.461,Exactly.
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,712.461,713.102,But now--
1997.97-156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,713.102,730.673,"So if that's so, my question is, if you're willing to put in things that relate to feeling, things that relate to eating, things that relate to those things which are part of our ordinary human life, and if you also say that sexual activity is an ordinary part of human life, and an important part, why isn't that on there, too?"
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,730.673,733.495,--Because the test is not important.
1997.97-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,740.679,742.452,May I ask about the regulation... I'm a little puzzled.
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,750.429,751.511,--No.
1997.97-156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,762.115,767.639,"Well, the regulations specifically list HIV as a physical or mental impairment."
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,767.639,788.824,"--And it almost certainly is a physical or mental impairment, but a physical or mental impairment is different than a disability, and we know that it's classified, probably classified as a physical impairment, certainly if you follow the regulations, but the question is, is it a disability, and we get to... in order for it to be a disability, it has to be a physical impairment that substantially limits a major life activity."
1997.97-156,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,788.824,800.782,"You're saying... you're... you're referring, when you keep referring to the examples in the regs, to the one set out on page... in the appendix to your brief, 36.104--"
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,800.782,801.58,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-156,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,801.58,811.298,"--which has the examples, and I take it your argument is that all of those examples go to the capacity of an individual in effect to survive personally."
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,816.49,817.051,That's right.
1997.97-156,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,819.194,825.486,"So that's why you would pick up eating, but you would draw the line... one does not have to reproduce in order to survive."
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,825.486,826.818,--In a sense.
1997.97-156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,847.332,855.607,"What about sustaining oneself, the words you just used, including access to ordinary health care like going to the dentist?"
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,873.398,885.096,"I think it's arguable that if a person has a serious disease and the present medical regimen would include more visits to the office than perhaps some... not I, but somebody else makes."
1997.97-156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,885.096,892.031,"And that access is rendered more difficult, as this very case shows."
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,902.557,908.25,"Well, if that argument is, you're substantially limited in the ability to care for yourself--"
1997.97-156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,908.25,908.721,Yes.
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,908.721,914.385,"--Because you have to go to the doctor, first of all... or a dentist, first of all she's not substantially limited."
1997.97-156,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,931.776,940.433,Is there something in the record that indicates that someone in the position of Ms Abbott would have to go to the dentist more regularly than someone without that condition?
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,940.433,944.575,--There's nothing in the record that I'm aware of that would suggest dental care would fit under that rubric.
1997.97-156,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,944.575,947.098,But do I under... I may not understand you.
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,973.666,997.971,"I think that's correct, that the... you can't get at what is a disability by what is allegedly discrimination, but what I was trying to get at is, we're now talking about reproduction as a... we're now talking about caring for oneself as a major life activity, and we know it is a major life activity because it's on the list, and the AMA tries to put health care services under that, and our first argument is it really doesn't belong there."
1997.97-156,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1001.063,1002.204,Is others caring for one?
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,1002.204,1014.321,"--But the part that I was getting... attempting to get at was there is... you're not substantially limited in it simply because a single dentist says to you, I believe we should take additional precautions to treat you."
1997.97-156,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1041.05,1060.974,"But even if you put... and I realize you're not doing it, but even if you put reproduction within the approved list of activities that the statute is getting at, I take it you make a distinction between, let's say, a person who is infertile and a person who simply has HIV."
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,1060.974,1065.246,"--Ultimately you do, yes."
1997.97-156,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1065.246,1065.767,Yes.
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,1067.617,1091.154,"Well, if we're talking about HIV, the first question is, is it an impairment, and the regulation suggests that it is an impairment, and when we're talking about whether it substantially limits a major life activity, like being impotent or like being infertile, it has no relationship to this concept of day to day independent living."
1997.97-156,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1091.154,1099.229,"Yes, but let's assume we get over that point and we classify this as one of the activities that does, in fact, belong within the series of examples."
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,1099.229,1100.568,Reproduction?
1997.97-156,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1100.568,1101.239,Yes.
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,1123.834,1124.215,Right.
1997.97-156,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1124.215,1125.106,What is your distinction?
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,1125.106,1128.868,I'm afraid I've lost that distinction as we discussed now.
1997.97-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1134.374,1134.942,I don't understand your answer.
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,1136.955,1139.437,--I lost... I'm not aware of the distinction as I stand here.
1997.97-156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.437,1151.795,"You would think that if HIV... if the inability to reproduce because of HIV qualifies under the statute, the inability to reproduce because of impotence or sterility would also--"
1997.97-156,0,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,1151.795,1154.677,"That's correct, arguably."
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,1537.815,1541.458,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.97-156,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1601.207,1602.777,"Well, Mr. Klein, you say as noted in the committee reports."
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,1605.96,1618.388,"It's not the same as the statute, and I think that what is noted in the committee reports, which is the people with HIV are limited in major life activities, is consistent with the plain meaning of the... the phrase that Congress did choose."
1997.97-156,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1630.986,1632.276,"Well, why can they not?"
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,1722.767,1723.177,Yes.
1997.97-156,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1763.075,1766.756,"And the question is, why are those conditions moral conditions rather than physical conditions?"
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,1766.756,1772.57,"--Well, the... the limitation flows from the physical impairment of HIV."
1997.97-156,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1772.57,1773.111,No.
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,1788.681,1805.041,"Well, I think that a person is limited... a person cannot perform an activity under the same conditions as somebody without the impairment if... if, for example, they can transmit a deadly disease to a sexual partner, if they can infect their child, and also because--"
1997.97-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1805.041,1806.022,"I mean, you can say that, but is it true?"
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,1810.637,1819.165,"--Because it all flows from the inevitable fact of the contagiousness of H... not only the contagiousness of HIV, but the fatality of HIV."
1997.97-156,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1828.93,1831.75,"Well, there again, that... that's... that's a fine statement."
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,1852.514,1861.28,"--Well, I think the plain meaning of the statute does not... does not preclude the re... does not require a preclusion of the activity."
1997.97-156,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1876.631,1885.657,"Well, do... do you concede that it's strictly a moral limitation or a moral mandate that you're client followed?"
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,1906.841,1908.832,That's correct.
1997.97-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.832,1909.853,I don't see... I don't think--
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,1926.014,1929.808,"Well, I don't think that the key choice is a moral choice."
1997.97-156,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1933.911,1939.816,"No, but it flows through a choice about what I ought to do in relation to other people."
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,1966.653,1972.236,--I don't believe... I'm not sure I under--
1997.97-156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.236,1973.426,"Under the regulation, what difference does it make whether it's moral or not?"
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,1974.698,1984.094,--The... I don't think the fact that there's a volitional aspect to a limitation precludes it from being a substantial limitation under the statute.
1997.97-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.284,1998.273,"Would it be a disability under the Act if... if I know that... that there is in my family a gene that causes manic depression, and... and I choose, therefore, not to have children?"
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,1998.273,1999.394,--Well--
1997.97-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.394,2000.474,Is that a disability under the Act?
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,2000.474,2004.027,--I think that's a very separate and complex question that's not at issue in this case.
1997.97-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.887,2007.209,"Oh, I thought it was an issue in this case."
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,2008.02,2011.3,"--The... well, I think... I think that is somewhat... somewhat distinct, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2023.268,2023.819,Is it different?
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,2030.334,2032.355,"--I would certainly think so, yes."
1997.97-156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2032.355,2032.815,"Yes, I would think so, too."
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,2081.206,2086.34,There is no documented case of a dental practitioner who has been infected with HIV.
1997.97-156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2086.34,2087.732,"And by that, you're not using some technical loaded thing."
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,2088.303,2088.804,No.
1997.97-156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.973,2093.344,"--I mean, somebody like a person who's in the dentist's office and who is working, I would call a dental practitioner."
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,2093.344,2093.826,That's right.
1997.97-156,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2099.713,2104.715,"But what about the seven cases that the other side has mentioned, of dental health care workers?"
1997.97-156,1,17791,bennett_h_klein,,2104.715,2112.4,Those are cases that the CDC has investigated and concluded that there's not sufficient evidence to determine occupational transmission.
1997.97-156,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2419.67,2423.853,"That is not correct, Justice Scalia."

1997.97-156,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3299.439,3300.12,Of your own?
1997.97-156,3,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,3300.12,3300.62,Right.
1997.97-156,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3362.566,3366.497,How many cases of AIDS had there been approximately as of 1994?
1997.97-156,3,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,3366.497,3368.841,--I... I don't know that figure.
1997.97-156,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3382.738,3383.189,All right.
1997.97-156,3,31980,john_w_mccarthy,,3395.396,3400.159,"Well, the question is, does he... what's the then current medical knowledge?"
