1975.74-653,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,32.692,"We will hear arguments next in 74-653, Michigan against Mosley."
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,35.787,38.728,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,229.345,236.473,"What is the reason for doing this twice, giving him the Miranda Warnings twice, what was the reason for it?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,236.473,244.428,"Well, Your Honor in this case, I think that Detective Hill did not know that Mr. Mosley had earlier exercised any right to remain silent."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,244.428,245.124,Why did he not know?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,248.75,249.703,"That is correct, Your Honor, but --"
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,249.703,251.116,"It was in the same building, was it not?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,251.116,252.393,"It was in a different floor, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,253.563,255.577,Why did he come to different floor?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,255.577,258.035,"Because it was a different bureau, Your Honor, investigating the crime."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,258.978,263.796,Moving him around from place to place and then all of the sudden you give him another warning?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,263.796,264.594,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,270.306,275.854,"He knew that when he was taken from fourth floor to the ninth floor, did he say he did not do that?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,275.854,277.607,That is exactly where they took them here.
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,278.335,280.192,Then they have moved him around?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,280.192,283.978,"They took them to the lockup area, Your Honor and brought them back them for further interrogation."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,283.978,286.634,"Then they gave him Miranda Warning, again?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,286.634,287.977,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,287.977,289.033,Why?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,289.033,300.468,"Because Detective Hill was going to interrogate him on the Leroy Williams murder and under the doctrine enunciated by this Court in Miranda versus Arizona, the rights were prerequisite to any interrogation."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,300.468,305.281,Is there anything in Miranda about taking from place to place and giving the warnings every time they took him?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,305.281,306.069,In the companion case --
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,306.069,307.386,"But, of course not?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,307.386,310.769,"In the companion case, Your Honor, there is discussion of that particular point."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,310.769,312.744,I know a little bit about that one.
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,312.744,314.038,Westover versus United States.
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,314.038,315.082,"Yes, I remember that."
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,316.538,317.489,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,317.489,319.279,But this is all state?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,319.279,320.089,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,326.162,334.594,"But the question to me as to why you gave the same warning twice, the same interrogating or agency gave him the same warning twice?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,334.594,336.595,"In this case, Your Honor, there was a change in circumstances."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,336.595,339.986,But what if you thought he was going to change his mind?
1975.74-653,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,339.986,343.084,Unless there is the state that will penalize for overdoing it?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,343.084,344.066,"I do not think so, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,351.152,355.888,"But suppose you have given six of them, would that not be penalizing him?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,359.206,360.547,"Well, Your Honor, that is not the way that we --"
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,360.547,361.516,As I read Miranda?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,361.516,363.253,"That is not the way we read Miranda, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,411.792,413.566,May I ask you Mr. --
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,413.566,414.401,"Khalil, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,414.401,422.129,-- does the record show whether or not Hill knew about the earlier interrogation by Cowie?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,422.129,431.279,"Yes, Your Honor, the record indicates that Detective Hill did not know that Mr. Mosley had exercised his right to remain silent relative to the robberies."
1975.74-653,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,431.279,435.47,Does it show whether or not he knew that Mosley had been interrogated by Cowie?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,435.47,436.162,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,458.144,460.846,"That is Hill’s testimony in the record, is it?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,460.846,466.734,That is Hill’s testimony and it is also Mr. Cowie’s testimony that he did not tell Detective Hill about the prior exercise.
1975.74-653,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,466.734,472.564,There was no direct contact as I understand it between Cowie and Hill?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,482.787,485.477,He was taken to the fifth-floor from the ninth and interrogated by Hill.
1975.74-653,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,501.976,510.724,He did know that -- about the earlier interrogation and he did know that Mosley had refused to discuss the robberies?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,510.724,512.594,"He did not know that specifically, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,518.264,519.302,He denied any implications?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,519.302,520.571,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.571,523.931,But your agreement I take it would be the same whatever he knew?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,523.931,524.989,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,526.654,529.896,"But that is not critical, you do not think that is a critical fact in the case?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,529.896,531.854,"No, I do not, Your Honor, not at all."
1975.74-653,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,531.854,541.452,Should we decide the case on the assumption that the second officer knew that he had declined to answer and he had decided to exercise his rights?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,541.452,548.758,"Well, I think in this particular case, Your Honor, the record is clear that he did not know that he had earlier exercised his rights, but it does not matter for purposes --"
1975.74-653,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,548.758,550.959,"It might, it might."
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,566.227,567.633,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,567.633,578.351,"And if he had any doubt about whether the warning had been given or what had proceeded, I suppose your position would be the prudent thing was to give the warning again?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,578.351,579.147,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,581.915,585.6,"And if he had not done that, you would not have any case, would you?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,585.6,588.982,"That is not necessarily correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,837.213,842.374,(Inaudible) Would you please not characterize what I am thinking?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,842.374,843.805,"My apologies, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,843.805,844.679,(Inaudible)
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,844.679,848.597,But there was in any event no bureaucratic harassment in this case.
1975.74-653,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,887.039,897.017,I got some impression to what you said earlier that you had in mind a remand to reconsider under the totality of the evidence approach?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,897.017,897.629,"No, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,917.919,936.192,"Well, if we reject the per se rule which you said the Michigan Court of Appeals has adapted, would we not ordinarily simply tell Michigan Court of Appeals that was not a proper standard for reversing on the federal constitution and then let them make an assessment as to the totality of the circumstances?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,936.192,949.279,"Well, Your Honor, I know that this Court in Brown versus Illinois, decided last term, decided the issue rather than submit it back to the Trial Court, that this Court will have before all of the facts that will be available to the Michigan Court."
1975.74-653,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,969.057,972.909,Let me follow through at this point.
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1003.877,1013.335,"Well, Your Honor, in this case, I would submit to the Court that enough facts are present here that this Court could determine whether or not the arrest was valid, if it so desired."
1975.74-653,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1045.863,1047.358,And you would be content with that kind --?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1047.358,1058.802,"We would be content, Your Honor, with the reversal of the Michigan Court of Appeals and with some instructive language relative to the confession in what Miranda intended in cases such as this one."
1975.74-653,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1058.802,1060.321,"Well, what is a Walker Hearing?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1060.321,1064.855,"A Walker Hearing, Your Honor, is the counterpart of the Jackson v. Deno case."
1975.74-653,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1064.855,1066.295,"That is the case in Michigan, the Walker case?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1066.295,1072.965,The Walker hearing is a Jackson v. Deno hearing to determine the admissibility and voluntariness of a confession.
1975.74-653,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1072.965,1074.522,"The Walker case is a Michigan Case, not (Voice Overlap)?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1074.522,1075.717,It is People versus Walker.
1975.74-653,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1076.538,1076.966,Alright.
1975.74-653,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1077.347,1078.89,Every state has a different name?
1975.74-653,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1078.89,1081.478,"That is correct, Your Honor, ours is Walker."
1975.74-653,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1081.478,1081.903,Very good.
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1082.69,1103.828,"Now, it is our position in this case that Miranda did not preclude subsequent interrogation relative to even the same case that instead as I indicated the circumstances of the waiver and the confession have to be looked to on a case by case basis, but in any event, this case is not a case of continuing or incessant interrogation."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1140.056,1149.242,"The Westover was the state court prosecutors and the federal prosecutors, that is entirely different, is it not?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1149.242,1150.335,"I do not think so, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1160.352,1162.61,And you do not see any difference in the state and federal?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1162.61,1171.97,"Not at all, Your Honor, I think the critical question is to look at the state of mind of the defendant in a particular case and I think that is what this Court did in Westover because in Westover, even Westover --"
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1171.97,1178.242,Westover was deliberately (Inaudible) opinion that one was federal and one was state.
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1179.452,1180.954,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1180.954,1183.651,As the best way to remember a case is to lose one?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1183.651,1186.368,"That is correct, Your Honor, you argued that case as I remember."
1975.74-653,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1186.368,1189.257,And that was the point that one was federal and one was state?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1189.257,1195.244,"But what I am saying, Your Honor, that ipso facto that should not determine what the outcome in a given case is."
1975.74-653,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1278.257,1287.591,Who has authority in Detroit to prescribe the police investigating procedures?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1290.182,1291.47,"Yes, Your Honor, the City Government."
1975.74-653,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.629,1300.103,And the state has no authority or whatsoever?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1300.103,1304.629,"No, in the city there are state statutes, Your Honor, that guide the City Police in certain areas."
1975.74-653,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.461,1308.51,But the Attorney General’s’ Office has no authority?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1308.51,1311.909,"The Attorney General does not have a direct hand in it, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1316.939,1322.833,"But in a case like this, it is the local prosecutor’s office has the authority to handle the appellate litigation?"
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1322.833,1325.667,"That is correct, Your Honor, the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office."
1975.74-653,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1325.667,1327.415,The Attorney General has no authority?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1327.415,1328.313,"Yes, he does, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1338.349,1340.931,(Voice Overlap) to bringing the case here?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1340.931,1341.883,"Not that I am aware of, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1341.883,1344.185,"Alright, thank you."
1975.74-653,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1344.185,1345.731,But he may displace the local?
1975.74-653,0,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,1345.731,1353.34,"He may displace us, if he so chose to do so, but in this particular case he did not do that."
1975.74-653,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1379.309,1382.461,Very well.
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1384.749,1391.963,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1975.74-653,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1453.027,1454.305,But does mean not forever obviously?
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1454.305,1455.686,"No, not forever."
1975.74-653,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1455.686,1460.214,"I mean, if he is released, a year later and apprehended on some separate crime --"
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1460.214,1461.964,"True, true, true."
1975.74-653,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1470.554,1473.713,"But that is just dicta that you are quoting from Miranda, is it not?"
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1478.333,1481.536,"Well, no but the language is there, the questioning --"
1975.74-653,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1481.536,1484.503,"But I think it was dicta, was it not?"
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1484.503,1487.133,"Not the statement that the questioning must cease, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1487.133,1498.062,"Well, I thought that definition of dicta was any observation by the Court made that was not necessary for decision on the particular facts before it?"
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1502.36,1504.97,That is my point which really --
1975.74-653,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1504.97,1508.998,"So, you concede then that you are relying on dicta?"
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1508.998,1511.472,"Under that that definition, yes, yes."
1975.74-653,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1557.394,1566.706,You are referring an injunction with something like a side bar comment in the Miranda Opinion now?
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1566.706,1569.12,I would like to elevate it to more than just a side bar comment.
1975.74-653,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1569.12,1579.689,"Well, in Harris against New York, we indicated that we were separating the dicta from the substantive aspects of the holding, did we not?"
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1579.689,1603.33,"That is true, that is true and then of course this Court in Santobello, when confronted with a situation where one prosecutor made a promise to a criminal defendant regarding his plea and other indistinct prosecutor appeared with that same defendant in open Court that the promise of the first out of Court prosecutor would be binding on the in court prosecutor."
1975.74-653,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1604.216,1605.918,That was not on the Miranda issue?
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1605.918,1621.131,"No, but this Court said, if responsibility could be evaded that way, the prosecution would have designed another deceptive contrivance akin to those we condemned in Mooney versus Holohan and which is the point of the respondent here."
1975.74-653,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1699.133,1705.552,It makes no difference if the subject matter of the conversation is totally different?
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1705.552,1719.522,"None, whatever and I think the case at Bar, is the most beautiful illustration of that principle that one could hope to find for this reason."
1975.74-653,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1797.143,1801.279,He questioned him on Blue Goose which was the name of the café where the robberies had been?
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1801.279,1802.622,I think so.
1975.74-653,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1802.622,1804.811,He was responsible for White Tower?
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1804.811,1807.465,And Cowie mentioned the White Tower robbery.
1975.74-653,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1807.465,1809.055,I just want to be sure I understood what you are saying?
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1809.055,1811.872,Yes.
1975.74-653,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1835.098,1856.221,"As you indicate in the last paragraph of your brief, if you stand on the totality of circumstances rule then there might be quite a different approach if there were ten such or even five such episodes in sequence as compared with two, is that not correct?"
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1856.221,1862.23,"I think it would be more rote certainly, but in principle I do not think that there is any difference at all because Mr. Chief --"
1975.74-653,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1862.23,1866.423,But is that not what the totality of circumstances means?
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1866.423,1879.376,"In my mind, in this case the totality of circumstances would mean the completely -- the arrest without any probable cause whatever of the respondent."
1975.74-653,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1915.01,1917.63,(Inaudible) because he did not have anything to hold him?
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,1917.63,1929.288,"That is true and precisely Cowie said, I did not take him over because I did not think I had enough."
1975.74-653,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2040.434,2053.039,"But Mr. Khalil says that when he was there the second time with the second officer, if he had not given the Miranda Ruling, he would be yelling?"
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,2053.039,2053.735,[Laughter]
1975.74-653,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2053.735,2057.641,What would be your answer to that?
1975.74-653,1,20441,carl_ziemba,,2057.641,2060.721,I would have yelled in the either case.
1975.74-653,2,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,3434.048,3451.11,"I think from the examples that had been given in this particular case, some of the answers that had been given by the respondent to them, indicating that some of the answers are very difficult, I think that the Court can see what a Pandora’s Box would be introduced in this case, should the per se rule stand."
1975.74-653,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3480.136,3497.897,"Mr. Khalil, when you say totality of circumstances, you mean totality of circumstances as to whether the Miranda Rights have been waived and not totality of circumstances as to whether the confession is involuntary under pre-Miranda instead?"
1975.74-653,2,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,3497.897,3502.37,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3502.37,3517.524,"Your point, a gross deliberate violation of the letter and spirit of Miranda than the confession should be inadmissible regardless of whether or not the confession was in fact involuntary, in fact and in law involuntary under old Due Process Standard?"
1975.74-653,2,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,3517.524,3518.2,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3521.016,3528.507,"Yes, but Miranda case was not decided under the Due Process Clause?"
1975.74-653,2,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,3528.507,3530.796,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3530.796,3533.021,Let me ask you one thing.
1975.74-653,2,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,3545.946,3546.719,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3560.326,3585.008,"Can there be an infringement of one's Miranda Rights that is in the language of Justice Stewart, sufficiently gross, so that it would require exclusion of a confession under Miranda, but nonetheless, the statement would be voluntary under the pre-Miranda holdings of this Court?"
1975.74-653,2,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,3585.008,3587.254,I think there could be Your honor.
1975.74-653,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3601.18,3603.728,You cite the cases so holding in your brief?
1975.74-653,2,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,3603.728,3604.17,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3604.17,3608.323,Those cases as you say that they are typified by refusing to take no as an answer?
1975.74-653,2,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,3608.323,3609.509,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.74-653,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3612.339,3616.911,Even though there is not a holding that they were involuntary confessions under the Due Process Clause?
1975.74-653,2,42909,thomas_m_khalil,,3616.911,3618.151,That is correct.
1975.74-653,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3755.062,3755.75,Thank you gentlemen.
