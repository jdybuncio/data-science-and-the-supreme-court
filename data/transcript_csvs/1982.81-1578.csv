1982.81-1578,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.103,We'll hear arguments next in Shaw against Delta Air Lines.
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,61.535,65.25,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,115.546,117.559,Where is that set forth in the brief?
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,117.559,122.23,--Pages four and five of the blue brief.
1982.81-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,122.23,123.447,Thank you.
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,123.447,134.272,"ERISA, Section 514(a), provides that ERISA supersedes state laws which relate to employee benefit plans."
1982.81-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,253.035,269.218,"Now, the Solicitor General, as I understand it, has suggested that what all of this means is that ERISA would invalidate New York's substantive law, but not its procedural law, if you will."
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,274.416,295.081,"As I understand the Solicitor's suggestion, he is saying that this Court need only reach the situation where New York law provides more protection than state law, but need not reach that situation where the protections are identical."
1982.81-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,328.351,335.862,"It requires sort of a strained interpretation, doesn't it, to say that New York law is a federal law?"
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,335.862,339.55,We don't suggest the New York law is a federal law.
1982.81-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.266,383.108,"You can say that, and you are perfectly correct so far as Title VII is concerned."
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,395.213,408.473,"--First of all, New York does not, by any means, suggest that it is a federal law, but rather to preempt New York's law would impair the federal scheme."
1982.81-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,408.473,412.596,Simply because it was allowed to survive after Title VII?
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,412.596,413.52,No.
1982.81-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,444.474,453.111,"But, really Title VII left the decision as to employers below of 15 or less up to the individual states, didn't it?"
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,453.111,453.782,Yes.
1982.81-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,453.782,461.999,It was really neutral as to what kind of policy the state enforced with respect to employers of less than 15.
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,461.999,470.995,I think it would be more accurate to say that it encouraged the states to take the first step to eradicate employment discrimination.
1982.81-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,478.588,485.894,"Well, why do you say that it encouraged... That it is not accurate to say it is simply left up to the states, but rather the states were, in your words,"
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,491.05,500.187,"I think that if we look at the legislative history in 1978, when Congress was considering the Pregnancy Discrimination Amendment--"
1982.81-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,500.187,502.515,Was this after ERISA was passed?
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,502.515,506.932,"--Yes, it was obviously... The history was three and four years later."
1982.81-1578,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,506.932,509.463,We will resume at 1:00.
1982.81-1578,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,509.463,527.175,"You may proceed, Ms. Bachrach, when you are ready."
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,527.175,535.142,"May it please the Court, at the lunch break, I was discussing the 1978 Pregnancy Amendment to Title VII."
1982.81-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,698.043,703.589,"And, they remain fully applicable, do they not, Title VII non-discrimination provisions?"
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,703.589,706.915,"If this Court reverses the Second Circuit, they would remain--"
1982.81-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,706.915,713.085,"Title VII non-discrimination provisions are contained in the substance of Title VII, aren't they?"
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,718.083,719.799,--We would suggest otherwise.
1982.81-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,731.716,733.575,"What do you mean, ""go into the states""?"
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,733.575,741.355,--That the federal scheme in Title VII was built on the laws in effect in 1964 in the states.
1982.81-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,750.773,759.146,There is no question that Congress intended in 1964 that those laws remain in effect if they were in effect in the states.
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,775.355,797.158,--I would state it slightly differently and I would say that what Congress did in 1974 was to make sure that nothing would... That the preemption provisions of ERISA would not be construed as to even alter in any way the protections of any federal law.
1982.81-1578,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,797.158,811.434,"Well, do you mean that what Congress did in enacting ERISA was, in effect, to say Title VII saves state laws in this respect and ERISA continues that scheme."
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,812.576,813.465,"Yes, and more."
1982.81-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,931.807,937.742,I don't think I understood the Solicitor General's suggestion in quite the same way.
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,974.931,981.07,I believe that was the Solicitor's argument only as to the Disability Benefits Law.
1982.81-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,981.07,981.928,Right.
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,981.928,1003.89,"And, as to the Human Rights Law, the Solicitor General took the position that New York State's Human Rights law was preempted to the extent it provided protection beyond Title VII and it urged this Court not to reach the situation where the two statutes appear to be congruent."
1982.81-1578,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.226,1180.299,You argue as though we were writing on a clean slate.
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1184.737,1185.922,Yes.
1982.81-1578,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.922,1189.124,Shouldn't we talk about that?
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1191.998,1205.713,We think the Congress that enacted ERISA intended that in the area of employment discrimination that the principles enunciated in Title VII control and--
1982.81-1578,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1205.713,1211.367,Is that argument all predicated on 514(d)?
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1211.367,1217.848,--It is predicated on 514(d) and on the specific legislative history where--
1982.81-1578,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1217.848,1221.626,And you say 514(d) is to be read how?
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1221.626,1230.685,--That the preemption provision may not be construed so as to any way alter--
1982.81-1578,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1230.685,1231.718,Alter what?
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1231.718,1232.982,--A federal law.
1982.81-1578,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1232.982,1233.84,What federal law?
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1233.84,1235.2,Title VII.
1982.81-1578,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1252.991,1259.596,There just wouldn't be a state welfare law with respect to benefit plans.
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1274.246,1275.841,"No, some states don't."
1982.81-1578,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.465,1278.337,So Title VII operates on its own.
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1279.417,1291.554,--Title VII was formulated on the assumption that the states would take pain to eradicate employment discrimination at the local level.
1982.81-1578,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1291.554,1293.678,That simply isn't correct.
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1306.905,1307.875,No.
1982.81-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1374.551,1378.768,"Well, can't New York require the employers to do exactly that?"
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1387.936,1391.902,"--New York could do that, however, that was not what Congress intended."
1982.81-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1402.446,1409.784,"Yes, but how do you read out of the federal ERISA statute the word solely?"
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1417.155,1423.184,"--We would say that that language has to be read to mean any plan, fund, or program."
1982.81-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1446.316,1449.802,"That is not a normal reading of the language, is it?"
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1449.802,1452.703,--It certainly is not a literal reading of the language.
1982.81-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1460.514,1471.698,"But, don't we have to look at the language Congress employs initially and in that paragraph it is very difficult to resolve it in the way you are suggesting."
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1471.698,1474.275,--Yes.
1982.81-1578,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1540.465,1552.242,"At least on the Disability Benefits Law, New York has the means to solve the problem if you follow the Solicitor General's theory, right?"
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1552.242,1556.57,--The Solicitor General's theory is really not very different than New York State's.
1982.81-1578,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1556.57,1562.037,"I was going to ask, as far as the DBL is concerned, do you agree with the Solicitor General?"
1982.81-1578,0,20627,deborah_bachrach,,1562.037,1563.394,Yes.
1982.81-1578,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1592.415,1593.834,You may.
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1595.539,1616.123,May it please the Court: In this case we have a situation which one would hope would be more usual where the statutory language is thoroughly consistent with the legislative history which is thoroughly consistent with the policies sought to be effectuated.
1982.81-1578,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1807.53,1810.03,Are you now referring to 514(d)?
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1810.03,1811.965,"I may be, Your Honor."
1982.81-1578,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1811.965,1812.935,I beg your pardon?
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1812.935,1814.371,It is the preemption provision.
1982.81-1578,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.371,1815.806,"Well, it is your case."
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1815.806,1817.412,"Well, Your Honor, I will have to check."
1982.81-1578,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1817.412,1819.007,It is 514 (a).
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1819.007,1819.616,It is 514(a).
1982.81-1578,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1819.616,1820.364,It is 514(a)?
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1820.364,1821.597,"Yes, I think so."
1982.81-1578,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.597,1823.8,"How about the word ""impair"" in there?"
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1825.489,1835.686,"I am sorry, Your Honor, the impairment provision as in alter, amend, or impair is relating to federal law which is not the preemption provision."
1982.81-1578,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1835.686,1837.889,You are not presently discussing that?
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1837.889,1838.965,"That is right, Your Honor."
1982.81-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1908.657,1910.299,"Let me ask you a question at this point, Mr. Booth."
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1922.746,1923.775,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
1982.81-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1923.775,1941.066,"So that if New York had, under its Human Rights Law, computed seniority in a manner different than this Court approved in American Tobacco, for example, and someone came in and made a claim under the plan and said you must count pre-Act seniority or something like that."
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1949.985,1957.355,"Well, Your Honor, the EEOC now would not technically defer to a state agency."
1982.81-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1957.355,1963.496,"But, doesn't part of the processing include the preliminary screening by the state agency which first addresses the issue?"
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1963.496,1966.822,"If there is coverage under both statutes, the EEOC defers."
1982.81-1578,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1969.852,1971.537,Suppose there is different coverage?
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1971.537,1976.333,"If there is different coverage... Do you mean if the laws are different, Your Honor, I am sorry."
1982.81-1578,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1976.333,1976.786,No.
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1985.33,1987.735,"Well, Your Honor, they wouldn't defer."
1982.81-1578,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1989.985,1992.934,Is it your argument that there would be complete preemption?
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1992.934,1994.045,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1578,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1994.045,1999.309,And that is because (a) says supersede any and all state laws?
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,1999.309,2000.885,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1578,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2000.885,2004.882,That would relate to any employee benefit plan?
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,2004.882,2005.806,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1578,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2005.806,2011.398,"To the extent there is a difference between the federal provision and the state provision, the state law is out, is that it?"
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,2011.398,2012.583,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.583,2014.661,Why should it make any difference whether they are different?
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,2014.661,2019.489,Well--
1982.81-1578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2019.489,2020.644,They are just preempted.
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,2020.644,2023.705,--They are preempted in the area of employee benefit plans.
1982.81-1578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.705,2025.202,That is what Congress says.
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,2032.919,2037.201,"Your Honor, the present procedure involves enforcement."
1982.81-1578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.917,2041.15,There has to be a state law in effect before you defer.
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,2041.15,2044.648,--The EEOC can only defer if the state law--
1982.81-1578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2044.648,2049.02,"If there isn't one, you don't defer at all."
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,2049.02,2053.504,--The EEOC may not defer if the state law doesn't adequately cover the claim.
1982.81-1578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.504,2054.362,Or if there isn't one.
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,2054.362,2055.162,Or if there isn't one.
1982.81-1578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.162,2058.129,"And, if it is preempted, there isn't one in this respect."
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,2058.129,2059.549,"That is right, Your Honor."
1982.81-1578,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2059.549,2064.594,"Isn't that begging the question, because the statute, at the time it was enacted, there was a state law."
1982.81-1578,1,25049,gordon_dean_booth_jr,,2087.679,2093.662,"Your Honor, there was a deferral procedure in Title VII before and after ERISA was passed."
1982.81-1578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.662,2094.66,The same one.
