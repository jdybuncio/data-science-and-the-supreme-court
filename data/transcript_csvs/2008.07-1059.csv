2008.07-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.956,"We will hear argument next in Case 07-1059, United States v. Eurodif and 07-1058, USEC v. Eurodif."
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,11.891,24.048,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The question presented in this case is whether the provision of enriched uranium under separative work unit or SWU contracts is covered by the Federal antidumping duty law.
2008.07-1059,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,120.843,128.866,I can imagine you could have a grain mill and they have lots and lots of grain absolute identical one to the other.
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,150.429,167.741,"Well, indeed, as we've explained in our opening brief, at common law the distinction between a bailment and a sale in that type of circumstance depended upon whether the miller or the equivalent processor was under an obligation to return the very same thing in processed form."
2008.07-1059,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,168.51,201.981,"You are saying if we have that, in fact, if the -- if the exact situation, if some farmers up in North Dakota send their grain just to be milled -- it's their grain -- up in Canada, and they come back, and it -- you know, it may not be the identical molecule, but it's identically the same; they have done this for 100 years -- now suddenly this -- the Commerce Department is going to say, that's a sale, and the antidumping statutes apply?"
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,201.981,204.599,--We are saying that Commerce could treat it as a sale.
2008.07-1059,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,205.199,205.999,"Well, would it or not?"
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,205.999,224.929,"--I think Commerce in that hypothetical -- again, if we were talking about grain being provided by the customer to a miller overseas -- overseas, and then the finished product being brought back into this country, I think the logic of the Commerce determination here would suggest that it would be a sale."
2008.07-1059,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,224.929,243.058,"I agree with you, and I just wonder, what I would like to know, is if any businessman involved in any of these or related things before this decision of the Commerce Department would have thought that that is how the Commerce Department would have treated such a transaction?"
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,243.058,249.978,"Well, I don't think that Commerce had before this incident dealt with exactly this type of situation."
2008.07-1059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.978,251.93,"Well, but common law would have treated it that way, you say?"
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,251.93,252.83,Common law would have treated it--
2008.07-1059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.83,254.449,That's pretty good authority.
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,254.449,257.918,--It certainly suggests that Commerce could permissibly treat it as a sale.
2008.07-1059,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,257.918,258.601,I don't know.
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,274.695,275.312,I--
2008.07-1059,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,275.312,285.051,"--Because after all, you have three precedents in related areas, not the direct area but in related areas, that suggest that they wouldn't have treated the millers that way."
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,285.051,288.42,--I'm not sure exactly which precedents you mean.
2008.07-1059,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,318.974,322.51,"You know what, I'm thinking of those things, they're something called ""tollers""."
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,333.734,334.401,That's correct.
2008.07-1059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,397.908,401.712,"Mr. Stewart, can I ask a question about the scope of discretion involved here?"
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,420.007,431.397,"--Well, I think that Commerce's determination suggests, without squarely holding, that it would treat that as a sale of goods because it would involve substantial transformation of the original item."
2008.07-1059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,431.397,432.581,That's really what I wanted to ask you.
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,440.92,441.303,We do.
2008.07-1059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,468.671,476.593,"But then supposing they send the suit back to a different person for alterations, and they say, well, this is part of the sale, so we want to treat it as a sale of goods?"
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,476.593,480.478,"--Well, the alterations would just be a finishing process and that wouldn't involve substantial--"
2008.07-1059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,480.478,482.414,What is the difference between that and what we've got here?
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,482.414,503.078,"--But the point I was going to make about the suit, and it applies equally to the uranium enrichment process, is if I say to my tailor, rather than I pay you $600 and you pay your cloth supplier $300, how about I just give you $300 and I will give $300 to your cloth supplier, and it will amount to the same thing in the end, because you won't have to pay for the cloth?"
2008.07-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,519.27,531.597,"Could you articulate precisely what your test is, because you have been going back and forth between whether the raw materials are fungible and whether there is a fundamental transformation in the product?"
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,541.703,551.808,"I think that the Commerce determination -- that Commerce did not purport to either promulgate a regulation or announce a test that precisely defined the term ""sale""."
2008.07-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,574.84,583.53,"You would say your ultimate touchstone is whether there is substantial transformation, and whether it's a raw material or discretion, those go into that determination?"
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,583.53,597.205,"--That's correct, although it would certainly be appropriate for this Court if it didn't want to address the situation in which only substantial transformation was present, to say that at least when both circumstances were present there was a sale."
2008.07-1059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,632.295,630.627,What's a SWU?
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,633.062,643.936,"--A SWU is a unit of work and it's work in the sense of output; that is, it is the work necessary to separate out a particular quantity of enriched uranium--"
2008.07-1059,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.936,652.542,"If you put in more time with the uranium, with the same amount of 235, if you put in more time you can get out more?"
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,652.542,653.726,--That's right.
2008.07-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,667.969,672.354,I'm sure you're prepared for a wide variety of hypotheticals.
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,687.965,691.751,I'm not sure whether Commerce would treat that as substantial transformation.
2008.07-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,691.751,695.719,"--Neither am I, and it's kind of -- it's sort of a bit of a concern."
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,703.642,711.915,"Now, in this case -- in this particular case, Commerce noted that there was no dispute among the parties that the enrichment process did result in substantial transformation."
2008.07-1059,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,774.255,779.725,"Mr. Stewart, we're reviewing a decision of the Federal Circuit."
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,840.113,845.501,I don't think we have disavowed the position we took in the Florida Power & Light case.
2008.07-1059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,939.193,944.097,But isn't it correct that the universe of transactions that is the subject of this Act is sales?
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,950.085,962.643,"Well, it is true that the antidumping statute requires that merchandise be sold in the United States, and we don't contend that the statute applies to price discrimination in services like insurance or banking."
2008.07-1059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.643,968.563,"But do you -- do you contend the word ""sold"" is an ambiguous term, requires construction by a particular agency?"
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,968.563,975.116,"It is ambiguous at the margins; that is, the classic arrangement, the classic sale is an exchange of--"
2008.07-1059,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.116,985.341,Do you think Congress intended the ambiguity to be resolved by an agency rather than judges applying the rules of common law and the rules of sales law generally?
2008.07-1059,0,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,985.341,1002.601,"--Yes, and I think this is a statute that has been around for, I believe, close to 90 years now; and in order for it to remain efficacious in this area, Commerce has to be able to adapt its principles to new forms of transactions."
2008.07-1059,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1010.124,1012.159,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1026.835,1043.095,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would submit, as the questions this morning have indicated, one of the difficulties in this case, obviously, is this is the kind of transaction that can be thought about reasonably enough in different ways."
2008.07-1059,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1091.528,1093.444,What -- what do we do about the question that is bothering me?
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1154.784,1155.601,Okay.
2008.07-1059,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1155.601,1165.492,"Now that's the -- the question I want responded to in the legal context of, has Commerce made a significant change in its policy?"
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1165.492,1167.559,"Several things about that, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-1059,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1180.918,1184.62,And I read -- at what page do I find all these cases?
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1184.62,1185.203,That is in our brief.
2008.07-1059,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1186.655,1187.239,"Well, roughly."
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1188.355,1189.191,--But it's in--
2008.07-1059,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1189.191,1190.657,But I will see a lot of cases where--
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1190.657,1193.059,--Where we discuss Commerce's tolling precedent.
2008.07-1059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1330.348,1337.62,"Mr. Farr, are there earlier cases that applied Chevron deference to the Commerce's determination of what a sale is?"
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1337.62,1340.922,"--No, there are not, Your Honor, that I am aware of."
2008.07-1059,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1343.155,1347.309,You agree that the Chevron case is not a substantial evidence case?
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1347.309,1352.796,"--I do think so, although I must say the line between the two is not enormously clear to me, to be honest."
2008.07-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1409.05,1418.655,"If we are to defer to the agency's interpretation, what -- how would you phrase its interpretation, apart from ""this is a sale""?"
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1418.655,1450.46,"Well, I think -- the narrowest interpretation, and it seems to me the one that is most readily dealt with is, to say, in a situation where a customer provides raw material that is the type of, but not the precise raw material, used by a manufacturer to make the good that it then delivers to the customer, in that situation, we are going to treat the manufacturer as having made a sale of that good for the consideration of the cash and the raw material."
2008.07-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1450.46,1454.162,So it doesn't matter whether there is a substantial transformation or not?
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1454.162,1461.415,"I think it does, Mr. Chief Justice, in this sense, that we are talking about the sale of the merchandise and that is a new good."
2008.07-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1547.29,1555.711,"So that -- so that is the critical factor, whether it's made from their material, regardless of whether there is a transformation?"
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1573.156,1575.275,"No, I don't think Commerce would say that."
2008.07-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1584.48,1585.48,So it's got to be both?
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1585.48,1594.152,"--I think that Commerce would say, if you have both, that clearly can be regarded as a sale of merchandise, and we will regard it as a sale of merchandise."
2008.07-1059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1615.102,1616.835,Would you--
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1616.835,1618.386,I would emphasize that's not the case.
2008.07-1059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1618.386,1625.64,"--Would you do that if you thought it was clear as a matter of common law or under the Uniform Sales Act, or something like that, that it was not a sale?"
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1625.64,1636.348,"I think because of the different circumstances, under the common law, for example, I should make very clear -- but I should make first my answer to you, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-1059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.56,1655.743,"Under common law, you don't need deference."
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1655.743,1656.429,Pardon me?
2008.07-1059,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1656.429,1657.395,I'm sorry.
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1661.213,1685.512,"Well, in the end, I think, in the commercial setting, there is a reasonable chance, not necessarily certain because you do have the UCC and you have the possibility, in those situations, the courts might say, in a commercial setting, we are going to pay more attention to the parties' efforts to structure their contracts in a particular way, so that between them, we are going to treat the contract differently."
2008.07-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1693.352,1694.887,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1059,1,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1694.887,1695.57,Thank you.
2008.07-1059,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1695.57,1700.089,Ms. Halligan.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1700.089,1715.883,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to start with Justice Breyer's question about the way in which the Department of Commerce has treated transactions for the processing of goods and the uncertainty that their position in this case will cause, not just in this industry but across industries."
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1738.714,1746.736,"And those have been cases where the very same product is returned with value added, right?"
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1746.736,1747.252,Not necessarily.
2008.07-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1833.627,1837.162,What do you do about the substance versus formality question?
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1856.208,1863.063,"--First of all, the Department of Commerce has not until this case suggested that fungibility of goods might make some sort of a difference."
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1936.343,1938.093,"No, old mills used to do that."
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1944.366,1949.084,--But -- but there is nothing about the economic transaction that requires that it--
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1949.084,1950.436,That's absolutely true.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,1950.436,1956.256,"--that happen, and more importantly, the enrichers don't end up at the end of the day with any feed."
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.873,1984.324,"Your brief constantly assumes that there has been no sale, that throughout the entire transaction, the utility owned what ultimately becomes the rods, as though it was indeed the same feedstock that produced the rod that was ultimately delivered."
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2000.452,2004.404,--It may be the same molecules; it may not be.
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2008.189,2009.058,That's exactly right.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2014.276,2016.062,"--Respectfully, Your Honor, I disagree."
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2031.055,2032.088,"No, we've got the same molecules."
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2053.503,2057.889,You can't say for sure because the gas molecules can't be segregated that way.
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2086.641,2087.941,"That makes no sense, what you just said."
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2095.414,2098.782,"No, they hold title to it until -- just to provide a--"
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2098.782,2100.449,Most of it is back overseas.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2104.484,2108.536,"--Your Honor, the contracts provide several things."
2008.07-1059,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2177.949,2183.103,That's only -- that's only true because apparently they use up all the feed that they get.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2200.029,2208.801,The price terms of the contract provide only for the utilities to pay for the amount of energy that is expended.
2008.07-1059,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2249.395,2257.651,"Yeah, but why are they providing something that is very valuable that, in fact, could not be obtained by the enricher on the open market if those were the contract terms?"
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2273.744,2276.296,"--Those are very different kinds of contracts, though, Your Honor."
2008.07-1059,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2313.571,2313.921,Sure.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2323.927,2324.427,That's right.
2008.07-1059,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2324.427,2325.211,--That's why they are doing that.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2325.211,2331.115,"And so, they go out into the market and procure the feed pursuant to whatever arrangements they have with their feed suppliers."
2008.07-1059,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2340.738,2343.923,That is a way of looking at it.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2369.657,2370.124,--They are.
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.558,2404.229,"--Ms. Halligan, try this hypothetical, and it really gives you the benefit of the doubt."
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2461.5,2474.142,"It would be perfectly appropriate for the Department of Commerce to do what it has done in the past, which is to treat the sale of the sweater by the U.S. companies for $20,000 as the cognizable sale."
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2476.177,2477.26,Say it again?
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2477.26,2478.879,--In your hypothetical--
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.879,2484.7,I'm talking about the -- I'm talking about the sale from the European mills to the American department store.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2484.7,2486.316,--That would be a processing transaction.
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2486.316,2488.234,A processing transaction.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2497.34,2500.642,Let me give you an example of what the Department of Commerce has looked at.
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2547.106,2548.623,They said there was no sale.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2548.623,2550.158,They said that--
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2550.158,2554.177,"When the pasta was imported, there was no sale into the United States."
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2554.177,2555.712,"--No, they said that--"
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2555.712,2557.162,But that's what we are talking about here.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2557.162,2563.716,"--We don't disagree, Your Honor, that there is a product that comes into the United States, it's low enriched uranium."
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2594.837,2597.122,Get back to your pasta case.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2602.491,2614.5,--The question before Commerce was which transaction is the appropriate transaction for us to treat as -- as the one that establishes the price all over the United States.
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2614.5,2615.15,That's a different issue.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2621.67,2624.789,"It turns on the same issue, Your Honor, and here's why."
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2675.789,2676.289,"Now, wait."
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2706.308,2708.024,To the extent that it may--
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2708.024,2713.378,That you have to look at the price at which the department store then sells to individuals?
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2713.378,2714.028,--That's right.
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2718.282,2719.899,But the department store is not dumping.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2722.318,2728.722,"--But the question, Your Honor, is -- is the price at which the product is sold in the United States."
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2766.363,2766.697,Okay.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2772.934,2773.786,A sale and I--
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2773.786,2777.155,And I thought this is -- this is what you say fails in this case.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2781.439,2786.176,--There is an importation of LEU into the United States by the utilities.
2008.07-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2803.222,2806.174,That is pretty important.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2858.19,2859.308,--It is true.
2008.07-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2859.308,2859.658,All right.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2946.295,2946.511,Yes.
2008.07-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2947.528,2948.33,And what is the answer to that?
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2948.33,2950.113,--And here is why that's not sufficient.
2008.07-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2975.147,2975.464,Yes.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2982.318,2983.101,But that's--
2008.07-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2983.101,2990.074,"--if there had been a substantial transformation, because the key to this concept of ""sale"" is the word ""substantial"" transformation."
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,2990.074,3004.584,"--Two responses, Your Honor: First of all, the statute doesn't allow that, and I would recommend to the court the remand response that Commerce provided in the Taiwan semiconductor case."
2008.07-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3004.584,3005.167,In which--
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3005.167,3007.951,The Taiwan semiconductor case which is cited in the brief.
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3051.145,3065.955,"What does -- what does the government do with respect to these other transactions where, indeed, the utility does not provide the feed uranium but just pays for, you know, getting -- getting the rods?"
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3065.955,3067.324,--In those cases--
2008.07-1059,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3067.324,3071.542,"There is no down -- you know, there is no domestic sale there, either."
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3075.68,3076.28,--No.
2008.07-1059,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3104.865,3109.984,Isn't it true that in all of those cases there is no transfer of ownership of the basic product?
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3136.184,3143.407,"--I think not, Your Honor, certainly not for the same reasons that you would have that in -- in a grain elevator."
2008.07-1059,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3155.215,3168.373,"But you have the same contract you've got here, but you are able to identify that, in fact, there is a difference in the -- in the commodity that -- that -- at least not a different raw material that was sent to France and returned."
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3179.33,3183.465,"First of all, you can't tell -- and I don't think there is any -- any dispute as to that fact."
2008.07-1059,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3186.584,3193.19,"Well, isn't it true, if you can't tell, the odds are that there is some product the title to which has been transferred?"
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3193.19,3198.911,"--No, I -- I think you certainly can't tell what molecules come out the other end."
2008.07-1059,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3199.644,3202.446,Can't we assume -- let's assume that there is.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3202.446,3203.363,--Yes.
2008.07-1059,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3203.363,3210.533,"Assume that there are -- are two sources for the uranium, A and B, and it goes to the enricher."
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3219.472,3225.376,"And that's -- that's the operative premise that I am disagreeing with, with all due respect."
2008.07-1059,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3225.376,3225.828,No.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3229.113,3232.798,I mean the legal -- the legal consequences is -- is what I am--
2008.07-1059,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3232.798,3237.0,--Are you saying the utility doesn't have title to what was formerly B's uranium?
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3237.0,3241.654,--The utility holds title to a discreet amount of feed uranium.
2008.07-1059,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3243.94,3244.906,The enrichment is done.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3250.96,3252.811,"--No, not at all."
2008.07-1059,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3252.811,3258.865,How does he get the title from -- to the uranium that was formerly B's uranium?
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3258.865,3260.782,Because--
2008.07-1059,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3260.782,3262.784,At what point did that title transfer?
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3262.784,3266.536,"--It -- maybe the useful analogy is money -- is money in the bank, Your Honor."
2008.07-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3289.719,3292.02,You don't -- you don't retain ownership of that.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3302.644,3317.738,"--But the bank could not hold title to that as against me if I came and tried to take the money out of my safe deposit box, nor could the farmers at the -- at the grain elevator be told that they -- they don't have title to the grain."
2008.07-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3317.738,3332.847,"--Is there any point in time from the time that the -- the processors get ahold of the uranium until the time it leaves their control that if they went bankrupt, anyone other than the utility could get ahold of the product?"
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3332.847,3333.18,No.
2008.07-1059,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3333.18,3333.463,No.
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3333.663,3335.063,And let me clarify this because it's an important issue.
2008.07-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3344.655,3350.023,"Well, but if they go bankrupt because -- I mean let's say they don't have all the uranium."
2008.07-1059,2,19243,caitlin_j_halligan,,3356.628,3359.664,"--But -- but the system doesn't operate that way, Your Honor."
2008.07-1059,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3503.64,3505.892,"Thank you, Ms. Halligan."
