2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.67,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-689, Bartlett v. Strickland."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,7.904,18.395,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The Voting Rights Act should be interpreted in such a way as to encourage a transition to a society where race no longer matters.
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,53.984,65.589,How can you say that this brings us closer to a situation where race will not matter when it expands the number of situations in which redistricting authorities have to consider race?
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,65.589,80.968,"Well, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, it will require somewhat an increase in the number of districts that would be drawn, there is no question about that, but that increase is not substantial."
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,111.82,117.558,It seems to me to be a criticism of the majority-minority district approach in the first place.
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,117.558,130.366,"Well, Your Honor, it is a recognition of the fact that coalition districts allow us to move away from majority-minority districts and create districts where races are working together."
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,130.366,132.334,What about influence districts?
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,132.334,132.751,Your Honor--
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,132.751,137.388,Do you move -- you've moved from majority-minority to crossover districts.
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,140.674,147.993,"--Your Honor, the decision in LULAC makes clear that influence districts are not protected under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act."
2008.07-689,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,147.993,153.831,"But under your definition of coalition district, race is the key factor."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,153.831,155.099,Your Honor--
2008.07-689,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,155.099,160.853,And you are telling us if we have a rule that makes race the key factor then race doesn't matter.
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,160.853,172.311,"--Your Honor, it is a matter of -- under the Voting Rights Act, Congress has made clear that districts should be drawn to protect minority voting rights."
2008.07-689,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,185.202,189.939,I thought you were proposing a brave new world of coalition districts.
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,189.939,191.306,"--Your Honor, and race--"
2008.07-689,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,191.306,194.641,Based on race.
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,194.641,200.712,"--Justice Kennedy, you have to consider race in drawing these districts."
2008.07-689,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,212.37,224.661,"What's the authority that says you must consider race in drawing the districts, assuming that you don't have an existing majority -- minority-majority district?"
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,231.933,237.587,"Well, Your Honor, that's certainly the decision in Thornburg v. Gingles."
2008.07-689,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,238.337,242.907,"No, that's -- that's a majority -- majority district."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,242.907,243.774,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-689,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,246.609,246.993,Okay.
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,248.493,256.663,"--Your Honor, this Court, of course, has left open the issue of whether the Voting Rights Act would protect minority--"
2008.07-689,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,256.663,266.103,"Well, then your statement that you must always consider race in drawing districts is not -- is not supported, or at least it's a new proposition that you are arguing for us here."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,266.103,277.66,"--Your Honor, my point is when you are drawing districts under section 2, of course race has to be considered, but it's considered because the process is not equally open to minorities."
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,291.534,302.609,"Well, I would have thought the possibility of coalition districts would be evidence that the Voting Rights Act has succeeded, rather than evidence that you need to apply it more broadly."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,302.609,313.047,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the coalition districts are certainly evidence that we have made progress towards Congress's ultimate goal under the Voting Rights Act, but we are not there yet."
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,338.614,351.755,"Well, I mean, the obvious question when you say 15 to 30 percent is what number of crossover voters would you say demonstrates that you no longer need to consider race in shifting a coalition district?"
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,351.755,358.409,"--Your Honor, in the Gingles case, this Court stated that it was a district-bydistrict determination."
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,370.383,375.002,"Of course, it could be 70 percent that don't vote for a particular candidate."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,380.739,396.034,"--Your Honor, at some point that's true, that it would be issues beyond race, but here, the expert report and as stipulated to by Respondents, this voting is racially polarized."
2008.07-689,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,406.89,416.412,You can't say where -- how much crossover voting would be so large as to make a difference?
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,419.148,426.97,"Your Honor, this Court's, again, decision in Gingles makes clear that that is a district-by-district determination."
2008.07-689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,426.97,434.409,"And that -- that has been stipulated here, right, that you meet the third Gingles factor?"
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,470.416,481.973,"Justice Ginsburg, I completely agree that, at some point, the crossover voting becomes so great that you no longer have to take into account district lines."
2008.07-689,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,482.606,483.373,"If that's the case, then--"
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,483.373,484.14,--we're not there yet.
2008.07-689,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,484.14,491.762,"--If that's the case, then your test imposes a statistical standard just as your opponent's test does, doesn't it?"
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,493.614,494.698,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-689,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,519.663,527.169,"Suppose there is 40 percent crossover voting, and that's a little bit -- that's not quite enough for the minority candidate to win."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,527.169,540.41,"Your Honor, again, whether the third Gingles prong is satisfied obviously is a district-by-district determination."
2008.07-689,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,541.345,549.016,"We can't even say that 40 percent would be sufficient in every instance, that that might be -- you know, that might not be enough?"
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,549.016,557.688,"--I'm hesitant since this Court has not set a specific limit, and that's, again, an issue that has been stipulated to in this case."
2008.07-689,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,559.473,567.662,"Well, you don't suggest that if there were 40 percent white crossover voting, we would find white bloc voting within the Gingles condition, do you?"
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,570.428,574.649,"--No, I think it would be very, very unrealistic that you'd have 40 percent--"
2008.07-689,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,574.649,578.184,"No, but I mean you really do have an answer to Justice Alito's question."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,578.184,578.901,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,578.901,579.97,What is the answer?
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,585.255,590.158,"Again, the third prong is not an aspect of this case."
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,590.158,592.193,So you don't have an answer to Justice Alito's question?
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,593.043,611.339,"If you are saying that 40 percent is a very high amount of crossover voting, that, of course, is not our case, where the crossover voting that is necessary to make this coalition district work is 18 percent crossover voting."
2008.07-689,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,611.339,618.928,Do you have racially polarized voting when you have as high a crossover vote as 40 percent?
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,626.867,629.151,"40 percent is a high number, and particularly--"
2008.07-689,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.151,634.104,But you still think that we can confidently say this is racially polarized?
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,634.104,640.091,"--Your Honor, here, however, under this case, there's not 40 percent crossover--"
2008.07-689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,640.091,648.03,"But you're opening yourself to this line of questioning about the third factor, which is conceded by both sides, so it's not in issue."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,683.87,695.011,"--Well, Your Honor, as the language the Court used in the De Grandy decision is whether the minority group is sufficiently large to elect a minority-preferred candidate."
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,768.559,778.748,"Under your theory, it would be possible to challenge a majority-minority district on the ground that you could draw a different coalition district, maybe more than one coalition district."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,793.924,824.896,"Your Honor, our position is that the -- assuming all of the factors under Gingles to be met, that if you have a minority group that was packed in to a -- one district, and in its place two coalition districts could be effectively drawn, and those districts would actually work and you could meet all of the other standards under Gingles -- the district was geographically compact, there is--"
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,824.896,827.479,That's an easy -- I suspect that's a common hypothetical.
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,837.87,848.242,"--In that situation, assuming you could meet all of the Gingles factors, that, yes, that 80 percent district should be drawn as two 40 percent districts."
2008.07-689,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,848.242,851.813,Aren't you adopting the principle of maximization?
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,851.813,852.696,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-689,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,852.696,861.152,"Let me ask you this, and correct me if I am wrong, because it has been a long time since Gingles came along and I may be forgetting things."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,914.987,921.858,"Well, Justice Souter, certainly the -- the criteria that you have referred to have to be part of the districting process."
2008.07-689,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,921.858,924.31,But they weren't part of your answer to the Chief Justice.
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,924.31,951.995,"Well, my point is that when minorities are basically put in an enclave, in a separate district but yet it is possible to draw two districts, two coalition districts, and the other prongs of Gingles have not been met, so that there is not rough proportionality throughout the State, yes, the districting body needs to consider drawing two districts--"
2008.07-689,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,951.995,957.447,"It needs to consider it, but I thought your answer was it needs to do it."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,959.649,977.793,"--Yes, Your Honor, it would be -- it is our answer that if a district -- if there is not rough proportionality in a State, there is a district that is a super-majority and there is no reason for that super-majority to be in place."
2008.07-689,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,977.793,980.062,Okay if there is no reason for the super-majority.
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1005.01,1015.984,"No, Justice Souter, your point is well taken and I agree that with a hypothetical like that it's very difficult, unless you are actually considering the specific situation of the district."
2008.07-689,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1015.984,1029.959,"Well, we -- what you propose is going to inject courts into the drawing of districts much more frequently than they -- than they already are injected."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1068.684,1078.058,"Your Honor, I think what Congress has required courts to do is to look at the overall picture of the district."
2008.07-689,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1097.686,1100.804,"Well, that's fine, but you just can't wave a magic wand."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1119.366,1132.007,"Well, Your Honor, and that's the very point of the section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, is when minorities do not have equal opportunity to elect their candidate of choice, where they are packed in to districts--"
2008.07-689,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1132.007,1139.077,We will be injected into this very political game much more frequently than we now are.
2008.07-689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.851,1181.689,In this case which way does the presumption favoring what the legislature did cut?
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1185.824,1191.712,"--Yes, Your Honor, the North Carolina Supreme Court determined that this district should not cut county lines."
2008.07-689,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1216.578,1217.979,That's something new.
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1236.091,1252.619,"--Your Honor, the government has asserted that there should be a near-50 percent test which includes as part of it a -- either the district is close to 50 percent or there is an element of discrimination."
2008.07-689,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1252.619,1270.997,"I'm talking about, you're indicating to us that the county line standard that the State court invoked as a matter of State law is itself questionable because it was based on a prohibited racial animus."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1303.568,1309.122,"Justice Kennedy, the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court is to adopt an inflexible 50 percent rule."
2008.07-689,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1314.174,1316.692,I'm talking about the county line rule.
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1316.692,1335.319,"--Yes, Your Honor, that the county line rule -- the North Carolina Supreme Court concluded that this district could not cut county lines because this should not be treated as a section 2 district."
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1335.319,1342.073,"We are fighting over -- the district that you want to draw, the crossover district, would have 39 percent African-American voters."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1357.5,1370.493,"Your Honor, the plaintiffs have and the Respondent and the government have referred to an alternative district that would not cut those county lines and would have a black voting age population of 35 percent."
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1385.983,1387.6,"What do you mean by ""workable""?"
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1387.6,1393.673,"That this -- that the district they propose was simply prepared by their attorney, looking at a map."
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1401.842,1404.861,Because it's 4 percent less than the district you propose?
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1404.861,1419.871,"--Well, it is a matter of the percentage of voting age population, but more importantly, the district they drew would have put a black incumbent, a black Democrat incumbent, in the same district with a white Republican incumbent."
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1421.156,1423.089,So it gets back to the Justice Scalia's point--
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1423.089,1423.406,--Yes.
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1423.406,1426.024,--that this is designed to protect incumbents.
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1426.024,1436.666,"Well, Your Honor, incumbency certainly has to be considered in the context of what the Voting Rights Act requires us to do, which is to look at the total picture."
2008.07-689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1444.937,1469.72,"Mr. Browning, I thought there was something in the record that said never in North Carolina's history have you had African Americans able to choose the -- able to elect the candidate of their choice where the minority population was less than 38.37 percent."
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1469.72,1479.659,"Justice Ginsburg, there are districts such as Wake County, the seat of government, where a minority has been elected with less than 38 percent."
2008.07-689,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1508.178,1515.784,"Well, does that mean a proposal if you succeed, we should remand on that question?"
2008.07-689,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1515.784,1553.041,"Your Honor, that would certainly be one possibility, but the North Carolina Supreme Court resolved this straight legal question as to whether the 50 percent rule is in place and is an -- is an inflexible rule, and not only did they -- they imposed this rule with respect to this district, they essentially had a mandatory injunction on the North Carolina General Assembly to never draw a district at less than 50 percent if it cuts too many county lines; and that is even inconsistent with the United States' view of section 2."
2008.07-689,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1559.361,1563.997,"Thank you, Mr. Browning."
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1565.349,1568.384,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1586.695,1589.045,I don't know why it would require maximization.
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1613.513,1631.807,"Your Honor, in this situation, we take the position that the people of North Carolina and their ultimate authority, their State Constitution, have spoken and said that county lines should be kept whole to the extent practical."
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1642.18,1644.715,What's that got to do with maximization?
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1644.715,1650.436,"--Well, Your Honor, that would be the position they would take of every district that could be drawn regardless of the--"
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1650.436,1669.349,"There is no question that if they are -- if they win this case, I think there is no question there will be more claims requiring -- or potentially more claims requiring adjustment of lines based on avoiding section 2 violation."
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1685.275,1703.486,"--Your Honor, it seems that if there are going to be more potential claims, and as every legislative body, school board, city council, whatever it is, has to follow section 2, they will have to take this into account."
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1715.294,1719.829,You are saying they will tend to maximization in order to avoid litigation.
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1719.829,1721.364,"--Your Honor, I think that is absolutely true."
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1721.364,1722.131,Okay.
2008.07-689,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1722.131,1731.237,Why in the -- why in the world would you stipulate to bloc voting in a situation where you have nearly 20 percent crossover voting?
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1731.237,1744.563,"Your Honor, the answer to that question is we were 20 months into the litigation, we had just received a partial ruling on cross motions for summary judgment, we were already at the midpoint of the decade."
2008.07-689,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1757.954,1771.047,"Well, but it seems to me you have complicated situations on a rather critical point, what seems to me a basic conundrum, how can you have bloc voting and at the same time have significant crossover voting?"
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1775.582,1777.034,"I agree, Your Honor."
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1801.483,1814.708,"Well, since the district is drawn from the counties and there's a stipulation with respect to the counties, doesn't it follow in the absence of some surprising fact that there would be bloc voting or the stipulation would cover bloc voting in the district?"
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1814.708,1830.419,"Your Honor, there are very different populations in these two counties, and that is referenced in the record with regards to the growth in population; and there is very different minority populations in the two counties because of the influx--"
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1830.419,1851.332,"But regardless, regardless of the -- the variations in mix, if you are stipulating that there's bloc voting in county A, bloc voting in county B, and you have got a district made up part of A, part of B, doesn't it follow in -- in the absence of some pretty specific evidence to the contrary, that in the district there is probably going to be bloc voting?"
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1851.332,1858.152,"--Your Honor, I would respectfully submit that it does not follow within a particular section of a district."
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1859.086,1872.246,"Do you have evidence in the record -- did you put evidence in the record that this particular district is carved from some peculiar section of county A and county B, so that the general bloc voting pattern does not apply in the district?"
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1872.246,1887.839,"--Your Honor, there is evidence in the record, and it is cited in the brief, that minority candidates, black candidates for judicial office and for State auditor received between 59 percent and 62 percent of the vote in the proposed district."
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1892.041,1892.575,Well--
2008.07-689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1892.575,1893.609,But you stipulated.
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1922.679,1932.635,"Your Honor, we did make a stipulation that there was evidence sufficient to support a finding and that we would stand by."
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1952.781,1957.15,"--But just help me on the facts, because I may have misunderstood the facts."
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1966.624,1976.229,"Your Honor, on page 130a of the -- I believe this is their submission, the--"
2008.07-689,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.229,1981.114,"I'm sorry, what -- what's the color of the brief -- of the cover on this?"
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1982.966,1986.085,"--I believe this is the white one, Your Honor."
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1986.085,1988.787,"Okay, and you're at 130?"
2008.07-689,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.787,1993.874,130a?
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1993.874,1994.724,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1994.724,1995.641,Yes.
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,1995.641,2016.687,"And it starts out that, in terms of the bloc voting, between the -- and the evidence presented by the defendant is sufficient to support a finding of fact that the racial difference in the presence of those results in the white majority voting is sufficient as a bloc to defeat the minority's preferred candidate."
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2030.195,2033.297,But what do you make of the -- the beginning of the next paragraph?
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2057.06,2058.144,--Your Honor--
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2058.144,2060.279,If you don't wish to present evidence.
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2060.279,2065.315,"--Your Honor, first of all, we were not stipulating that it did exist."
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2067.981,2070.05,"Yes, I realize, but when you then say"
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2075.421,2088.395,"--Your Honor, we do -- we let it stand on its own, we not wish to be heard further, we do not wish to take additional time on that, given the circumstances of the case."
2008.07-689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.565,2151.087,What was wrong with the clear rule that Justice Souter suggested in the LULAC case?
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2151.087,2152.004,"I'm sorry, ma'am."
2008.07-689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2152.004,2157.908,"Justice Souter, in his opinion in the LULAC case--"
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2157.908,2158.775,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2158.775,2176.62,"--he suggested what he called a hard-edged -- a clear, hard-edged rule which is not going to be an exclusive rule, but, anyway, if you met that standard, you're okay."
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2176.62,2181.905,"Your Honor, I certainly am not criticizing the rule proposed by Justice Souter, but--"
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2181.905,2182.774,It's okay.
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2187.309,2237.575,"--Your Honor, I think -- the perspective -- and I can't help -- that it is not as clear-edged as it seemed to the Court, at least to Justice Souter, that the 50 percent rule does provide a very clear, very limited sort of a rule that can be followed without getting involved in -- I do believe that -- race becomes very likely the predominant factor in the redistricting decision, because based on the cases that have come before you already, there have been claims that 26 percent, 25 percent--"
2008.07-689,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2237.575,2245.394,"I don't see how those claims could possibly succeed, but I thought -- let's go back to sort of step 1."
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2258.321,2259.638,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-689,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2259.638,2279.568,"Section 2 -- does vote dilution mean we who are a minority group, let's say a black group, could have elected a candidate of our choice more likely than the white group, but because you are engaged in vote dilution, that isn't going to happen anymore?"
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2281.853,2282.786,"Yes, Your Honor, that is--"
2008.07-689,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.786,2284.971,That's the form of the claim.
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2306.885,2319.193,"--Your Honor, I'm not sure that is entirely what we are trying to find out, because certainly districts are created where there was no minority incumbent, and that can happen because of changes in demographics or a variety--"
2008.07-689,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2319.193,2320.811,There are a lot of reasons that can happen.
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2336.07,2340.772,"--Your Honor, I believe the answer is, yes, we are trying to prevent that from happening."
2008.07-689,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2340.772,2341.891,That's what we are trying to prevent?
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2399.309,2405.146,"Respectfully, Your Honor, I believe there is, because you said you look to see if there is vote dilution."
2008.07-689,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2410.116,2425.959,"Here what we've -- could we look to see whether the three Gingles factors, whatever they are -- one was, is the black group numerous enough to elect the candidates of their choice?"
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2436.184,2436.667,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-689,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2436.667,2437.967,That's what we should do?
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2437.967,2438.986,Your Honor--
2008.07-689,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2438.986,2446.723,"Then I'm back to my problem, that sometimes the 50 percent criteria just doesn't measure that first part."
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2513.034,2515.969,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2008.07-689,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2591.431,2595.3,"Mr. Thurman, can I ask you this question?"
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2630.54,2634.96,"Your Honor, I categorically reject that as a human-rights basis for our argument."
2008.07-689,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2696.164,2701.735,What -- what Justice Breyer proposed a rule at the end of his question.
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2715.126,2728.568,"But, Your Honor, first, I believe as he said, as Justice Breyer said, that's an arbitrary number that he picked up on, the 50 percent."
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2743.126,2750.232,"But -- but you are saying it's an opportunity, and what you mean is it is sufficient to provide an opportunity."
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2760.271,2775.864,"--Your Honor, I would say that that would not be appropriate, because at that point you are looking on -- at the basis of race to give one group a greater opportunity than another, and the Voting Rights Act is the one group being given less opportunity than another."
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2784.886,2797.444,"Well, it's -- it's a greater opportunity than -- than would be given to them in -- in the district or a pair of districts that splits the minority population in half."
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2803.181,2803.914,--Your Honor--
2008.07-689,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2803.914,2808.252,"The opportunities are -- are measured on the ground, not in the abstract."
2008.07-689,1,20181,carl_w_thurman_iii,,2808.252,2817.441,"--Your Honor, my answer to that would be that the -- what would be proposed is it is required."
2008.07-689,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2834.752,2837.104,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2848.377,2855.233,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner has proposed expansion of section 2's traditional coverage because of three serious problems."
2008.07-689,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2914.854,2927.995,"I thought you were conceding that it isn't a rigid rule, and that the North Carolina Supreme Court should have to be -- I mean they could be 48 percent, I think you said."
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2927.995,2933.082,"We have identified two narrow exceptions, neither of which the Court really needs to reach in this case."
2008.07-689,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2944.188,2946.806,Intentional by those who draw the district?
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,2946.806,2948.658,"Yes, exactly."
2008.07-689,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2994.704,3003.56,I don't know if you litigate whether you are -- whether you are really talking about a -- a possible two percent variation.
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3014.249,3023.188,"--Well, because -- I say actually the opposite because -- well, I think that trying to determine 48percent raises no more difficulty than trying to determine 50 percent."
2008.07-689,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3023.188,3026.389,Except that you have a better chance so you are more likely to do it.
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3026.389,3031.257,There is -- there is a slight narrowing of the -- of the--
2008.07-689,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3031.257,3032.876,Two percent is pretty big in an election.
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3032.876,3043.332,"--Well, in -- in practice -- I mean, remember, the majority-minority rule has been followed in almost every jurisdiction nationwide for more than two decades, and so far I have seen one 48 percent case."
2008.07-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3046.284,3052.956,"If you want an absolute, arbitrary rule, which is what you were heading toward which will just -- the question is whether they get in the door."
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3097.901,3099.318,"Well, there -- there are a couple of things."
2008.07-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3124.386,3134.508,"It takes into account the realistic fact that in every group, including lots of African-American groups, there is -- it is not 100 percent African American at all."
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3140.495,3140.978,--Right.
2008.07-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3141.478,3144.614,So we want -- a little flexibility here is all that I'm suggesting.
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3144.614,3144.997,--Yes.
2008.07-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3158.437,3160.487,You can't get below 42.
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3164.691,3165.157,--I mean--
2008.07-689,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3165.157,3173.63,"They are -- they are finished at 40, and they are not even in at 40, if they have to depend more than two-to-one on the crossovers."
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3173.63,3177.899,--One problem with what you are looking for is a principled rule that can be justified.
2008.07-689,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3206.882,3214.488,I won -- I'd hoped that you could have a brief time to discuss your third rationale because it's going to require determination of how people would vote.
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3214.488,3218.857,Under Gingles one typically looks at what actually happened in the past.
2008.07-689,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3301.075,3307.331,Do you have a view on how we should approach the stipulation adopted below?
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3307.331,3314.485,I think the easy way to cut through is that a state Supreme Court respond and remand all arguments other than the first Gingles factor.
2008.07-689,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3398.721,3400.09,You mention how well it worked.
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3416.349,3418.984,--There are two things about the graphs.
2008.07-689,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3425.371,3432.525,"But they were designed to produce 50 percent, and that's why they got so -- so -- so grotesque."
2008.07-689,2,21060,daryl_joseffer,,3432.525,3432.944,Right.
2008.07-689,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3471.816,3473.535,Thank you Mr. Joseffer.
2008.07-689,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3475.804,3477.054,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-689,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3515.612,3522.249,Wouldn't Justice Breyer's 40 percent rule be just as arbitrary?
2008.07-689,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3522.249,3534.24,"--Justice Alito, it is important to recognize that there are significant districts that are out there that would not be protected under the 50 percent rule."
2008.07-689,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3551.618,3553.034,But this -- but yours is below?
2008.07-689,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3554.384,3562.724,The voting age population is 39.36 percent based upon the census data.
2008.07-689,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3635.57,3651.33,"The rule I suggested, though there are arbitrary aspects is a better targeted, more administrable -- or equally administrable or not much worse administrable arbitrary rule."
2008.07-689,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3651.33,3662.903,"Justice Breyer, in our view the rule that should be applied is consistent with the rule of LULAC, that the minority group is substantially larger than its coalition partner."
2008.07-689,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3679.849,3683.134,There must be somebody there to get you over 50 percent.
2008.07-689,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3683.134,3683.734,I'm sorry?
2008.07-689,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3683.734,3687.086,Thirty-three plus 11 is 44.
2008.07-689,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3689.205,3693.74,"Your Honor, this district is 39.36 percent African American."
2008.07-689,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3693.74,3697.56,"That's 40, and then -- oh, I see, 39 plus 11."
2008.07-689,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3697.56,3703.464,"And you need 11 percent crossover voting, 11 percent of the electorate--"
