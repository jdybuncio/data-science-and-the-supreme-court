1989.88-1932,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.737,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88-1932, United States against German Munoz-Flores."
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,8.939,12.391,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1932,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,44.279,54.151,Did your office raise the justiciability question in its petition for certiorari?
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,54.151,54.585,"Not directly, Your Honor."
1989.88-1932,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,55.168,57.003,"But then you don't think much of it, I take it."
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,57.003,73.362,"--Well, Your Honor, we felt that the issue on which there was a conflict among the lower courts at the time we filed the petition and a conflict among the circuits at the time we... this Court addressed the petition, was the... on the merits."
1989.88-1932,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,190.72,195.541,"But, Mr. Bryson, does that mean in some other case one would not defer?"
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,195.541,196.157,--No.
1989.88-1932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,244.688,252.711,"I take it that... that the House has always got a remedy, hasn't it?"
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,252.711,253.128,Exactly.
1989.88-1932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,254.061,269.237,And we... no... no court would ever be asked to review a... to review the House's decision that... not to... not to pass a bill it... it thought should have originated there and didn't.
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,269.237,270.172,--That's exactly right.
1989.88-1932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,280.695,281.178,That's right.
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,281.178,282.747,--with the procedure and with the substance.
1989.88-1932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,283.497,285.015,And the President is too.
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,285.015,286.599,"--And the President is too, exactly."
1989.88-1932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,319.236,321.938,"Could you say the same thing, Mr. Bryson, for the legislative veto?"
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,321.938,322.455,No.
1989.88-1932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.455,323.39,Why not?
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,339.567,340.852,"No, we wouldn't... you wouldn't."
1989.88-1932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,340.852,342.169,"Well, why should we let the House do it?"
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,342.169,346.673,"Because the House is not really, we think, giving away a power here."
1989.88-1932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,354.926,360.044,It's an inter-House dispute which is just as important as far as separation of the various powers of the government is concerned.
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,360.894,362.144,"Your Honor, we... we think it is not."
1989.88-1932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.496,395.381,"Well, that... but that's just demeaning the importance of the constitutional provision."
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,408.625,415.795,"--I think you give full effect, Your Honor, by allowing the House to decide whether there has been an Origination Clause violation."
1989.88-1932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,416.312,422.616,Just as could allow the President to decide whether the... the bill veto clause has been... has been offended.
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,423.134,432.573,--You don't and I think the difference is because in the legislative veto case you... you're talking about the presentation to the court of something that simply is not a statute.
1989.88-1932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.727,439.777,But that... but that begs the question.
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,444.464,445.748,"Well, Your Honor, let--"
1989.88-1932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,445.748,453.154,"And if one of those requirements is... is this sequence, then it's not a statute, just as something that is passed without both Houses is not a statute."
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,453.154,467.127,"--Well, I... I would disagree, Your Honor, because... to take the next clause that appears in the Constitution after the Origination Clause, the Presentment Clause requires when a bill is sent to the President, that if the President decides not to approve the bill, he sends it back to the House from which it originated."
1989.88-1932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,502.901,505.336,xxx is that what you are saying?
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,505.336,506.371,Not... not really.
1989.88-1932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,507.088,508.404,That all these sequential things don't... don't amount to much.
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,509.24,509.79,--No.
1989.88-1932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.79,510.99,I... don't want to say that.
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,510.99,511.69,"No, I think it's a matter of constitutional remedy."
1989.88-1932,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,512.357,525.333,"Well, Mr. Bryson, are you... are you relying on the... when you cite us to the second paragraph of Section 7 of the express language that if a bill passes both Houses and is signed by the President, even after a veto, it shall become law?"
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,530.404,541.61,"--Well, that certainly is support for the position that we are taking that... that once the House is satisfied that the Origination Clause has been fulfilled, that--"
1989.88-1932,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,541.61,547.329,"Well, couldn't one argue that the entire Section 7 has been satisfied if the second paragraph has been satisfied?"
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,547.329,548.198,--One certainly could.
1989.88-1932,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,550.817,552.7,Which one couldn't argue in the executive veto case.
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,552.7,553.519,--That's right.
1989.88-1932,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,634.971,650.147,"Well, of course, all of your comments to the effect that this is just ministerial and it seems to be rather a minor matter are quite inconsistent with the other prong of your argument in which you tell us the House has been very jealous to guard this prerogative."
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,650.147,651.23,"--Your Honor,--"
1989.88-1932,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,651.23,654.765,I would assume that this is a very important prerogative for the House.
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,674.595,675.445,--Exactly.
1989.88-1932,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,793.086,808.08,"Mr. Bryson, in Buckley against Valeo the court held that the provision in the Federal Election Commission Act providing for appointments violated the President's authority under the Appointments Clause."
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,837.432,839.967,I think that's certainly an important feature of our argument.
1989.88-1932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,854.411,860.731,"Well, you know, they're just not going to... [inaudible] will never be here."
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,860.731,862.75,--That's certainly true.
1989.88-1932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,873.022,875.057,"Well, that isn't conflict between the two Houses, that's a conflict between--"
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,875.057,876.723,--Within--
1989.88-1932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,876.723,878.842,--some other person and both of the Houses.
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,878.842,879.359,--That's right.
1989.88-1932,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,881.875,891.048,Would you agree that bicameralism is one of the most important structural components of the Constitution insofar as The Federalist papers and Framers were concerned?
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,891.048,891.517,I would.
1989.88-1932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.933,906.443,"Mr. Bryson, I... I will... I will remind the Solicitor General of the argument you are making today at the time when the House and the Senate decide that it would be much more efficient to conduct all of their business through joint committees."
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,906.443,909.395,"Well, I--"
1989.88-1932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,909.395,926.754,"And... and at that point I... I will say that the Justice Department seems to have taken the position that after all this is... this is a family affair, it's just an internal dispute within the Legislative Branch and that's really not as important as disputes between the separate branches."
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,926.754,948.854,"--Well, I think... without trying to give a global answer to all of these questions, I think it is wise to look at the language that the court used in Baker against Carr when the court said that it is necessary to make a discriminating inquiry into the precise facts and postures... posture of each particular case and the impossibility of resolution by semantic cataloguing."
1989.88-1932,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,962.779,964.429,"Precisely my point, Mr. Bryson."
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,964.429,969.517,"--The... on the merits, if I can turn to the merits now."
1989.88-1932,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1089.796,1120.065,"Well, it's your position then that if the government decided we needed a new national network of roads or needed to massively expend money to repair those we have and enacted an income tax increase for that purpose and put the money in the general revenue with the idea that it wanted to support the road building, no Origination Clause problem if the bill originates in the Senate."
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1120.065,1124.767,"That's... that's correct, Your Honor, and I think the Millard case is almost... almost on point with that."
1989.88-1932,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1160.69,1162.773,"Well, that's a pretty extreme position."
1989.88-1932,0,44079,william_c_bryson,,1168.177,1175.199,"Well, you don't because this case, I think, is a good deal easier than that and I am just trying to lay out what the limits of the Court's doctrine had... have been."
1989.88-1932,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1560.804,1563.088,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1932,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.579,1632.197,"But... but in England, the... the House of Lords could not amend the bill."
1989.88-1932,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1660.883,1663.633,It lost some strength in the compromise.
1989.88-1932,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.339,1764.295,"Ms. Clarke, another clause of the Constitution says that a majority of each House shall constitute a quorum to do business."
1989.88-1932,1,29518,judy_clare_clarke,,1783.59,1784.708,--I would object to that.
1989.88-1932,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3101.189,3102.889,Thank you.
1989.88-1932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3169.864,3173.833,"No, but it's not the government giving and... and the taxpayer receiving."
1989.88-1932,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3175.166,3177.035,"No, because the government is acting as a stakeholder for the--"
1989.88-1932,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3177.035,3179.418,"And in a sense you say, no, it's for the benefit of all the people."
1989.88-1932,2,44079,william_c_bryson,,3186.74,3187.54,"--Well, it is--"
