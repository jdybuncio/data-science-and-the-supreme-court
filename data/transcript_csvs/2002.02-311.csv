2002.02-311,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.434,"We'll hear argument next in Number 02-311, Kevin Wiggins versus Sewall Smith."
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,53.81,60.355,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-311,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,108.617,116.16,"Do you think the Williams case is a white horse for you, that is, I mean, that it is exactly identical to this case?"
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,116.16,141.489,"I do not think it's exactly identical to this case, Your Honor, but we think it clearly informs this case both by explaining what an... what an objectively unreasonable application of Strickland amounts to and in emphasizing the critical importance of investigating a... a... your client's background as... as a prerequisite to making informed, reasonable choices about how best to defend your client."
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,141.489,145.649,But... but wasn't Williams decided after the Maryland Supreme Court's opinion here?
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,145.649,147.364,"Yes, it was Justice Scalia, but--"
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,147.364,154.677,"So, therefore, it can't be used for purposes of deciding whether what Maryland did was an unreasonable application of then-existing Federal law."
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,154.677,157.647,"--I disagree with that, Justice Scalia, for the following reason."
2002.02-311,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,186.798,191.808,You go back to Strickland and you can't find the principle that you're now enunciating.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,191.808,193.289,"Oh, no, no."
2002.02-311,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,222.582,234.774,"Last year in Bell... Bell versus Cohen... Cone, we stressed that it is a tremendously deferential regard that we have to the lawyer's action in a case like that."
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,234.774,239.375,"Yes, but there's a fundamental difference between this case and Bell v. Cone, Mr. Chief Justice, and it's this."
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,270.107,273.933,"Is that what this case is about, Mr. Verrilli, about failure to investigate?"
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,273.933,276.313,"This case is about both, but it's principally about--"
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,276.313,285.946,"It would seem to me if it were, you would have to establish pretty clearly that counsel did not know these many things that you say he did not know."
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,365.32,367.384,"--I disagree with that, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,367.384,368.224,"Well, how do we know that he didn't know it?"
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,368.224,369.226,"Well, here's how."
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.616,411.033,I... I have to correct you.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,441.027,443.309,"--Justice Scalia, that is not how the--"
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,443.309,443.912,That's how it reads.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,443.912,444.804,--Maryland Court of Appeals read it.
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.375,450.359,The court of appeals and the Fourth Circuit must have read it wrong because that's the way it reads.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,450.359,464.689,"But... but, Justice Scalia, what matters here for AEDPA purposes under (d)(2) is whether the court of appeals based its determination on an unreasonable factual finding, and there are two... there are two critical indicia here that it did."
2002.02-311,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,487.945,490.69,This was in the trial itself or in a State habeas proceeding?
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,490.69,492.269,"In the State habeas proceeding, Your Honor."
2002.02-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,563.553,567.292,So that counsel referred to other people's reports and other reports.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,579.059,580.03,"--Well, I think there was--"
2002.02-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,580.03,581.448,And the pre-sentence and social--
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,581.448,581.928,--Pre-sentence.
2002.02-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,581.928,582.857,--and social services?
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,584.623,591.587,The... there is a document which the State has lodged which indicates that there were transcripts of interviews with family members.
2002.02-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,613.767,616.992,--And... and the psychologist's is the social... social services report.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,616.992,617.819,--No.
2002.02-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,618.87,620.031,That's a separate report.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,620.031,620.538,--That's a separate--
2002.02-311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,620.538,628.028,"That's exactly my... look, there is a document here called lodging and it says, Baltimore City Department of Social Services Department File."
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,634.141,635.167,--They are--
2002.02-311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,635.167,635.894,I don't think they're there.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,635.894,636.682,--They are not there.
2002.02-311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,636.682,656.476,"But this says, other people's reports, and I'm perhaps going to hear in about 20 minutes from now that there could be other reports to which he was referring which are not in this document and which might be those other... those other interviews with other people, et cetera."
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,703.1,704.869,"Justice Breyer, let me... let me--"
2002.02-311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,704.869,707.244,Or I suspect I'll hear that because I've read it.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,707.244,707.937,--Let me address--
2002.02-311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,707.937,708.422,So I would like you--
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,708.422,717.5,"--Let me address that directly because I think this goes to the essence of why the Maryland Court of Appeals judgment was an unreasonable application of... of the Strickland rule, and it's this."
2002.02-311,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,735.969,740.43,--That would have involved the principal issue had they... as a separate--
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,740.43,741.064,Right.
2002.02-311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,807.638,831.647,"--What about the first part which was Justice Kennedy's part, I think so far all of our parts... questions, which is when you read just the part that Justice Scalia read to you... and he says it's on the basis of other people's reports... will the other side concede or how do we know it's... what he's referring to is this document rather than some other set of documents?"
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,831.647,841.34,"Well, I think what's critical in that regard is what the Maryland Court of Appeals found because what AEDPA requires deference to is factual findings made by a State court."
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,878.403,880.775,"Did it say, and nothing else?"
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,880.775,881.415,--It said--
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.415,886.064,You're... you're making it as though it was a factual finding that this is all that he knew.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,891.44,907.53,--They... the factual... the only factual finding they made... the only... the only... the only thing that supports and explicates the general statement at the outset of that paragraph that they were aware of his unfortunate childhood is the specific factual finding that the social service records documented sexual abuse and documented physical abuse.
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.154,933.821,"Mr. Verrilli, I'd like to come back to the habeas... the State habeas decision that you... that you cited us to, which is on the joint appendix page 604."
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1001.933,1002.741,--But--
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1002.741,1007.267,The court should have had to find they did not have this information.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1010.945,1012.302,"--Justice Scalia, I disagree."
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1015.927,1017.246,You... you tell me what it means.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1017.858,1018.36,--The trial--
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1018.36,1021.234,--I have no reason to believe that they did have all of this information.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1021.234,1025.409,--The trial judge said that he was concluding that it was error not to investigate.
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.948,1029.343,No.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1035.404,1036.897,"--With all due respect, Justice Scalia--"
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1036.897,1038.536,--I don't know any capital case in which a social history wasn't done.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1038.536,1039.29,--With all due respect--
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1039.29,1043.531,I think he... I think he reversed simply because you're always supposed to do a social history.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1043.531,1050.033,"--With all due respect, Your Honor, the very sentence that you pointed to said, based on the evidence that I have seen, I'm concluding it was error for them not to investigate it."
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1053.198,1053.771,No.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1055.386,1056.216,And that's completely supported by the proffer.
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1056.216,1057.8,--He reached the conclusion because he--
2002.02-311,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1057.8,1058.974,--No two voices at the same time.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1060.308,1060.524,Excuse me.
2002.02-311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1060.524,1065.081,"He reached the conclusion because he said, I have no reason to believe that they had the information."
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1067.337,1081.193,"I think that's implicit, Justice Scalia, in his conclusion that it was error not to investigate, and I think it's completely confirmed by the proffer which didn't include any of this information and for which there would have been absolutely no explanation for its exclusion."
2002.02-311,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1093.481,1098.312,"Mr. Verrilli, you said absolutely no reason why it wouldn't come in if they had it."
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1176.473,1182.307,"Well, I think, Your Honor, I'm going to answer Your Honor's question directly, but I... I need a minute to do it."
2002.02-311,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1182.307,1182.542,Yes.
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1182.542,1195.872,"The question under Strickland, it seems to us, is that once you've concluded that there was a failure to investigate adequately, the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different as a result of that failure."
2002.02-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1295.24,1295.803,Do you--
2002.02-311,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1296.034,1302.231,--What do you think the test is that Williams against Taylor lays down as to determining a... a probability of a different outcome?
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1302.231,1307.544,"Well, I think, if I may just draw from Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion with respect to that."
2002.02-311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1351.116,1362.754,Are... are you making any argument that the ruling on the bifurcation motion might also have been different if there had been a proffer of this?
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1368.568,1370.86,"The... factually, Justice Kennedy, it's the latter."
2002.02-311,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1375.358,1379.85,"Is... is that a common motion in Maryland capital cases, to try to bifurcate the sentencing proceeding?"
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1379.85,1390.573,"At the time it was, and the reason it was, Mr. Chief Justice, is because sometime shortly before this case was tried in Baltimore County, another Baltimore County judge had allowed such a motion."
2002.02-311,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1409.981,1413.4,"But they would... they would be fighting over the principalship too, would they not?"
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1413.4,1420.094,"Yes, but that... the point of bifurcation was to do principalship first, and if they prevailed on principalship, they wouldn't go to the second phase."
2002.02-311,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1451.978,1452.519,Mr.--
2002.02-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1452.519,1455.473,"--What about the psychological reports, Mr. Verrilli?"
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1457.968,1459.384,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
2002.02-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1459.384,1460.802,"And indeed, obtained by defense counsel."
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1460.802,1461.853,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
2002.02-311,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1461.853,1466.174,And what did they reveal in this area of mitigation?
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1466.174,1475.029,"They were... the... the... there are two things that are important about the psychologist's report: one, what it does contain; the other, what it doesn't contain."
2002.02-311,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1547.23,1560.474,"Mr. Verrilli, is... is there any evidence, one way or the other, as to whether defense counsel simply sat down with the defendant and said, tell us about your background and what has happened to you in your life?"
2002.02-311,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1562.883,1563.745,--There is not.
2002.02-311,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1595.551,1596.502,"Very well, Mr. Verrilli."
2002.02-311,1,25036,gary_e_bair,,1597.984,1602.953,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-311,2,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2807.663,2823.938,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-311,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2859.657,2863.0,What's the bifurcated... I've never heard of a bifurcated sentencing hearing.
2002.02-311,2,20994,dan_himmelfarb,,2863.724,2878.474,"--My understanding, Justice Breyer, is that the basis for the motion was that the principalship defense could be undermined by presenting the mitigating evidence, so they wanted to do it separately."
2002.02-311,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2878.474,2878.761,Right.
2002.02-311,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3427.445,3430.221,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.02-311,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3489.578,3492.092,He does that... he does that to argue--
2002.02-311,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3492.092,3494.032,--He's making a record for--
2002.02-311,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3494.032,3495.355,--after the fact that that the judge--
2002.02-311,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3495.355,3496.368,"--He's making a record for appeal, Justice Kennedy."
2002.02-311,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3669.636,3671.589,"Thank you, Mr. Verrilli."
