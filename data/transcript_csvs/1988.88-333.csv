1988.88-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.641,"We will hear argument next in No. 88-333, Alabama against James Lewis Smith."
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,12.641,23.096,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,92.51,96.295,"Let me get one thing straight in my mind, Mr. Bjurberg."
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,96.295,97.58,Yes.
1988.88-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,97.58,109.554,"The original appeal to the Alabama, it was the Court of Criminal Appeals in this case, was on the basis that the guilty plea had not been knowingly made?"
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,109.554,125.481,The narrow basis was that the Defendant was not told the correct minimum and maximum possible range of sentences under our habitual felony offender statute and an enhancement statute when a weapon or dangerous instrument is used.
1988.88-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,128.348,140.491,"So, he... he appealed his sentence on the guilty plea and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals upheld his appeal, and, what, sent it back for resentencing without that guilty plea?"
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,140.491,144.542,"They, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals sent back for a retrial."
1988.88-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,144.542,145.277,"Re... sure, for a trial--"
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,145.277,145.927,Right.
1988.88-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,145.927,147.294,--rather than a plea.
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,147.294,152.079,Yes.
1988.88-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,182.717,186.002,So it's not important that there was a plea bargain in this case?
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,186.669,188.235,It is important that there was a plea.
1988.88-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,190.887,193.073,"--No, a plea bargain."
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,193.073,195.691,"--I'm sorry, the... yeah, there was a plea bargain."
1988.88-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,195.691,203.547,Is that relevant to your case or is your case the same as if there had just been a guilty plea?
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,203.547,227.746,"It's important that there was a plea bargain in our case, because, in the plea bargain, the prosecutor and the court are oftentimes, or always, almost, engaging in exchange for that plea bargain, either sentencing concessions or charge concessions, as in this case."
1988.88-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,249.342,252.944,"Well, how often are there guilty pleas entered without a plea bargain?"
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,255.996,261.8,"I would say the very vast majority are entered with a plea bargain, yes, sir."
1988.88-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,261.8,265.102,So I'm not quite sure why that makes the case different from just any guilty plea.
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,283.583,299.775,"But the basis really is that the, the resulting increase in the sentence after the trial is based on this guilty plea because of the lack of information established at the, factual information established at the guilty plea."
1988.88-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,299.775,306.781,--Was there any factual information that the prosecutor obtained that he didn't have at the time of the guilty plea?
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,317.97,320.339,"Not in this record, no, sir, no."
1988.88-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,320.339,340.419,"So I suppose that your... the rule you would... you would argue for is one that, as long as the prosecutor doesn't tell the judge everything that might come out of the trial and the defendant sets aside the guilty plea by... it's unconstitutional grounds or whatever it might be, there could always be an increase in sentence if the judge thinks it's appropriate?"
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,340.419,347.239,"The focus of our case really is not the knowledge or the lack of knowledge of the facts that the prosecutor might have, but--"
1988.88-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,347.239,347.823,But what the judge has.
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,347.823,348.608,--But what the judge has--
1988.88-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,348.608,366.903,"And I'm suggesting to you that, under your rule, if I understand you correctly, if the prosecutor just withholds from the judge... not purposely, but just doesn't tell the judge all of the facts that might come out at the trial... then the judge learns something extra about the defendant's behavior at the trial, the judge could always enhance the sentence."
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,366.903,380.996,"--The judge will always be, in our position, in our situation, in... have knowledge of more facts in a trial situation."
1988.88-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,380.996,382.546,Right.
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,384.364,389.649,"Yes, yes."
1988.88-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,402.076,408.48,"But he could, he could always overcome whatever would be left of the presumption of vindictiveness in every case."
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,408.48,409.813,"Well, the rule we're arguing for is that--"
1988.88-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,409.813,412.448,But there's a guilty plea followed by a trial at which you learn something more.
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,412.448,415.884,--Yes.
1988.88-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,415.884,418.586,How is this case different from Pearce?
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,418.586,425.857,"This case essentially is different from Pearce in that, in Pearce, there was an initial trial and an appeal and then a subsequent trial."
1988.88-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,425.857,429.809,"That, that wasn't true as to the co-respondent in Pearce, Rice."
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,429.809,432.078,"Rice pleaded guilty, correct."
1988.88-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,432.078,436.38,"In Pearce, we held a vindictiveness rule applied."
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,439.265,440.951,"No, we're not asking--"
1988.88-333,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,440.951,447.205,"How do you distinguish this case from the position of the respondent, Rice, in Pearce?"
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,447.205,458.163,--The narrow focus of this Court in Rice was on whether or not a defendant under due process was entitled to credit for time served.
1988.88-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,473.338,474.438,I'm not sure I understand it.
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,496.336,498.221,--Right.
1988.88-333,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.045,590.647,But that's also an explanation that would be present in every guilty plea case.
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,590.647,600.105,--Yes.
1988.88-333,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,688.211,699.352,"Now, the, the Respondent tells us that there is some evidence of actual vindictiveness here."
1988.88-333,0,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,714.128,728.204,"--I believe it would be, that the... the Alabama Supreme Court could then engage in... in, or remand it to the Court of Criminal Appeals for them to determine whether or not there is evidence of actual vindictiveness."
1988.88-333,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,903.535,906.939,"Very well, Mr. Bjurberg."
1988.88-333,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,924.465,927.417,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1011.923,1019.029,"Do you think that that approach is consistent with the Court's decision in the Rice case, the companion case to Pearce?"
1988.88-333,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1019.029,1029.718,"But in the Rice case, the Court applied a presumption and the Court said that the state of Alabama, in that case, at no time sought to dispel that presumption."
1988.88-333,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1057.385,1062.956,But this case... but this case he relied solely on the Rice case.
1988.88-333,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1065.924,1066.726,"Correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-333,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1067.226,1069.795,And he relied on Rice alone.
1988.88-333,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1069.795,1070.495,--Correct.
1988.88-333,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1070.495,1072.997,And we have to say they're wrong.
1988.88-333,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1072.997,1073.83,Correct.
1988.88-333,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.587,1187.287,"You're saying this rule would apply only to plea bargains, then?"
1988.88-333,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1187.287,1193.157,"No, I think as an empirical matter, it... the correlation between this rule and plea bargains is going to be very high."
1988.88-333,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1196.56,1201.012,Not if you distinguish it... not if you distinguish Rice the way you've just proposed.
1988.88-333,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1201.012,1205.416,"Well, if you distinguish Rice that way and you exclude the plea bargaining process, then, yes."
1988.88-333,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.285,1372.308,"Mr. Larkin, if we agree with you, why shouldn't we give the Supreme Court of Alabama the chance to decide on this thing without the benefit of the presumption?"
1988.88-333,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1386.901,1387.618,Yes.
1988.88-333,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1408.564,1414.837,"And that inquiry hasn't been made here, so... so it would still be available to... to the Supreme Court of Alabama to make that inquiry, no?"
1988.88-333,1,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,1414.837,1416.353,You are correct on both counts.
1988.88-333,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1422.841,1423.776,"Very well, Mr. Larkin."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1447.724,1450.426,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.88-333,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1495.789,1496.939,"Well, isn't that a bargain?"
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1496.939,1498.574,--There was a bargain that included--
1988.88-333,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1498.574,1499.807,That's the bargain.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1506.347,1508.18,"--Justice O'Connor, that's absolutely correct."
1988.88-333,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1571.872,1587.882,"Well, do you concede that, at least as to the third charge that was restored when he went to trial, that the judge had complete flexibility within the statutory sentencing scheme to sentence for that offense?"
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1587.882,1589.834,"Justice O'Connor, that is clear on the record."
1988.88-333,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1643.219,1645.92,"What about the sodomy charge, uh, Ms. Boyd?"
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1653.157,1653.943,"No, sir."
1988.88-333,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1653.943,1654.393,It was not?
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1654.393,1658.645,Burglary and rape and sodomy were all charged.
1988.88-333,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1676.273,1677.107,Thirty years on each?
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1677.107,1677.725,"--Yes, sir."
1988.88-333,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.725,1678.509,Concurrent?
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1678.509,1679.642,Concurrent.
1988.88-333,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1679.642,1682.861,It was a... a sentence of from two to 30 years?
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1682.861,1684.896,"No, sir... no, Your Honor."
1988.88-333,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1761.546,1764.248,"And what, what charge was added, again?"
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1764.248,1764.931,Sodomy.
1988.88-333,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1764.931,1765.415,Sodomy.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1765.415,1772.853,"Sodomy at that point was reinstituted and that is why, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, the state has lost nothing in its bargain."
1988.88-333,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1778.34,1780.107,"What... what, what were the new sentences?"
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1780.107,1787.78,"The new sentences were these: burglary, life; sodomy, life, to run concurrent."
1988.88-333,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.407,1834.959,You think the rape sentence has been... set aside entirely?
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1834.959,1840.013,"--It has not yet, because the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals remanded that."
1988.88-333,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.365,1846.933,"Anyway, it's not in effect; it was set aside, wasn't it?"
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1846.933,1850.885,"--In effect, it was set aside as statutorily exceeding the maximum."
1988.88-333,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.885,1851.236,Right.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1852.453,1854.105,Why does Pearce apply?
1988.88-333,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1893.913,1899.801,But I didn't think the Court of Appeals had addressed itself to that question of actual vindictiveness.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1899.801,1915.911,"--Justice O'Connor, the Court of Appeals did not detail in its opinion any... any... analysis of it, but, as I read the Alabama Supreme Court opinion, the, it held that the presumption wasn't overcome."
1988.88-333,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1938.092,1946.032,"Well, I thought the Supreme Court of Alabama applied the Pearce presumption and that that was how the case was resolved."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1950.484,1958.256,The Pearce presumption is a presumption of vindictiveness upon the occurrence of certain factors.
1988.88-333,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1958.256,1958.94,Right.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,1967.296,1971.064,Its opinion does not set forth an analysis.
1988.88-333,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.49,1988.275,"Excuse me, I... I... I... I'm... I... I'm not sure I'm understanding you."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2002.549,2002.816,--Pearce--
1988.88-333,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2002.816,2004.966,It's up to the state to refute that presumption.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2007.901,2013.089,"--What the Alabama court did, Your Honor, was say that the evidence that was offered by the state--"
1988.88-333,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.089,2013.639,Was not enough.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2013.639,2014.274,--was not enough.
1988.88-333,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.857,2016.124,To overcome the presumption.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2016.524,2017.007,Yes.
1988.88-333,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2017.007,2031.784,"But, now, if we disagree with that... and this is what Justice O'Connor and I were getting to... if we disagree with that, if we think there shouldn't have been a presumption, we would still have to send it back so that Alabama could then consider, had there not been a presumption, would we have found on the facts that there was vindictiveness."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2033.319,2040.322,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that there is ample evidence on this record to support the Supreme Court's finding."
1988.88-333,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.862,2050.297,All right.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2050.297,2060.719,"But, in so doing, you would not, based on your own case law, be asking the Alabama Supreme Court to actually find actual vindictiveness, because--"
1988.88-333,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2060.719,2063.855,Unless we disagreed that Pearce as applicable here.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2063.855,2064.288,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-333,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2077.764,2080.132,"But, there... those are two different inquiries."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2100.63,2101.18,I agree.
1988.88-333,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2126.963,2133.351,"But that's opposed to the... that goes to whether the presumption should apply and not to whether there was, in fact, actual vindictiveness."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2133.351,2135.386,"The presumption should apply, Your Honor--"
1988.88-333,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2135.386,2136.586,That... that... that's what you say.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2138.421,2144.492,"--Well, let... let... let me go directly to some reasoning for why the presumption should apply."
1988.88-333,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2179.582,2182.867,Suppose this were a different judge.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2191.64,2196.258,This Court has held that a different judge would make a difference.
1988.88-333,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2224.027,2244.524,"But I thought that, in considering whether the Pearce presumption should apply in a given situation, we look to the generality of cases and the likelihood of whether, in all cases, there is such a realistic... likelihood of vindictiveness that we should, in fact, apply a presumption."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2251.011,2268.973,"--Although this Court's opinion in McCullough, the majority opinion was not embraced by this entire Court, it specifically suggested that it is a case-by-case analysis that ought to be employed because of the difficulty in ascertaining actual vindictiveness."
1988.88-333,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2344.89,2347.456,"But, Ms. Boyd, may I... may I ask you a question at this point?"
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2366.886,2367.886,"No, Your Honor."
1988.88-333,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2387.55,2388.733,But doesn't he have a duty to do that?
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2398.541,2401.559,--What is not normal is what the trial judge did here.
1988.88-333,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2409.396,2410.082,By the Defendant--
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2410.082,2423.223,"--by the Defendant, without, uh, advice of counsel, without knowledge of counsel, and he stated his own adoption of... of the implications of guilt that came in those letters."
1988.88-333,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2426.258,2428.71,--But that was after the defendant had entered a guilty plea.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2428.71,2430.46,"It was before his sentencing, however."
1988.88-333,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2430.46,2431.446,"Yes, I understand."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2443.553,2451.575,"Well, if that judge was not the same judge, to proceed with the retrial--"
1988.88-333,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2451.575,2457.194,"Well, but I think what you're really arguing is that the sent... the judge who accepts a guilty plea should never handle the retrial."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2457.194,2458.996,"--No, I'm not arguing that, Your Honor."
1988.88-333,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2463.55,2470.871,All the things that you say that this judge did only go to convincing him that this Defendant was guilty.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2486.38,2490.848,"What this judge did went beyond the initial guilty plea, Your Honor."
1988.88-333,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.8,2493.2,"Well, so much the better."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2496.236,2505.675,"--Well, what do we do with the defendant's due process right to believe that he is going to have a fair trial at the hand of a judge who has no predisposition--"
1988.88-333,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.675,2506.742,--I'm not talking about that.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2515.047,2516.749,--That is the preferred procedure.
1988.88-333,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2543.383,2550.22,"But that... that, but that... you... you're almost arguing that the judge should have disqualified himself, uh, from trying the case."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2550.22,2555.024,He was asked to do so and he was asked to do because the Defendant had a reasonable basis for--
1988.88-333,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2555.024,2556.39,"But, but that, that, that isn't the point here."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2567.665,2584.044,"--The Pearce presumption, Your Honor, as I read Rice and the underlying case, is grounded on a due process right that recognizes not only actual vindictiveness, but a defendant's perception of vindictiveness."
1988.88-333,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2627.737,2630.239,May I ask one other question about the procedure here?
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2647.7,2650.086,It was not challenged below and that's why it's not here.
1988.88-333,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2650.086,2651.202,So you... so you... it's not before it.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2656.74,2661.21,"Well, the difference is that, uh, the sentences were to run concurrently."
1988.88-333,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.21,2662.477,"Well, they do run concurrently, don't they?"
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2662.477,2670.149,"Burglary and, and sodomy, at the second sentencing were both life sentences running concurrently."
1988.88-333,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2683.123,2684.159,You say it... it does or does not affect?
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2684.159,2687.777,It does... it does affect it because it's the sentence that's running concurrently.
1988.88-333,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2691.896,2699.669,"Yeah, but if you... if we vacate the burglary sentence, if you totally vacate the burglary sentence, the sodomy sentence would stand, wouldn't it?"
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2699.669,2701.169,--The sodomy sentence would stand.
1988.88-333,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2708.858,2709.225,Yeah.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2717.146,2719.582,"Well, I think it does, Your Honor."
1988.88-333,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2735.758,2736.608,"Well, I understand that, that argument, yeah."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2742.912,2754.636,"--It would not, but then, again, this... he is still free to make some appellate, uh, challenges on the sodomy sentence, because we haven't gone back on remand yet."
1988.88-333,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2768.913,2774.75,"Well, the Alabama Supreme Court seemed to think that it should decide, uh, the validity of the burglary sentence."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2774.75,2775.752,That it should or should not?
1988.88-333,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2775.752,2776.569,That it should.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2776.569,2777.935,That was the only thing before it.
1988.88-333,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2777.935,2778.452,Yes.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2785.541,2786.558,I was not trial counsel.
1988.88-333,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2805.521,2810.573,"Well, you still would have to exhaust your state remedies with respect to the--"
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2810.573,2814.627,"--And whether they have been exhausted is still in question, because it hasn't gone back on remand."
1988.88-333,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2814.627,2817.746,"--Or, or, or whether they've been, or whether they would now be procedurally barred?"
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2817.746,2821.448,I think both issues are still open because of the procedural posture of this case.
1988.88-333,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2897.531,2919.877,"Well, but we... we allow even, even when crimes are... are not prosecuted simultaneously with the... with the crime that he's being sentenced for, and, indeed, even when he hasn't been convicted of them yet, we... we allow, at the penalty phase, other crimes to be considered, or other unlawful conduct to be considered in deciding what... what punishment to impose for this one."
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2919.877,2926.383,"Justice Scalia, that may be the case, but we don't need to speculate that this trial judge did consider those other crimes."
1988.88-333,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2941.143,2942.41,"Well, look it... he, he did say,"
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,2962.723,2966.675,"Well, Pearce requires him to justify each sentence."
1988.88-333,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2976.483,2977.283,It shows new evidence of other crimes.
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,3012.906,3013.789,That is a correct statement.
1988.88-333,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3013.789,3018.81,So the... the... the 150-year consecutive sentence is for rape?
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,3018.81,3020.929,Yes.
1988.88-333,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3044.794,3049.996,"Well... well, getting back to the burglary conviction, the, uh, element of, the offense of burglary is"
1988.88-333,2,20570,delores_r_boyd,,3073.128,3091.339,"Justice Kennedy, the legislative scheme for... for punishment of burglary, rape and sodomy considered... took into consideration the fact that a burglary is entry of a residence to commit another crime, and, in doing so, categorized it as a Class A felony, separately punishable."
1988.88-333,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3204.595,3205.745,"Thank you, Ms. Boyd."
1988.88-333,3,37702,p_david_bjurberg,,3208.13,3209.68,"No, Your Honor, I don't."
1988.88-333,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3209.68,3211.18,"Very well, the case is submitted."
