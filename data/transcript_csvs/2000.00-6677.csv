2000.00-6677,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.795,"We'll hear argument next in number <oh oh sixty six seven seven> [=00-6677], John Paul Penry versus Gary Johnson."
2000.00-6677,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,15.838,18.431,Mr. Chief Justice.
2000.00-6677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.366,156.109,"It was impossible there under the instructions that were there given, but the instructions here given made it very clear that if you considered the mental deficiency to be a mitigating factor you should answer one of the three questions ""no""."
2000.00-6677,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,196.64,200.997,"--I think that's clear, Your Honor, indeed I said it and I thought I was being clear when I said it."
2000.00-6677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.997,202.591,I thought you were imminently clear.
2000.00-6677,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,202.591,212.586,"But I... but I was not a judge, Your Honor, and there is no one of whom a jury is likely to be more skeptical in a situation like that than defense counsel."
2000.00-6677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,231.125,251.476,"How about this sentence: if you determine when giving mitigating effect to the mitigating evidence, if any, that a life sentence as reflected by a negative finding to the issue under consideration rather than a death sentence is an appropriate response to the personal culpability of the defendant, a negative finding should be given to one of the special issues."
2000.00-6677,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,251.476,256.896,"--I respectfully submit that's much less than clear, Your Honor, and becomes even less clear if you read the preceding sentence."
2000.00-6677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,275.686,283.478,"Right, and then the next sentence explains just what he means by giving, in assessing the defendant's personal culpability."
2000.00-6677,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,302.034,309.079,"I can only respectfully beg to differ, Your Honor, and in doing so I'll... let me stress a couple of phrases."
2000.00-6677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,332.414,340.426,--This is also the jury that you told on I guess it was you doing the voir dire as well--
2000.00-6677,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,340.426,340.879,"No, it wasn't."
2000.00-6677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,340.879,353.108,"--Now this instruction that you got, this is almost like a fourth issue in that you will hear this other evidence that comes in about the defendant, you will take that into consideration when you are answering these three issues."
2000.00-6677,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,353.108,357.982,"That was a voir dire, that wasn't me actually Your Honor that was a voir dire back in March."
2000.00-6677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,357.982,359.013,That was pretty well done too I thought.
2000.00-6677,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,359.013,368.305,"Done by Joe Price, who's a very able man but he was doing it back in March and the jury didn't deliberate until July."
2000.00-6677,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,460.346,463.47,Do we have the verdict form that you're talking about?
2000.00-6677,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,465.064,473.967,--You certainly do and I believe it's at 676 of the joint appendix.
2000.00-6677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.49,534.004,--What is confusing about the instruction
2000.00-6677,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,555.262,566.818,"Well, what is... a number of things I think are confusing about it including the extraordinary fact that it doesn't give them any hint which one to pick, but the words I would focus on are most strongly--"
2000.00-6677,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.818,598.385,"If it had given them a hint as to which one to pick, you'd object to that, the fact is that we all acknowledge as we held in Penry One, it doesn't naturally come under any one of them so the judge's instruction was the Supreme Court has said this mitigating evidence doesn't come under any one of the three, so in effect, as counsel said in the voir dire, I'm creating a fourth special issue and if you find mental incapacity, say no to any one of the three and I think that's what this sentence says."
2000.00-6677,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,598.385,608.082,"--I submit it would have been significantly less confusing if they had indeed put a fourth question on the piece of paper Your Honor, but I also want to call your attention in the instruction to the words"
2000.00-6677,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,633.902,638.602,At any rate the verdict form that they got gave them the three questions.
2000.00-6677,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,640.539,641.539,There was no fourth question.
2000.00-6677,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,641.539,653.08,"So if a jury is hearing fleetingly this long instruction then gets a piece of paper with three choices answer yes or no, maybe it's not so clear."
2000.00-6677,0,40421,robert_s_smith,,653.08,659.406,I figure it was not so clear especially if they do not necessarily take defense counsel's word unsupported by the prosecutor--
2000.00-6677,1,17111,andy_taylor,,1585.176,1587.143,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
2000.00-6677,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2792.643,2828.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, despite the lip service that the petitioner pays to Edpa, the fundamental flaw in both of his claims is that they ignore the statute's threshold requirement and that is that the principal of federal law on which he relies be clearly established in this Court's decisions and not just arguably established."
2000.00-6677,3,40421,robert_s_smith,,3412.567,3414.77,Thank you.
