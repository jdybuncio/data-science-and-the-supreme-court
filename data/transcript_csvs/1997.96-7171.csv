1997.96-7171,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.127,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-7171, Randy G. Spencer v. Mike Kemna."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,9.377,13.46,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:--"
1997.96-7171,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,92.081,92.982,It does?
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,118.62,120.321,Justice Breyer--
1997.96-7171,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,120.321,121.342,"Am I wrong, because... yes."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,121.342,123.403,"--Justice Breyer, I've two responses to that."
1997.96-7171,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,140.974,150.13,"I thought... am I not... what I was saying is, I thought that that which does it is not the parole revocation, it is that for which the parole was revoked."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,166.101,168.493,--I agree with--
1997.96-7171,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,168.493,168.833,Tell me if I'm--
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,168.833,175.537,"--I agree with what you're saying, Justice Breyer, but in Sibron this Court... this Court considered that question in respect to criminal convictions--"
1997.96-7171,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,175.537,181.582,"--All right, but I mean, the first part was, is that right, and then if I'm right, then why... then you're going to explain why it doesn't matter."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,182.363,183.913,--Well... yes.
1997.96-7171,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,225.13,245.753,"But in Lane v. Williams we said that the same factors don't apply, that the parole revocation situation not becoming moot, we limited Sibron to say what it said, the legal consequences, and said that some of the other consequences that you're talking about did not prevent it from becoming moot."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,252.407,254.649,"Certainly not abandon, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-7171,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,254.649,257.841,But considerably cut back on it.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,257.841,259.511,"I'm not even sure of that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-7171,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,285.461,291.465,But didn't we say in Lane that consequences... we're talking about whether something becomes moot.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,301.229,302.391,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-7171,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.782,306.335,What has changed?
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,306.335,311.858,"Well, first of all the Court's doctrine on that has changed, because in Evitts the Court added--"
1997.96-7171,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.858,315.742,That was a footnote in... on a point that wasn't even argued.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,315.742,318.821,"--Well, Your Honor, I believe... well now, of course, Your Honor, I wouldn't know whether it was argued."
1997.96-7171,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,319.693,323.805,"Well, you can tell whether... just from the way it's put in a footnote you can tell it wasn't argued."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,323.805,330.491,"Your Honor, the material that is most damaging to my client in Lane is also in a footnote."
1997.96-7171,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,403.629,412.183,"Well, are you saying then that whether or not a case has become moot may depend upon the seriousness of the charges in the parole revocation?"
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,412.183,416.255,"--Only if the Court chooses to apply Sibron to parole revocations, Your Honor."
1997.96-7171,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,447.857,458.425,"Well, Mr. Simon, as I understand it, you're concerned about the stigma as it would apply at the point of a subsequent parole revocation."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,485.273,494.6,"Your Honor, we have been a little more soft spoken about the parole consequences per se, but we have never abandoned them, and they--"
1997.96-7171,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,494.6,505.816,Did you argue them in the... I thought your argument on the circuit was that the adverse consequences that you're concerned about are adverse consequences at the point of a later parole revocation.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,508.36,523.821,"--I... Your Honor, I am not sure about where the focus of it was, except that in the Eighth Circuit the focus was on the parole consequences as... and to the exclusion, I will concede, of later consequences such as sentence enhancement."
1997.96-7171,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,523.821,523.848,"Let me ask you a different question, if I may."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,550.345,550.936,Yes.
1997.96-7171,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,550.936,551.895,You could be heard on that.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,551.895,552.386,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-7171,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,552.386,589.201,"Is it also the case... do you assume that you could also make this argument: you may not consider the fact of the earlier parole revocation as such independently of the underlying conduct, because I was doing my best, I had done my best to litigate that by means of habeas at the time I was released, and therefore the habeas issue became moot and I could never go to judgment, so therefore you shall not consider, you must not consider the parole revocation as such."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,594.033,601.958,"Your Honor, if I were representing Mr. Spencer on that hypothetical case I would certainly make the argument that you're suggesting, Justice Souter."
1997.96-7171,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.645,630.968,"Mr. Simon, may I just clarify one thing?"
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,673.787,681.953,"Justice Ginsburg, the guideline that you're quoting is from the Missouri sentencing guidelines rather than their parole guidelines."
1997.96-7171,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,698.714,710.9,"It says... can we take the case, then, that there's not a single statute which attaches adverse consequences to parole revocation in and of itself."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,710.9,713.183,"No, Your Honor, we can't--"
1997.96-7171,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,713.183,713.742,Or am I wrong about that?
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,713.742,718.687,--We can't take that because of the 15-year window under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.
1997.96-7171,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,718.687,720.047,"No, there's... I'm sorry."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,728.755,731.955,"Well, it's... I guess it depends on what we mean by in and of itself."
1997.96-7171,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,731.955,732.235,No--
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,732.235,732.936,Consequences.
1997.96-7171,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,732.936,736.668,"--What I mean by this is the following, and I think maybe Justice Kennedy means the same."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,753.019,754.461,You can't attack it anyway?
1997.96-7171,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,754.461,755.14,"Well, I don't know."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,759.804,761.264,"No counsel, for example."
1997.96-7171,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,761.264,761.484,Yes.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,788.651,793.225,"Well, Justice Breyer, for me to advise you on the kinds of--"
1997.96-7171,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,793.225,793.405,"No, no."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,793.405,794.517,--Sentencing Guidelines--
1997.96-7171,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,794.517,794.835,You've read it recently--
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,794.835,796.227,--is like bringing coals to Newcastle.
1997.96-7171,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,796.227,804.282,"--You've read it recently with this in mind, and so I raised it because I fear I could be overlooking something, which is why I raised it."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,804.282,815.929,"Your Honor, the big picture in respect to the Sentencing Guidelines is that before the Sentencing Guidelines were authorized and adopted a Federal sentencing court had virtually unbridled discretion."
1997.96-7171,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,836.513,839.205,15-year window for what?
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,839.205,842.908,"For a previous incarceration, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-7171,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,842.908,846.19,For prior offenses.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,846.19,846.761,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-7171,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,846.761,849.413,Not parole revocation as such--
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,849.413,849.702,Not--
1997.96-7171,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,849.702,851.422,--for prior offenses.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,851.422,857.627,"--Not as such, Your Honor, but the parole revocation makes a difference in the 15-year window."
1997.96-7171,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,871.886,878.391,These all assume that he's going to commit another crime and be judged again or be up for parole again.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,879.533,884.324,"--No, Your Honor, because of the other... because of the other factors."
1997.96-7171,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.87,942.532,"Yes, but those are... I'm willing to acknowledge that people have those choices."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,958.003,961.476,"Agreed, Your Honor, and there's no way that I'm arguing that anyone should commit crimes."
1997.96-7171,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.408,983.129,I'm not talking about that.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1001.36,1002.261,"Yes, Justice."
1997.96-7171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1002.261,1005.884,"First, isn't... didn't... this man actually did commit another crime, didn't he?"
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1005.884,1014.009,"He committed a separate crime that is, we would submit, only marginally relevant to what's going on here."
1997.96-7171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1014.009,1014.519,"Oh, okay."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1014.519,1025.456,"It was... it was attempted stealing, nothing to compare with the serious sexual, violent weapons, drugs felonies that the State has found him guilty of without a trial."
1997.96-7171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1025.456,1027.379,"Let me ask my second question, then."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1050.264,1052.264,I shake hands with Mr. Layton and we go home.
1997.96-7171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1053.005,1057.316,You'd have... but is that conceivable in the way this thing might develop?
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1057.316,1061.9,"Theoretically conceivable, Your Honor."
1997.96-7171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1061.9,1065.172,But under your view what will happen if you win?
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1066.162,1079.071,"Oh, the relief we would ask for, Your Honor, is a remand to the Eighth Circuit for... with instructions to remand to the district court to allow the respondents and the petitioner to litigate the merits of his claims."
1997.96-7171,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1079.071,1081.022,--To say that it's not moot.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1081.022,1082.184,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-7171,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1082.184,1087.407,Do you... you said the Sentencing Guidelines regime is new.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1104.868,1105.559,Mm hmm.
1997.96-7171,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1105.559,1118.088,Is there something other than habeas that would enable you to expunge what you say is this unjust blot on the record?
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1118.088,1120.629,"Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
1997.96-7171,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1144.914,1151.968,"There's no other procedure in Missouri that could be used to expunge this, to get a hearing and to expunge it?"
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1163.358,1169.132,--I believe that his appropriate remedy was... in the State courts was a State habeas petition.
1997.96-7171,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.841,1220.854,"Well, that was the case for at least a century and a half, wasn't it?"
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1236.695,1237.975,"Agreed, Your Honor."
1997.96-7171,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1276.791,1297.183,"Well, they didn't amend it, but what do you think in the congressional statutes dealing with habeas corpus reflects a congressional desire that there be a hearing in Federal court for every asserted violation of the Federal Constitution in State criminal proceedings, or parole proceedings?"
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1297.183,1298.045,Every?
1997.96-7171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1298.886,1299.925,Okay.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1311.984,1312.394,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-7171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.426,1314.545,Okay.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1326.332,1327.374,"We go home, Your Honor."
1997.96-7171,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1327.374,1332.026,"I don't know why they don't do that and let you go home, because that's all they need, it seems to me."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1332.026,1341.752,"Well, Your Honor, the respondents are on the horns of a dilemma, because they're arguing here that, oh, this is just a parole revocation."
1997.96-7171,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1353.39,1356.402,When he comes up for sentencing on some new crime.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1356.402,1361.475,"--Or, Your Honor, when he is the victim in an automobile accident and has to testify--"
1997.96-7171,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1361.475,1361.736,But that--
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1361.736,1363.248,--to get his medical expenses paid.
1997.96-7171,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1363.248,1378.278,"--That invokes Justice Souter's earlier observation that at that point he says, look, this was an improper revocation, you go from there, and then you said that... I think that's when you said it was... Occam's razor applied, because this is more--"
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1378.278,1380.538,Parsimonious.
1997.96-7171,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1380.538,1381.63,--I assume because this is more complex.
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1409.347,1439.377,"Your Honor, I thought that the Court had crossed that bridge in Sibron, and my question is, if it... if Sibron is right on that point, that we shoot it out closer in time to the transactions and occurrences involved in the case, which is what the respondents normally want to do in collateral attacks, is litigate things closer in time while the witnesses are still alive, they're still around, the blood samples are fresh, what not, why doesn't it work when it cuts in the petitioner's favor?"
1997.96-7171,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1450.184,1454.337,"Well, how would it... you say it would come up if he testified in an automobile accident."
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1460.721,1470.508,"--Your Honor, I believe that the two sides have cited all of the Missouri cases on that, and that the... as... they argue one side, we argue the other."
1997.96-7171,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1478.303,1480.463,May I ask one other question?
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1480.463,1481.665,"Please, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-7171,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1481.665,1495.013,"I know your time is almost up, but are you relying at all on any bad faith extension of time in these habeas proceedings that caused the thing to become possibly moot?"
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1495.013,1504.649,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, in no way are we relying... are we asserting that this man is entitled to relief on account of the delay, only that he's entitled to a day in court."
1997.96-7171,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1507.391,1518.237,But are you relying on the fact that the district court acted improperly or in bad faith or anything in extending the time after which he was released?
1997.96-7171,0,32952,john_w_simon,,1518.237,1522.311,"--No, Your Honor, but it does illustrate the risk of leaving the lower court decision intact."
1997.96-7171,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1524.412,1524.673,Yes.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1526.706,1530.99,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:--"
1997.96-7171,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1570.333,1589.126,"Mr. Layton, maybe I misremember Sibron, but I thought, unlike the first case, Carafas, or whatever, which dealt with only present disability, Sibron did speak about future problems as a result of the conviction, like being impeached as a witness."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1589.126,1590.886,It did speak of those.
1997.96-7171,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1770.774,1787.026,"I'm not sure I follow that, because isn't it as a practical matter, given that when you're put back in, parole is revoked, it's not for a very long time, and almost in every case you couldn't get through the whole process."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1802.847,1818.097,"--I think these things are bound to become moot, and I think that the problem Mr. Spencer has where he suggests that he is unusual somehow in losing a 1983 claim is... well, let's present a hypothetical about Mr. Spencer."
1997.96-7171,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1910.937,1912.396,"Let me ask you something, Mr. Layton."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1929.279,1931.14,"Perhaps not, Justice O'Connor."
1997.96-7171,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1946.701,1948.311,So he just can't get it litigated.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1948.311,1951.313,He cannot get it litigated in the context of this case.
1997.96-7171,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1951.313,1951.653,Well--
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1974.778,1975.018,No.
1997.96-7171,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1975.309,1980.642,"What are the constraints, if you're right, and we have some bright line rule here?"
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1980.642,1983.035,--Section 1983 provides a constraint.
1997.96-7171,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1983.803,1992.659,"Well, but he's going to lose any right to recover in 1983 because he can't get a successful habeas conclusion."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1992.659,1993.76,"--Well, he loses his 1983 claim."
1997.96-7171,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1993.76,1994.04,Yes.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,1994.04,2015.135,"But if the State had a policy or program or practice of doing what Your Honor says, then he would... could have a 1983 claim to stop that practice, not to question his own determination, but to stop that practice, and he would have an incentive to do that, since he's already incarcerated again, and although he's been given a new parole date on his new sentence, he has yet to be paroled, and so he could do that."
1997.96-7171,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2015.135,2019.757,"Mr. Layton, what about the State challenges on State habeas?"
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2026.943,2049.868,"In each instance the petition was denied without explanation, and so it is impossible to do more than assume that they were ruling on the merits, with the possible exception of the intermediate court, where he used the wrong writ, although the Missouri practice is, even when a lawyer presents the wrong writ, is to simply assume that the lawyer intended a different writ."
1997.96-7171,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2049.868,2064.798,"Is it possible... is it typical in a Missouri habeas proceeding if the... say the habeas court expressed a view on the merits, to simply deny it, rather than say it's... write it out?"
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2064.798,2069.53,It is very unusual in Missouri practice for the denial of any writ to come with an opinion.
1997.96-7171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2073.083,2082.178,"May I ask a... probably kind of a stupid question, I must admit, but you're arguing that this... the harm to him is so trivial that the case is moot."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2086.101,2092.864,"I don't know that that is a stupid question, because it's something that I've considered carefully."
1997.96-7171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.247,2136.375,And if the problem arises in a future proceeding you... everybody agrees you can save the evidence and save... just as you save charges that are made against people that are never disposed of.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2155.065,2156.587,"Well, I think that that is--"
1997.96-7171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2156.587,2158.077,That doesn't seem to me that would hurt you very much.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2158.077,2178.462,"--I think that would be true if all cases were like Mr. Spencer's, but of course, if this Court announces a rule that extends the breadth of collateral consequences, then we will be litigating more cases further in the district courts and the courts of appeals, and that is our difficulty here, is not so much what our disagreement is with Mr. Spencer, as where we would be if this Court announced a different rule."
1997.96-7171,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2200.437,2204.17,"But there was a very serious charge there of rape, which he vehemently denied."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2204.17,2204.411,--Yes.
1997.96-7171,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2213.925,2219.051,The problem that I have is that... let's take the worst case.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2250.66,2254.924,That is the result of the Court's holding in Heck v. Humphrey.
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.602,2291.366,So one possible thing would have been in your view to say it's moot... to bring this you have to be in custody.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2291.366,2291.817,Yes.
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2291.817,2292.398,It's a... all right.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2320.355,2322.427,"Those are both logical, but the third--"
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2322.427,2326.518,"But now where we are is, if we agree with you here we are saying you can't do either."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2326.518,2327.119,--That's right.
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2327.119,2327.52,All right.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2327.81,2328.251,I think that's--
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.251,2333.484,"--Now if... and starting afresh... let's start absolutely afresh, which is pretty close to where I am."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2346.143,2346.584,--Yes.
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2346.584,2347.063,Is that right?
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2347.063,2347.403,Yes.
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2347.403,2347.784,All right.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2354.899,2355.728,That's the way that the statute--
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2355.728,2355.898,All right.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2374.0,2375.091,--But the--
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2375.091,2376.331,"I mean, that's what he's asking for."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2380.445,2381.196,--But to say--
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2381.196,2382.866,And all we're debating about is whether he should want it.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2383.888,2384.288,--The same--
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2384.288,2392.463,"Or, unless you say... there's one other little part to this, because I... you'll say... maybe you could say, well, the relief he wants under the circumstances is outside the statute."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2392.463,2394.444,--I believe it is.
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2395.966,2398.317,"Oh, I didn't mean for you to jump there yet--"
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2398.317,2398.648,--Okay--
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2398.648,2402.908,"--because I was saying... two parts... one is, why would the Constitution stop him from getting the relief he wants?"
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2403.609,2404.65,"--Well, I don't know that the--"
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2404.65,2406.27,Then the statutory part.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2406.27,2409.493,--I don't know that the Constitution does stop him from getting the relief he wants.
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2424.904,2427.976,"What we're doing here, and it's really... mootness is an odd word to use."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2438.372,2438.843,--Correct.
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2438.843,2443.838,"It couldn't be relief that law and justice requires, and the reason it couldn't be is because too little turns on it."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2443.838,2444.455,Yes.
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2444.455,2445.397,That's your argument.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2448.559,2451.451,"Yes, you could take that approach."
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2451.451,2458.817,"No... well, we... how can we say that if, in fact, in other cases we've said that a person who is no longer in custody can bring it?"
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2458.817,2462.31,I think that Justice Breyer presents the problem.
1997.96-7171,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2462.31,2462.531,Yes.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2470.763,2497.76,"It's certainly possible to go to where Justice Thomas led in, I believe it's the Heck decision, and not have any of these problems, but we aren't there today, and today we're in the presence of the Lane decision that says that when the future consequences are discretionary, when they're speculative, when they require certain intervening steps before there's some kind of relief, that we aren't going to recognize that the case continues after custody in those situations."
1997.96-7171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2503.514,2510.45,"Of course, in Lane we in effect said that if he had... they had asked for relief this man asked for it would not have been moot."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2510.45,2512.21,"Well, I'm not sure of that."
1997.96-7171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2523.099,2527.85,"They were asking for in effect an enforcement of the plea, specific enforcement of the plea bargain."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2527.85,2528.101,--Yes.
1997.96-7171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2528.101,2528.792,Which we--
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2528.792,2548.054,"If... if we treat the parole revocation as the direct equivalent of a conviction, then that's correct, but we haven't treated parole revocations as the direct equivalent of convictions, and I think the reasons have come out this afternoon, that they don't come accompanied by the same kind of consequences, at least under Missouri law."
1997.96-7171,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2566.426,2578.845,"--Mr. Layton, the most recent expression of this Court on this mootness is a case called Minnesota v. Dickerson, and I was surprised that neither brief cited that."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2591.842,2592.513,Well--
1997.96-7171,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2592.513,2594.125,It's that long footnote.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2594.125,2596.336,--I know the footnote.
1997.96-7171,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2615.657,2627.415,It wasn't... it was a case where there was a diversionary sentencing statute so that there was no conviction on the record.
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2627.415,2635.843,"That's right, and there was a reference in the case to collateral legal consequences, and they were of the sort that are contingent in my three part classification that is--"
1997.96-7171,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2635.843,2640.225,"Yes, because the original criminal charges, as I understand that case, were dismissed."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2640.225,2646.94,"--I believe that that is right, although the dismissal itself I think is at issue there."
1997.96-7171,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2652.533,2656.815,"And that was a case I think in which it was the petitioner that was seeking to have it dismissed as moot, rather than the State."
1997.96-7171,1,31466,james_r_layton,,2656.815,2676.869,"--That may be, plus the Minnesota statute said that a conviction after a successful probation, although not a conviction for future purposes, can be used in calculating a criminal history category under Minnesota law, but there's nothing in that decision to suggest that the same would be true even under Minnesota law for a parole revocation."
1997.96-7171,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2693.769,2694.81,"Thank you, Mr. Layton."
1997.96-7171,2,32952,john_w_simon,,2697.031,2702.935,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1997.96-7171,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2759.011,2766.415,"But you didn't cite it, so that suggested to me you didn't think it was... if it was in your favor, that it was strongly in your favor."
1997.96-7171,2,32952,john_w_simon,,2766.415,2771.54,"I'm sorry if I didn't cite it expressly, Your Honor, but we would own it."
1997.96-7171,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2816.588,2821.674,"You're not saying that wouldn't be admissible in a revocation hearing, are you?"
1997.96-7171,2,32952,john_w_simon,,2821.674,2826.176,"--Mr. Chief Justice, hearsay is, of course, admissible in parole revocation proceedings."
1997.96-7171,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2918.154,2919.336,"Thank you, Mr. Simon."
