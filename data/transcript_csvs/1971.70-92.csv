1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,48.192,53.548,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.86,953.444,"Well, Mr. Lakusta, we have -- I take it, we're approaching this case on the assumption that the allegation is in the complaint is true, I think."
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,953.444,955.785,"We must, Your Honor, yes."
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,955.785,967.98,"And -- so we will you take this true that we -- that in advance, the defendants agreed to oppose every petition of the time listed in the complaint."
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,970.354,971.933,Yes.
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,971.933,976.418,"And I -- and I take as they did, regardless of what it says."
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,976.418,981.641,We -- we accept that allegation.
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.749,993.229,"Well, if they had agreed -- if the parties had agreed to bribe one of the Commissioners to get a favorable decision in order to monopolize commerce, would you have a different argument?"
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,993.229,994.004,I certainly would.
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.179,1013.89,"Would it be (Voice Overlap) as you -- well, I know it that it might be -- there might be duly a bribery that -- but it would -- that if -- duly of a Sherman Act violation, if they did it to -- did it by subverting the -- the adjudicatory process for the purpose of achieving a monopoly."
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1013.89,1016.685,I should take they well might be.
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1018.552,1021.651,"Well, then you accept the Wood case."
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1021.651,1023.219,I -- I accept the Wood case.
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.219,1026.586,Where if you agreed to file false information with the --
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1026.586,1031.288,"Yes, assuming that the facts are as they were found by -- by the Court of Appeals --"
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.288,1031.598,Yes.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1031.598,1032.365,-- in that case --
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.365,1032.806,Yes.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1032.806,1035.068,-- then I accept the Wood case.
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1077.254,1079.297,"Well now, how many defendants are there?"
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1079.297,1080.416,There are 19.
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1080.416,1084.484,"19, they don't operate on the same area, I take it."
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1084.484,1086.764,"No, there's -- to some extent they do."
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1087.579,1088.114,Would you think that --
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1088.114,1088.392,-- they're overlapped.
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.392,1105.772,-- in every single defendant -- every single defendant who's named -- would really have substantial interest in every single petition of any kind that was ever filed before the PUC or the ICC?
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1105.772,1121.501,"Well, I -- I you -- you will -- you will observe, Your Honor, that the complaint alleges that the protests were filed in every case where there was a competitive interest, not in -- not quite to me in -- in every case, every conceivable case."
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.501,1145.487,"Well, I know, but what interest that some -- what interest would A operating in Southern California, having agreeing with B, in Northern California for B to help him oppose and help -- and jointly to finance the opposition before the PUC of a transfer of some operating right in Southern California."
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1145.487,1145.692,Well --
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.692,1149.644,What interest does the Northern California men does in contributing to -- to --
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1149.644,1153.058,"I -- I think, I -- I understand your question, Mr. Justice White."
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1193.542,1202.313,"But it's -- it's hard to conceive that out of -- there were 500 petitions filed, there wouldn't be a single one of them that was meritorious."
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1202.313,1202.676,Well --
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1202.676,1209.659,And that every one of them deserves joint -- jointly commenced doctrine.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1209.659,1225.105,"Well, I -- I think we -- we have to bear in mind that the -- the -- our position was only to the extent and as permitted by the regulatory agency that there's no allegation of abuse of the administrative process."
1971.70-92,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1245.393,1258.434,In this respect is it basically fundamentally any different from collective enterprises by working men or collective enterprises of trade associations?
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1258.434,1258.456,I --
1971.70-92,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1258.456,1260.702,"This is -- this is in fact a trade association, is it not?"
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1260.702,1262.615,"Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-92,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1262.615,1267.292,It's a trade association of the ins against the outs.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1267.292,1275.158,It's not really altogether the ins against the outs because the (Voice Overlap) plaintiffs as well or -- or certificate of carriers.
1971.70-92,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1275.158,1277.331,"Well, because it's cast in this case."
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1277.331,1278.514,"Yes, it is."
1971.70-92,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1309.783,1328.937,Don't you have to -- don't you have to argue to make your case look even -- with this First Amendment rights that underlies the case includes the right to act in bad faith and for improper motives.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1328.937,1330.629,"Well, I -- I think if -- if it includes --"
1971.70-92,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1330.629,1332.621,Improper is defined by the Sherman Act.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1332.621,1340.33,It -- it includes the -- the right to -- to act for that kind of motive.
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1385.422,1410.133,"And are also, isn't that the base of the matter that a -- a question of whether the PUC, if it -- in taking the action, can -- well, we'll put it this way, assume the ICC or the PUC decided to reduce the number of carriers in a certain area, the one given the monopoly."
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1418.307,1418.645,Yes.
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1426.926,1428.298,I didn't say you.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1428.298,1428.348,And --
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1428.348,1433.327,The State can authorize private individuals to violate the antitrust laws I suppose.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1433.327,1433.649,No.
1971.70-92,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.649,1438.367,It's -- but it can take action that isn't reached by the -- by the antitrust law.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1438.367,1439.784,That is quite true.
1971.70-92,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1506.43,1518.225,So we -- we don't have in this case the distance where there's joint efforts to persuade a governmental body or an administrative due simply doesn't have power to do.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1518.225,1518.443,No.
1971.70-92,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1546.024,1559.325,I've seen the -- in the comments in the California Law Review in this case that what this amounts to is that the defendants -- I'm reading from this lower -- this one sentence here --
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1559.325,1559.625,Yes.
1971.70-92,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1559.625,1564.958,-- “Defendants substitute themselves for the Public Utility Commission and regulated for their own property.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1569.583,1569.903,Well --
1971.70-92,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1569.903,1572.472,Is that substantially correct?
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1572.472,1576.645,"I -- I don't -- I don't think that it -- that it is correct, unless you --"
1971.70-92,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1576.645,1581.582,It's supported by citing the -- the decline application is a --
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1581.582,1582.051,Yes.
1971.70-92,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1665.721,1671.618,Does your organization intervene in those PUC cases?
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1671.618,1672.648,It -- it did.
1971.70-92,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1673.339,1678.936,I mean prior to the time that you were doing the things you charge would do here.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1678.936,1679.13,No.
1971.70-92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1734.743,1753.817,"(Voice Overlap) issues hereto, with some -- of conduct on the part of your clients to discourage applicants from ever going after certificates and threatening them that if they did, they'd be met with the kind of resistance which would make it very, very expensive?"
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1753.817,1759.066,Well if -- if one reads to the factual context in the --
1971.70-92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1759.066,1760.934,"No, but are there allegations to that effect?"
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1760.934,1761.259,Yes.
1971.70-92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1761.519,1764.455,And that's -- that's -- that was in the defense that you're making?
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1764.455,1775.637,"Well, the -- the allegation is that the way in which that threat occurs was to say to publicize fact, we will go in and we will protect."
1971.70-92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1780.38,1780.688,"Well, do you think --"
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1780.688,1781.718,-- the governmental process.
1971.70-92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1781.718,1785.291,(Voice Overlap) do you think that's within Noerr that kind of conduct?
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1785.291,1786.36,"Yes, I think it is."
1971.70-92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1794.158,1807.803,"Yes, but I -- I thought this or this misconduct, as I understood the allegation, it discouraged (Inaudible) can never go and deviate, by threatening him and if he did he -- he's going to be met with a kind of resistance which would make the proceeding a very, very expensive one for him."
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1807.803,1816.942,"Well, there is -- there is nothing -- nothing wrong in -- in imposing upon an applicant a requirement that he make out of his case."
1971.70-92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1835.195,1840.636,"Well, certainly -- certainly the fact situation is in neither Noerr nor (Inaudible) prove that aspect."
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1840.636,1840.794,No.
1971.70-92,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1842.749,1849.794,And there's much more here than your practice of merely intervening in these cases.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1849.794,1851.982,"I -- I didn't understand, Your Honor."
1971.70-92,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1851.982,1860.453,That as Justice Brennan points up there's much more than merely intervening in these PUC proceedings.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1860.453,1877.858,"No, in the contrary Your Honor, that the factual allegations, Mr. -- Mr. Justice Brennan has referred to conclusions but the factual allegation's been supported or simply that the defendants publicized this program and said, “If you come in, we shall protest.”"
1971.70-92,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1919.935,1943.191,"Are you suggesting that this is essentially the same as though a newspaper carried a box on the front page saying, “If anyone sues us for libel -- libel by virtue of what we say, we will -- we will keep them in litigation for years and it will not be profitable to sue us for libel, something of that kind."
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1949.109,1965.969,"Well, your hypothetical goes a little bit far if that -- if that news item said, “If you sue us libel, we will fight you and fight you hard and fight you all the way,” then I would say that is perhaps what we have here."
1971.70-92,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1965.969,1968.641,And you say that that's what your point for doing?
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1968.641,1971.166,"Well, that -- that is the allegation."
1971.70-92,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1971.166,1977.776,The allegation as distinguished from the conclusion as -- and inferences drawn from those allegations.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,1977.776,1978.056,Yes.
1971.70-92,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2019.217,2020.97,Very well.
1971.70-92,0,17807,boris_h_lakusta,,2026.296,2029.255,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1971.70-92,1,36123,michael_n_khourie,,2029.255,2034.652,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.70-92,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2272.218,2285.653,"So to every adjudicatory body possessed of enhanced powers to deal with, what we might call abuses of its process."
1971.70-92,1,36123,michael_n_khourie,,2285.653,2288.313,"Certainly is, Mr. Chief Justice Burger."
1971.70-92,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2288.313,2297.908,Isn't -- isn't that -- isn't that the factor that backstops this situation?
1971.70-92,1,36123,michael_n_khourie,,2297.908,2298.558,It is.
1971.70-92,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2300.762,2303.408,Why isn't that enough ground without the Sherman Act?
1971.70-92,1,36123,michael_n_khourie,,2303.408,2316.817,Because it is a -- the abuse of the judicial process was -- was designed to restrain competition.
1971.70-92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2647.696,2653.533,If that is true that the protest automatically entitled the protestors to intervention?
1971.70-92,1,36123,michael_n_khourie,,2653.533,2655.23,"To a hearing, yes, it does."
1971.70-92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2655.23,2655.876,It does.
1971.70-92,1,36123,michael_n_khourie,,2655.876,2656.754,"Now, there are other --"
1971.70-92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2656.754,2659.581,(Voice Overlap) that's two of the ICC's (Inaudible) of these?
1971.70-92,1,36123,michael_n_khourie,,2659.581,2662.672,That's correct.
1971.70-92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2695.039,2709.345,"Do you conceive that would be part of your burden that he'd go to trial to prove that there were respective applicants who did not apply, because of misconduct that would be coming?"
1971.70-92,1,36123,michael_n_khourie,,2709.345,2715.159,"We desire, Mr. Justice Brennan, to obtain damages for them."
1971.70-92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2720.25,2721.396,That they did not apply.
1971.70-92,1,36123,michael_n_khourie,,2721.396,2723.04,-- that they did not apply.
1971.70-92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2723.04,2724.861,"You ask for an injunction, too?"
1971.70-92,1,36123,michael_n_khourie,,2724.861,2725.434,Yes.
1971.70-92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2725.434,2726.801,At least you want that.
1971.70-92,1,36123,michael_n_khourie,,2726.801,2728.161,We want an injunction.
1971.70-92,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2853.182,2856.444,"You mean -- you mean, it's so effective that no application sufficed?"
1971.70-92,1,36123,michael_n_khourie,,2856.444,2857.845,Extremely few.
1971.70-92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2890.973,2893.069,They may have never changed that policy.
