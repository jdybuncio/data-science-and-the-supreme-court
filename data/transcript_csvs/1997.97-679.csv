1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.627,"We'll hear argument now in Number 97-679, American Telephone and Telegraph Company v. Central Office Telephone, Incorporated."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,11.029,13.941,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,117.348,123.333,Do we take the case as if there had been no violation of the Federal statute 201 through 207?
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,123.333,124.842,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,149.088,158.686,"Are there cases which tell us that a State law, the State law of torts, say, inform the construction of reasonableness under the Federal statute?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,170.293,185.563,"There's no limitation on the things that the FCC can consider in deciding whether a difference in treatment is unjust and unreasonable, for example, for purposes of the prohibition of section 202(a) of the Communications Act."
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,191.975,205.346,"You're saying that AT&T, then, is immune from any sort of intentional interference with business relationship action brought against it by anyone who it had a contractual relationship with."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,207.116,209.029,"--No, that's not... that is not our position."
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.502,243.601,"I realize that, but you would be immune in many respects from an ordinary suit, say in State court based on State court tort law."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,243.601,253.368,"Absolutely, if it involved the rates that we charge for our communications service or the obligations that we incur in exchange for the receipt of those payments."
1997.97-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,253.368,255.031,"Well, I was asking because I--"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,255.031,255.251,Yes.
1997.97-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,255.251,274.562,"--I have some of the concerns indicated by the Chief Justice's question, whether or not in interpreting what is reasonable under the Federal statute, lower courts or the agency has said, well, this is an interference with an advantageous business relationship under State tort law, and that informs our judgment as to what is unreasonable."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,274.562,280.126,"That's... that would be entirely legitimate, but, of course, the Federal statute has to be interpreted uniformly."
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,302.111,304.523,"In a Federal court, or by the FCC?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,304.523,305.384,Either place.
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.965,327.87,What if the... what if AT&T decides that Central Telephone is not simply a customer but a competitor?
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,327.87,328.809,Central Telephone is a competitor.
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,328.809,332.141,And then decides simply to drive it out of business?
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,332.141,344.541,"If we had done that and did it by providing it with worse service than it was entitled to under the tariff, under 201 of the Communications Act, or 202, it has a Federal damages remedy, but that... that--"
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,344.541,346.374,But it has no State law--
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,346.374,347.345,--It has no State law remedy.
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,355.43,359.311,"--Well, that really is pushing one principle to the very limit of its logic."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,359.311,361.374,Let me suggest something for your consideration.
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,364.706,365.538,"I've read that, yes."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,365.538,380.118,"--Abilene case, the question there was whether a State law that had the identical substantive prohibitions as the Federal statute could be... could be applied to define the regulated carrier's obligation to its customer."
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,396.949,400.352,What was the kind of action that was sought to be brought in the--
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,400.352,403.023,--It was a case involving whether the rates were just and reasonable.
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,403.023,404.135,--So--
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,404.135,406.926,There was a common law right to be charged only a reasonable rate.
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,406.926,412.179,--But that was certainly a much less of an expansive preemption than you're arguing for here.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,412.179,413.831,Well--
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,413.831,417.345,You say an intentional tort is preempted.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,417.345,430.324,"--Your Honor, an intentional tort is preempted only if the predicate for it is, is that the customer didn't receive the quality of service that it was entitled to in exchange for the payment of the tariffed rate."
1997.97-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,430.324,461.985,"Well, why couldn't it... can it be brought, then... could the claims of intentional interference and the claims of wilful breach have been brought under the tariff as in effect claims that the... that AT&T had not used what I think the tariff called its best efforts to provide the services they had contracted for by the time they contracted to provide it, so that at least with respect to these two State causes of action there would have been a Federal remedy?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,461.985,462.496,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1997.97-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,469.902,473.833,Of the claims... I take it you're conceding that they would have stated claims under the tariff--
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,473.833,474.033,--Absolutely.
1997.97-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,474.033,475.365,--if they had been brought under the tariff.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,475.365,475.596,Absolutely.
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,495.197,499.051,"Mr. Carpenter, is it possible that you can make a service guarantee that was not covered by a tariff?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,499.051,507.279,--If you make a guarantee involving the tariffed service it's not covered by the tariff.
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,508.0,511.54,"Well, you... in your briefs you describe network billing and multilocation billing--"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,511.54,511.97,Yes.
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,511.97,513.613,--as not covered by the tariffs.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,513.613,518.506,There's a terminological issue there.
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,525.638,527.631,And the tariff doesn't require them to select either one.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,527.631,531.043,--The tariff... the tariff doesn't even discuss... what the tariff does--
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.043,534.006,"Well, does that mean the tariff doesn't require them to select either one?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,534.006,541.961,"--The tariff obviously requires us to bill them, and it defines our obligations in billing them."
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,541.961,545.363,What if you made a contract to give them one option rather than the other?
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,546.692,552.837,Our position... it's our position that we have to give them a choice of one of those two.
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,555.171,555.391,"Well, that's not my question."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,560.556,560.776,--Yes.
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,560.776,562.377,--but we're not putting it... we're not modifying any tariff.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,562.377,562.646,Right.
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,562.646,565.127,Would you have to honor that contract?
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,565.127,577.105,"Under that set of facts I would read the obligation to provide multilocation billing or network billing into the tariff, and if we violated the obligation--"
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,577.105,577.215,"In other words, the tariff silently--"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,577.215,579.548,--as defined by the tariff we'd be libel to them in damages.
1997.97-679,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,580.668,588.926,"--Well, if you failed to use your best efforts to provide that billing service as you contracted to do, that would be a violation of the tariff, the best effort provision of the tariff, wouldn't it?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,588.926,596.89,"--If we fail to provide it, it is our best efforts, that could be a... that could be a violation--"
1997.97-679,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,596.89,598.563,"That would state a violation, would it?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,598.563,607.405,"--It would state a violation of the tariff, and then the question, you know, would be under the limitation liability clause, whether it was wilful."
1997.97-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,625.147,627.03,But in the hypothetical question--
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,627.03,627.24,Yes.
1997.97-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,627.24,633.415,"--I take it you... under Justice Stevens' hypothetical you would have had the option to file that as a tariff, if you'd made that arrangement?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,633.415,639.789,Just let me clarify one thing about multilocation billing.
1997.97-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,682.127,683.056,But in the hypothetical case--
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,683.056,683.387,Yes.
1997.97-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,683.387,686.849,--suppose that you had agreed to provide the MOL billing.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,692.683,706.531,"We could have certainly put in the tariff that the customer has two billing options, multilocation billing and network billing, and we think actually our tariff should be construed, given that we have these order forms that give people that choice, as imposing that obligation anyway."
1997.97-679,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,706.531,717.889,"But didn't you just say your tariff prevents... I'm really confused about your billing position, because I thought you had just said that your tariff says you will not allocate."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,717.889,718.38,That's right.
1997.97-679,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,718.38,718.67,So--
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,718.67,729.007,"So whatever multilocation billing is or isn't, it is not a case where we are assuming the obligation to allocate charges among locations."
1997.97-679,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,729.007,738.615,"--But yet you did agree... you had a box to check off, and you agreed to provide this service for which the tariff didn't provide, is that correct?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,738.615,745.408,"I suppose there would be two ways to look at this, and I'm... the first, which I'm not going to advocate, is that the service wasn't authorized by the tariff."
1997.97-679,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,764.871,767.803,"Well, wasn't... their claim is that... oh, that you--"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,767.803,770.795,--Their claim is that we didn't accurately bill their customers on their behalf.
1997.97-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,802.856,805.247,--But would it have prevented you from making a contract to do that?
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,805.247,805.487,No.
1997.97-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,813.153,817.715,And would... and that would have been enforceable in State court or in Federal court on a diversity--
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,817.715,826.511,"--Yes, that would have been enforceable in State court, because that would have been a contract for an unregulated service declared by the FCC to be outside the scope of common carrier communications services."
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,845.892,850.496,--But the same doesn't obtain for intentional interference with business relationships?
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,850.496,866.397,"It does obtain if the intentional interference doesn't arise out of a relationship with them as our long distance customer, so if we... they mention something here called slamming, which is when you change a long distance customer from someone else's service to yours without authorization."
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,866.397,866.597,Yes.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,866.597,874.233,"That's a classic example of something that is quite independent of the customer-carrier relationship, but that wasn't the basis for this judgment here."
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,874.233,884.218,"But would slamming be... would an intentional interference with business relationships manifested by slamming, would that be actionable in the State court?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,884.218,884.398,Yes.
1997.97-679,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,897.381,901.302,I don't know why slamming... we don't have time to go into all the economics.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,909.105,909.726,--All right.
1997.97-679,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.975,989.411,--How can you tell whether something is being given in exchange for the rates?
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1007.013,1012.765,"Well, that's true, but there's always going to be questions of law application in a case like that."
1997.97-679,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1035.31,1039.553,"So if you did this for them, the only reason you would have done it was because of the rates that you got."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1039.553,1040.964,"--That was our... yes, that's right."
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1040.964,1044.455,"I thought there was a whole doctrine of law designed to answer that question, which I didn't see here."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1077.377,1078.008,Primary jurisdiction.
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1078.008,1078.919,"Yes, exactly."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1078.919,1079.28,"Yes, absolutely."
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1079.82,1080.301,Primary jurisdiction.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1080.301,1080.852,And if this case--
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1080.852,1083.383,"But nobody asked for primary... I mean, what are we supposed to do about that?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1083.383,1087.877,"--Well, in this case there was no occasion to ask for a primary jurisdiction referral because the--"
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1087.877,1091.33,"Because it's obvious that it's within the statutory exemption, implied."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1091.33,1093.942,"--Your Honor, if they had brought this case under the--"
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1093.942,1094.613,I didn't mean to cut you off.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1098.405,1098.924,"--Well, let me answer--"
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1098.924,1099.144,--Yes.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1099.144,1099.424,--what I was trying to say.
1997.97-679,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1148.747,1157.162,"Mr. Carpenter, before you leave the billing aspect of this claim, maybe you can clarify my confusion."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1179.599,1180.978,That's right.
1997.97-679,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1180.978,1201.582,"--And you then said here that you could have an agreement outside the tariff with regard to the billing options, so if you can have an agreement outside the tariff for the billing options, then why wouldn't the breach of that agreement be a proper lawsuit for State court?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1201.582,1213.66,It would be an unlawful preference under the Wabash Rail and other decisions of this Court if we had given them a service outside the scope of the tariff at no extra charge.
1997.97-679,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1215.451,1215.901,"Oh, I see."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1217.394,1218.135,"--Right, yes."
1997.97-679,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1218.135,1218.416,--but it has to be for an extra charge.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1219.247,1223.46,And just... everyone's very interested in multilocation billing.
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1308.518,1310.75,"Mr. Carpenter, I lost part of your explanation."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1319.074,1319.445,"Yes, that's right."
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1319.445,1324.127,--So why should they have to pay extra for it to have a binding agreement to take one rather than the other.

1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1328.15,1328.361,Yes.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1328.361,1328.992,That's a very--
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1328.992,1330.501,"Well, it's a tendentious way to put it, but--"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1330.501,1334.815,--It's a very... I think it actually... it does boil down to that.
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1353.336,1377.121,"--Isn't it... this... I thought the answer to Justice Stevens' question... correct me if I'm wrong, because I think it's important... is that there are certain services that AT&T in our odd, sort of half-slave, half-free world that we have at the moment, provides on the free side and the FCC has a tariff, or has a rule, rather, that says certain kinds of areas don't fall within the tariffs."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1377.121,1377.492,That's right.
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1377.492,1392.351,"And it's because of that rule, not because of any fairness or anything else in the situation, it's because of that rule that you operate now in the nonregulated world, and once you're in the nonregulated world, of course, contract law, tort law and every other law governs."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1392.351,1392.642,Right.
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1392.642,1400.957,"And that's why, not because of the fairness of the situation or anything else, that had they paid for it they would have taken themselves within the scope of that rule--"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1400.957,1401.228,That's right.
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1401.228,1404.72,--and thereby removed themselves from the tariff-regulated world.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1404.72,1404.94,Right.
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1404.94,1405.481,Is that right?
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1405.481,1405.982,Right.
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1405.982,1406.222,All right.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1406.222,1407.564,And it would have been an unlawful rebate--
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1407.564,1407.844,Yes.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1407.844,1410.386,--if we'd given them that unregulated billing service--
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1410.386,1412.116,If you're in the regulated world.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1412.116,1412.797,--for nothing.
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1412.797,1420.552,"If... as long... if they don't pay for it, they're in the regulated world defined by the FCC tariff... the FCC rule."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1421.243,1421.683,If all they--
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1421.683,1422.354,Am I right?
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1422.354,1425.316,--pay for is... if all they pay us is the tariff rate--
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1425.316,1425.446,Yes.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1425.446,1437.664,"--all they're entitled to are services that are authorized by the tariff, and under the FCC's rule the particular kind of billing service they want has to be provided outside the tariff in the deregulated world."
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1437.664,1452.163,"And the reason you said what you just said... I want you... I want to be sure I'm thinking about this right... is because when they don't pay for it under a particular FCC interpretation of a statute or something, they fall within the regulated world."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1452.163,1454.306,I wouldn't put it quite that way.
1997.97-679,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1454.306,1455.047,"Well, how would you put it?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1455.047,1461.612,"The way I would put it is that they're entitled, in exchange for payment of the tariffed rate, to get services that are within the scope of the tariff."
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1480.344,1483.146,"Well, is the option regulated or unregulated?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1483.146,1484.767,The--
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1484.767,1487.518,"When you give them an option, is that regulated or un--"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1487.518,1494.785,"--The option is regulated, because the option doesn't encompass the things that would make it an unregulated service."
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1510.415,1514.667,"--But as I understand it, you've told them that for no extra charge you will do that."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1514.667,1515.508,No.
1997.97-679,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1527.075,1530.878,"Bills to them, as distinct from bills to their customer?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1532.798,1534.899,This is the way in which we bill our customer.
1997.97-679,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1534.899,1545.027,"--Right, so the bill is going to read, you, customer, pay so much for service at this location, as opposed to your... you, customer's customer, pay this?"
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1545.027,1545.207,Right.
1997.97-679,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1545.207,1545.638,Okay.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1545.638,1545.798,That's right.
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.008,1561.831,"But as I understand it, the tariff doesn't require you to do either of those options."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1561.831,1566.201,"--What the tariff does is, it prohibits us from providing the service that they want."
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1566.201,1571.937,"It prohibits you from giving that option to the customer, because I thought you did give that option to the customer."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1571.937,1572.275,"No, Your Honor."
1997.97-679,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1593.469,1600.705,"What you're saying, as I understand it, is you can give the option pursuant to the tariff, but if you guarantee the option, they have to pay extra."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1600.705,1617.496,"--If... they would have to pay extra if we guarantee we do it right, but the other additional factor is, is if we're assuming an obligation for billing their customers, which is what they're claiming, then it's in the deregulated world that Justice Breyer referred to, and we can only do it by contract."
1997.97-679,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1617.496,1618.006,All right.
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1641.645,1642.213,That's correct.
1997.97-679,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1642.213,1642.724,"That is correct, okay."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1642.724,1642.944,That's correct.
1997.97-679,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1657.723,1684.01,"Well, I think in... perhaps in kidding around with one of the questions earlier you may have conceded too much, because I thought you were conceding that if the customer wanted the tariff service of multilocation billing done accurately, and wanted to be able to enforce it as an obligation to do it accurately, the customer would have to pay extra for it, separate consideration, and I think your answer is no, the customer... we simply cannot do that and the customer cannot do it."
1997.97-679,0,20717,david_w_carpenter,,1699.37,1700.151,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-679,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1700.151,1701.963,"Thank you, Mr. Carpenter."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,1709.66,1711.821,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-679,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1756.976,1784.464,"Just on the last point, because I think it follows from what we've just been discussing with petitioner's counsel, if the service is provided by the tariff then you should have sued under the Federal law sections 201 through 207 for violation of the terms of the tariff, or unreasonable provision of services in violation of the tariff, and you didn't do that."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,1784.464,1787.065,"--That is not raised here as an issue, Your Honor, but--"
1997.97-679,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1787.065,1793.6,"Well, but it's important because we're trying to ask if there is a cause of action and, if so, what it is."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,1793.6,1795.11,"--Well, there are two causes of action here, Your Honor."
1997.97-679,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1810.76,1812.761,"Well, if you're right--"
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,1826.9,1841.971,"Your Honor, we have made the assumption, and I believe that AT&T has made the statement to the FCC to the same effect, that wilful misconduct is fully... can be sued under, and it is 2.3.1 of the tariff."
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1844.662,1849.748,"But surely a person cannot, by tariff, change the meaning of the Federal statute."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,1849.748,1851.847,"Well, this has been--"
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1851.847,1864.085,"So your argument is that... in fact, your claim... your claim, this kind of a claim, when we read the communications statute, the communications statute does not mean to preempt this kind of claim."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,1864.085,1864.595,"--That is true, Your Honor."
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1864.595,1864.785,All right.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,1868.578,1868.829,Yes.
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1868.829,1871.242,"If it does, Justice Kennedy says go to the commission."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,1871.242,1871.601,Our third--
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1871.601,1889.271,"If it doesn't, I say don't the courts continuously... hasn't this Court continuously, where it's a close question, in the antitrust area, for example, said where the claim is, Judge, the communications statute, the regulatory statute isn't meant to preempt this kind of claim."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,1902.001,1906.583,"--Well, on this instance, as counsel mentioned to Your Honor, they did not ask for a referral."
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1906.583,1910.807,"Maybe they didn't, but what's the judge supposed to do if he wants to follow the law?"
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,1910.807,1934.542,"Well, I think the judge felt that the common law claims were well within his cognizance and the wilfulness conduct claim which we say is under the filed tariff itself, it is authorized by 203 (a), which as the filing of the tariff becomes the law, 201... pardon me, 2.3.1, which is the wilful misconduct cause of action, if you will--"
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.542,1941.247,"Now, wait, do you read that as saying any State cause of action for wilful misconduct will lie?"
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,1982.083,1982.734,"--Well, wilful--"
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.734,1993.941,"But I don't read it as saying that so long as it's wilful you can bring suit for over... I mean, for charging you too much."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,1994.692,1995.834,"--Definitely not that, Your Honor."
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1998.325,1998.565,--Okay.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,1998.565,1999.607,--is not rate or rate-affecting.
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.607,2000.047,Okay.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2005.63,2005.811,No.
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.281,2006.592,--Okay.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2006.592,2016.657,"--that it must not be rate-affecting as well, because we know the cases like Marco, where you had a collision between wilful misconduct and misrepresentation of rates."
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2028.715,2031.088,But don't you have the obligation to ask them?
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2041.785,2042.386,"Well, Your Honor--"
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2042.386,2053.723,"Now, on your argument, which is, all that's irrelevant because the statute doesn't mean to preempt State unfair competition law, you still should have gone to the commission to get some determination about that."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2067.351,2073.855,"--Well, there's quite a body of, I guess you'd call it negotiation in this area already, Your Honor."
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2128.022,2138.967,"But it's a classic case, isn't it, if you're saying this is all too complicated, it's absurd to think that people have to read all this, where you would go to the commission and say, commission, the statute requires reasonable rate services."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2151.997,2163.195,"Well, Your Honor, maybe if we had the FCC guidelines type of situation with the Robinson-Patman Act, but here we have... the FCC doesn't even want the filed tariff doctrine any more, and I don't think as a practical matter we'd have much luck."
1997.97-679,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2163.195,2173.192,"Well, your complaint, Mr. Hall, was not of a violation of any provisions of the act, was it, or was it?"
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2173.192,2174.02,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-679,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2192.583,2210.035,"Well, then it seems to me your response to Justice Breyer's question is not adequate, because section 208 seems to say that if you're complaining about a carrier's violation of the act you can file a complaint with the commission and the commission will adjudicate it."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2210.035,2213.858,"Yes, Your Honor, but this would render obligatory the 2.3.1."
1997.97-679,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2215.491,2217.771,What is... is that a regulation?
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2217.771,2221.553,"That is part of the tariff, Your Honor, which has the authority of 2."
1997.97-679,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2222.774,2226.066,But how could a tariff repeal a part of the statute?
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2226.066,2227.548,"It didn't repeal it, Your Honor."
1997.97-679,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2238.034,2243.029,"But why couldn't he... why shouldn't he, why mustn't he do it under the Federal statute?"
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2243.029,2246.719,"Well, again, Your Honor, we are saying, and we have said--"
1997.97-679,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2246.719,2263.121,"It says the company's liability is not limited by the tariff, as I assume the company has to pay an amount that's not set forth in the tariff in the event of wilful misconduct, but that is far different from saying that it must look to State law and that the customer can go to State law."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2276.138,2279.982,"--That is a State law claim, Your Honor, which was brought under the savings clause and--"
1997.97-679,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2279.982,2294.611,"Well then, then that you wouldn't... even if we assume that you would have to go to the commission to get adjudicated a claim that what AT&T did was in violation of the act, if you're not claiming a violation of the act, then presumably that would not apply and you wouldn't have to go the commission."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2294.611,2298.895,"--Well, Your Honor, we are saying two things about our intentional claim."
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2326.173,2332.886,"Well, suppose they try to put you out of business by charging too much, charging more than their filed tariff allows for this service."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2332.886,2333.847,--Well--
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2333.847,2335.388,Would you have a separate State cause of action?
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2335.388,2349.956,"--Your Honor, that one, we cited to you some antitrust cases, and two of those antitrust cases that we cited... these are in the circuits... City of Kirkwood and City of Groton, were ones where there were price squeezes, where the municipality had its price squeezed by the--"
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2349.956,2354.291,The prices charged were the tariff prices.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2365.658,2369.962,"--I was trying to answer your question, Your Honor, only to say that the... that those issues have been considered."
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2372.242,2373.553,Just answer my question.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2387.613,2398.99,"I don't think we would win, Your Honor, but we would certainly cite those two cases I just mentioned to you, because they do tend to support our position."
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.99,2401.061,"You see, I thought you had conceded that point."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2420.395,2420.795,Both.
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2421.737,2421.947,Okay.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2440.47,2440.71,Yes.
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2440.71,2449.485,"That's, I take it, another way of saying that this statute, the Communications Act, does not mean to displace State law here."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2449.485,2451.378,"That is right, Your Honor."
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2451.378,2451.598,All right.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2455.97,2459.122,It... I think it is also supported by Morales--
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2459.122,2459.412,All right.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2459.412,2460.023,--v. TWA.
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2460.023,2460.354,All right.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2483.879,2484.529,Under--
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2484.529,2487.662,"All the antitrust cases say, it's not at all clear."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2501.861,2502.221,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2502.221,2509.645,"Why... in other words, my first take on it would be, of course Congress wanted to displace State unfair competition law."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2514.38,2529.549,"--Well, if I understood your correction... your question correctly, Your Honor, the antitrust claims that we cited did survive the Communications Act and filed rate doctrine objections."
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2664.6,2677.729,"Well, the response that AT&T makes to that, of course, is that how... you can't possibly interpret a savings clause, unless you're going to gut the Federal legislation, to save State law that positively contradicts the Federal law."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2682.853,2696.571,"Well, there, Your Honor, I guess our answer to that has been that we can't understand how attempting to put somebody out of business and wilful misconduct which included a mess of dirty tricks relates to the purposes of the Communications Act."
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2696.571,2697.202,It depends.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2722.179,2722.74,"Well, again, Your Honor--"
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.74,2724.71,If that's your business claim you're contradicting the act.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2724.71,2745.844,"--We go back to the really quite a large body of work we have in this particular case where we have the... our amici, AT&T itself at various parts of its brief, in the materials I indicated to the Court that we received, we have a large body of, if not law, of business practice occurring now where a huge amount is not under the direct tariff language."
1997.97-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.033,2758.283,May I just--
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2758.283,2758.493,--Pardon me.
1997.97-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.493,2760.456,"--I'm sorry, I didn't want to... I thought you'd finished your answer."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2760.456,2761.285,"Excuse me, Justice Stevens."
1997.97-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2761.285,2766.37,I just want to get two things straight on the record for my own information.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2776.556,2776.816,No.
1997.97-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2776.816,2783.25,"And the second question I have is, has the FCC... have they filed an amicus brief at any stage of these proceedings?"
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2783.25,2783.65,"No, Your Honor."
1997.97-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2783.65,2785.273,It seems unusual.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2785.273,2786.692,"We suggested they do, but they didn't respond."
1997.97-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2786.692,2787.323,I see.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2795.16,2813.231,"Your Honor, they are... it's a strange mix, and I will tell you one of the reasons why, is that at the trial the AT&T tariff expert said that provisioning and billing, which are a large part of what we're talking about here, are not in the tariff, and that has not helped us make a... this fine distinction here."
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2862.403,2863.425,What's wilful--
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2863.425,2868.818,"Some of these were much more, what would be commonly called intentional interference type actions."
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2868.818,2885.057,"--What is the difference between... let's imagine in Maislin we have a trucking firm, and the trucking firm charges lower than tariff rates to a whole lot of shippers, a lot of them, and then later on they all go out of business when the trucking firm comes along and has to raise the rates."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2888.571,2888.911,My--
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2888.911,2891.211,"Is that a matter... I mean, what's the... there's a filed rate."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2903.389,2907.072,"--Well, we know that we're all presumed to know the tariff, even though we don't, and that was another--"
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2907.072,2913.507,"How does your case differ from that, because what they're saying as well, at worst, you know... at worst, accepting everything you say--"
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2913.507,2914.038,--We--
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2914.038,2917.009,--This is an instance where they filed tariffs as to services.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2930.578,2931.508,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2931.508,2931.82,--follow the tariff.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2933.79,2935.662,--We... we're paying the rate.
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2937.632,2939.083,"The rates and services are treated alike, aren't they?"
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,2940.064,2972.074,"Rates affecting... I mean, services affecting rates under the Federal Communications Act, which makes a big difference, and there were a lot that AT&T says in this courtroom and has said in its briefing, and the amici have said, do not affect rates, and most of what we are talking about here, that we are certain does not affect rates and it's been mentioned before about this MLB LABO network comment in the AT&T brief, where they said that while these may have value there's no charge for them."
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.074,2985.184,"--Well, I... you know, I think it's easy to say that selecting between, what is it, multiple location billing and the other billing, selecting between one or the other doesn't affect rates."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3013.642,3017.224,"Well, that, Your Honor, leads to another conundrum within this language we have here."
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3057.229,3059.232,"Now, that was a violation of the tariff, you say, because--"
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3059.232,3059.871,That was a violation of the tariff.
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3061.033,3064.706,"--And you'd have a remedy for that at the Communications Commission, right?"
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3064.706,3072.39,"--You could, but it's also a part of wilful misconduct if it's intentional and if it's a part of all of these other things I've been mentioning."
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3072.39,3076.183,So any intentional violation of a tariff you can go under State law.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3076.183,3086.469,"Your Honor, I think that any... you have to prove wilful misconduct, but it's a separate matter and it has equal dignity."
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.245,3109.455,"Do I have to agree with you on that in order for you to win the case, because I find that an extraordinary proposition, that even for the most clear tariff violations you can sue under State law, so long as they have been wilful."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3109.735,3113.289,--And so long as they are not rate-affecting.
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3113.97,3114.24,--Ah.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3114.731,3115.102,--can certainly concede that.
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3115.102,3115.583,I see.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3115.583,3117.045,"That's... we've always said that, Your Honor."
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3117.045,3118.297,And so long as they are not rate-affecting.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3118.297,3118.637,Yes.
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3124.041,3126.802,"Well, is there anything in the tariff that is not rate-affecting?"
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3126.802,3127.533,Yes.
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3141.671,3142.022,I see.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3171.692,3198.371,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, again I have to... the real world that has been shown here in the evidence by both sides, I've cited page 35 of their opening brief and 13 and 14 of their closing brief, all the materials that were submitted by the amici, and those of our own, in the actual working world they all accept these as part of... gap-fillers, as they call them, or details, as it was called by counsel, as part of the tariff."
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3201.584,3206.768,"No, but Justice Ginsburg was talking about matters set forth in the tariff, not these side agreements."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3206.768,3206.998,Okay.
1997.97-679,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3207.529,3224.898,"Your position is that even some things set forth in the tariff don't affect the rates, and you can sue for failure to provide those provisions under State law so long as they're not rate-affecting, and I just find that a difficult problem."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3224.898,3228.031,"Well, Your Honor, AT&T made no effort at trial to make any such distinctions."
1997.97-679,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3267.588,3269.598,But the Ninth Circuit passed on that question.
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3269.598,3278.945,"The united... the Ninth Circuit said more than it should have there, Your Honor, because it simply overlooked our position."
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3278.945,3280.925,"Your view is they waived it, is that right?"
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3292.147,3296.451,"At the trial, Your Honor... I'm merely pointing out that intentional interference--"
1997.97-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3296.451,3303.583,"Mr. Hall, at page 51 of the Joint Appendix, the pretrial order, (g), first affirmative defense, filed tariff doctrine."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3303.583,3305.526,"--Is that under intentional interference, Your Honor?"
1997.97-679,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3305.526,3307.057,"Well, it's their first affirmative defense."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3310.379,3318.454,"I may have misspoken myself, but I'm awfully certain that under the intentional interference claim they did not raise the filed rate doctrine."
1997.97-679,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3318.454,3326.721,"--If we're speaking practically, is there anything impractical about the following: you file your complaint in court to protect against the statute of limitations."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3353.408,3360.805,"Well, reserving that, we thoroughly believe we have the right to file an intentional interference claim and if it weren't linked to this other one we wouldn't even be here today, in our opinion."
1997.97-679,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3369.37,3387.491,"I take it the argument of AT&T is that if you had been simply a competitor and not a customer, there might have been a cause of action here, but the customer relation trumps your standing as a competitor."
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3388.402,3389.613,That seems to be their argument.
1997.97-679,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3389.613,3391.335,Do you have some cases that refute that?
1997.97-679,1,17687,bruce_m_hall,,3391.335,3403.791,"Well, I would simply say, Your Honor, that the ones that we cite at the very beginning of our case, of our answering brief, responding brief, suggest that a number of these have gone forward despite the Communications Act and filed rate doctrine."
1997.97-679,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3403.791,3404.772,"Thank you, Mr. Hall."
