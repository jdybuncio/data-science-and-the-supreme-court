1980.80-289,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.141,We will turn to our first case and we'll hear arguments in United Mine Workers v. the Labor Board and the consolidated case.
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,19.295,23.615,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-289,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,188.637,202.397,"Mr. Dalton, does the Government concede that if the person in question here was a collective bargaining agent rather than a trustee, there was coercion on the part of the union?"
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,202.397,203.264,Yes.
1980.80-289,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,298.145,300.095,"Mr. Dalton, may I ask one thing?"
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,300.095,300.611,Yes.
1980.80-289,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,300.611,311.118,I gather the Belle Ayr mine was not part of the collective bargaining unit in connection with which the original trust fund was set up.
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,311.852,312.435,That is correct.
1980.80-289,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,314.504,315.537,The Belle Ayr mine was not?
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,315.537,316.189,Right.
1980.80-289,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,316.189,329.247,"And the demand of the union was that, nevertheless, the contributions to the pension fund be made to the trustees set up under a different unit than this."
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,329.68,333.132,The trustees of one of the national pension and welfare funds; yes.
1980.80-289,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,333.132,339.686,And there's no question of the legitimacy of that demand and that it is the subject of mandatory bargaining?
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,339.686,340.386,Yes.
1980.80-289,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,349.142,349.658,Yes.
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,349.658,358.498,And the Board rejected Amax's contention and concluded that trustees are not collective bargaining representatives.
1980.80-289,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,487.781,494.703,"Let's assume that, of course, a trustee represents no one except the interests of the trust."
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,498.672,499.089,Absolutely; yes.
1980.80-289,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,499.089,510.896,"But in a sense, does not... is not each of the trustees, one appointed by the union and one by the employer, a representative in a limited sense?"
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,510.896,543.434,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but it's our position that they represent those parties, that the limitations of that representation are such that in any instance in which the interests of the parties to the collective bargaining agreement might possibly conflict with the interests of the beneficiaries, then the former must recede, and therefore it's inappropriate to consider them as collective bargaining representatives because the latter owe an undivided duty of loyalty to the parties that they represent."
1980.80-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.508,839.46,"Mr. Dalton, may I ask you a question?"
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,839.46,839.96,Yes.
1980.80-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,839.96,848.816,I remember reading somewhere in the briefs that the trustees of this fund had the power to set the royalty rates on salvage coal--
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,848.816,849.566,Yes.
1980.80-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.566,855.969,--Which I gather is a method of determining how much is contributed to the trust funds by the employers?
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,855.969,861.556,With respect solely to refuse or salvage coal.
1980.80-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,861.556,870.812,"To the extent that they have the power to determine the level of contributions by the employers, are they not determining a matter which would normally be subject to collective bargaining?"
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,870.812,877.835,"Yes, but they would do that by virtue of the agreement of the parties during collective bargaining."
1980.80-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,879.335,887.941,"Well, supposing the collective bargaining agreement had an open-ended provision saying the trustees shall determine from month to month how much the employer shall contribute to the fund."
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,890.976,892.845,--I would submit not.
1980.80-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,908.604,911.056,Royalties on the salvage coal.
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,920.828,929.368,"--They still would not be collective bargaining representatives, so they would indeed obviously be engaged in the setting of those rates."
1980.80-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.368,935.338,"Well, what if they were to determine the hours of work on which royalties would be paid or the--"
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,935.338,936.755,"Well, then we begin--"
1980.80-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.755,938.389,--At what point do they become representatives?
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,938.389,953.399,"--That's... at that point I begin to worry because at that point, and maybe even at some point prior to that, they're engaged in brokering the relationship between employers and employees, which is one of the hallmarks of collective--"
1980.80-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,953.399,957.703,It seems to me they're doing that as even with the smaller item of royalty rates on salvage coal.
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,957.703,965.957,"--Except that one of the other hallmarks of collective bargaining representatives is that, is that what they are negotiating around is the contract."
1980.80-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,974.98,986.854,"Well, if the trust instrument gave them the power to adjust... to make a term of the collective bargaining agreement, which in effect it does when it says, how much money shall be contributed to the fund?"
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,992.508,1029.399,"Well, a third distinction between bargaining parties and trustees is that when the former reach impasse, they're entitled to... at least, if we're talking about issues that are mandatory bargaining issues, they're entitled to resort to their economic weapons, strike, lockout, et cetera, whereas under Section 302(c)(5), when trustees reach an impasse, either that impasse is broken by neutral trustees, if such exist, or the trustees are entitled to themselves appoint a compulsory arbitrator or to ask the district court to do so."
1980.80-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1047.261,1057.467,But the employer here doesn't want his royalty rate set by either the trustees selected by the employees or or by the compulsory arbitrator selected by them.
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1066.089,1070.56,"Well, I just have a couple of responses."
1980.80-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1084.47,1093.326,"Well, Mr. Dalton, didn't Amax, as to its membership on the multibargaining unit, did have a voice in the selection of this trustee?"
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1093.326,1098.961,"In fact, Amax... yes... that's precisely... Amax... Number one, Amax did select these trustees in connection with this deep shaft bituminous mine--"
1980.80-289,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.961,1104.347,"Then your argument is, not that this is not a representative, but he's not being compelled to take a representative he didn't have a voice in selecting."
1980.80-289,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1105.649,1109.085,I thought you had conceded that there was coercion?
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1109.085,1112.887,"--I did concede that there was coercion, but not for all time."
1980.80-289,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1132.784,1133.7,"Well, Mr. Dalton, am I wrong?"
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1141.188,1141.973,--That is absolutely correct.
1980.80-289,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1143.29,1147.008,If that's your argument--
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1150.496,1151.262,"Yes, it would."
1980.80-289,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1152.762,1156.65,The trustee is not a collective bargaining representative.
1980.80-289,0,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,1156.65,1157.216,--Yes.
1980.80-289,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1177.229,1180.515,Very well.
1980.80-289,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1188.102,1191.137,Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the Court.
1980.80-289,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1463.114,1480.176,"Do you disagree, Mr. Combs, with the proposition that on occasion under certain contracts the management trustee could be pulled in one direction and the union trustee in another over a question as to the administration of the trust?"
1980.80-289,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1480.176,1481.112,Yes.
1980.80-289,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1510.195,1514.749,And if that would go to court or to arbitration or?
1980.80-289,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1514.749,1530.176,"Well, under the way that these trust agreements, it does not go to arbitration, it's a final judgment of the trustees on the eligibility that's specified in the trust agreements of that kind."
1980.80-289,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1530.176,1543.352,"But supposing that we're talking about the price of salvage coal or the amount, as Justice Stevens asked Mr. Dalton, and the two trustees disagree on that, how is that answered?"
1980.80-289,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1543.352,1549.756,That would be answered by the third trustee as provided for in Section 302(c).
1980.80-289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1621.186,1627.589,Would you say the same thing if the entire trust were financed by royalties; I don't know whether it is or not?
1980.80-289,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1627.589,1628.922,"It's partly, both."
1980.80-289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1628.922,1642.366,"If we assume it all was and the trustees had the power to decide what the royalty rate on coal would be, would it be $5 or $10 a ton, they would determine the entire economic burden on the employers of the fund?"
1980.80-289,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1642.366,1649.503,I think that assumption would have to take into consideration that many of these operators don't agree to any such thing as that.
1980.80-289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1650.288,1651.972,"--If you're right, then that's a matter of collective bargaining."
1980.80-289,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1651.972,1654.324,"Well, it is a matter of collective bargaining but--"
1980.80-289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.324,1657.626,And I take it the point on the royalty coal is that that's a relatively small item in the total picture?
1980.80-289,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1657.626,1658.292,--Yes.
1980.80-289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1658.292,1662.013,"If it were a big item, it would clearly be a subject that would be bargained out, wouldn't it?"
1980.80-289,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1662.013,1662.346,Yes.
1980.80-289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1705.356,1707.042,"Does the record... oh, excuse me, go ahead."
1980.80-289,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1707.042,1707.575,--Sure.
1980.80-289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1786.66,1788.344,"Let me ask you one question before you sit down, if I may."
1980.80-289,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1800.754,1805.555,"I might say this for the information, Mr. Justice Stevens, of you and the Court: I am a trustee."
1980.80-289,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1827.737,1834.575,And I take it it's a formula that's well known to the parties and their agreement may in effect be interpreted as having accepted that as a proper approach?
1980.80-289,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1834.575,1835.258,That is correct.
1980.80-289,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1837.593,1838.127,I see.
1980.80-289,1,26739,harrison_combs,,1839.212,1841.112,Thank you.
1980.80-289,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1841.112,1846.282,Mr. Gruender.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,1846.282,1849.484,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-289,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1934.554,1951.282,"Mr. Gruender, may I ask a moment, am I right that you do have representative in multibargaining set-up through BCOA of which, as I understand it, your client's a member?"
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,1951.282,1954.467,--A separate bargaining unit as to Amax Coal--
1980.80-289,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1954.467,1955.101,"I know, but--"
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,1955.101,1957.353,--is a member of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
1980.80-289,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1957.353,1964.859,"--But the fact is, the fact is that you did have a voice in the selection of the trustee through BCOA, did you not?"
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,1964.859,1965.592,I did not.
1980.80-289,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1966.959,1967.661,Your client did.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,1971.143,1975.595,"Well, the way it... somebody was a representative of the Bituminous Coal Operator's Association."
1980.80-289,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1976.728,1978.047,Of which your client was a member.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,1978.047,1982.849,"--Whether they were at the time that they joined the BCOA or not, I don't know that."
1980.80-289,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1995.258,2000.376,"No, but the fact is that your client is a member of BCOA?"
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2000.376,2002.595,"My client, Amax Coal Company, is."
1980.80-289,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2003.614,2008.816,And that there is a trust fund of which one of the trustees was selected by BCOA?
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2008.816,2011.951,"--Well, I'm sure that the trustee was selected by BCOA."
1980.80-289,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2016.338,2020.207,"Well, now, assume with me for a moment that it was, and it had a voice in the selection."
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2020.207,2020.974,"Yes, sir?"
1980.80-289,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2020.974,2022.842,Even if you're right--
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2022.842,2025.544,Even if I'm right?
1980.80-289,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2025.544,2037.851,"--Even if you're right that the trustee selected by BCOA also is a collective bargaining agent, then you do have a collective bargaining agent administering the fund, don't you?"
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2037.851,2045.607,"Well, no, because the Act dictates and guarantees to the parties unit-by-unit bargaining."
1980.80-289,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2173.574,2186.182,"When the unions struck to demand that Amax join the multiemployer group, didn't the NLRB file an unfair labor practices charge against them?"
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2186.182,2192.102,"--Well, the employer filed an unfair labor practice charge and the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint."
1980.80-289,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2515.278,2523.534,"Now, Mr. Dalton, earlier, in response to questions, conceded that the conduct here constituted coercion."
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2541.679,2543.012,"No, sir."
1980.80-289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2672.995,2674.595,"Mr. Gruender, may I interrupt just a second?"
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2674.595,2674.928,"--Yes, sir."
1980.80-289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2674.928,2681.349,It doesn't seem to me that the issue is whether it's appropriate to bargain over whether you can join a multiemployer trust.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2687.736,2692.557,You mean on the basis that it wasn't as good?
1980.80-289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2709.666,2714.053,But that's a reason why you don't want to participate in the multiemployer trust.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2714.053,2714.703,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.703,2716.505,And that's totally independent of who the trustee is.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2716.505,2716.988,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2716.988,2729.663,"And... but it is true, is it not, that there are many multiemployer trusts in which one employer is not necessarily a member of the employer association that is primarily responsible for the particular trust?"
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2729.663,2737.251,"Where he agrees to participate... and the cases on that are clear... once you agree to participate in multiemployer bargaining, you have a right to come in and designate who the representative--"
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2737.251,2745.774,"Some of your argument sounds as though you're arguing that, well, that you shouldn't be forced to participate in this multiemployer trust."
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2747.291,2748.976,"--Well, on the contrary--"
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2748.976,2752.761,You just want to avoid the strike to make you.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2752.761,2753.261,"--No, no."
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.88,2761.634,You could just bargain to impasse and then see who can win.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2761.634,2765.836,"--The issue before this Court is, are these people collective bargaining representatives or not?"
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2765.836,2766.419,"I know, I know."
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2766.419,2790.117,"And if, in fact... and they say that... 30 percent of our compensation package in this country today is fringe benefits... and if they say, and we all agree, that fringes, fringe benefit funds are mandatory subjects of bargaining, and so are wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, which are handled by joint grievance representatives at a joint grievance procedure under a multiemployer trust."
1980.80-289,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2802.592,2804.508,I understand what the issue is... I know what the issue is--
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2804.508,2805.042,--What's the difference?
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2805.042,2807.127,--But nobody claims that you have to do it.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2808.746,2809.096,Yes.
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2816.316,2817.685,"--You don't have to accede, though."
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2826.207,2832.361,"--No, but there is a provision in the law that it is not right for a union to strike to compel someone to select as their representative--"
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2832.361,2833.261,I understand.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2833.261,2834.294,--someone who cannot--
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.294,2835.329,I understand.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2837.912,2840.547,"--No, that is... the point is not, whether you win."
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2919.883,2921.549,You haven't mentioned ERISA at all.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2921.549,2931.941,"--Well, in ERISA it merely reemphasizes what in fact the common law was with respect to 302(c) trusts before and codifies them."
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2958.006,2961.543,"You can wear two hats, but as mentioned in the brief, you can't wear them both at once."
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2961.543,2969.38,The day has gone when we can look at a union representative as some big monster who's only interested in union goals.
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2969.38,2973.518,The trustee has duties both under the common law or equity--
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2973.518,2975.068,So do collective bargaining representatives.
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2975.068,2978.636,--And under the statute now enacted by Congress called ERISA.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2981.486,2981.721,"Well, he had them before, sir."
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2981.721,2983.404,And they're not collective bargaining duties--
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2983.404,2986.64,"Well, they are collective bargaining duties, in our opinion."
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2986.64,2988.925,--Imposed by ERISA?
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2988.925,2992.544,"Well, ERISA doesn't impose collective bargaining duties."
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2992.544,2992.994,No.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,2992.994,3001.132,The National Labor Relations Act defines collective bargaining duties and the provision of the National Labor Relations Act is 302(c)(5).
1980.80-289,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3012.19,3012.673,Or equity.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3012.673,3025.848,"--So, our point is that the conflict that they say exists between employer and union representatives."
1980.80-289,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3042.276,3053.434,"I'm a little puzzled by your seeming to merge, maybe you didn't intend to merge the functions of the collective bargaining representative and the functions of the trustee."
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3064.992,3066.708,"No, I do not agree at all."
1980.80-289,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3067.61,3068.777,"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3075.614,3076.883,--At what point?
1980.80-289,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3083.869,3085.338,I'm talking about reaching the agreement.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3115.591,3125.963,"A BCOA collective bargaining representative has the same obligation to all of the members of the association... the union, to all the members of the union... as he would if he were a trustee."
1980.80-289,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3134.686,3155.483,"Well, certainly, the Chief Justice is correct that in the collective bargaining process itself, before the agreement is reached, or alternatively in the processing of a grievance under the agreement, a collective bargaining representative owes his exclusive and undivided loyalty to either the union or the employer?"
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3157.316,3158.133,Before an agreement is reached?
1980.80-289,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3158.133,3162.053,The association or person whose agent he is.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3162.053,3163.637,Subject to the law--
1980.80-289,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3163.637,3164.422,Like any agent?
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3164.422,3175.195,"--Subject to all the requirements of the National Labor Relations Act, some of which impose obligations on the employer's representative to watch out for the interests of the employers."
1980.80-289,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3176.229,3189.62,"Can a collective bargaining representative as defined in the National Labor Relations Act sit on a grievance panel, administering a collective bargaining agreement?"
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3189.62,3193.172,Can a collective bargaining representative?
1980.80-289,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3193.172,3193.858,Yes.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3193.858,3194.424,Yes.
1980.80-289,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3194.424,3207.499,"Well, then, in that case I take it he might well have occasion, as you have pointed out, to vote against... if he's the management representative, he might nonetheless vote against one of his fellow managers."
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3207.499,3209.618,In the multiemployer situation they do it every day.
1980.80-289,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3209.618,3214.522,But he is not then acting as collective bargaining agent.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3214.522,3215.905,"I beg your pardon, sir, he is."
1980.80-289,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3215.905,3218.588,"He can wear two hats but he can't wear them both at once, as we said earlier."
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3218.588,3219.69,"Well, I don't agree with that, sir."
1980.80-289,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3301.092,3305.896,"I've been listening very carefully to what you say and I read your brief, but you know my problem?"
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3323.257,3333.696,"Well, the legislative history, in my opinion, we didn't address that because I don't think the legislative history is dispositive, or I don't believe it's that conclusive."
1980.80-289,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3334.229,3334.981,Isn't it helpful?
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3334.981,3339.867,"--I think it suggests certain things but you've seen legislatures come and go, Your Honor."
1980.80-289,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3339.867,3341.469,It's really not helpful to you.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3341.469,3343.837,That's not it; really.
1980.80-289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3544.133,3548.77,"Mr. Gruender, you haven't really argued this, but I've just been reflecting on your argument a little bit."
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3566.981,3568.581,They struck the BCOA?
1980.80-289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3568.581,3569.6,Yes.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3569.6,3570.85,And I represent the BCOA?
1980.80-289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3570.85,3575.837,"You say that BCOA, just say, I want to pick my own representative, and they say, no, no, we want John L. Lewis, Jr., or somebody like that."
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3575.837,3576.571,The union did that?
1980.80-289,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3576.571,3577.087,The union did it.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3584.46,3585.377,That's their view of the law.
1980.80-289,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3680.822,3681.855,Your time has expired now.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3683.607,3686.059,--The case is Sinai Hospital.
1980.80-289,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3692.296,3693.346,Would you see the Clerk about that?
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3694.496,3697.784,"I have not received it, so I am unable to answer you."
1980.80-289,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3701.336,3701.886,There are two.
1980.80-289,2,20902,daniel_b_gruender,,3703.086,3704.52,I have not seen the Government's brief.
1980.80-289,3,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,3708.639,3717.578,"I just have three quick points, actually four."
1980.80-289,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3723.565,3727.886,"It's dated April 21, filed in the Clerk's Office."
1980.80-289,3,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,3728.919,3729.869,Yes.
1980.80-289,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3770.244,3773.129,"Mr. Dalton, would you respond to the question I put to your opponent--"
1980.80-289,3,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,3773.129,3773.462,--Yes.
1980.80-289,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3773.462,3774.564,--A moment or two ago?
1980.80-289,3,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,3782.735,3783.337,"No, I think not."
1980.80-289,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3783.337,3784.17,Why not?
1980.80-289,3,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,3784.17,3785.087,For two reasons.
1980.80-289,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3801.815,3811.071,"No, if they... what they'd do is say we want the employer to select a trustee from the following list, but the employer can make the selection and he will be the employer trustee."
1980.80-289,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3811.071,3813.189,That wouldn't be a mandatory subject of bargaining.
1980.80-289,3,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,3813.189,3813.956,That's my second point.
1980.80-289,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3817.241,3822.045,Would it violate the provision that prohibits the union from trying to designate the employer's collective bargaining representative?
1980.80-289,3,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,3822.045,3822.679,I'm sorry?
1980.80-289,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3822.679,3830.318,This case arises as a violation of whatever statute it is that says the union cannot try to coerce the employer into selecting a representative.
1980.80-289,3,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,3830.318,3830.735,Yes.
1980.80-289,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3830.735,3834.686,"Now, would he be a representative for purposes of that section?"
1980.80-289,3,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,3834.686,3840.106,"No, he wouldn't but nevertheless the union's demand would not be a mandatory subject for collective--"
1980.80-289,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3840.106,3841.223,"Well, it wouldn't be mandatory, it would be permissive."
1980.80-289,3,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,3844.375,3863.706,"--Well, my point clearly is the man is not a representative for purposes of Section 8(b)(1)(B) so then the question is, as it is here, assuming that the trustees are not collective bargaining representatives, then the question is, whether or not the union demand is a mandatory or permissive subject of collective bargaining."
1980.80-289,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3867.391,3877.631,"The union could say, to avoid your suggestion that he would become a union representative, say the union just said, we will not, we insist that you do not appoint Mr. X, the man you had before."
1980.80-289,3,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,3883.369,3888.654,"My position is that the union could make that request or demand, but the employer--"
1980.80-289,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3888.654,3891.023,Without violating this statute?
1980.80-289,3,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,3891.023,3899.379,--Without violating Section 8(b)(1)(B); that the employer need not accept it and that the union would not be entitled under the Act to bargain to impasse or strike over that issue.
1980.80-289,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3923.594,3924.862,You mean they always take the highest possible rate?
1980.80-289,3,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,3924.862,3928.064,If that's in the interest of the beneficiaries of the trust.
1980.80-289,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3928.064,3928.714,"Well, it surely would be."
1980.80-289,3,26814,harlon_l_dalton,,3932.366,3933.1,I've got the red light.
1980.80-289,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3934.335,3936.368,"Thank you, gentlemen."
