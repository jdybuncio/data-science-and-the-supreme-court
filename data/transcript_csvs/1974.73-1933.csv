1974.73-1933,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,44.732,"We'll hear argument next 73-1933, United States against Citizens & Southern National Bank."
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,46.208,50.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1933,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,194.435,199.995,Did the FDIC state reasons Mr. Friedman for rejecting as to the sixth bank?
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,199.995,229.442,"Yes, what it said was that with respect to the Bank of Tucker which was founded in 1919, there they said the initial acquisition by C&S in the 1960's of an interest and the development of this relationship was itself anticompetitive because prior to the time, Tucker and C&S had been fully independent and competitors, whereas it distinguished the other five situations where they had said there was no competition between them from the outset."
1974.73-1933,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,295.08,304.354,Does the government here have the burden of showing that the situation would different after the acquisition that it was under the five percent arrangement?
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,304.354,309.182,"Well, I would -- may I answer the question this way Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-1933,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,409.22,415.545,Then what does the language lessening competition mean?
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,415.545,418.525,Maybe substantially to lessen competition.
1974.73-1933,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,497.359,504.529,Let me see if I understand what you're saying thereby putting it into a hypothetical case Mr. Friedman.
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,542.397,543.718,It could well and as I've indicated.
1974.73-1933,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,543.718,551.295,That's the kind of situation you are talking about that you think the antitrust law must reach this in its incipiency?
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,551.295,575.246,"Yes Mr. Justice -- well what I was suggesting with something Mr. Justice, what I was suggesting was that Section 7 is intended to reach anticompetitive acquisitions in order to prevent the development of a situation where there would be the actual elimination of competition as distinguished from the potential for eliminating competition that Section 1 is designed to reach."
1974.73-1933,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,610.064,625.57,"Mr. Friedman, before you go into that you've said a few moments ago that so far as the Sherman Act was concerned, there was an initial violation in the formation as I understand it of these five percent banks."
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,625.57,628.761,"I'm sorry Mr. Justice, perhaps I misspoke myself."
1974.73-1933,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,682.156,685.597,"Well, may I ask you a question on that basis of that theory."
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,696.086,697.82,"No, no, of course, not, Mr. Justice."
1974.73-1933,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,697.82,699.911,But what is the economic difference?
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,699.911,714.439,"Well, I think the difference Mr. Justice, the difference is that the thrust of Section 1 of the Sherman Act is against restraints upon competition created by independent entities which combined."
1974.73-1933,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,733.074,749.425,"I understand that, but historically, I've also understood that it was a policy of the antitrust division to encourage banks to open branches which stimulate competition."
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,774.904,790.366,"Well I think Mr. Justice, the economic interest here is the whole basic concept that under the Sherman Act, you cannot use -- make arrangements between independent entities which eliminates competition."
1974.73-1933,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,903.542,907.843,"Mr. Friedman suppose and this is not hypothetical, but it involves your projection."
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,934.651,938.148,"If we had an appeal, I would very much doubt it Mr. Justice."
1974.73-1933,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1056.794,1062.354,"But may I say -- but you told us up to now, you do not contend this as a violation of the antitrust law?"
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1062.354,1064.868,"No, no, of course, not, but we're just -- I'm just trying to set the background."
1974.73-1933,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1064.868,1066.647,"You're giving us the history, but I just wanted -- right."
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1066.647,1070.386,Setting the background in the light of which what they did thereafter.
1974.73-1933,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1070.386,1077.555,"But all of this sponsorship and creation and everything that went with it what you told us about so far, you do not submit there is a violation of --"
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1077.555,1083.313,"No, we don't -- may I make something very clear Mr. Justice in light what our opponents say."
1974.73-1933,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1093.807,1099.82,"But all of these components, the whole totality that you told us about up to know you would not say was a violation."
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1099.82,1114.619,"No, not, but the last thing -- the two last things that I come to a beginning to develop reach into -- one is the selection and the placing as Chief Operating Officers of the banks of officials of C&S."
1974.73-1933,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1133.006,1149.621,"It seemed to me -- it would seem to me, if I may think out loud that your case would be is stronger if you do not rely on the sponsorship in creation of these banks, but rather analogize them to banks that were independently sponsored."
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1149.621,1152.827,"Well, they purported to be independently sponsored."
1974.73-1933,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1152.827,1153.284,Right.
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1153.284,1157.021,"But, but things began to develop."
1974.73-1933,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1168.936,1170.096,There are some pictures here.
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1170.096,1182.574,"There are some pictures showing that and they also used the logo gram which is this lollipop like thing with a distinctive letter C&S, so when the public pass by these banks, they seemed to be C&S banks."
1974.73-1933,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1252.833,1253.684,Mr. Friedman.
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1253.684,1254.058,Yes.
1974.73-1933,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1254.058,1265.96,"Excuse me to interrupting you, but I wonder whether the Stone Mountain as I recollect it is fairly comparable, wasn't there a stockholder who owned more than 50% of that bank?"
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1265.96,1267.434,I believe 30%.
1974.73-1933,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1267.434,1267.61,30%.
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1267.61,1269.462,It always 30% Mr. Justice.
1974.73-1933,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1269.462,1272.663,"For SEC purposes, it's more than abundant for control?"
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1272.663,1273.444,Yes.
1974.73-1933,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1273.444,1285.651,"In any event, the stockholders of the other 5 percent banks as I recall were for the most part employees, officers and directors, and the stockholders of C&S."
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1285.651,1289.01,"I'm not sure for the most part, there was substantial number."
1974.73-1933,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1492.507,1497.819,To what point now do you direct these examples Mr. Friedman?
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1497.819,1498.594,This is to show --
1974.73-1933,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1498.594,1501.051,Are you speaking of the past situation aren't you?
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1501.051,1501.601,"Well, not that far."
1974.73-1933,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1501.601,1503.367,The five percent arrangement.
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1503.367,1504.73,The five percent arrangement.
1974.73-1933,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1547.599,1562.201,"Does that not also suggest, doesn't that lessen the distinction that you were previously making between the situation as it was and the situation as it will be after the acquisition?"
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1562.201,1562.391,"No, no."
1974.73-1933,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1562.391,1568.128,I think you're narrowing the gap when you press that point.
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1568.128,1580.961,"Mr. Justice, obviously if as we say and as they concede in effect, there is no competition barring the acquisitions will not indirectly increase competition."
1974.73-1933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1715.208,1721.419,"Mr. Friedman, you say this supports -- would support a finding of an agreement not to compete?"
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1721.419,1722.985,We act out stronger than that.
1974.73-1933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1734.481,1738.945,Did the Government submit proposed findings to the District Court to this effect?
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1738.945,1739.894,"Yes, yes, we did."
1974.73-1933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.894,1742.734,And the District Court refused to make this finding.
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1742.734,1771.427,"What the District Court found -- the District Court found in this case that this was not the result of any agreement because as it put it, this denied that the service or information received by these banks from C&S was the result of any tacit or explicit combinations rather than the natural deference of the recipient to information from one with greater expertise or better sources."
1974.73-1933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1771.427,1776.581,Then the Government to upset the District Court's conclusion has to say that it's clearly erroneous.
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1776.581,1783.176,"We think the ultimate finding, the ultimate finding of no agreement in this case is clearly erroneous."
1974.73-1933,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1867.084,1867.993,Plus the name.
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,1867.993,1870.677,"Plus the name, thank you Mr. Justice."
1974.73-1933,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2267.821,2277.709,"Well, are you saying that each of these five percent situations was violation or only that taken all together against this whole background?"
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,2277.709,2295.035,"I would say each one -- I would say each one Mr. Justice was because in each case, each five percent bank was an independent entity and in each instance what you had was the complete elimination of competition between C&S and the fives."
1974.73-1933,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.754,2327.928,Do you think we need any market analysis in the case at all on the Sherman Act?
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,2327.928,2329.216,I don't believe so Mr. Justice.
1974.73-1933,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.216,2336.105,"Well, just tell what is the -- what is the per se violation, just an agreement not to compete?"
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,2336.105,2340.114,An agreement and understanding not to compete at all in anyway.
1974.73-1933,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.787,2346.702,And so if the price fixing agreement is per se this is a fortiori.
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,2346.702,2347.852,That's correct.
1974.73-1933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2350.371,2362.166,"Well, if what the bank in Birmingham agreed with the bank in Atlanta not to compete and in fact there was no real realistic possibility of competition between, would that be a violation of the Sherman Act?"
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,2362.166,2369.957,"If there was no realistic possibility at all, if they were completely independent, I doubt it very much, but that's not this case."
1974.73-1933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2384.522,2389.101,But don't you have to know something about the market then in order to answer Justice White's question.
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,2389.101,2392.624,"Well, I think I interpreted --"
1974.73-1933,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2392.624,2394.098,You know that.
1974.73-1933,0,23500,friedman,,2394.098,2404.899,"Yeah, I interpreted Justice White's question as meaning whether it would be necessary to define a market in the way that it is normally defined for Section 7 purposes, my answer is no, not under Section 1."
1974.73-1933,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2446.113,2448.018,Mr. Hodgson.
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,2448.018,2452.473,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1933,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2991.798,2995.322,This was in no way of violation of state law to use the C&S name.
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,2995.322,2996.639,No sir.
1974.73-1933,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3011.788,3013.092,Franchisees?
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,3013.092,3021.834,"Very some, if Your Honor please, in an area where at this point in time C&S could not go, could not have its own direct operation."
1974.73-1933,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3606.723,3615.97,"Could it be -- they would be capable of the -- this emancipation that I discussed with Mr. Friedman, would they not?"
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,3615.97,3623.699,"Oh, Mr. Chief Justice indeed they would be capable of this emancipation as they always have been."
1974.73-1933,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3698.473,3704.58,Do you know -- does the record show whether there were restrictions on the transfer of the bank stocks.
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,3704.58,3707.424,Restrictions on transfer of bank stock?
1974.73-1933,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3707.424,3713.235,"Internally, when the bank -- when the stock was issued to bank people, were there any buy and sell arrangements --"
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,3713.235,3719.064,"There is no evidence to that effect and I can ensure Your Honor, so far as I know there are none."
1974.73-1933,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3719.064,3721.706,So the stock was -- could be free transferred.
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,3721.706,3728.312,"Oh, yes sir, yes sir, freely transferable stock, no limitations and then not let away --"
1974.73-1933,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3728.312,3732.344,People sometimes need money and sell their stock and sometimes they die.
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,3733.104,3734.153,"Yes sir, but I believe--"
1974.73-1933,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3734.153,3736.287,In the same hands forever.
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,3736.287,3736.626,Yes sir.
1974.73-1933,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3754.921,3755.813,The economics?
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,3755.813,3757.492,"Yes sir, the economics of it."
1974.73-1933,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3764.695,3784.402,"In a hypothetical bank what Mr. Justice Rehnquist I think asked you about the bank over in Birmingham closely set out on a plan to buy above the stock that's got available in anyone of these five banks, against the possibility that one day they might want to enter that market."
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,3784.402,3791.122,"I don't believe much would be sold if Your Honor please, but it's totally hypothetical."
1974.73-1933,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3818.276,3825.926,"Also very difficult hypothetical question for you to answer to me, because it is possible isn't it?"
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,3825.926,3828.098,"Oh, if Your Honor please of course it's possible."
1974.73-1933,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3836.314,3856.623,"It is also a fact, an economic fact in some localities that when banks of this kind are organize the stockholders looked down the road to the day when laws will permit mergers and then they will acquire the stock of the C&S bank."
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,3856.623,3860.582,"If Your Honor please, there is expressed evidence in this record to that effect."
1974.73-1933,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3868.922,3870.706,We'll resume there after lunch.
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,3870.706,3879.078,Thank you Your Honor.
1974.73-1933,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3879.078,3882.333,Mr. Hodgson you may continue.
1974.73-1933,1,21025,daniel_b_hodgson,,3882.333,3885.98,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court again.
1974.73-1933,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5206.91,5209.099,Mr. Friedman do you have anything further?
1974.73-1933,2,23500,friedman,,5209.099,5213.429,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to just answer two or three things -- say two or three things."
1974.73-1933,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5456.775,5457.664,Thank you Mr. Friedman.
