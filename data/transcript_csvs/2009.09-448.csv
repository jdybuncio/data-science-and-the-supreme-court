2009.09-448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.07,"We'll hear argument next in Case 09-448, Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company."
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,6.887,27.917,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Fourth Circuit vacated an award of attorney's fees to Petitioner Hardt even though the district court found Respondent violated ERISA in bad faith and required Respondent to redetermine benefits within 30 days or face adverse judgment."
2009.09-448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,54.301,69.477,"What do you define as -- assuming that we go back to our prior language and use -- in Ruckelshaus, ""some success on the merits"", what's the ""some success on the merits"" that you claim your client reached?"
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,69.477,80.302,"--In that instance, the ERISA violation in this instance."
2009.09-448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,80.302,94.962,"Now, I believe that this circuit said, yes, there are cases where we have so held, but that's because there was a cause of action under the complaint that -- that alleged a violation of the Act."
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,111.07,113.856,"They misread the complaint, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.09-448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,179.396,191.017,"So what do you think our -- the meaning of our footnote, Chief Justice Rehnquist's footnote in Ruckelshaus, who said a procedural victory is not some success on the merits."
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,199.623,205.777,"--I think it foreshadowed the Hanrahan-type case, and we are miles apart from Hanrahan."
2009.09-448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.744,231.828,It was the same in Hanrahan.
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,247.54,253.175,"But, in Hanrahan, there was no finding of a violation of law, Justice Scalia."
2009.09-448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,287.063,294.735,"Are you saying that in Hanrahan there was no prod at all from the court, and here there is?"
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,294.735,296.437,I'm sorry--
2009.09-448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,296.437,307.627,"In Hanrahan, there was no prod from the court; the court didn't say anything that -- it was the filing of the complaint that led to the action, wasn't it?"
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,307.627,317.534,"--Well, what happened was the district court, I believe, granted a motion to dismiss or a motion for judgment as of law at trial."
2009.09-448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,335.646,349.672,"Suppose now, in response to ""Do it right"", Reliance on a complete record and very careful review finds that total disability was not proved."
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,352.357,352.99,--No.
2009.09-448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,384.227,389.047,"Well, this district court kept jurisdiction over the action."
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,409.841,416.411,"Absolutely, the court at that point, if he's closing the case out in particular and entering judgment as to the violation--"
2009.09-448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,416.411,425.616,"So that even if, when it goes back to Reliance, Reliance finds that it's patently frivolous, close to a fraud, she -- the employee still gets the fee?"
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,425.616,430.135,"--The only way it's going back, Justice Kennedy, is from a violation of law."
2009.09-448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,477.915,482.318,"Well, she prevailed in some way to give her another chance to make that argument."
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,482.318,483.018,Again--
2009.09-448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,483.018,484.77,I'm just saying I think you're giving up too much.
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,484.77,487.42,"--Maybe I am, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.09-448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,510.717,515.988,"Well, what if you get in Justice Kennedy's situation, where the court doesn't know what's going to happen on remand?"
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,534.165,536.598,--It -- it depends on what the district court does with it.
2009.09-448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,548.056,553.524,So is the district court -- is the district court supposed to wait until the whole thing is over before deciding the fee application?
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,553.524,559.244,--I think the better practice is for the district court to hold the case over and supervise the remand.
2009.09-448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,636.011,642.601,How could somebody have some success on the merits if they don't achieve a judgment of some sort?
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,642.601,671.834,"This case -- in the -- in the Bradley case, which was cited in Hanrahan, said you have many final orders in a case, and if the court determines an issue of -- a particular issue in a case -- and here it's finding an ERISA violation -- and as relief for that they are issuing an order requiring Reliance to act within 30 days, let's say the case settles at that point."
2009.09-448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,694.061,699.615,"But under your theory, presumably no relief has to be granted?"
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,699.615,701.734,--Relief does not have to be granted.
2009.09-448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,702.567,726.2,"But then what -- what's the difference -- is it your theory that if the district court -- for whatever reason, if this wasn't an ERISA case where a remand -- or where the court said they did violate, but I've now looked at the evidence that you're proffering, the new evidence they did not consider, and it's not enough for benefits; you don't get it."
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,735.99,736.623,"--Yes, it is."
2009.09-448,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,768.377,779.915,"Going back to Justice Scalia's question, what's the difference between Hanrahan, where there's a violation of the civil procedure code which is an entitlement to process?"
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,791.623,794.492,--Because you have to look at the party who is violating.
2009.09-448,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.509,824.944,May I ask -- ask this question?
2009.09-448,0,28803,john_r_ates,,841.989,847.208,The district court can exercise its discretion and not award fees.
2009.09-448,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,959.392,960.328,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,973.219,990.614,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court found that Respondent's original decision denying benefits disregarded pertinent medical evidence in violation of ERISA and found that the decision was otherwise unsupported by substantial evidence."
2009.09-448,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1024.585,1031.655,"Could you tell me whether you differ in your definition of ""some success on the merits"" than your predecessor colleague?"
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1049.45,1054.604,"--Yes, I -- I think we are in an agreement, Your Honor, with -- with -- with Petitioner's characterization."
2009.09-448,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1057.556,1059.339,"No, that's different than what he said."
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1059.339,1059.872,--Okay.
2009.09-448,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1059.872,1060.591,All right.
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1095.412,1100.066,"I don't want to characterize his view, but here's our view on -- on ""some success on the merits""."
2009.09-448,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1105.101,1105.97,"No, I didn't assume this case."
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1105.97,1106.636,--Pardon?
2009.09-448,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1106.636,1108.82,"No order, just a finding."
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1108.82,1113.39,"So there's a finding of an ERISA violation, period?"
2009.09-448,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1113.39,1114.157,And then a settlement.
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1114.157,1115.409,And then a settlement.
2009.09-448,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1165.191,1173.011,"Well, that seems like a catalyst theory, and that was, at least in dicta, rejected in -- in Ruckelshaus."
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1174.797,1195.643,"--Well, it wasn't -- in the dictum in Ruckelshaus; it was actually accepted, Your Honor, in that -- in the footnote the Court -- in the dictum within Ruckelshaus, the Court says quite plainly that Congress, in departing from a strict prevailing party language in Ruckelshaus, meant to embrace judicial -- relief that wasn't encapsulated within a judicial order."
2009.09-448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.059,1253.396,"As the Respondent points out, the position you're taking is unusual for the government."
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1261.668,1262.034,--Right.
2009.09-448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.034,1264.953,So long as you know that you're making your bed and you're going to have to lie in it--
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1295.64,1305.263,"Your Honor, a couple of responses: First of all, ERISA is somewhat unique in that ERISA -- first of all, this provision doesn't have prevailing party language as -- unlike EAJA, for example--"
2009.09-448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.263,1309.215,"No, I'm talking about other prevailing -- I'm talking about other statutes that don't say ""prevailing party""."
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1309.215,1309.465,--Okay.
2009.09-448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1309.465,1309.965,Sure.
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1309.965,1321.439,"I think still this provision is unique in that it's informed explicitly by trust law principles, as this Court has held numerous -- in numerous decisions regarding other ERISA provisions."
2009.09-448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1339.834,1347.84,I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure it's reasonable to interpret an attorney's fee provision as having anything to do with trust law.
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1347.84,1348.356,"--Well, even--"
2009.09-448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.356,1356.344,"It's -- it's a requirement of attorney's fees enacted by -- by the Federal Congress, and I -- I find that very artificial."
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1356.344,1368.587,"--Well, Your Honor, it's -- it's a fee provision enacted within ERISA which explicitly states as one of its purposes to protect beneficiaries and to provide them access to courts."
2009.09-448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1370.003,1376.323,"Well, I -- I can see now why the red brief has a very substantial appendix with statutes."
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1386.714,1387.231,Correct.
2009.09-448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1387.231,1393.968,"But just in going through the list of the statutes, there are many statutes that are not prevailing party statutes."
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1406.61,1407.045,Right.
2009.09-448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1411.696,1414.212,"Take the case, though -- just take the -- what is the government's position?"
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1452.051,1457.789,"--Under your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, a district court would be within its jurisdiction to deny attorney's fees."
2009.09-448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1458.491,1459.391,My question is--
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1459.391,1459.907,--He wouldn't--
2009.09-448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1459.907,1467.513,"--does the statute, in the view of the government, permit attorney's fees in the case I just mentioned?"
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1467.513,1469.68,--Probably not in application.
2009.09-448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1471.982,1473.182,"Your answer is, yes--"
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1473.182,1473.683,--Yes.
2009.09-448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1473.683,1474.183,--it does permit?
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1474.183,1474.634,Yes.
2009.09-448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1475.8,1476.202,All right.
2009.09-448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1481.47,1485.558,What if -- what if the success is preliminary?
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1498.365,1498.715,"--No, Your Honor--"
2009.09-448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1498.715,1499.215,--Why?
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1500.065,1523.997,"--No, Your Honor, because that would be captured within Hanrahan, we think, and that's -- and that's easily distinguishable because those are errors -- even if some of those procedural victories were overturned on appeal or procedural losses were overturned on appeal, those are all errors within the court system or victories within the procedures of the court system, not a violation of -- on the merits of the underlying claim, which is what we have here."
2009.09-448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.449,1531.651,"But then, aren't you treating the statute as though it did have a prevailing party clause in it?"
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1531.651,1532.936,"--Pardon, Your Honor."
2009.09-448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1532.936,1540.523,Is not your construction one that just treats the statute as though it required the plaintiff to be a prevailing party?
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1540.523,1542.356,"Well -- well, Your Honor, no."
2009.09-448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1571.356,1576.808,"Well, under your -- under your rule would it be error for the district court to terminate its jurisdiction?"
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1580.093,1583.545,"--No -- no, Your Honor, I don't think it must keep jurisdiction."
2009.09-448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1586.164,1594.318,"Well, but it certainly has to in order to adopt the ameliorating factors that you -- that you use in order to justify this rule."
2009.09-448,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1599.654,1600.839,"--May I respond, Your Honor?"
2009.09-448,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1651.939,1652.989,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,1665.33,1673.62,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: No judge has ever decided the merits of Petitioner's claim for benefits."
2009.09-448,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1686.177,1690.231,What about the footnote that was mentioned in Ruckelshaus that said:
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,1707.074,1709.359,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.09-448,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1732.724,1735.526,This is not merely a catalyst.
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,1791.013,1800.534,"Yes, Your Honor, but it would be an utterly unadministrable rule to attempt to weigh the inclinations of district judges in their opinions."
2009.09-448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1807.438,1808.724,"Well, the judgment is, send it back."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,1885.387,1895.028,"Your Honor, Petitioner in this case, like all plaintiffs, arrived in court requesting a judgment, a judgment awarding her benefits."
2009.09-448,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1923.929,1934.652,His point -- your adversary's point -- is the court couldn't effect that procedural move without taking step one in what was requested.
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,1971.706,1975.876,"--Your Honor, this is a purely interlocutory order."
2009.09-448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1996.623,2003.027,"Counsel, what is the impact on your position of our decision last week in Conkright v. Frommert?"
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2007.229,2017.453,"--Your Honor, Conkright emphasizes that these judgments are to be made in the first instance and, in fact, in the second instance by claims administrators, that that is--"
2009.09-448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2017.453,2034.646,"I would have thought that it -- one thing it did emphasize, that in the typical case, the likely relief is going to be sending it back rather than making a judicial decision, which -- which seems to me, then, that -- and then presumably, in most cases, the person would prevail before the plan administrator."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2042.919,2057.344,"--Your Honor, it's -- you are correct that in Conkright, the Court -- Court indicated that in most cases the district court should remand under circumstances like this."
2009.09-448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2070.152,2077.158,"Even though the -- as in Conkright, the claimant's success can -- before an agreement, can be quite dramatic."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2086.114,2088.947,"--Your Honor, I'm not sure this should be characterized as a victory."
2009.09-448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.979,2115.364,"Future claimants will not ask for summary judgment from the district court, presumably, in light of Conkright."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2121.149,2127.505,"--I don't think that future claimants will ask for a remand as their final form of relief, Your Honor."
2009.09-448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2134.442,2136.625,"Well, we've -- we've already told them they can't get that."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2136.625,2152.987,"--Your Honor, a plaintiff could get an -- could get the relief of benefits if a claims administrator had acted severely improperly or in very bad faith."
2009.09-448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.057,2160.657,The claimant doesn't -- doesn't really claim that.
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2173.714,2175.25,--But the correct way to--
2009.09-448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2175.25,2181.92,"So he would not ask for money and, therefore, would be victorious, on your analysis."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2184.436,2185.455,"--No, Your Honor."
2009.09-448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2203.249,2208.301,"If someone wants a remand, it's a remand, but on limited grounds; that is, a holding of the district court."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2245.91,2246.862,--Your Honor--
2009.09-448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2246.862,2247.645,If that's what you think.
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2247.645,2256.934,"--Your Honor, a remand order under those circumstances might constitute success on the merits because it resolves an issue in the case, which was liability in the case."
2009.09-448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2268.64,2285.684,"You distinguish between him saying you have to give her at least 30 and his saying the evidence that supports giving her less than 30 is -- insufficient, is substantially -- is -- what's the word?"
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2288.053,2292.857,"Yes, Your Honor, this Court has -- this Court has expressly distinguished between judicial--"
2009.09-448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2292.857,2293.923,That's the line you draw?
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2293.923,2299.177,"--Yes, Your Honor, the difference between judicial pronouncements and judicial relief is one that this Court has--"
2009.09-448,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2299.177,2300.177,That -- that's difficult.
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2326.475,2337.1,"--No, Your Honor, in your hypothetical the -- the remand order would presumably be a final judgment, and it might well constitute success on the merits."
2009.09-448,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2337.1,2337.983,So you're -- you're -- wait a minute.
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2366.802,2371.421,"Your Honor, I'm not sure that's a properly formatted ERISA complaint."
2009.09-448,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2375.058,2384.913,"Well, what -- what's the difference between the first example I gave, a mandamus to issue a decision -- that's not a claim for benefits, either; it's a claim for a decision."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2388.532,2396.638,"--If the -- if the gravamen of the complaint is a complaint for benefits, then the complaint should ask for benefits, and the judge should resolve that case."
2009.09-448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2405.327,2406.261,Is that how it works?
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2439.232,2450.54,"Your Honor, on the research that we have done, most district courts hold jurisdiction on remands such as this, and we believe that is the proper course."
2009.09-448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2461.18,2462.763,"That may be, but why can't they do this?"
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2500.769,2507.506,"Your Honor, I believe that would be to embrace the catalyst theory that this Court rejected in 2000--"
2009.09-448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2507.506,2509.875,It didn't say anything against the catalyst theory.
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2529.788,2536.208,"--Your Honor, the Court was careful in Ruckelshaus to say that a purely procedural victory would not suffice."
2009.09-448,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2554.57,2570.781,"Mr. Rosenkranz, suppose the complaint was: I asked for a turnover of certain documents; they refused without reason."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2611.237,2615.272,"--On your hypothetical, Your Honor, that would not be an interlocutory order."
2009.09-448,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2637.102,2646.891,So that would fall -- even if in the end of the -- at the end of the day no -- no award is made?
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2650.009,2658.515,"Your Honor, it might be proper to frame a complaint under ERISA for a purely procedural remedy like some documents."
2009.09-448,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2668.004,2674.125,"But you -- but you say -- you called it purely procedural and you said yes, but that's the only thing that she asked for."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2684.813,2685.846,--Your Honor--
2009.09-448,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2685.846,2686.882,--so she gets benefits.
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2686.882,2694.336,--I'm not sure that a properly framed ERISA complaint would be -- would be for a purely procedural result.
2009.09-448,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2697.74,2700.942,"Well, I'm not dealing with something obscure."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2723.939,2724.789,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.09-448,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2724.789,2730.359,"But, nonetheless, benefits would be -- nonetheless, fees would be available?"
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2730.359,2737.948,"Your Honor, our position is that in this case the remand order was both purely procedural and interlocutory."
2009.09-448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2750.772,2751.172,What if--
2009.09-448,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2751.172,2752.791,You're changing -- you're changing the answer.
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2762.647,2768.901,"Your Honor, it would qualify in the sense that it would be a final judgment, not an interlocutory order."
2009.09-448,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2780.487,2784.623,Suppose the claim were: They're just not processing my application.
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2796.847,2805.888,"--Again, Your Honor, that would perhaps be best characterized as a purely procedural victory even though it's a final judgment and even though it's what the plaintiff sought."
2009.09-448,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2819.212,2828.068,"The government in response to questions about the significance and the consequences of its position said, oh, this is a unique statute."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2838.756,2840.625,"No, Justice Kennedy, I don't."
2009.09-448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2858.67,2867.091,"What if the parties -- to follow up on Justice Ginsburg's line of questioning, what if the parties decide, look, this case rises or falls on the discovery issue?"
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2877.963,2880.148,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2009.09-448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2887.552,2894.574,"Well, it grants the discovery order, and as a result, a direct result of that ruling, the plan pays benefits."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2894.574,2895.741,"No, Your Honor."
2009.09-448,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2908.667,2916.005,So what is the difference between prevailing party and some success on the merits for you?
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2920.475,2942.572,"Your Honor, in Ruckelshaus, the Courts emphasized that omitting words like ""prevailing party"" or ""success"" from a statute is significant, but it's not revolutionary, that what it accomplishes is a decrease in the quantum of success required -- the degree, I believe was the Court's language -- but not the type of success required."
2009.09-448,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2943.355,2947.473,"So under Buckhannon, 51 percent only entitles you to fees."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2953.811,2965.951,"--Your Honor, the -- the Court in Ruckelshaus was speaking of the interpretation of 1970s."
2009.09-448,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2988.984,2990.15,So you -- you see no difference today?
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,2990.15,2996.137,"--There may still be a difference, but it will be a smaller difference and a difference only in quantity, certainly not a difference in type."
2009.09-448,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3083.471,3084.737,May I ask this question?
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,3105.532,3107.333,"--Your Honor, I don't think so."
2009.09-448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3134.565,3138.684,"--Well, it's a trust -- trust law is at issue here, is the government's assertion."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,3138.684,3148.79,"--Your Honor, I agree with you that it seems artificial in a way to apply those -- to apply -- to import those principles entirely."
2009.09-448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3205.542,3209.578,You also received -- she also received a conditional judgment in her favor.
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,3209.578,3216.148,The district court specified that if Reliance did not comply with this procedural--
2009.09-448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3216.148,3222.588,"She said: Unless this order goes into effect within 30 days, the judgment will be entered for the plaintiff, for her -- for her."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,3222.588,3223.254,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.09-448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3226.123,3228.24,"Well, she got one judgment in her favor."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,3246.701,3249.518,"--Your Honor, she didn't actually get a judgment."
2009.09-448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3249.919,3250.585,"Well, let's read the judgment."
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,3292.621,3300.561,"--Your Honor, I think that's only -- the district court was only saying what is implicit in most all procedural orders--"
2009.09-448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3300.561,3300.844,No.
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,3310.666,3316.903,"--But, Your Honor, if a party ignores the procedural order of a district court, it does so often on peril of default."
2009.09-448,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3317.57,3329.793,"I'm just saying, if we're going to be formal and we're going to look to certain words included in -- in certain papers, irrespective of what really happened, don't we have those words in the paper that's relevant here?"
2009.09-448,2,37276,nicholas_q_rosenkranz,,3329.793,3333.745,"--Again, Your Honor, the district court did not decide the merits of this case."
2009.09-448,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3392.218,3393.001,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.09-448,3,28803,john_r_ates,,3395.586,3427.391,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I have two points on rebuttal: Under their we must have a final judgment on the benefits on her claim for -- final judgment on the merits on her claim for benefits, that is absolutely foreclosed by this Court's decision in Schaefer, where a Social Security claimant comes forward, shows a violation by the Secretary; it's remanded back to the Secretary; the case is closed at that point."
2009.09-448,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3648.749,3649.182,Sure.
2009.09-448,3,28803,john_r_ates,,3649.182,3655.736,The only issue that Reliance contested was whether she was a prevailing party.
2009.09-448,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3660.205,3660.723,"Thank you, counsel."
