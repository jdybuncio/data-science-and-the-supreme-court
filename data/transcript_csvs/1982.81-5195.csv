1982.81-5195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.994,We will hear arguments first this morning in Jones against the United States.
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,11.679,13.773,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-5195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.006,138.3,"Mr. Wasserstrom, you're not challenging, as I understand it, the initial commitment."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,152.464,160.57,"Our position is, Your Honor, that he has to be released at that time unless the Government can at that time prove his commitability by the standards required."
1982.81-5195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.57,167.737,"And you are not challenging, then, the standard or burden of proof at the time of his commitment?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,167.737,170.596,It's our position that question is not raised in this case.
1982.81-5195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.007,212.706,"If his initial commitment is not punitive, then how is the statutory period of time that he could serve on the criminal charge relevant?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,212.706,225.045,"Well, we think the only justifications that could, the only justifications that could countenance that initial commitment are punitive in nature, that is, are a kind of punitive rationale."
1982.81-5195,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.045,232.79,And so for us to agree with your position we would have to conclude that his initial commitment was punitive?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,232.79,251.971,"Your Honor, I don't think that it's terribly important whether the word ""punitive"" is used, but I do think that any kinds of justifications which would justify the initial commitment are what I would call backward looking justifications, that is, justifications that do turn on the fact that he was found to have committed a criminal act beyond a reasonable doubt."
1982.81-5195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,269.386,289.02,"But hasn't this Court, as well as the United States Court of Appeals in the D.C. Circuit, said there's no rational connection between the possible sentence and the possible length of stay after an acquittal, not guilty by reason of insanity?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,289.02,308.417,"I believe that the law in the United States Court of Appeals in Brown against the United States and in Wade v. Jacobs, in both of those cases the Court suggested that there is a relationship between the sentence that might have been imposed and the length that the commitment can persist without the Government proving commitability under civil commitment standards."
1982.81-5195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,314.055,318.399,"Oh, the Court has said expressly that there's no connection, in one case some time ago."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,319.694,333.579,"Well, it is true in Lynch v. Overholser this Court suggested certain rationales for a commitment, but it didn't then go on to say whether those rationales were ones which would justify an indefinite commitment or simply one that would persist as long as the sentence might have been imposed."
1982.81-5195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,346.042,352.259,Does your position depend at all on whether or not the initial crime was a crime of violence?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,355.648,367.017,"Well, of course, the more serious the crime, the longer the maximum sentence that could have been imposed and the more distant the rights that we're talking about, the more distant in time the rights we're talking about would become available."
1982.81-5195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,367.017,371.564,Is a maximum sentence the standard or the actual sentence?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,371.564,373.67,"Well, of course, there never is an actual sentence."
1982.81-5195,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,376.341,376.934,Right.
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,376.934,385.931,"Well, all we're arguing for here is that at the time, once he's been incarcerated as long as the maximum sentence that could have been imposed is up--"
1982.81-5195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,385.931,391.788,"Doesn't the statute say he should be there until he's ""eligible for release""?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,394.459,396.241,"--That is what the statute says, Your Honor."
1982.81-5195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,396.241,398.07,But isn't that clear?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,398.07,399.973,It's clear that that's what the statute says.
1982.81-5195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,399.973,402.192,That doesn't say he automatically gets out in one year.
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,402.192,404.238,"Well, we're not arguing that he should automatically get out after one year."
1982.81-5195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,416.748,419.216,"Well, I mean, he asked for this, didn't he?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,423.447,424.668,--He pled insanity.
1982.81-5195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,424.668,431.462,"Well, so then he says... I don't understand what the one year has to do with it."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,437.24,438.457,"Your Honor, it would be our position--"
1982.81-5195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,438.457,439.818,--in very broad terms.
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,439.818,444.752,"--Well, it would be our position that by raising the insanity defense he shouldn't be held to have agreed to anything."
1982.81-5195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,449.64,459.432,"Well, the law says... the law doesn't say any time that he shall be given this examination, is that right?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,459.432,461.136,The law... that's correct.
1982.81-5195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,465.399,467.431,"Well, when do you say he must have a hearing?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,467.431,477.363,"--We say that he must have a hearing after he's been confined for as long as he could have been upon conviction, not because the statute suggests that, but because we think the Constitution requires it."
1982.81-5195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,477.363,478.989,So you say he should have had a hearing four years ago.
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,478.989,482.112,"That's right, he should have had one then, and he asked for one then."
1982.81-5195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,487.719,488.172,I know that.
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,490.344,491.467,That's when he should have had it.
1982.81-5195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,496.294,505.104,"Isn't your major point, perhaps, or a main point the matter of where the burden of proof lies at the time of that hearing?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,505.104,510.68,"That's right, and for that we rely on this Court's decision in Addington against Texas."
1982.81-5195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,510.68,512.911,"Of course, that was a civil case, wasn't it?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,512.911,514.303,Addington was a civil commitment.
1982.81-5195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,525.501,534.669,Addington was a case where the person was being committed and it was suggested that he was insane for the first time.
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,541.291,546.072,"Your Honor, Mr. Addington had been committed seven times in the eight years preceding his commitment."
1982.81-5195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,546.072,549.242,"Well, but that didn't enter into the Court's assessment, I don't think."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,549.242,550.771,It's part of the facts in Addington.
1982.81-5195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,555.317,561.097,"Well, do you think a different burden of proof would attach if he was being committed for the first time?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,564.75,565.14,No.
1982.81-5195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,573.357,578.886,"Well, I thought the case mentioned one of the interests is not being stigmatized."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,584.193,608.841,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, it seems to me that the rationale of Addington is primarily based on the liberty at stake there and this Court's determination that where there was the kind of massive curtailment of liberty that's involved in an indefinite commitment to a mental hospital, one that can last for a person's life, that the risk of error with respect to that determination should be borne disproportionately by the state."
1982.81-5195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,614.995,618.259,"It says there are two interests, one the one you've just described and one the stigma."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,621.694,625.255,"Well, I think the liberty interest far overshadows the stigma interest."
1982.81-5195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,626.117,628.788,Do you think that Addington says that in so many words?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,628.788,632.63,"--It doesn't say it in so many words, Your Honor, but I think that it is clear from the opinion."
1982.81-5195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,663.961,666.223,"Well, he invites that by pleading insanity."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,666.223,670.239,"Well, the question is whether he invites it beyond what the Constitution permits."
1982.81-5195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,692.369,702.196,"No, but society can certainly take into account his behavior in the criminal trial and what he has asserted there in determining what should happen to him thereafter."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,702.196,706.692,"Well, to begin with, there's no question that society can take that into account in a civil commitment proceeding."
1982.81-5195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,743.663,748.893,"Mr. Wasserstrom, he had the initial 50-day release hearing, did he?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,748.893,750.285,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-5195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,771.853,777.476,"In any event, I gather at the conclusion of that that his confinement to St. Elizabeth's was continued?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,777.476,784.803,"That was because, we submit, the statute says that unless he proves that it shouldn't be continued, it is continued."
1982.81-5195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,786.769,792.237,And was the second hearing six months later or some time longer after?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,792.237,794.845,"No, he never had... well, he didn't really have a second hearing."
1982.81-5195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,803.279,806.715,"Did he initiate... did he request it at that time, after he had been confined over a year?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,806.715,807.901,"His attorney did, in his behalf."
1982.81-5195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,807.901,808.493,Yes.
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,808.493,812.178,And there was no evidence held at that... no evidence was taken at that time.
1982.81-5195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,828.623,835.434,And that is the... that actually then is the sequence before the case gets here?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,835.434,836.776,"That's right, Your Honor."
1982.81-5195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,838.214,839.837,That's six years ago.
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,845.85,851.973,"--At the 50-day hearing there was evidence taken from a psychologist, although the statute requires that it be a psychiatrist."
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.973,852.738,Who presented it?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,852.738,854.816,The Government put on the only witness that was put on at that hearing.
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,854.816,858.282,So the Government assumed at least the burden of going forward with the evidence?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,858.282,862.688,"Although the statute didn't require it to do so, it appears that the Government did assume that burden."
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,862.688,866.296,And there was no contrary evidence?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,866.296,869.263,"No, the defense counsel put on no evidence."
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.263,873.385,And so the testimony of the psychiatrist--
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,873.385,874.465,It was a psychologist.
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,874.465,877.011,--psychologist was uncontradicted?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,877.011,879.288,It was uncontradicted.
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.288,885.524,"And if you believed him and thought he was right, the burden would have been satisfied."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,885.524,889.583,"Well, Your Honor, we would submit that clearly a burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence would not have been satisfied."
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,889.583,894.282,Just by the testimony of a psychologist?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,894.282,897.878,Just because the judge... there's no reason to think that the judge felt it was satisfied.
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.921,915.386,"Do you think we're free to operate under that rule here and say, whatever the rule is, it was satisfied?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,915.386,918.618,"Well, Your Honor, our position is that the Constitution--"
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.618,922.492,"Unless you think, unless you also think, which I suppose you do, that there should have been a jury trial."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,922.492,927.865,"--As a matter of equal protection, although not as a matter of due process, we do think that there should have been a jury trial."
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,951.137,959.213,What should have happened at the hearing is that the Government shouldn't have put on anything?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,959.213,960.976,"That's right, they shouldn't have."
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.788,1005.192,Which hearing?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1005.192,1010.347,"The 50-day hearing, the 50-day hearing, which came eight months after the Defendant was arrested."
1982.81-5195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1047.034,1054.751,"Well, there was one stage in this proceeding, as I understand it, when the Court of Appeals agreed that he was entitled to a civil commitment proceeding."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1054.751,1055.157,That's right.
1982.81-5195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1064.044,1066.387,Is there any reason this has all taken six years to get here?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1066.387,1074.525,"Well, the Court of Appeals each time they decided the case took a year, year and a half, and it decided it three different times."
1982.81-5195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1088.958,1094.877,Is there anything in the record to suggest why no evidence was offered on his behalf?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1099.982,1102.715,"Your Honor, no, I think that's very unlikely."
1982.81-5195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1145.044,1152.134,"Also, probably the average person doesn't have psychiatrists waiting around to testify for them, isn't that true?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1152.134,1156.82,"Well, that, Your Honor, raises what I think is a very interesting point, which is not in any of the briefs."
1982.81-5195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1158.083,1161.238,"I mean, is there any organization of psychiatrists like legal aid?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1161.238,1162.221,"--No, there isn't."
1982.81-5195,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1162.221,1163.847,Psychiatrists aid or something?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1163.847,1164.331,No.
1982.81-5195,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1168.297,1170.843,"Well, there is in Massachusetts."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1170.843,1173.811,--I thought you meant in D.C. There may be in other places.
1982.81-5195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.285,1206.438,Let me just ask one question about your legal theory.
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1210.017,1240.129,"Your Honor, as we said in our reply brief, I think we concede that if our due process argument fails, that is if this Court thinks that the Petitioner here is sufficiently different from the committee in Addington that these procedures that are accorded to him or that are not accorded to him meet due process standards, then it's likely that the Court would uphold the difference, would on the same theory uphold an equal protection claim, but not necessarily."
1982.81-5195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1248.513,1257.198,"The thing that troubles me about your due process argument, supposing we have precisely the same facts, say in Texas, and say in Texas they had a maximum sentence of ten years for this offense."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1260.696,1265.523,--He would have a due process claim once the ten years were up.
1982.81-5195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1265.523,1270.662,But otherwise... different process is required depending on the length of the sentence.
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1270.662,1292.745,"This is because... this is because the legislature in Texas would have said that this kind of conduct merits a possible sentence of up to ten years, and because the rationales for committing people found not guilty by reason of insanity of that conduct are, if there's a justification for commitment at all, ones that look to the nature of the conduct."
1982.81-5195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1292.745,1304.505,"But it seems to me if your case turns on a comparison between his treatment and the treatment of a person who is convicted of the offense, you're really in the final analysis relying on the equal protection clause."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1304.505,1309.411,"Well, I think the two in a case like this are almost coterminous."
1982.81-5195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1309.411,1311.037,Suppose it were a life sentence?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1311.037,1320.876,"Then... again, we're not conceding that a commitment based purely on a not guilty by reason of insanity is ever justifiable."
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.233,1345.505,"Well, unless the rationale you propose inevitably would at least be relevant to the claim, on the very moment that he is acquitted that he may not be committed without having a hearing in which the Government takes the burden of proof."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1345.505,1353.643,"Your Honor, it's the Government, not us, that take the position that this commitment after not guilty by reason of insanity is just like a civil commitment."
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1364.687,1371.231,"If we agree with you, the next challenge will surely be the next day after the acquittal."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1371.231,1381.821,"Then this Court will have to decide whether those other rationales which we are not challenging will justify a commitment, automatic commitment following not guilty by reason of insanity."
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1381.821,1385.631,But agreeing with you has a lot to do with deciding about those other rationales.
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1385.631,1387.113,"I don't think they do, Your Honor."
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.875,1402.485,"Because after all, the acquittal was based on the fact that at the time of the crime the person was insane."
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1402.485,1405.074,That's true.
1982.81-5195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.074,1408.732,Not at the time that he was tried or at the time he's acquitted.
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1408.732,1416.851,"And that's why if the only rationale for the commitment is a conclusion that he's presently mentally ill and dangerous, it seems to me it can't survive."
1982.81-5195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1441.422,1449.369,But you're also asking... are you not also asking that the Government must maintain the burden of proof at all times?
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1449.369,1458.365,All we're arguing here is that it must meet the Addington standard of proof once the Petitioner has been confined for as long as he could have been confined if he had been convicted.
1982.81-5195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1458.365,1465.161,"In other words, you'd like to have us import the civil standard into the criminal law?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1465.161,1474.001,"Well, again, Your Honor, it's because the rationales which support his initial commitment are ones which simply do not justify a commitment of an indefinite duration."
1982.81-5195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1481.715,1500.052,"Mr. Wasserstrom, if you rely on a comparison to the criminal proceeding to judge the adequacy of the insanity procedures, would it be constitutional to do away with the 50-day hearing that you now have and substitute a hearing at the time when the man first becomes eligible for parole?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1500.052,1503.834,I would see no problem with that at all.
1982.81-5195,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1533.337,1546.891,"No, but I'm just thinking that the other side of the coin is, would it be permissible to govern the scheduling of potential release hearings by a schedule that just paralleled what would be appropriate if the man had not been found not guilty by reason of insanity?"
1982.81-5195,0,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,1546.891,1553.03,"Again, Your Honor, this Court would have to first answer the question whether those other rationales for an automatic commitment are justifiable ones."
1982.81-5195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1582.802,1584.628,Very well.
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,1588.596,1599.137,Thank you.
1982.81-5195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.787,2079.752,That was at the time of the crime.
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2079.752,2081.222,That's right.
1982.81-5195,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2088.779,2094.98,"Mr. Schwartz, was that in effect an overruling of Davis against the United States by the Congress?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2094.98,2096.824,"--No, it clearly was not, Your Honor."
1982.81-5195,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2118.049,2121.22,So in effect it was an overruling of Davis.
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2121.22,2126.765,"Well, it changed the result of Davis for the District of Columbia."
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2305.709,2308.973,"But ""temporary"" here in this case is six years."
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2308.973,2309.769,No.
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2323.405,2324.217,I am all ears.
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2324.217,2334.257,"The Government's contention is that the reason that Mr. Jones is today committed are twofold: One, a hearing was held at the conclusion of 50 days."
1982.81-5195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2374.851,2378.303,"Mr. Schwartz, who had the burden at that hearing?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2378.303,2385.068,The statute on its face does prescribe that the burden is upon the acquittee.
1982.81-5195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2399.813,2408.072,"Yet, according to the transcript of that hearing, Mr. Kraekoff... the attorney for the Government, wasn't he?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2408.072,2409.058,Yes.
1982.81-5195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2409.058,2412.431,--began by stating that the burden is on the Defendant.
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2412.431,2414.194,That's right.
1982.81-5195,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2419.957,2424.176,"Well, I certainly would say so, in view of that comment."
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2424.176,2431.141,"He also said that this is a Bolton hearing, and Bolton of course teaches that the burden of proof is on the Government."
1982.81-5195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.392,2623.718,"Well, on that basis the case shouldn't be here at all, I suppose."
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2623.718,2627.937,"--Your Honor, that may be correct."
1982.81-5195,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2680.101,2704.344,"Mr. Schwartz, by way of background information, if you will, under the present statutory scheme is it still possible for an automatic commitment to be made of a defendant who doesn't himself raise the plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, but who is acquitted on those grounds, as occurred in the Overholser case?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2704.344,2708.497,"Justice O'Connor, the answer is clear that that is not possible."
1982.81-5195,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2708.497,2709.137,All right.
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2722.244,2736.395,"The statute doesn't... neither the statute for commitment nor the statute on insanity defenses... and they are all part of Section 301, enacted at one time... does not recognize any difference."
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2768.679,2779.561,"Was there any... as I understand it, he was insane at the time of the crime, but he wasn't insane at the time of the trial?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2779.561,2783.438,"No, he wasn't incompetent at the time of the trial."
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2783.438,2784.577,There is a difference?
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2784.577,2785.949,"Yes, there is."
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2787.622,2790.87,Can you be committed if you're incompetent?
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2790.87,2793.245,--If you're incompetent--
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2793.245,2800.397,"The question is, if you're incompetent, solely incompetent, can you be committed to St. Elizabeth's?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2800.397,2802.912,--You cannot be committed under this scheme.
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2804.648,2808.972,Could you in a civil commitment be put in St. Elizabeth's because you're incompetent?
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2810.676,2816.425,--Only if you are independently found to be mentally ill and dangerous.
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2821.669,2827.545,But I understand that in this case they said that he was insane at the time he committed the crime.
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2827.545,2832.619,But that he nevertheless had become competent by the time of trial.
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2832.619,2834.291,"Well, why was he committed?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2834.291,2840.601,"He was committed because the standard for... first of all, the standard for competency in law is--"
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2840.601,2844.255,"Well, there was no hearing at all about his competency at that time, was there?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2853.657,2854.749,"--Yes, after--"
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2854.749,2856.094,Before he was committed?
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2856.094,2858.075,--No.
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2858.075,2860.075,"Well, that's what I'm talking about."
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2860.075,2861.011,50 days elapsed.
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2861.011,2872.413,"So I'm talking about when he was committed, there was no hearing at all on whether or not he should be committed to St. Elizabeth's."
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2872.413,2873.193,No.
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2876.379,2877.147,What was the hearing?
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2877.147,2878.301,--The hearing was--
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2878.301,2881.254,I thought the hearing was whether or not he committed the crime.
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2881.254,2882.33,--No.
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2903.84,2907.759,But there was no hearing on that day?
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2909.712,2911.24,--On the... I'm afraid I--
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2911.24,2921.239,"On the day that he was committed to St. Elizabeth's after he had been acquitted, was there or was there not a hearing?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2921.239,2922.315,--I understand now.
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2943.666,2947.163,Was it a civil commitment or a criminal commitment?
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2947.163,2952.1,Labels in this area can be confusing and they're rather arbitrary.
1982.81-5195,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2963.44,2964.485,It's both?
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,2964.485,2986.322,"Well, there's no need to reach the issue that Mr. Wasserstrom says that potentially exists, if the Court accepts our argument that Addington is distinguishable and that this class of individuals may be civilly committed, with the full consequences of a civil commitment, with the procedures that are afforded under this statute."
1982.81-5195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3014.715,3017.136,May I ask one question before you do.
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3031.35,3038.626,We are arguing that in this case that was a commitment hearing and that the Government did bear the risk of nonpersuasion as well.
1982.81-5195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3092.544,3100.586,I'm still not entirely clear on what your view of the legal significance of that having been tantamount to a civil commitment hearing would be.
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3106.536,3112.642,"Well, we may be saying other things, but we are among other things saying that, certainly."
1982.81-5195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3112.642,3116.909,Did he get the same periodic review by the head of the hospital and all that sort of thing?
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3116.909,3126.701,The release procedures which Mr. Jones now confronts are the same in material respect to those that confront a civil committee.
1982.81-5195,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3140.087,3142.962,"There are some crucial procedural differences, aren't there?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3142.962,3146.397,"Well, I'm not sure I would agree that they're crucial."
1982.81-5195,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3164.233,3170.683,"Doesn't notice go to the prosecutor and you have an opportunity to contest it, or something?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3170.683,3173.448,That is true.
1982.81-5195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3203.856,3210.338,"Mr. Schwartz, he was entitled after the 50-day period periodically to further hearings, was he not?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3211.932,3216.962,"--I'm afraid, Mr. Justice Brennan, that the answer is not really simple."
1982.81-5195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3220.585,3234.548,"Well, really what I'm coming to... I know your time is running, and I don't want to take it... is there a distinction between periodic hearings for civil committees and this kind of committee?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3234.548,3243.639,"--Under the statute as written, the right to judicial hearings has the same... in both cases has a periodic element."
1982.81-5195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3243.639,3245.23,"Well, are the periods the same?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3245.23,3253.493,They're six-month periods at which the criminal committee may seek his release.
1982.81-5195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3271.579,3283.449,"Well now, you suggested to my brother Stevens that he in effect had all the procedures that a civil committee gets on the occasion of the 50-day hearing, is that right?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3283.449,3289.384,"On the occasion of the 50-day hearing, it is our submission that in this case he did."
1982.81-5195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3289.384,3291.151,As if he had been a civil committee.
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3294.493,3308.051,He is treated as a civil committee in the sense that his continued confinement rests upon the fact that he is unable to show that he is no longer mentally ill and dangerous.
1982.81-5195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3308.051,3311.33,Is he entitled to demand a periodic review?
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3311.33,3316.637,"He is entitled to go to court periodically to review, to seek his release."
1982.81-5195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3316.637,3319.2,As a civil committee or as a criminal committee?
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3319.2,3322.214,I'm not sure the meaning of that term.
1982.81-5195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3358.058,3359.497,"Mr. Schwartz, isn't this much true?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3381.989,3385.831,"--We really don't say anything about that issue, frankly, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1982.81-5195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3388.533,3389.828,"Well, but don't you have to say something about it?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3398.075,3401.183,"--In major respects, he clearly is treated the same way."
1982.81-5195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3402.84,3403.995,"Well, what about particular respects?"
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3408.478,3410.787,--The law of the D.C. Circuit--
1982.81-5195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3410.787,3411.821,Under your view of the law.
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3411.821,3415.35,"--in Bolton versus Harris is that he is, and there's nothing further."
1982.81-5195,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3415.35,3417.631,Has he received that?
1982.81-5195,1,33036,joshua_i_schwartz,,3417.631,3421.145,I frankly do not know that the record reveals that.
1982.81-5195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3429.22,3431.545,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Wasserstrom?"
1982.81-5195,2,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,3431.545,3432.543,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-5195,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3476.198,3479.602,You're addressing the weight of the evidence.
1982.81-5195,2,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,3479.602,3483.99,"--Well, our contention is that it was required to be proved by clear and convincing evidence."
1982.81-5195,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3498.203,3501.436,Is that the real issue that we've taken this case for?
1982.81-5195,2,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,3501.436,3502.481,"Well, I hope not, Your Honor."
1982.81-5195,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3518.18,3519.444,May I ask this question.
1982.81-5195,2,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,3536.453,3537.954,"We would still have an equal protection argument, Your Honor."
1982.81-5195,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3554.305,3557.788,I see.
1982.81-5195,2,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,3557.788,3559.929,"Your Honor, one final point."
1982.81-5195,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3602.894,3606.785,"Let me ask one more question, if I may, because I'm still not entirely clear on your position."
1982.81-5195,2,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,3624.247,3625.667,"Your Honor, those--"
1982.81-5195,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3625.667,3628.493,Difference in the sense of ability to obtain his release?
1982.81-5195,2,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,3628.493,3631.149,--We would submit that there are meaningful differences in the release procedures.
1982.81-5195,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3631.149,3632.397,But you haven't really relied on them.
1982.81-5195,2,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,3632.397,3634.71,"But we're not challenging them, because they weren't really raised in the Petitioner's case."
1982.81-5195,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3640.115,3647.894,"So your case really boils down to the absence of what you consider to be a necessary predicate for indefinite detention, namely a clear and convincing showing in a civil hearing?"
1982.81-5195,2,42299,silas_j_wasserstrom,,3647.894,3648.44,That's right.
1982.81-5195,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3694.314,3695.499,"Thank you, gentlemen."
