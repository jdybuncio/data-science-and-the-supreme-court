1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,0.0,17.105,"-- The Supreme Court of the State of Arkansas, the defendant Frank Andrew Payne is or rather was at the time of the alleged commission of the crime a 19-year-old Negro youth, was tried for a charge of murder in the first degree in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Arkansas."
1957.99,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,164.384,166.688,What is the term of office of the jury commission?
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,166.688,170.814,The term of office of the jury commission amounts to approximately six months.
1957.99,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,179.408,183.33,Is it a -- was it a practice to change them or do they go on (Voice Overlap) --
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,183.33,188.532,It is the practice to change them and I'm rather definite that it is required by law that they be changed.
1957.99,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,205.28,212.415,"May I ask before you get into your argument, is there any literacy test for registering for voters?"
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,212.415,218.075,"Not in the State of Arkansas, the only prerequisite for voting in the State of Arkansas is a payment of a $1 poll tax --"
1957.99,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,218.075,218.646,Yes.
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,218.646,223.018,-- and then you are a qualified to elector for all purposes under the Arkansas law.
1957.99,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,223.018,224.271,Is that accumulated?
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,224.271,225.268,"No, sir."
1957.99,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,235.82,240.895,"Are public officials eligible to serve as jury commissioner, as sheriffs, et cetera?"
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,240.895,244.436,"I do not believe that they are, Your Honor, I could not answer that question."
1957.99,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,252.769,256.937,"Well in this instance, were any of the jury commissioners public officials?"
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,256.937,260.124,"No, sir, none of the jury commissioners were public officials, no."
1957.99,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,347.286,355.434,Well do the jury commissioners for a given term pick the jury panels?
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,355.434,357.65,Only for that one term of court.
1957.99,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,357.65,360.749,And how do they do that within a few days before a term?
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,360.749,377.387,"They are given the poll tax record from the county and purportedly they go through this entire record of persons, of qualified electors and select at random or in any manner that they so desire a sufficient number of persons to serve on the jury panel."
1957.99,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,377.387,378.943,How large is the panel usually?
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,378.943,392.359,"The panels normally in that particular county consist of about 36 persons for the regular panel, then there is a 25-man special list which normally is not opened unless the 36-man panel has been exhausted."
1957.99,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,392.359,397.229,"And does that panel, a grand jury as well as the petit jury is picked from that panel?"
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,397.229,397.499,No.
1957.99,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,460.864,462.852,Do you have peremptory challenges?
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,462.852,463.498,"Yes, Your Honor, we have --"
1957.99,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,463.498,463.871,How many --
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,463.871,464.656,-- peremptory challenges.
1957.99,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,464.656,465.605,How many in a criminal case?(Voice Overlap) --
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,465.605,473.524,In -- in a capital case the state has 10 peremptory challenges and the defendant has 12 peremptory challenges.
1957.99,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,628.645,634.062,Did I understand you to say that there are no qualifications whatever that guides the jury commissioners in that --
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,634.062,641.546,"They must be persons of good moral character, is about the only requirement for serving on the --"
1957.99,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,641.546,643.003,"Well, is that a statutory requirement?"
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,643.003,643.87,That's a statutory requirement.
1957.99,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,643.87,645.768,And that's the only one in the statute?
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,645.768,656.403,"There is -- there's no educational requirement, there's nothing else, that's -- it -- they are taken purely from the electors."
1957.99,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,706.156,717.36,"You mentioned that the state might excise its challenge and thereby challenge all the Negroes who were drawn from the selection of petit juries, you take exception as to that?"
1957.99,0,43997,wiley_a_branton,,717.36,736.629,"Only by saying that because of this inapportioned limiting and having such few Negroes on the panel, we see here that as a practical matter, the total number of Negroes ever appearing on the panel is less than the peremptory challenges allowed to the State even in a misdemeanor case, to say nothing of a capital case."
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,2667.465,2670.782,May it please the Court.
1957.99,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2774.109,2779.728,How many had served the year before?
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,2779.728,2782.869,The payroll record --
1957.99,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2782.869,2786.164,"Well, they couldn't have served without a payroll, could they?"
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,2786.164,2792.624,"They -- no, Your Honor they could not have served without being on it."
1957.99,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2802.594,2810.674,"May I stop you long enough to either tell me, to explain what is meant by his answer, ""Well, they had other reasons."""
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,2825.567,2825.864,"Well, the --"
1957.99,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2825.864,2826.641,(Voice Overlap)
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,2826.641,2831.488,-- the other reasons Your Honor I can't answer.
1957.99,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2841.941,2845.384,"He didn't say, I asked some other reasons for not taking this, (Inaudible)"
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,2845.384,2849.888,"He said they, and later on in his testimony he does explain that."
1957.99,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2861.247,2867.159,"But you've just answered the Chief Justice as to how few they were, so that takes care of the two, (Inaudible)"
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,2867.159,2869.043,Now --
1957.99,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2869.043,2886.48,"Well then, in the year 1954 there were two terms, March 1954 and there was only one Negro who would have disqualified himself for that year because he was the only one called and in the October term there were none called."
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,2886.48,2888.467,Mr. Chief Justice Warren it reflects --
1957.99,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2888.467,2888.761,(Voice Overlap) --
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,2888.761,2889.503,-- this -- this record that --
1957.99,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2889.503,2890.689,-- the number of them (Voice Overlap) --
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,2890.689,2901.111,-- that you are reading from is the payroll record which does not disclose all of the Negroes that were summoned for jury service.
1957.99,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2906.931,2914.052,"Well, if you're -- if you're summoned but excused before you respond to the summons you haven't been on the jury, have you?"
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,2914.052,2923.878,"Well, as a practical matter in Arkansas and the way it works is if you have a toothache or something you can get on the phone and call the judge and tell him, ""Well, I've got a toothache."
1957.99,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2931.164,2934.03,"Now, I can understand all that."
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,2952.538,2956.031,"Well, the -- the record is silent as to that."
1957.99,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3019.343,3021.432,"That's part of the testimony, is it?"
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3025.67,3029.91,"Well, I think its testimony on the part of Mr. Branton's."
1957.99,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3029.91,3030.45,"Well, he doesn't know it."
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3030.45,3035.23,It's -- it's certainly a fact that needed clarifying.
1957.99,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3037.28,3043.453,"I'm asking proof that there were any number -- any number of them, who were thus excused, is it?"
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3043.453,3045.902,There's no -- there's no proof in the record as to that --
1957.99,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3045.902,3046.04,(Voice Overlap)
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3046.04,3062.066,"-- and that's Your Honors, precisely the point I'm making, that under the holding in the Patton against Mississippi, the burden since there were Negroes on this particular panel, the burden was not on the State to show how many Negroes it served or had not served."
1957.99,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3156.431,3163.855,"(Voice Overlap) we have to take this at face value, this testimony, Mr. Branton, you didn't contest it down there."
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3163.855,3165.463,I wasn't there Your Honor.
1957.99,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3165.463,3165.704,But (Voice Overlap) --
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3165.704,3168.293,But the prosecuting attorney did not contest it.
1957.99,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3168.293,3169.212,They didn't contest it.
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3169.212,3169.544,No.
1957.99,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3169.544,3174.813,They wouldn't even -- they wouldn't even let a state officer give the testimony.
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3174.813,3185.035,"Well, the delay of time, I don't think that Mr. Branton would deliberately fabricate his testimony, and I doubt that the judge did there either."
1957.99,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3203.513,3217.61,"Did you -- did you mean if Arkansas had shown there had been only one colored man in 15 years, the burden would be on the -- shall remain on the county?"
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3217.61,3220.395,"It probably wouldn't in that instance, no."
1957.99,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3220.395,3222.814,There are -- there are some other points at which --
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3222.814,3224.406,There are some breaking points.
1957.99,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3244.584,3255.375,"May I ask you one question about the -- those who were excused, I noticed because that figure is probably the same (Inaudible)"
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3272.243,3273.232,That's correct.
1957.99,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3273.232,3280.421,"But if they come to court in response to the summons, they are entitled to their pay, is it not, and get on the paperwork."
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3280.421,3321.294,"Now, I believe Mr. Justice Brennan asked this question too about an Arkansas statute in regard to how the jurors are paid, and that is that Arkansas statutes 39, 301.1 and it reads thusly, “Person whose names appear on any legal and authorized grand jury or petit jury list of the respective counties of Arkansas, shall receive in addition to other fees allowed down blow other than under authority of another Act, A, when such person or a person failed for any reason to attend court, none."
1957.99,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3330.677,3332.314,(Inaudible)
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3332.314,3333.67,That's what actually occurs.
1957.99,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3338.123,3341.299,"I understand, but we -- we can accept the payroll."
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3343.775,3346.862,As meaning everybody who actually served.
1957.99,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3346.862,3348.543,Everybody who actually appeared.
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3348.543,3349.717,"Yes, I believe you can go that far."
1957.99,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3349.717,3350.404,Actually appeared.
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3350.404,3351.539,Actually appeared.
1957.99,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3351.539,3362.2,And those who get excused in advance (Inaudible) that's -- they have to hear from the judge to be excused or not.
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3362.2,3363.051,Not necessarily --
1957.99,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3363.051,3367.321,"(Inaudible) knows how to go up there, calls him up (Inaudible) to get excused."
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3367.321,3379.814,I -- I think the -- how easy can -- you can get excused from serving depends in large part on how pressing the need is for a juror's particular time.
1957.99,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3379.814,3385.074,"Well, I'm taking about the -- it's a small number that get excused, is it not?"
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3385.074,3386.875,"I would say so, yes."
1957.99,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3386.875,3389.59,And -- and it would likely be as many on one side --
1957.99,1,43382,thorp_thomas,,3389.59,3394.584,As the other.
1957.99,2,43997,wiley_a_branton,,6887.664,6888.925,May it please the Court.
1957.99,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,7035.332,7047.721,Did that testimony (Inaudible) $400 from the deceased?
1957.99,2,43997,wiley_a_branton,,7053.241,7054.412,"No, sir."
1957.99,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,7054.412,7058.896,(Inaudible) and the testimony went in.
1957.99,2,43997,wiley_a_branton,,7058.896,7063.877,"If Your Honor please, we object to the information in the first place because --"
1957.99,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,7063.877,7074.103,"Well, did you object to the inference that the $400 of the deceased money was found in the home of the deceased --"
1957.99,2,43997,wiley_a_branton,,7074.103,7074.393,We objected --
1957.99,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,7074.393,7075.489,-- of the petitioner.
1957.99,2,43997,wiley_a_branton,,7075.489,7081.914,"We objected to the testimony of Sergent Halsell who first testified, yes, sir we did."
