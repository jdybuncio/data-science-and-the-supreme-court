1963.199,0,38972,robert_j_carluccio,,11.109,16.555,Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices of this Honorable Court.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3463.388,3469.946,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3620.07,3623.477,(Inaudible)
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3623.477,3628.414,He refused to -- he -- he was present or had been -- he was present at the start of the first trial.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3636.918,3639.01,He pleaded guilty at the beginning of the second --
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3639.01,3640.549,Of the second trial.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3643.55,3643.836,Yes.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3643.836,3645.981,He was called as a witness.
1963.199,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3674.046,3675.499,"The very next day, was it not or --"
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3675.499,3678.255,"Yes, a very soon thereafter."
1963.199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3740.317,3746.509,Suppose there -- there's no intimation that Colson fears (Inaudible).
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3746.509,3747.299,"No, no."
1963.199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3779.526,3796.216,(Inaudible)
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3796.216,3798.946,This -- there's no -- there's no such claim on our part.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3810.429,3819.261,"But does that -- does that excuse putting on secondary evidence or for witness just says, ""I refuse to talk because I'm afraid of what might happen to me if (Voice Overlap) --"
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3819.261,3822.544,"No, when I reach that part in my argument --"
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3822.544,3823.089,Alright.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3823.089,3823.897,-- Mr. Chief Justice --
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3823.897,3824.145,Alright.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3824.145,3838.714,"-- I -- I will discuss it and will try and discuss both sides but our conclusion is that if -- that this is evidence, I wouldn't characterize it as secondary evidence, that this evidence is admissible."
1963.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3910.849,3914.806,It's without reference to the fact that On Lee was not under indictment.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3914.806,3916.059,"On Lee was under indictment, Mr. Justice."
1963.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3916.059,3916.898,"No, he is not."
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3919.32,3922.381,There was -- I think there was an information.
1963.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3922.381,3923.059,Alright.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3923.059,3924.286,And I think the record will also show --
1963.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3924.286,3928.521,It does not -- it does not appear that On Lee had an attorney.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3928.521,3930.166,It did not appear in the opinion.
1963.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3947.42,3948.791,He's out on bail.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,3948.791,3953.606,He was out on bail.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4082.045,4090.314,Then are we -- are we entitled to assume that -- that the action of Colson was Government action?
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4090.314,4092.47,I don't think that that follows.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4100.178,4101.314,"Well, I understood you to say that --"
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4101.314,4102.073,Whether --
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4102.073,4106.019,-- I understood you to say that he had turned the car over to the Government.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4106.019,4106.617,"Well, I -- I'm meant in the sense it --"
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4106.617,4108.113,The Government would use in it --
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4108.113,4119.595,"I meant, Mr. Chief Justice, in the sense that he was -- he was using and allowing the Government to use his car in pursuing this investigation."
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4119.595,4119.756,"Well, then --"
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4119.756,4137.408,"Now, whether he was, in saying that, I -- I think we do have to consider whether Colson was an agent of the Government but the fact that he allowed the car to be used for the purposes of carrying on the conversation does not seem to me to demonstrate that he was acting as an agent to the Government."
1963.199,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4157.393,4163.636,"I believe I -- he was an agent of the Government, wasn't he, undercovering?"
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4163.636,4165.513,He was I think also an informer.
1963.199,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4169.822,4171.198,"In here, you don't have any."
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4171.198,4172.676,You don't have any paid --
1963.199,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4172.676,4175.076,Other than hope that he might --
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4175.076,4180.314,Other than his hope which he -- that he might receive is somewhat lighter sentence from the judge.
1963.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4180.314,4186.357,"Well, doesn't it appear on this (Inaudible) on the record or otherwise?"
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4186.357,4190.996,I thought the word suggested in the opinion that he was but I maybe --
1963.199,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4190.996,4192.591,As undercover agent?
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4192.591,4195.368,I'm afraid I don't have it with me.
1963.199,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4195.368,4197.252,As undercover agent.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4197.252,4198.216,Yes.
1963.199,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4198.216,4200.639,Some quotations.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4200.639,4207.694,But I take it that means that he have been used on a continuing basis on a -- on numerous occasions.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4372.193,4380.581,"Without Colson -- without Colson, how do we know what induced the petitioner to go into that car?"
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4380.581,4385.17,We don't -- might I beg Your Honors' indulgence for just a minute more because I --
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4385.17,4385.191,Yes.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4385.191,4387.919,-- assure you that I'm going to discuss that part of the case.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4387.919,4389.53,"Yes, you may."
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4389.53,4391.729,I'm afraid I get myself and therefore --
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4391.729,4392.168,Very well.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4392.168,4392.645,-- perhaps the --
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4392.645,4392.707,You may.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4392.707,4398.088,"-- Court -- I am now, Mr. Chief Justice, about to go into the --"
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4398.088,4399.895,"Alright, take -- take your time, right."
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4399.895,4415.185,-- to the various elements of the -- in the Government's conduct here and to take up each one and examine it in sequence and one of those questions will be the absence of Colson.
1963.199,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4616.355,4624.492,"This a different branch in the case and perhaps, I will not go onto discuss it now and I'm sure you are going to discuss it later but don't you think the time which this was done, it was some relevance --"
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4624.492,4625.103,"Yes, sir."
1963.199,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4625.751,4627.071,-- and had been indicted.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4627.071,4629.06,I do indeed.
1963.199,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4629.398,4629.488,You argue that (Voice Overlap) --
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,4629.488,4631.202,-- discuss that last.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5220.697,5230.808,"When -- when you're testifying to a conversation against the defendant, is he not entitled to know the entire conversation?"
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5230.808,5240.352,But he -- he is entitled to know all the witness can testify to but I suppose that -- let's change the circumstances a little bit.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5240.352,5242.844,Why not deal with these circumstances?
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5242.844,5247.148,"Well, I'd -- I'd certainly think we've got to decide on these circumstances, Mr. Chief Justice."
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5251.227,5251.342,What --
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5251.342,5252.698,-- find which way to deal with it.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5252.698,5253.093,What I'm thinking --
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5253.093,5254.264,That's what I was trying to do.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5254.264,5257.682,What I'm thinking of is this.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5335.849,5343.287,"Well, I -- I would think that there were distinctions to be drawn in this area."
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5385.223,5385.448,"Oh, yes, I --"
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5385.448,5387.638,-- evade your question about the particular case.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5387.638,5388.769,Alright.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5388.769,5431.656,"Suppose, for example, that Murphy testified, that he had been sitting in the booth in a bar or cabin and that Massiah came in with another man and he couldn't hear the beginning of their conversation because they talked in a low voice of -- for about half an hour they talked in a louder voice and they discussed who could have informed on them and how this cocaine was brought in and so forth and then Murphy going on and said, ""Well, I couldn't hear anymore because Massiah said, ""For goodness sakes, stop yelling."
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5452.52,5465.464,Would it make no difference whether that was just a normal conversation between two individuals or whether one of them was working for the Government at the time and had set a trap for that to be done?
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5465.464,5483.669,"I wouldn't take the mere fact that he was working for the Government at the time introduced such a probable element of unreliability as to make it imperative under all circumstances for the Government to produce the informer, no."
1963.199,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5493.319,5513.191,(Inaudible)
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5513.191,5521.325,"Well, I wasn't addressing myself, Mr. Justice, to privacy of the conversation as I suggest it with respect to that before."
1963.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5537.416,5537.958,Pardon me but you --
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5537.958,5539.122,"-- In some cases, Mr. Chief --"
1963.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5539.122,5542.448,"Pardon me, I want to ask you one for I don't understand it clearly."
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5553.133,5555.165,The -- the facts were these.
1963.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5622.106,5626.876,(Inaudible)
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5626.876,5634.194,Neither party took any step to subpoena him during the second trial.
1963.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5642.097,5642.403,He's available --
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5642.403,5644.482,-- every reason to believe he was in custody.
1963.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5644.482,5645.527,He's available to both then.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5645.527,5649.625,He was available to both or he was available to the judge.
1963.199,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5716.873,5720.068,(Inaudible)
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5720.068,5720.858,Yes.
1963.199,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5720.858,5722.279,(Inaudible)
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5722.279,5723.259,Yes.
1963.199,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5723.259,5734.028,(Inaudible)
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5734.028,5734.932,"Well, I think your --"
1963.199,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5734.932,5735.886,(Inaudible)
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5735.886,5752.288,I -- I think Your Honor's question in -- overlooks the counsel and the judge all knew that Colson had already been in Court and at the -- when the Government tried to get him to testify and had refused to do it.
1963.199,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5752.288,5753.671,(Inaudible)
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5753.671,5755.467,But that is the fact here.

1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5768.73,5773.247,"He's -- at the very time he pleaded guilty, he stated that he wouldn't testify."
1963.199,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5773.247,5785.435,(Inaudible)
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5785.435,5785.642,Yes.

1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5795.639,5811.236,"Well, I'm -- I must confess, Mr. Justice, that it -- it would seem to me a mistake to spend out too much from the exact words of what occurred on this occasion."

1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5923.753,5928.598,We must also recall -- we must also recall that he had invoked the Fifth Amendment.
1963.199,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5928.598,5929.42,Previously.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5929.42,5929.998,Previously.
1963.199,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5929.998,5931.191,Before he pleaded guilty.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5931.191,5932.188,Before he pleaded guilty.
1963.199,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5935.99,5940.632,(Inaudible)
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5940.632,5944.597,I would have grave doubt about that.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5963.602,5964.082,Didn't we have one --
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,5964.082,5965.827,I think we were not successful.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5965.827,5979.282,"-- didn't we have one just a year or so ago when your -- when your office was arguing that a man who is in the identical position of -- of this man, Colson?"
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,6001.517,6001.972,As I remember --
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6001.972,6002.337,How do you --
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,6002.337,6004.328,-- we are criticized for doing it that way.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6004.328,6008.035,"Yes, but you -- you won the case so."
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,6008.035,6008.131,"Yes, (Voice Overlap) -- but I'm not sure."
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6008.131,6011.479,"You won the case, there was a dissent but you won the case."
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,6011.479,6013.218,It seems to me --
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6013.218,6016.373,Why doesn't it work both ways?
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,6016.373,6021.733,Exact logical consistency might have required us to press further here.

1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,6073.063,6086.031,He could have called himself and he could have called him as a hostile witness and I think he could have argued to the judge that he shouldn't be bound by what he said or anything else.
1963.199,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6087.108,6094.45,"(Voice Overlap) -- the Government call him as the Government's witness, which is claimed, isn't it?"
1963.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6094.45,6095.108,That's strange.
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6095.108,6095.839,Strange?
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,6095.839,6097.821,That's strange that he should want to.

1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6103.295,6105.781,-- the Government had done it the day before.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,6105.781,6106.696,We wanted to use him --
1963.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6106.696,6106.728,(Voice Overlap) as strange.
1963.199,1,15704,archibald_cox,,6106.728,6107.742,-- as a witness.
1963.199,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,6107.742,6108.261,I don't know.
