1978.77-5781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,54.223,"We'll hear arguments next in 5781, Rakas and King against Illinois."
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,57.467,61.017,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-5781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,136.714,140.555,When they found them possession of that car?
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,140.555,144.095,The car was subsequently abandoned.
1978.77-5781,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,252.05,256.389,"Mr. Weller in your opinion, was there ever an arrest?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,256.389,259.676,"In my opinion, there was not an arrest before the search."
1978.77-5781,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,259.676,261.628,"Not before the search, I want to be sure about that."
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,263.611,266.4,No arrest before the search.
1978.77-5781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,323.222,330.265,"For now, that language that you have paraphrased at least from our opinions related to dwelling houses did it not?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,330.265,341.487,That's exactly correct and I believe the issue in this case contrary to what the respondents brief would suggest is whether this rule does apply to automobiles.
1978.77-5781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,341.487,347.329,Many cases have made sharp distinctions between searches of automobiles and homes have they not?
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,347.329,349.171,I acknowledge that Your Honor.
1978.77-5781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,364.08,372.699,"Does it not also rest on expectation of greater privacy in the home, in an enclosed home than in an automobile?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,372.699,381.513,Recent cases have dwelled upon the point that there is a lesser expectation of privacy in an automobile.
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,394.857,412.202,"Well, if standing is a prudential rule, doesn't it make some sense to say that if automobiles are subject to less rigorous substantive requirements as to search and seizures, they're also subject to stricter standing requirement?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,412.202,418.082,I don't think so unless you can say that there is absolutely no expectation of privacy in automobile.
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,422.929,448.416,"If you could use both to zero, I mean you never get an automobile case, but if you're for simply talking about diminished expectations of privacy as compared to a house, then wouldn't it make sense to say there are stricter rules of standing too because we don't consider the interest in privacy as great in an automobile as we do in a house?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,448.416,450.077,"Of course, it is diminished."
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,469.243,484.284,"Well as the Chief Justice has commented, we have differentiated between houses and automobiles for purposes of substantive Fourth Amendment inquiries; doesn't it make sense to differentiate between them for standing purposes too?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,484.284,499.586,"No, I don't believe so because as long as the right of privacy exists and someone can be the victim of a Fourth Amendment violation, be it an automobile or a house, you should have standing to raise that issue."
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,499.586,512.705,"Well, are you arguing an injury in fact that if it your trial evidence is introduced against you which has been obtained in violation of Fourth Amendment, you can object to it eventhough you didn't own it?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,519.269,520.846,"Oh, absolutely not."
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,522.14,525.991,"Well then, what is it mean to say you're the victim of an unlawful search?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,525.991,534.722,The victim is one who actually suffers an invasion of the privacy which he had and his reasonable expectation of privacy.
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,539.249,557.897,"Well how about supposing that the police go to A's house and searched without a warrant and find a letter that has your finger prints on it and you were not in the house at the time the search occurred and the letter did not belong to you, nonetheless, it tends to incriminate you."
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,561.71,567.026,Not under the legitimately on a premises rule which I have advanced.
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,576.945,581.979,Haven't been a victim of the search then?
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,581.979,588.377,"I would have to concede that if you're not present, you were not be a victim on the search, but if you are present you have the expectation."
1978.77-5781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,595.102,607.241,"When you indicate at what point precisely is right of privacy you speak of was invaded, that is was it invaded when they told them to get out of the car?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,607.241,609.409,I think it was invaded when the car stopped.
1978.77-5781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,609.409,611.119,-- stopped the car?
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,611.119,614.614,"I believe it was invaded to several points, including when the car was stopped and --"
1978.77-5781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,614.614,617.6,"Now, where's the first point where the privacy was invaded?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,617.6,619.364,When the car was stopped Your Honor.
1978.77-5781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,619.364,621.309,And then the next time?
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,621.309,624.457,When the car was searched.
1978.77-5781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,624.457,627.34,How about when they told them to get out of the car?
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,627.34,630.758,"That's correct, that would be another time and I think --"
1978.77-5781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,630.758,641.211,"Haven't our cases indicated a broad right when a car is stopped to search the car, search the people?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,641.211,647.552,I don't believe that it is quite broad enough to allow a search of a car without probable cause.
1978.77-5781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,647.552,652.036,Because as I understand that the validity of this search has never been determined by the lower court.
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,652.036,652.628,That's exactly true.
1978.77-5781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,652.628,665.843,"And even if we decided in your favor, all you ask us to do is to remand it to the state court that yes, the -- to determine the validity of the search, is that right?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,665.843,666.395,That's correct.
1978.77-5781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,666.395,668.942,"So that -- that's not before us not at all, isn't it?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,668.942,675.658,"No, it's not."
1978.77-5781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,713.765,717.268,"Although it fact, it was a possessory offense in Jones was it not?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,717.268,718.159,"That is true, but I think it's --"
1978.77-5781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,718.159,729.199,"The dilemma perceived in the Jones' opinion, Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion for the court in Jones was eliminated and Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion for the court in Silence; isn't that correct?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,729.199,729.669,That's correct.
1978.77-5781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,729.669,735.075,I may not have the identification of the members of the court exactly correctly; that's my recollection.
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,744.091,744.756,That is correct.
1978.77-5781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,744.756,748.402,And that had only to do with possessory offenses?
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,748.402,755.287,"For the purposes of argument, I would say eliminated offer, I think since I haven't briefed that point whether that actually eliminated, I won't."
1978.77-5781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,755.287,771.461,"But with respect to possessory offenses that Simmons made clear that a person didn't have to in fact admit possession in order to try to exclude the evidence, is that correct?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,771.461,772.192,That's correct.
1978.77-5781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,772.192,774.53,And that was the dilemma perceived in Jones?
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,774.53,778.399,That was a dilemma which was faced with the automatic standing which I do not rely upon here.
1978.77-5781,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,778.399,779.996,I understand that.
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,779.996,797.811,"I might add that Mr. Justice Harlan also wrote the Mancusi versus DeForte opinion in which did not involve the posssessory offense, and in his opinion he clearly notes that there is a distinction between the two tests."
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,817.769,823.752,"But if you have an expectation of privacy, your Fourth Amendment interests are implicated are they not?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,830.349,835.289,"Well certainly if there is a violation of Fourth Amendment, one would have to have standing."
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.289,838.394,"Well then, what's the point of a standing rule?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,847.241,855.281,"Well, I agree with that though if one is the victim of a Fourth Amendment violation, he should have standing."
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,855.281,860.212,"Well then, you are arguing first injury in fact or doing away with standing?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,860.212,872.991,"Oh no because if you aren't a victim of the illegal police conducts, if it was somebody else who was a victim, you would not have standing or I would not have standing."
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.349,890.046,And how again do you define the term victim?
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,890.046,899.3,Victim is one who had a reasonable expectation of privacy at the time of the contested police conduct.
1978.77-5781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,906.009,911.844,"If they had been found in a stolen car, you wouldn't be here wouldn't you?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,911.844,913.214,I would hate to make that argument.
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,916.078,920.962,What if they were ten feet away from the car?
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,920.962,925.216,"It seems to me that if they were that close, they might have standing."
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,932.467,937.833,Suppose he never been in the car but he was just ten feet away from it?
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,937.833,938.169,No --
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.169,943.017,"Would he be ""legitimately on the premises"" as you to use the term under --"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,943.017,947.843,That's a difficult question and it doesn't apply here.
1978.77-5781,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,954.604,958.663,Other that you've never been in the premises you don't have to decide whether you're legitimately on the premise?
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,958.663,964.374,I think that makes good sense Justice Stevens.
1978.77-5781,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1003.512,1018.142,"Wouldn't it even better deterrent be to simply to do away with standing and say that anyone who has evidence offered against him at his trial, it was seized in violation of Fourth Amendment ought to be able to object to it?"
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,1018.142,1020.611,That would be better deterrent.
1978.77-5781,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.906,1030.608,You will argue that next time?
1978.77-5781,0,26247,g_joseph_weller,,1030.608,1035.586,Perhaps Your Honor.
1978.77-5781,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1041.306,1046.724,Very well.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1050.418,1056.147,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1128.177,1137.864,"What about the guest in the house and the search to the house, does the guest have standing?"
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1137.864,1145.058,"Your Honor, in order to answer that question, I think we have to look to what reasonable expectation of privacy the guest had."
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.058,1149.087,You say there is no general rule about that?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1149.087,1154.929,It is our position Your Honor that Mr. Justice White that Simmons --
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1154.929,1157.126,"You're right, it Simmons."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1157.126,1157.707,Is it Simmons?
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1157.707,1157.978,Yes.
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1157.978,1159.151,Yes.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1159.151,1166.97,"That Simmons although it -- excuse me, I'm getting confused."
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1181.278,1182.808,What if it isn't?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1185.748,1192.348,"Then, I would submit to Mr. Justice White that this Court should seriously consider abandoning."
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.348,1197.388,Because it might govern the case for the automobile or guest?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1197.388,1199.18,"Not only that, but because --"
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1199.18,1203.449,"Well, but so, but it would?"
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1203.449,1204.102,Yes.
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.102,1218.271,"So if I had a guest in the house and if he were had standing to object to a search, but then left and I was taking him home and there was a search in my car, he would have as much of a standing in the car to object in the search to car as to the house?"
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1218.271,1220.291,"No, we do not concede that Your Honor."
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1220.291,1234.138,Well it depends upon -- is it necessary to make such a general rule if depends upon what the search was on or been the house if it was a search of the guest suitcase or pajamas or hip pocket is one thing.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1240.751,1241.328,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1241.328,1248.469,"It's not -- you don't have to talk about the expectations of privacy, just talk about whose Fourth Amendment right was violated and adversely for the Fourth --"
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1248.469,1248.921,Correct.
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1254.898,1257.297,Is the proper answer yes or no?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1257.297,1259.973,Whether -- I just want --
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.973,1267.229,You would agree that the dictum in Jones indicated that the guest has -- may have standing.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1267.229,1267.969,That's correct.
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1273.248,1283.788,In view of -- and to the extent that is the law would it be as applicable to an automobile as to house?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1283.788,1285.145,"Yes, it would Your Honor."
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1285.145,1287.992,"That's all I really wanted to know, thank you."
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1287.992,1294.703,Isn't the real test of standing is whose Fourth Amendment right was violated?
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1294.703,1295.308,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1295.308,1310.924,"And a person has a Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures in this person's papers and effects, and forgetting about person for a moment because that's not involved here, that's an arrest situation."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1319.025,1320.022,That's correct.
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1320.022,1325.42,"If he's a stranger to either title of possession, his Fourth Amendment rights can hardly be violated, can they?"
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1325.42,1326.322,That's correct.
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.087,1340.425,Or by Jones.

1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1341.621,1342.691,Yes.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1342.691,1343.479,It is the --
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1343.479,1351.1,"And if Mr. Justice Stewart's presentation is -- he represents a law, the dictum is obviously wrong."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1351.1,1355.353,The desire position Your Honor.
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1390.586,1397.742,What if the passenger had been the title owner of the automobile?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1397.742,1398.158,Then he has standing --
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1398.158,1402.512,"Even riding in the backseat as a passenger, but the fact is he owns the automobile?"
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1402.512,1409.661,"Then under our argument Mr. Justice Stewart, that individual would have standing because his privacy --"
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1409.661,1410.563,"Well, his ownership --"
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1410.563,1412.184,And that vehicle is being violated.
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1412.184,1416.272,"Well, his privacy was no more violated in the one case and than in the other."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1416.272,1424.491,"Well, I suggest that as the owner of the vehicle, he has a paramount expectation of privacy in the contents of his vehicle --"
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1424.491,1430.376,"Well, he has a right not to have his automobile victimize by an unreasonable search and seizures."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1430.376,1430.718,Yes.
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1430.718,1439.269,John Smith doesn't have a right that that other fellow's automobile not be subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure; isn't that it?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1439.269,1439.371,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1439.371,1443.338,"Because you do a privacy, the privacy interest is the same in both cases."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1443.338,1453.419,"Well, we take the position that it is not Your Honor that a passenger in an automobile has a diminished expectation of privacy."
1978.77-5781,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1454.53,1464.714,Is that consistent with your answer to Mr. Justice White's question that the legitimately on the premises are rule for houses carries over automatically to automobiles?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1469.913,1475.729,"Justice Rehnquist, that is exactly what I responded to Mr. Justice White."
1978.77-5781,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1509.279,1511.955,Or not applied to court.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1511.955,1516.57,"Yes Your Honor, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1978.77-5781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.57,1520.193,"Mr. MacKay, I have to confess I'm somewhat puzzled."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1525.088,1527.76,I believe it turns on expectation of privacy --
1978.77-5781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.76,1538.709,"So then, you would not differentiate if you have four people riding in a car 11 o'clock at night out in the country somewhere, you'd say they all have precisely the same expectation of privacy regardless of who owns the car?"
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1538.709,1547.445,"No, because it is our position Your Honor, Mr. Justice Stevens that the owner of the car -- assuming he is present in your hypothetical."
1978.77-5781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1547.445,1549.419,We'll assume we will take it in both ways.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1555.524,1565.183,I would suggest Your Honor that the owner of the vehicle has a paramount right of expectation of privacy to the contents of that vehicle.
1978.77-5781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1565.183,1566.813,Regardless of whether he is present?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1566.813,1567.791,Yes.
1978.77-5781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1567.791,1572.031,And the persons present never have an expectation of privacy?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1572.031,1589.135,The operator of the car and perhaps on the theory of agency that he is the agent of the driver maybe placed in the shoes of the owner as being the surrogate owner to assert the right of privacy.
1978.77-5781,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1589.135,1596.643,"That's in robbing, what about the leased cars and the rented cars?"
1978.77-5781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1596.643,1602.427,"With a passenger in a taxi cab, he'd never have an expectation of privacy I guess."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1604.466,1605.09,"No Your Honor, I'm --"
1978.77-5781,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1605.09,1608.232,You're on a leased limousine.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1608.232,1610.755,As to the --
1978.77-5781,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1610.755,1615.555,What about a leased jet?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1615.555,1641.007,"As to leased modes of transportation Mr. Justice Marshall, the only way I think I can answer your question is to respond that the lessee here is the surrogate owner who has a -- the primacy, the primary protection of the interest of privacy in that vehicle or airplane."
1978.77-5781,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1641.007,1645.912,"Well I can see that the answer that I have for, I don't have any."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1645.912,1646.565,I'm sorry.
1978.77-5781,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1646.565,1649.771,I don't have any answer for it.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1654.304,1657.956,Well I'm sorry.
1978.77-5781,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1690.887,1696.576,We have on some occasions observed that an automobile is also an instrument of criminal conduct.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1696.576,1697.305,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-5781,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1697.305,1711.054,Which homes may or may not be but considerably less so.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1711.054,1738.503,And I believe that Mr. Chief Justice that your latest -- your comment gives more force to our argument that the rights of passengers on an automobile to privacy are significantly diminished.
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1738.503,1751.389,Is it your submission that nobody but the record owner of an automobile has standing to complain of a search or seizure of that automobile?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1751.389,1762.512,Essentially yes Mr. Justice Stewart with the qualification that someone acting as the owner's agent in possessing or driving the automobile would --
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1762.512,1770.609,"Somebody driving it with the owner's permission and who is the only person in the automobile, and therefore clearly has sole possession of it."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1770.609,1771.549,Right.
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1771.549,1772.583,It might also have --
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1772.583,1785.179,"What if the passenger in its motion to suppress says I was in possession, I was a passenger but I was in possession of the automobile because I had borrowed it from somebody or I have leased it from somebody --"
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1785.179,1785.644,Your Honor --
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1785.644,1789.222,Or I have stolen it from somebody?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1789.222,1792.768,"Mr. Justice White, I think in that -- that's what we're dealing with here."
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.018,1800.575,"In any of those circumstances, you would think he had standing?"
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1800.575,1804.047,Yes.
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1804.047,1808.145,Anybody who is in fact in possession of the automobile?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1808.145,1809.035,Yes.
1978.77-5781,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1822.084,1824.739,"You might have a quarrel, but it would be a harder case."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1824.739,1829.421,"Well, but I would have no quarrel with granting them standing at least to challenge the legality of the search."
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1829.421,1832.494,Or if he's alleged that he was in possession of the gun.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1832.494,1834.276,I beg your pardon?
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.276,1836.99,Or if he had alleged that he was in possession of the gun.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1836.99,1837.569,That's correct.
1978.77-5781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1837.569,1839.648,If he's indicted for possession of the gun.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1843.442,1848.016,"Well in that case Mr. Justice Stevens, you're then talking about a possessory offense."
1978.77-5781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1848.016,1849.003,That's correct.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1849.003,1856.589,-- and we bring into play the remaining language in Jones which is not been dealt with in Simmons.
1978.77-5781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1856.589,1864.965,"It seems to me, if I understand your argument correctly, you're saying in with respect to non-possessory offences that standing turns on property concepts?"
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1864.965,1865.343,Correct.
1978.77-5781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1865.343,1868.065,You kind of asking the court to go back to pre-caps days.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1868.065,1870.673,"No, not really on property concepts Mr. Justice Stevens --"
1978.77-5781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1870.673,1879.265,"Ownership's possession, agent of owner and all that, but the privacy doesn't have anything to do with it because I understand your argument."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1879.265,1880.527,"Well Your Honor, it may be --"
1978.77-5781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1880.527,1886.831,You used the word privacy to say its present when you're an owner but there is no privacy present when you're a non-owner and a non-agent.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1895.419,1902.648,I will concede that with this clarification.
1978.77-5781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1926.937,1937.762,"Do you think a judge could come to the conclusion that when four or five people are riding along in a car, the car stopped and everybody is ordered out of the car and everybody searched that they could feel that there has been some infringement of their constitutional rights."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1941.226,1942.696,"Your Honor, I'm not saying that."
1978.77-5781,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1951.362,1953.752,"If just the vehicle is searched, they don't have any right?"
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,1953.752,1958.96,That's correct.
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2081.289,2084.978,What do you say about Brown?
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,2108.755,2122.48,"Your Honor, the only way I can answer that is to refer the Court to the dissent of Justice Black in Mancusi versus DeForte where he labels the --"
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.48,2124.528,"Of course, this is a court opinion."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,2124.528,2125.703,I understand that.
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2125.703,2135.098,Residing what the -- reporting to say what one of the court holdings is and announcing of what the existing rule of lawyers.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,2138.778,2168.586,"Your Honor, it is our position that if this Court finds that is the rule in Jones, then Jones should be modified by the opinion in this case to strike being legitimately on the premises as an independent ground for standing because the factors which were present in Jones to give rise to that are no longer in existence."
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.681,2179.115,"-- the ground called Simmons, after Simmons?"
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,2179.115,2181.438,That's right.
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.095,2197.977,Only in the automatic standing taken with regard to possession.
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,2197.977,2206.48,"Now, the way I read Your Honor -- the way I read Brown Your Honor is that it reserves -- excuse me?"
1978.77-5781,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2206.48,2207.997,"Nothing go ahead, I'm sorry."
1978.77-5781,1,21254,donald_b_mackay,,2207.997,2215.865,It reserves for future consideration the application of Jones type standing only to possessory offenses.
1978.77-5781,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2256.709,2259.367,Very well Mr. Mackay.
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2267.313,2271.223,Thank your Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-5781,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2295.791,2302.385,"That leaves us then to decide whether premises and automobiles are to be equated, doesn't it?"
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2302.385,2310.643,"That's right Your Honor, and I'm willing to concede that there is a diminished expectation of privacy in automobile."
1978.77-5781,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2322.221,2334.614,"What if you could see, what if the officers could see the gun or whatever, is that a violation of privacy from the look at it?"
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2334.614,2361.257,"Well, I think we should make a distinction between what would be a legal seizure or search because of course you have the plain view doctrine would allow -- would make the police officers conduct legal, but perhaps we should still grant standing of the person who's present in the automobile to contest whether or not that gun was in fact in plain view."
1978.77-5781,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2370.135,2374.548,No question since you're so hip on Jones.
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2378.143,2392.812,"I think that hitchhiker would probably -- would have standing, however we're not hitchhikers in this case, we're clearly not hitchhikers and also I wonder if --"
1978.77-5781,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2392.812,2394.995,But it would apply to hitchhiker?
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2394.995,2398.516,Legitimately on the premises rule would apply to hitchhikers.
1978.77-5781,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2398.516,2400.495,"And robbers, how about --"
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2400.495,2402.543,It would not apply to someone who is --
1978.77-5781,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2402.543,2404.098,-- steals a car and is driving it?
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2404.098,2405.112,It would not apply to it --
1978.77-5781,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2405.112,2409.571,He is in fact in possession and let's says he is on sole exclusively --
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2409.571,2413.479,Not legitimately on the premise is with my answer.
1978.77-5781,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2413.479,2415.216,But the hitchhiker would be?
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2415.216,2417.625,Hitchhiker would be legitimately on the premises.
1978.77-5781,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2420.565,2428.656,The hitchhiker has a right of privacy in somebody else's car which he is temporarily in.
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2428.656,2432.545,"I think that is true, but I wonder if that is really a serious problem."
1978.77-5781,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2432.545,2434.766,Didn't it stretch something?
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2434.766,2444.583,"Well, if you're thinking can that situation come up very often because you would assume that this person that we're talking about is --"
1978.77-5781,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2444.583,2447.222,I've seen a whole lot of hitchhikers getting in cars.
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2447.222,2454.652,"Yes, but can they be incriminated by something found in that car unless they have some association with the car."
1978.77-5781,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2457.611,2459.632,You mean hitchhikers are isolated?
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2459.632,2460.496,No.
1978.77-5781,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.284,2463.057,-- as many as 10 man in a group.
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2463.057,2477.154,"So far as raising this issue is concerned, of course there are many hitchhikers but I think it would be rare that a hitchhiker would be incriminated by something found in the car, and I also would hasten to add that they were not hitchhikers in this case."
1978.77-5781,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2477.154,2480.094,Do you need this real case?
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2480.094,2481.062,Pardon me Your Honor?
1978.77-5781,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2481.062,2486.536,Do you need that Jones statement for your case?
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2486.536,2487.758,Legitimately on the premises?
1978.77-5781,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2487.758,2491.744,Yes sir.
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2491.744,2495.855,"It would certainly be helpful and I would not wish to discard it, but --"
1978.77-5781,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2495.855,2499.972,You have to go to direct that add forget about Jones don't you?
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2499.972,2504.25,"Well, if we conceive, there is no expectation of privacy."
1978.77-5781,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2531.185,2534.324,"Is that Mancusi was a building, not a car?"
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2534.324,2536.877,It was an office.
1978.77-5781,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2536.877,2542.762,That's the presence or absence of probable cause that make any difference in this type of situation?
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2542.762,2546.15,Not as far as standing is concern because that's what we would like to contest.
1978.77-5781,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2546.15,2546.821,All right --
1978.77-5781,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2546.821,2550.274,"Well, that's the issue on the merits that's decided on this case."
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2550.274,2551.098,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-5781,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2551.098,2569.85,"All right, but let's assume for the moment there was probable cause to stop this automobile, would you still be making the same issue with respect to standing to conduct a sort of pat down search that was approved in Robinson?"
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2569.85,2572.166,It's a probable cause to stop the vehicle?
1978.77-5781,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2572.166,2582.9,"Yes, would that have been permissible or would the individual who were patted down after the vehicle had been stopped with probable cause have standing to object?"
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2582.9,2596.322,"I would think so because he first to have standing to challenge has being patted down, that's his person, and I think he also has standing to contest to stop."
1978.77-5781,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2600.771,2603.294,"But if he conceives there is probable cause, he is not --"
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2603.294,2604.023,Well then --
1978.77-5781,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2604.023,2604.942,-- going to object to it.
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2604.942,2611.612,"He's conceited the issue, it's not a standing question it's not just an issue."
1978.77-5781,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.612,2618.748,"But the other side of the coin is if you assumed there is no probable cause, it still doesn't do your client any good if he has no standing."
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2622.962,2625.01,That is true.
1978.77-5781,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2644.232,2650.892,Well that's not yet involved in that closed husband and wife law.
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2650.892,2652.638,I have nothing further if there's no further question.
1978.77-5781,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2652.638,2653.395,Very well.
1978.77-5781,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2653.395,2657.704,May I ask you the question -- about your adversary.
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2660.891,2661.829,I have no problem with that.
1978.77-5781,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2665.756,2679.783,So you think that if I steal a car and I'm driving down the road and the policeman just stops the car without probable cause and searches it that I can object to it?
1978.77-5781,2,26247,g_joseph_weller,,2679.783,2684.847,I would hate to argue that issue and I don't think that would be the case.
1978.77-5781,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2694.15,2697.282,"Very strategic, very strategic."
1978.77-5781,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2697.282,2698.032,Thank you gentlemen.
