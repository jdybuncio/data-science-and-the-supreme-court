1973.73-473,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,41.13,"We’ll hear arguments next in 73-473, Taylor against Hayes."
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,43.746,46.864,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.73-473,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,103.384,106.907,Was that raised in the Kentucky Court of Appeals?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,106.907,111.078,"Your Honor, not specifically."
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,194.063,197.708,And how would the Court maintain decorum?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,197.708,198.593,"Pardon, Your Honor?"
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,198.593,201.686,How would the judge maintain decorum in his courtroom?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,201.686,206.267,By citing the offending lawyer or party for contempt.
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,206.267,207.431,Do you think that’s enough?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,207.431,220.907,"I think, Your Honor, that that should be a sufficient deterrent in all, but the most serious cases of persistent obstruction, which all of the empirical evidence indicates is virtually non existent."
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,220.907,224.512,"Well, aren’t you right now pretty being hunky you don’t need that for this, do you?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,224.512,231.665,"This is true, Your Honor, we do not need it for this case, but I honestly feel that the problem will remain."
1973.73-473,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,280.332,291.612,"Are you suggesting, are you suggesting that the existence of this summary contempt power in some way explains or excuses the conduct of this lawyer in this case?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,291.612,292.24,"Well, Your Honor --"
1973.73-473,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,292.24,294.471,Doesn't this provoke him to act that way?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,294.471,299.318,I would take the position of going back one step before.
1973.73-473,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,512.366,519.765,Mr. Sedler you say that the summary contempt power makes a lawyer tend to pull his punches up.
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,532.969,544.143,"Well, I think that the -- as the study of this order in the Court in the case the judge does this by maintaining control over the proceedings as the judge."
1973.73-473,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,545.091,546.768,But how does he maintain that control?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,546.768,548.46,"Well, by ruling on --"
1973.73-473,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,548.46,550.763,"Well, what if counsel doesn’t follow his rule?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,550.763,555.635,"Then the judge can say counsel, I’ve heard enough argument on this point, let us proceed."
1973.73-473,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,555.635,557.438,"Well, what if counsel continues to argue?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,557.438,565.219,"At that point, the judge has the power and should have the power, we don’t dispute that, to cite the counsel for contempt."
1973.73-473,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.58,570.059,But no punishment can be meted out during the course of those proceedings?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,570.059,572.832,"On the spot, on the spot."
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,600.681,604.236,Doesn’t he know that when he is admitted to the bar?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,604.236,605.404,Well he is aware.
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,605.404,606.078,Isn’t he?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,606.078,607.291,He doesn’t have much choice.
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,609.673,612.9,"Well, I mean when he takes his oath?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,612.9,614.679,"Well, when he takes his oath he is aware."
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,614.679,618.325,He knows that if he gets out of line he is going to be punished.
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,618.325,620.637,And punished summarily.
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,620.637,621.032,No.
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,624.362,625.388,Or can be punished --
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,625.388,630.863,"Now you say by putting additional one you are saying, we’ll try you later."
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,635.305,636.818,I think that that would be enough.
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,637.739,640.782,"That the two warnings would be enough, the first was not enough."
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,640.782,643.322,"Well, I think the problem is not so much of question of warning."
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,650.855,653.471,Well you want the lawyer to hold judge in contempt?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,653.471,654.45,Well there is an adherent --
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,654.45,656.591,You want to give him that power?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,656.591,671.011,I think that that the problem is that judges can act arbitrarily without any realistic sanction whatsoever and I don’t think we ought to allow the summary contempt power which simply encourages them to act arbitrarily.
1973.73-473,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,753.165,755.922,"Well, then your client moved for a mistrial?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,755.922,758.81,He moved for a mistrial on numerous grounds.
1973.73-473,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,758.81,759.736,On this ground?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,759.736,771.336,"No, because my counsel -- my client, I would submit and I think the record will reveal, was trying to vigorously defend his client in a highly emotionally charged situation."
1973.73-473,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,825.914,840.689,"Mr. Sedler, I think the way many of us learned to practice law was that if the trial judge was unfair to you or you felt that was hostile to you, you felt you have to abide his rulings, your remedy was by appeal that you could get that reversed on appeal?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,840.689,845.964,"Your Honor, when you take an appeal, you run into the problem of substantial error."
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,983.296,995.023,"But suppose a lawyer is contemptuous to the Supreme Court of the State, what court would sit on that one?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,995.023,1001.039,"I failed to see Your Honor -- well, let me -- let’s assume that the lawyer filed a false brief or pleading or something --"
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1001.039,1010.758,"No, no he stood up in open court and just did all the things you and I know can possibly be done, an absolute contempt to the Court."
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1013.511,1032.957,"Assuming in Kentucky, we have a procedure by which when all of the judges of the Court of Appeals are disqualified from hearing the case because of interest or involvement, the Government can appoint pro tem special judges to hear that contempt."
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1032.957,1038.105,And that would be the protection that the Supreme Court would get?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1038.105,1040.042,"Well, that the terms of protection --"
1973.73-473,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1040.042,1045.233,"Well suppose somebody is contemptuous in this Court, now what court will operate then?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1055.644,1083.011,"I guess that the best answer that I would give to Your Honor is that the exercise of the summary contempt power is inconsistent with those time tested principles of due process because it does combine the inherently inconsistent functions of prosecutor, jury and judge in the same instance -- in the same person and it also is the person who is necessarily involved in the events."
1973.73-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1141.142,1148.306,"Well I gather, Mr. Sedler, to that extent your position except it would invalidate Rule 42 (a), would it not?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1148.306,1148.831,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1148.831,1152.07,And also the underlying statute?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1152.07,1161.493,"I don’t believe that the underlying statute -- no, we are not challenging criminal contempt, we are not challenging the federal or state statutes that provide for criminal contempt."
1973.73-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1162.597,1168.325,"Well I thought the federal statute dealt by definition, doesn’t it, with what is a criminal contempt?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1168.325,1171.148,"Yes, and we are not questioning what is a criminal contempt."
1973.73-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1174.92,1175.483,Alright.
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1177.801,1178.764,42 (a).
1973.73-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1178.764,1181.99,And all contempts would have to -- the process would be under 42 (b)?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1181.99,1191.111,Under 42 (b) is preferably with the jury and this I think moves us into the second issue in this case and here again --
1973.73-473,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1191.111,1199.887,"Mr. Sedler before you get there, just the -- as a matter of curiosity, is your client Mr. Taylor a member of the bar of Kentucky?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1199.887,1200.595,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-473,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1200.595,1201.998,This wasn’t a pro hac vice case?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1201.998,1202.679,Oh no!
1973.73-473,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1212.11,1215.312,"If this conviction holds up, is he likely to be disbarred?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1215.312,1222.97,He certainly will be subject to disciplinary action which could reach out disbarment proportions.
1973.73-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1236.574,1253.123,"Excuse me Mr. Sedler, if you follow a Rule 42, if that’s what you say constitutionally would be required 42 (b) procedure whether state or federal, what issues would be determined at the hearing?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1253.123,1255.589,Whether the conduct constituted criminal contempt.
1973.73-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1255.589,1262.554,"I see, the judge in whose presence the conduct was committed could not say that’s contempt and --"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1262.554,1264.385,"He would cite, he would cite and specify --"
1973.73-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1264.385,1268.815,He wouldn’t cite just for determination whether --
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1268.815,1269.092,Oh!
1973.73-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1271.496,1278.221,Right and you’d have a -- you’re coming now that you’d say that the constitution would also require a jury trial?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1278.221,1280.675,"Well, depending on the view that the court takes."
1973.73-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1382.869,1386.043,You (Voice Overlap) only ten days would be substantial imprisonment for a lawyer?
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1386.043,1390.991,"Well, I would argue Your Honor in light of Argersinger of that any imprisonment --"
1973.73-473,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1390.991,1391.734,I would think so.
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1391.734,1398.707,-- makes the charge a serious one within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of right to trial by jury.
1973.73-473,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1463.743,1466.108,"We’re dealing here though with the Fourteenth Amendment, are we?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1467.49,1476.663,"Yes, Your Honor but as I read Duncan, it holds that the same standards apply -- same jury standards apply to the state courts."
1973.73-473,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1476.663,1489.86,"Yes, but the Court has never held that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates or absorbs or whatever the figure of speech maybe, the right to jury trial to be found in the Seventh Amendment has it?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1489.86,1491.237,"In civil actions, no Your Honor."
1973.73-473,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1491.237,1493.363,No.
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1493.363,1494.723,"Your Honor, I will reserve for rebuttal time."
1973.73-473,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1494.723,1502.504,"Mr. Sedler, let me go back to response you gave to Mr. Justice Rehnquist if I followed you."
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1537.539,1538.789,No.
1973.73-473,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1538.789,1540.282,"Well, then what are the alternatives?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1540.282,1565.725,"Well, I think if I were to be put, I was answering Mr. Justice Rehnquist question in regard to showing effect into the fact that the lawyer who must try to protect the rights of his client maybe shielded in his efforts to protest trial errors at the time that they occur."
1973.73-473,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1594.245,1608.928,"Would you think it is not contempt if after a judge, the trial judge has ruled and announced his ruling if the lawyer insists upon continuing argument of the ruling which has been closed?"
1973.73-473,0,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,1608.928,1618.669,"I think that the line is drawn where the trial judge says, “Counsel, I’ve heard enough argument on this point, proceed.”"
1973.73-473,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1691.979,1694.857,"Very well, Mr. Sedler."
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,1696.639,1704.409,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-473,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1785.941,1788.445,I missed to what you said a moment ago.
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,1790.84,1796.38,"A marriage and a funeral, and that sort of thing -- things that caused him to be tired and things that --"
1973.73-473,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1796.38,1798.265,"Who, who is tired, who is tired?"
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,1798.265,1799.971,Mr. Taylor.
1973.73-473,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2024.877,2027.253,"Mr. Triplett, I am just a little curious."
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2039.803,2044.171,"As they were initially opposed by Judge Hayes, they were consecutive."
1973.73-473,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2044.171,2044.855,Consecutive.
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2044.855,2063.808,"After they were imposed, Judge Hayes corrected his judgment with Court of Appeals of Kentucky’s permission and eliminated the requirement of consecutiveness and it was the ultimate judgment of the Court of Appeals that this meant six months."
1973.73-473,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2090.232,2093.994,"In that connection, do you have appellate review of sentences in Kentucky?"
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2093.994,2096.775,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-473,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2105.015,2112.811,"Mr. Triplett, when the Bar Association considers this case, will they consider it at one six months or more?"
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2112.811,2115.014,"One six months, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1973.73-473,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2115.014,2116.935,On how many counts?
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2116.935,2119.36,On eight counts.
1973.73-473,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2119.36,2122.296,"Well, they would be considered guilty on all the accounts."
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2122.296,2123.116,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-473,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2153.24,2159.105,"Well, what you’re saying there really is no more than that they would act on the full record?"
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2159.105,2160.016,That’s correct sir.
1973.73-473,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2163.557,2173.293,Mr. Triplett is there any limitation in Kentucky law as to the sentence that can be given by a trial judge for criminal contempt?
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2173.293,2175.794,"No, Mr. Justice Stewart there was none."
1973.73-473,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2208.131,2218.842,"So now, so far at least as theoretical, how are those, the trial judge could send somebody to be locked up for the rest of his life for criminal contempt."
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2218.842,2223.447,"Theoretically, that was true as it was true in Bloom against Illinois, yes sir."
1973.73-473,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2223.447,2234.042,"Mr. Triplett, let me back a little bit for something you touched on in response to a question partly from Mr. Justice Stewart."
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2256.087,2260.861,"I was drawing a series of things, isolated portions of it."
1973.73-473,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2267.871,2268.461,Where are you now?
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2268.461,2276.264,"On page 119 of the transcript Mr. Chief Justice, where petitioner says this."
1973.73-473,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2430.524,2433.674,"What about the phrase by “Now, I got you?” [Attempt to Laughter]"
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2433.674,2435.623,I beg your pardon Mr. Justice I didn’t hear you.
1973.73-473,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2435.623,2438.507,"What about the judge saying “Now, I got you?”"
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2438.507,2453.317,"We say that that occurred after the judgment of contempt had been -- wait a minute sir, I don’t recall anything in this trial or this transcript that said -- where Judge Hayes said, “Taylor, now I got you.”"
1973.73-473,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2453.317,2454.99,"Well, that might not be the exact words, but it’s close to it."
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2454.99,2458.292,I dispute that Mr. Justice Marshall.
1973.73-473,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2460.349,2461.664,"Well, I have to find it."
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2461.664,2462.694,Alright sir.
1973.73-473,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2474.531,2476.511,"Well, that's what we are talking about?"
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2476.511,2483.679,"But I read that in a different context Mr. Justice Marshall as saying, “Now I’ve got you.”"
1973.73-473,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2483.679,2485.475,"Well, now I got you on nine counts."
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2485.475,2486.186,That’s correct sir.
1973.73-473,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2486.186,2487.768,I stand corrected.[Laughter]
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2487.768,2487.897,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-473,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2487.897,2488.935,I stand corrected.
1973.73-473,1,28214,henry_a_triplett,,2488.935,2491.447,I don’t mean to be argumentative on --
1973.73-473,2,40558,robert_allen_sedler,,2882.738,2886.148,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
