2004.04-163,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,0.0,8.356,We will hear argument next in Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A.--
2004.04-163,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,68.46,83.47,"Justice O'Connor, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-163,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.649,282.853,"Well, does the fact that discrete or individual property rights are being affected and, indeed, taken justify some higher level of scrutiny than we would apply to general economic regulation by the State?"
2004.04-163,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,282.853,283.679,"No, Your Honor."
2004.04-163,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.353,372.889,"Well, we've said it a lot, though, haven't we?"
2004.04-163,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,375.368,396.749,"Well, Your Honor, I think that in... in Del Monte Dunes, every opinion in the case discussed this language and... and said that the Court has never indicated that this sets out a more exacting test than rational basis other than in the rough proportionality context of Nollan and Dolan."
2004.04-163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,435.061,445.092,"Suppose... suppose a person has a piece of property, and they zone it suddenly, no building... no building... which destroys the value of the property pretty much."
2004.04-163,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,462.925,469.695,"Your Honor, if... if the claim was that the legislation was irrational, that it--"
2004.04-163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,469.695,469.861,--No.
2004.04-163,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,475.639,476.261,--No--
2004.04-163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,476.261,483.895,"I mean, if you put your mind to it, you can make one up, which is sort of the test for rational basis in the economic context."
2004.04-163,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,492.812,494.009,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.04-163,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,513.495,524.763,"What are we supposed to do, to return to Justice Scalia's question, with the fact that this appears... I counted about 12 cases, I mean, where it implicitly or explicitly appears, something like it."
2004.04-163,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,530.047,538.592,"--Well, we would suggest, Your Honor, that what the Court does is say that... that in Agins, what the Court was essentially doing was restating a due process test, and either say--"
2004.04-163,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,538.592,540.283,Would you speak up a little?
2004.04-163,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,540.283,541.192,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2004.04-163,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.723,587.799,Why would you feel--
2004.04-163,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,587.799,588.049,So you want us to put--
2004.04-163,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.049,598.785,--Why would you feel better about our doing that in order to determine whether... whether there's a public use than you would feel about our doing it in order to decide whether there's been a taking?
2004.04-163,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,598.785,599.445,--Well--
2004.04-163,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.445,603.364,"I mean, wouldn't all of your... all of your objections apply equally?"
2004.04-163,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,603.364,606.336,--Certainly if it were more than rational basis.
2004.04-163,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,611.62,627.596,"You're... you're not really urging us to... to defer the... the evil day and simply say, well, this test, which is more than rational basis, may well apply to... to whether there's been a... a public use or not, but it certainly doesn't apply to whether there's been a taking."
2004.04-163,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,627.596,628.689,"No, absolutely not."
2004.04-163,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.637,629.887,I hope you won't do that.
2004.04-163,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,629.887,644.209,"--it shouldn't apply to... to either one, and wherever this... if the Court wants to say that this language needs to find a home somewhere and it isn't in due process, then it shouldn't be more than a rational basis test wherever it's put."
2004.04-163,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,714.881,728.34,"--Well, suppose it were clear, from what the legislature said, that the only purpose of this legislation was to help out some local dealers who were politically powerful and the gasoline prices would go up."
2004.04-163,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,730.856,745.262,"--Well, Your Honor, what we would say is that this Court's jurisprudence is that in applying a rational basis test, one doesn't look at what the legislature said was the purpose of the statute, but one looks at what could be advanced as a purpose for the statute and--"
2004.04-163,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,745.262,748.789,And you would be here defending the statute on... in my hypothetical case.
2004.04-163,0,35457,mark_j_bennett,,748.789,789.352,"--Yes, Your Honor, and we would... we would be, I imagine, positing additional reasons why the statute would pass a rational basis test than those actually reflected in the legislative history because I think, as this Court has indicated a number of times, that requiring the legislature to state reasons or, indeed, looking at the precise reasons stated by the legislature in deciding whether the statute furthers those goals as opposed to other goals the legislature might have had, simply sets this Court up as a... as I said, a super-legislature, and... and really opens the door to the type of intrusive review of legislative acts that this Court has not engaged in for more than 70 years."
2004.04-163,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,846.111,849.948,"Very well, General Bennett."
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,852.799,865.142,"Justice O'Connor, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-163,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1021.672,1022.581,Mr. Kneedler--
2004.04-163,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1022.581,1036.327,"Well, if you're going to use the public use prong of the... of the... the Constitution for what we think are regulatory takings, then what happens is you just invalidate the regulation."
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1037.896,1040.291,"That's... that's correct, although I... although I should say--"
2004.04-163,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1040.291,1042.066,"Because if it's not a public use, then you can't--"
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1042.066,1042.643,--Right.
2004.04-163,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1058.019,1064.54,"--What about substantially advances a legitimate State interest, which does sound like it's a higher standard?"
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1083.487,1091.744,"Well, in... in fact, the point you made that it has not actually affected the outcome I think is an important consideration for this Court."
2004.04-163,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1162.621,1163.614,What about Moore?
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1163.614,1164.69,Excuse me?
2004.04-163,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1164.69,1165.472,What about Moore?
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1165.472,1166.381,Moore?
2004.04-163,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1166.381,1171.748,"Yes, City of East Cleveland where they had the grandmother and the... the--"
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1171.748,1172.014,Right.
2004.04-163,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1191.893,1199.49,--So... so we might still keep a... a stronger test where a zoning ordinance affects the number of people that could live in a house or--
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1199.49,1201.309,"--No, not the number... not the number of people."
2004.04-163,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1201.309,1202.462,--Or who could live in the house.
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1202.462,1203.91,That case concerned--
2004.04-163,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1203.91,1205.479,Grandparents--
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1205.479,1209.377,"--a family, the... the question of interfering... possible interference with a family unit."
2004.04-163,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1243.829,1245.11,"Well, they don't sound like synonyms."
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1260.919,1261.373,--Yes.
2004.04-163,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1289.858,1306.41,"--Of course, when you have a physical invasion of property and a inverse condemnation is tantamount to a physical invasion, then we've built up some doctrine in order to protect the concept of physical invasion so that that can't be avoided."
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1312.233,1314.174,"Well, I... yes, this... this--"
2004.04-163,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1314.174,1315.864,Even though this is a leasehold interest.
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1316.873,1324.037,--But the Court applied a rational basis test in Pennell under the Due Process Clause and it would be odd to apply a... a higher test.
2004.04-163,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.034,1349.43,"But, Mr. Kneedler, simply giving... giving the phrase, substantially advance, the... the more modest meaning that you argue for doesn't solve the problem."
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1365.116,1365.316,Yes.
2004.04-163,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1366.702,1368.848,"I mean, so we have to eat crow no matter what we do."
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1374.315,1374.687,--Right.
2004.04-163,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1376.544,1376.916,Yes.
2004.04-163,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1376.916,1379.395,--be a rational basis test and therefore the Court would conclude it was a taking.
2004.04-163,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1468.188,1470.5,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1472.236,1478.263,"Justice O'Connor, may it please the Court:"
2004.04-163,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1496.856,1507.259,"Is it a regulatory taking in your view because the substantially advances test is not met, or is it a regulatory taking and then I ask if it substantially advances?"
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1507.259,1508.002,The--
2004.04-163,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1508.002,1510.314,"How do I know this is a regulatory taking, in other words?"
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1510.314,1518.504,--It's a... it's a regulatory taking because the government has not physically appropriated the property or condemned it.
2004.04-163,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1524.72,1528.064,"No, but that... that means if it's a taking at all, it's got to be a regulatory taking."
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1532.501,1553.677,"--And I believe that question, Your Honor, is answered by Pennsylvania Coal where the Court found that the fact that the statute at issue there prevented Pennsylvania Coal from mining a certain amount of the coal that was in the ground that it was otherwise entitled... be entitled to mine... took that property just as assuredly as a condemnation of it would."
2004.04-163,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1605.401,1614.772,"And then the question, of course, is let's imagine you're either right or you're wrong as to its being a regulatory taking."
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1656.3,1666.619,"I think it goes to the difference, Your Honor, between the public use standard and the... which governs in a situation in which the government is paying compensation."
2004.04-163,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1679.955,1680.531,But the burden on--
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1680.531,1681.357,--to governmental action is greater.
2004.04-163,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1681.357,1692.753,"--Maybe I'm not... I thought... are we in the world in which you agree the government can do it even though their reason... or is your basic argument, no, they can't do this at all?"
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1700.805,1703.877,"We... we believe, Your Honor, that it is a compensation issue."
2004.04-163,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1703.877,1705.263,It's a compensation issue.
2004.04-163,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1705.263,1705.968,So you want money?
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1709.228,1719.176,We wanted a declaration from the court that the... that they cannot proceed with a statute that takes our rents without paying... paying for us.
2004.04-163,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1722.043,1727.699,"But... but isn't... I thought your premise was that because the statute doesn't authorize any payment, that is a way of stopping it."
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1727.699,1728.609,--Yes.
2004.04-163,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1730.216,1743.674,"So if... if Hawaii modifies its statute and says, we will give to you the difference between, you know, whatever the rent we... if we can figure it out... whatever the rent would be and... and what our statute requires, you'd be perfectly happy."
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1743.674,1744.213,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-163,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1744.213,1744.706,Okay.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1744.706,1748.299,"What we are arguing about here is compensation, and the standard that we--"
2004.04-163,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1748.299,1752.508,"Well, it would seem that you're arguing about whether this amounts to a taking--"
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1752.508,1753.872,--Yes.
2004.04-163,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1753.872,1754.698,--at all.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1762.333,1772.941,"Your Honor, the... in Lucas, this Court found that a... a complete deprivation of the economic value of property constitutes a categorical taking."
2004.04-163,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1799.28,1804.027,"Well, the... let me go back to my question because I haven't heard the answer."
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1874.077,1884.934,"And my answer to that, Your Honor, is that it goes... it stems from the rationale expressed in Pennsylvania Coal for allowing the government to interfere with private property--"
2004.04-163,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1884.934,1896.246,"Holmes said, though he didn't hold that... what he said was you have to pay when the regulation, a legitimate regulation, goes too far."
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1908.506,1918.704,"--Well, part of the question whether the regulation goes too far is whether there is a basis for imposing the burden on a particular property right."
2004.04-163,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1919.364,1922.54,"Yes, and in that respect, Holmes did not use the word legitimate."
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,1938.804,1953.626,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that the... growing out of Pennsylvania Coal, the Court has recognized that one of the critical factors, if not the most critical factor, in regulatory takings analysis is the character of the government's action and the nature of the government's interest."
2004.04-163,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1983.347,1984.462,But he... he didn't go into this question.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2000.974,2003.388,"--Compensation, of course, has to be paid there."
2004.04-163,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2003.388,2003.471,"Of course, it does."
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2031.789,2041.737,"Your Honor, I... to me there's a threshold question of whether a general building regulation of that type really would be a... a regulation that would implicate the Takings Clause at all."
2004.04-163,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2041.737,2062.504,"Well, it is an... it does regulate the use of your property and it means added cost, in fact, several thousand dollars added cost, to the building of a house, and come up here and argue we agree there's a rational reason, but it isn't so you can do it, but it isn't a really good reason, not substantial."
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2065.226,2067.166,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
2004.04-163,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2106.176,2115.381,"Mr. Stewart, I'm trying to understand not your theory but its concrete applications."
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2140.811,2143.123,"Yes, and--"
2004.04-163,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2143.123,2146.012,And... and the measure of compensation would be?
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2165.619,2179.737,"--The compensation would be measured as the difference between the... the rent that was allowed under the regulation or the statute and the rent that the... that the landlord, the lessor, would otherwise be entitled to collect in the marketplace."
2004.04-163,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2179.737,2182.503,I didn't understand you as saying that all rent control constitutes a taking.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2189.375,2191.194,"No, that is not our position, Your Honor."
2004.04-163,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2200.854,2204.198,I'm asking for not the State's position but your position.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2204.198,2204.819,--And our--
2004.04-163,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2204.819,2218.194,"And let's... let's assume that there's no better reason for the rent control for the building, residential building, than there is for the rent control on the lease for the gas station."
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2218.194,2227.11,"--Your Honor, our... the question would be, under our analysis, is not the validity of the... of the ends, of the legislative ends."
2004.04-163,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2283.375,2286.263,And on your theory it would easily be met no matter how severe the control.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2305.788,2306.531,--I think our--
2004.04-163,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2306.531,2307.729,That can't be the test.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2307.729,2314.294,"--Well, I think our position, Your Honor, is that there are... this... this is a threshold inquiry, the... the hypothetical--"
2004.04-163,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2314.294,2317.76,But... but it would... in any case it would pass the threshold inquiry on your test.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2321.27,2324.158,--I think that it would pass the inquiry.
2004.04-163,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2325.727,2328.495,"So you would say at the threshold level, there's no taking."
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2328.495,2329.154,--Yes.
2004.04-163,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2329.154,2329.897,And what would you then do?
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2330.89,2331.14,Yes.
2004.04-163,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2331.14,2331.156,Okay.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2331.156,2358.055,"You would have an inquiry into whether there is a categorical taking under Lucas because it deprived essentially all economic value of the property and you would inquire under Penn Central whether... because the threshold inquiry into the nature of the government's interest is satisfied, you then inquire into whether the burden is such in light of the purposes to be served that we believe it goes too far--"
2004.04-163,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2358.055,2358.344,Okay.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2405.777,2423.526,"--I mean... part of my answer to that, Your Honor, is that this test, in our view, does have very narrow application, which is the reason why we don't believe that the State is correct in suggesting that it will result in the invalidation of all kinds of economic regulation."
2004.04-163,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2460.678,2465.713,But isn't the sensible response to the situation you posit that the government shouldn't be doing it?
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2499.853,2511.47,"And I... the distinction we're relying upon there, Your Honor, is... is the question whether the government can proceed with compensation as distinct from proceeding without compensation."
2004.04-163,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2547.325,2549.842,I must say I agree with Justice Souter.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2564.432,2573.786,"Your Honor, I... the... the question of whether it makes sense turns upon the standard of review that the Court is going to apply to answer that question."
2004.04-163,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2574.612,2574.779,No.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2592.406,2603.841,--Because of the... the... the difference in the relative interests at stake when we're talking about proceeding with compensation as against without compensation.
2004.04-163,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2638.392,2641.364,But isn't the effect of what you're arguing that you can't do it?
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2658.804,2670.714,"Your Honor, the State's position in this case is that by preserving a network of lessee dealers, there will be benefits to the public in terms of lower gasoline prices."
2004.04-163,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2704.234,2714.598,"Well, why wouldn't it make sense then for the government to say, Chevron, you charge what you want and, station owner, we, the government, gives you... Hawaii gives you this money so you'll be able to pay the excess rent?"
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2714.598,2720.375,"In fact, we believe that is... is, in essence, what is occurring here."
2004.04-163,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2732.924,2736.268,Explain it... explain your theory in terms of the example.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2765.329,2768.757,"Let me see if I can get to it better, Your Honor."
2004.04-163,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2880.584,2885.33,But there are so many things that you could dress up as being a taking.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2915.423,2928.222,"--I think, Your Honor, that most courts have recognized, although I don't know that it's settled, that a... a control on the price of a product that... that a business has produced would implicate the Takings Clause."
2004.04-163,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2934.909,2939.118,Do we have a case involving price control where we have analyzed that as a taking?
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2939.118,2942.09,--Yes.
2004.04-163,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2964.547,2967.436,I didn't know that those were treated as taking cases.
2004.04-163,2,19996,craig_e_stewart,,2967.436,2973.176,"--I believe they were, Your Honor, and that they have been... that this Court has discussed them in those terms."
2004.04-163,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3101.434,3106.142,Thank you.
2004.04-163,3,35457,mark_j_bennett,,3110.683,3116.295,"Your Honors, this case is not about compensation."
2004.04-163,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3223.375,3225.87,The case is submitted.
