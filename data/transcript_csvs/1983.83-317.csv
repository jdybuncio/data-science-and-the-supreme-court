1983.83-317,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,4.785,We will hear arguments next in Block against Rutherford.
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,28.031,31.602,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.83-317,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,117.208,122.826,"Just this one jail, that's over 4,000 square miles?"
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,122.826,125.944,"No, the County is 4,000 square miles."
1983.83-317,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,125.944,126.561,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,126.561,138.752,"Although all male inmates are centralized at one facility, in part because of the size of the County and because of some duties that are imposed upon the sheriff under state law."
1983.83-317,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,220.323,229.095,"Mr. Bennett, when you say they're involved in appellate process, you mean perhaps a motion to suppress that's appealed prior to trial, that sort of thing?"
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,229.095,230.611,--It could be that.
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,269.72,271.438,"But they're not members of the class, are they?"
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,274.457,284.73,"Technically, it was certified as to all prisoners within the jail, which at the time of certification involved a significant number of sentenced inmates."
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,288.967,296.221,"I thought the Court of Appeals' opinion referred only to pretrial detainees, that the order only referred to them."
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,296.221,307.595,"In the progress of this case, virtually all counsel and the courts at all levels focused only on the matters that dealt with pretrial detainees, although--"
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,307.595,312.963,"I mean, the legal issues would be quite different if they were sentenced people, would they not?"
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,312.963,314.665,--That's perhaps true as to some issues.
1983.83-317,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,314.665,325.64,But there still are within the technically certified class a small minority who are not pretrial detainees?
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,325.64,345.351,"We can't say how small, because if an inmate is sentenced on one charge and is a sentenced inmate, but is awaiting trial on other charges, of which there are many within our facility, we treat him for our classification purposes as if he is a pretrial detainee."
1983.83-317,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,516.56,527.534,"Is there a claim here, Mr. Bennett, that those objectives could have been accomplished by less intrusive, less restrictive measures?"
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,539.692,543.294,They did not make that request.
1983.83-317,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,572.147,575.015,This included children as well as adults?
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,575.015,576.284,"Yes, it did."
1983.83-317,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,576.284,583.038,I take it that your New York counterpart disagrees with some of the things you've just said?
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,583.038,588.259,"Well, I think that the New York facility is certainly different from ours."
1983.83-317,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,644.261,646.661,"Excuse me, before you go on."
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,655.903,665.259,"--I'd like to focus on two aspects: one, our drug problem; and then the drug problem, for instance, at New York jails which permit contact visits."
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,734.735,736.651,"Mr. Bennett, before you get into that."
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,755.046,759.516,"Well, the court certainly thought it applied to up to 1500."
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,759.516,760.95,"Well, it put a ceiling of 1500."
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,765.52,772.658,"But that number, in terms of total inmates that meet the 30-day requirement, would exceed that number."
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.658,782.132,"And out of those, how many would be... how many could you segregate out as having association with drug traffic or being particularly violent?"
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,782.132,787.952,We don't think that we can segregate them within our facility or classify them as to those types of risks.
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,787.952,791.237,You don't have any classification system at all?
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,791.237,791.887,We do.
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.401,818.389,"Yes, but for example, if someone's arrested on a drug charge presumably the jailer would know that and just make him ineligible for this visit."
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,820.341,830.696,"Even if we can segregate out those who might present the lesser risk of drugs or escape, we can't prevent the intermingling within our facility."
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,840.068,850.276,"What I'm trying to find out... and I don't know if the record will tell us... is how many people would get the benefit of this order if the Ninth Circuit were affirmed, in your judgment?"
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,855.145,861.668,I think it was apparent to us that the court expected us to find at least 1500 people--
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,861.668,863.034,--I'm not asking you what the court expected you to find.
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,868.404,870.523,--I can't say.
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,870.523,871.573,You have no idea?
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,871.573,884.081,"Although I would indicate that, in light of our sheriff's history as reflected in the record, that he would make an effort to try and find 1500 people if he could."
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,886.199,887.366,"Well, why would he do that?"
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,895.805,906.696,"--I think it's a reflection of this sheriff who, as the district court pointed out, tried, to the extent that it was told to him that he had to do something, he would make an effort to do that."
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.696,910.564,"Well, what if you told him that you thought he shouldn't do any more than absolutely necessary?"
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,912.766,913.566,I can't tell you.
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,913.566,914.366,You don't have any idea?
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,914.366,914.968,"No, I can't."
1983.83-317,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1021.822,1022.588,The inmates and the guards.
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,1022.588,1023.588,--That's true.
1983.83-317,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1023.588,1025.54,The guards don't like it either.
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,1025.54,1025.923,They don't.
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1110.477,1113.329,"Well, before you leave the contact visit issue, may I ask you."
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,1131.188,1136.425,--I don't think the mere question of contact visits rises to constitutional proportions.
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1136.425,1137.611,"Well, it does if it's punishment."
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,1137.611,1147.467,"Then the answer is it's not punishment, given the other alternatives that are available to permit the maintenance of these relationships."
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1147.467,1153.536,Your answer is it could never become punishment as long as other alternatives that are less desirable to the inmate are provided?
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,1153.536,1155.905,I think I would have to take that position.
1983.83-317,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1155.905,1156.522,I think you would.
1983.83-317,0,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,1156.522,1170.748,"The search procedures, as we've indicated in our briefs, are really not very distinguishable from this Court's prior examination of that question in the Wolfish decision."
1983.83-317,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1262.14,1265.092,Very well.
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1270.079,1278.201,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.83-317,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1321.461,1332.519,"Mr. Bronstein, can you answer the question that was earlier asked Mr. Bennett as to approximately how many people are included within the class certified?"
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1332.519,1333.802,I cannot.
1983.83-317,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1347.945,1376.031,"Mr. Bronstein, I have a recollection, but I haven't been able to check it out, of a case that came to us from the Second Circuit that involved a contact visit with the mother bringing a small child in, and in New York they had, or at least in the Second Circuit, there had been a screen barrier that was preventing the transfer of drugs or weapons or anything else."
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1377.715,1379.567,No--
1983.83-317,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1379.567,1380.983,Perhaps I'm confusing one--
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1380.983,1381.601,--not specifically.
1983.83-317,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1526.877,1530.829,"--Well, what is the precise definition of the class certified, do you know, Mr. Bronstein?"
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1530.829,1537.333,"There were two classes certified, Justice Rehnquist, a class of detainees and a class of sentenced prisoners."
1983.83-317,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1551.492,1554.277,And is that the one there's the 1500 cap?
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1554.277,1555.127,That is right.
1983.83-317,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1555.127,1560.614,And that doesn't apply to the convicted ones who are also detainees?
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1560.614,1562.633,It does not.
1983.83-317,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1565.335,1568.454,"Well, aren't there some of those that are convicted?"
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1573.739,1576.691,"They may have been convicted in some other case, yes."
1983.83-317,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1576.691,1577.357,Yes.
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1578.941,1579.976,I don't know.
1983.83-317,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1579.976,1581.893,Does it apply to them?
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1581.893,1590.682,"In this, I don't know the answer to that either, Justice Marshall, whether it would apply to them in this case."
1983.83-317,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.88,1699.903,"Of course, the class is certified not just to include Mr. Rutherford, who you say was there for 39 months, but to include anyone who is there for more than 30 days."
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1705.957,1716.432,"--That's precisely what the district court did, and if you'll notice, the district court in its original order provided that detainees there only 14 days were entitled to visits."
1983.83-317,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1831.557,1841.262,"I take it that you do not suggest that there's no risk of having drugs or weapons come into prisons, Mr. Bronstein?"
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1841.262,1846.649,"I do not suggest that at all, and the district court found that there is some risk, and prisons are--"
1983.83-317,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1846.649,1847.549,Some risk?
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1847.549,1848.351,--That's right.
1983.83-317,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1848.351,1851.22,"You think it's just some risk, or that it is an enormous risk?"
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1851.22,1852.953,The district court found there was--
1983.83-317,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1852.953,1854.505,I'm speaking of generally.
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,1857.54,1863.778,"--Generally, in some institutions it is a risk and a problem, in some more, some less."
1983.83-317,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.267,2007.969,"If you knew Ryker's Island, you'd find you can learn a whole lot in one day."
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2007.969,2027.733,"--Yes, but the brief of the New York City Board of Corrections indicates that last year there were 339,000 contact visits involving an average daily population of almost 10,000, and they were 99.95 incident-free."
1983.83-317,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2033.454,2041.208,Is there any... I know there's no evidence as to how much of drugs came in during that period.
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2041.208,2041.86,"No, there is none."
1983.83-317,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2041.86,2042.476,There is--
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2042.476,2047.011,"Except that there were no incidents in 99.95 percent, no finding--"
1983.83-317,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2047.011,2049.296,"--Well, the incident would be a person being caught."
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2049.296,2050.915,--That's correct.
1983.83-317,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2050.915,2053.617,But there is no record of those who were not caught.
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2053.617,2059.104,"I would concede that some drugs may have come in in some of those visits, obviously."
1983.83-317,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2123.964,2129.165,"The trial judge didn't make new findings after the remand, did he?"
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2129.165,2130.8,"No, he did not."
1983.83-317,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.8,2131.467,He just relied on his--
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2131.467,2132.985,He was directed by the--
1983.83-317,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.985,2133.869,--Court of Appeals?
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2133.869,2138.287,"--Court of Appeals to hold... to consider it in the light of Wolfish, without an evidentiary hearing."
1983.83-317,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2138.287,2140.656,And he could have held it?
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2143.508,2144.475,He could have made new findings.
1983.83-317,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.68,2183.418,Is that speaking only of pretrial detainees?
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2183.418,2185.384,"No, that's generally, and now I'm going to get to detainees."
1983.83-317,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2210.318,2221.959,"Do you think, Mr. Bronstein, that there is a difference between the classification of prisoners in the federal system and in what we're dealing with here?"
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2233.851,2236.001,"Well, a great many drug crimes, Your Honor."
1983.83-317,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2245.742,2249.11,--A great many so-called white collar crimes?
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2249.11,2250.91,--Not that many.
1983.83-317,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2305.797,2322.575,"Mr. Bronstein, the Court of Appeals in remanding to the district court said... this was in giving the district court some guidance:"
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2334.632,2336.799,"Does not, without more."
1983.83-317,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.799,2343.988,"Well now, my question to you is, do you think that invites a balancing process?"
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2343.988,2346.024,No.
1983.83-317,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.407,2357.063,"Well, it invites an inquiry as to whether a particular restriction is reasonably related to a non-punitive goal?"
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2357.063,2373.007,"--And also, as Wolfish tells us, whether there were genuine privations and hardships for very extended periods of time, and whether the particular response by the officials was exaggerated to the real concern for security."
1983.83-317,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.007,2375.293,Well--
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2375.293,2376.643,And illustrative--
1983.83-317,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2376.643,2379.828,--The district court said:
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2396.957,2399.457,--I don't think that's... I think that--
1983.83-317,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.457,2399.807,That's what he said.
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2399.807,2410.348,"--But in context, if the entire district court opinion is read, I think it is clear that he specifically follows Wolfish by finding the exaggerated response."
1983.83-317,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2453.71,2465.701,Is it your suggestion that a district court's conclusion as to whether or not a condition is reasonably related to a legitimate non-punitive objective is a finding of fact?
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2465.701,2471.005,"Well, that particular thing I think would be--"
1983.83-317,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2471.005,2475.623,Or his result of a balance is a finding of fact?
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2475.623,2476.157,--No.
1983.83-317,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2522.188,2531.794,"You've referred to several times, Mr. Bronstein, to overreaction or... I've forgot the precise phrase, that there is an overreaction to--"
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2531.794,2533.912,Exaggerated response.
1983.83-317,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2533.912,2536.281,--Exaggerated response to the problem.
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2560.163,2565.967,"I don't think that would be permissible, and that would not satisfy what Judge Gray was concerned about."
1983.83-317,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2789.027,2794.015,Is that really anything but a rather sophistic distinction?
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2794.015,2796.55,I don't think so--
1983.83-317,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2796.55,2810.227,"I mean, do you think a district court could properly say that, after this court has analyzed a particular claim under the Fourth Amendment, to reach a wholly different result, just saying, well, I'm going to use a little different constitutional provision?"
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2810.227,2834.008,"--Well, what I think Judge Gray was concerned about was his observations, his personal observations of the likelihood of the loss of cherished possessions: a photograph of a deceased mother, legal papers, a book that was of very great importance."
1983.83-317,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2835.808,2839.294,"Well, how does that bear on our opinion in Wolfish?"
1983.83-317,1,15610,alvin_j_bronstein,,2839.294,2882.489,"Well, what he found was that, I think, that it was not a search and seizure question, but since we have already determined that a prisoner does... that the state may not take property without some procedural due process, he found that if those things were taken there was no adequate procedural protection, such as the damage claim mentioned by footnote 38 in Wolfish; and that under Parratt v. Taylor, which reaffirms that a state may not take property without some sort of hearing or, as the Court said in Parratt, a meaningful hearing at a meaningful time, the only time to do that is in a prophylactic way, to prevent the taking."
1983.83-317,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2928.035,2931.054,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Bennett?"
1983.83-317,2,23633,frederick_r_bennett,,2931.054,2944.064,"I'd like to direct my attention just briefly to this 39-month inmate, because it may cause some concern to some members of the Court."
1983.83-317,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3240.422,3241.458,"Thank you, gentlemen."
