1973.72-6160,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,51.917,"We’ll hear arguments next in Mitchell against W. T. Grant Company, 72-6160."
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,57.742,61.869,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,300.753,304.7,Did he make any assertion that there was not a balance due on the debt?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,304.7,316.428,"No, he can -- he could do this in his defense to the underlying petition for setting a money claim and that is his intent, what he intents to do --"
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,316.428,318.787,You mean at the trial later?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,318.787,321.121,By pleadings and been at the trial --
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,321.121,330.83,"You claim that's his motion to dissolve the writ, he may not challenge the averments that balance are due?"
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,330.83,336.524,He can -- the Louisiana law is actually unclear on this.
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,339.769,358.079,"I notice that respondent’s claim that at this hearing, he dissolved the writ, he may challenge anything that is relevant to the issuance of the writ."
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,358.079,362.294,"I suggest that’s not the law of Louisiana, what the law says and --"
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,362.294,365.027,"Well, let’s assume that it was the law of Louisiana."
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,365.027,365.895,Yes.
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,365.895,374.246,"That he could challenge the writ, to challenge the underlying facts on which the writ was based."
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,374.246,374.567,Yes.
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,374.567,376.094,-- namely that there is a debt due.
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,376.094,376.315,Yes.
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,376.315,385.262,"And a balance due, would that make any difference to your argument?"
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,385.262,406.162,"Well, respondent does make the argument out of the -- he makes the argument that because Mitchell could have raised defenses in that post-seizure hearing that he had to raise every defense and because he did not raise the seizures against the underlying claim, he only raised defenses against the seizure that he has waived all these defenses."
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,416.404,417.492,It still comes too late.
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,417.492,423.644,"Because it comes too late, it comes after the depravation."
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,423.644,430.014,"Is it -- well, I’ll -- you go ahead."
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,430.014,445.232,"After the City Court refused to dissolve the seizure, Mitchell sought immediate interlocutory relief at the appellate level and intermediate Appellate Court refused to review."
1973.72-6160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,593.27,604.053,"Mr. Hobbs, you said that, I missed -- I think -- something you said, the Courts of how many states had held similar laws unconstitutional beyond understanding of --"
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,604.053,608.284,It’s a -- there’s been more than 60 decisions in more than 29 States.
1973.72-6160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,608.284,609.205,More than 29?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,609.205,610.025,Nine.
1973.72-6160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,610.025,611.559,Nine.
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,625.734,627.187,There has been --
1973.72-6160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,627.187,629.626,Have there been modifications of (Voice Overlap) --
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,629.626,638.04,I’m aware of the legislatures considering new legislation to give consumers prior notice and hearing.
1973.72-6160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,652.948,661.148,Do you have a -- do you have in your brief the judicial decisions to which you referred more than -- you cite this -- citations to?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,661.148,667.085,"No, to -- when I was writing it I thought it would -- it was -- would do -- to state the obvious."
1973.72-6160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,667.085,667.539,Yes.
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,667.539,669.253,And including those 60 (Voice Overlap) --
1973.72-6160,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,669.253,672.983,You say they’re more than 60 in over 29 -- in at least 29 states?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,672.983,674.827,Yes Your Honor.
1973.72-6160,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,674.827,677.918,I understand they are since Fuentes?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,677.918,683.865,"No, those decisions are all since Sniadach and since Fuentes."
1973.72-6160,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,765.963,773.626,Do you think if it could be shown that the collateral were actually in danger that that would be a legitimate exception to Fuentes?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,773.626,785.727,We then have the problem of safeguards to ensure whether that determination to safeguard that the determination is accurate once it is made.
1973.72-6160,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.649,803.584,"But of course, given notice and hearing, it’s also an opportunity for the person who is the object of the writ to spare that thing away?"
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,803.584,821.184,"Well, if we presume that consumers do spare things away or sitting in their house with the hatchet ready to destroy the goods; that would raise our presumption to a constitutional presumption of malice of consumers."
1973.72-6160,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,821.184,838.963,"Well, it’s not a question of malice of consumers but I think almost everyone who has had any experience in this type of practice knows that stuff frequently disappears if the people have notice of the fact that it’s a subject of sequestration?"
1973.72-6160,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,838.963,840.12,And they don’t use hatchets.
1973.72-6160,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,845.081,846.132,Or move it next door?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,846.132,849.747,That is a presumption which I’m unwilling to indulge in.
1973.72-6160,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,866.798,872.189,"What safeguards would be, what range of safeguards do you have in mind, I am not sure I follow you?"
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,872.189,878.452,Well the traditional safeguard is adversarial hearing in which both sides can assert their interests.
1973.72-6160,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,881.613,884.63,How does that help if the property has already been sold after those --?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,884.63,887.59,"It doesn’t, I’m talking about a hearing prior."
1973.72-6160,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,887.59,889.132,Oh! I see.
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,889.132,891.813,And those are the safeguards to protect --
1973.72-6160,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,891.813,892.103,Not a safeguard --
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,892.103,901.617,-- to make sure that the state is not engaging in an erroneous decision when it decides there's a need to seize this property to take it from one individual and --
1973.72-6160,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,901.617,908.265,"You didn’t mean a safeguard for the creditor, you meant to safeguard for the debtor, the purchaser?"
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,908.265,911.779,As a safeguard for the state to ensure that the state.
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,928.771,929.132,There are --
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,929.132,929.69,I --
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,929.69,937.008,"There doesn’t seem to be any question about -- why under a Louisiana law, the seller in this case had a property interest in the goods?"
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,937.008,939.432,"No, there's no contest."
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,939.432,947.804,"So, you would make the same argument if there were chattel mortgage on that or some -- something besides just a vendor's lien?"
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,947.804,949.199,That’s correct.
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.199,957.899,"And so, both parties have property interest in the goods and the question is who has possession pending litigation?"
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,957.899,958.697,Correct.
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.697,977.137,"And let’s assume there was a hearing of whatever kind of a hearing that you think would be satisfactory, what would you think would have to be established at that hearing in order to change possession or is your position that possession may not be changed until the entire litigation is over?"
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,987.067,987.974,There is a --
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,987.974,994.847,Or would you have to try out the entire case and make final and conclusive findings?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,994.847,1009.145,The Court in Fuentes suggested that at that hearing that the underlying merits of the claim would be what the claimant must prove in order to obtain the seizure.
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.145,1016.643,Not just probable cause to believe?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,1016.643,1023.955,When you get in to probable cause which is getting into us a burden or the specific facts on which this -- the --
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.955,1025.14,That’s right.
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,1025.14,1026.934,Creditor must show.
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1035.223,1050.467,"Well, I know but isn’t that -- so you, in effect -- you’re saying that you must have a full adversarial hearing on all of the issues in the case and decide them on the merits before possession maybe changed."
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,1050.467,1054.664,I don’t think that the Court has to reach that question to --
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1054.664,1069.614,"Well, I think it’s very much the part of the inquiry is what kind of a hearing are you talking about as requiring before a change of possession?"
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,1069.614,1089.45,"I think that perhaps one of the issues that could be involved is the necessity of the seizure and if it is not shown necessary at that hearing, that is that there is no danger of the goods to the goods to be seized, but then there would be no reason --"
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1089.45,1100.832,"How do you fill that, to put the burden on the creditor for that and to show that -- how does he show that?"
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,1102.007,1103.308,If you indulge --
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1103.308,1108.072,"In effect you’re just saying, let’s wait till the trial is all over."
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,1108.072,1112.51,That is the ordinary way that we test the claims under our system.
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.722,1146.359,You also think that the private repossession would be illegal without any aid from the state?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,1146.359,1148.937,"The -- well, let me make this clear."
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.349,1174.499,No self-help remedies under the Louisiana law permissible?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,1174.499,1188.549,"Not in the context of the credit sale and under the law of Louisiana, there are no conditional sales, title vests in buyer immediately upon the agreement of the price and the goods and therefore --"
1973.72-6160,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.549,1189.977,Subject to the vendor’s lien?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,1189.977,1196.108,"Subject to the vendor’s lien, and therefore, under that rational, they do not allow self-help repossession."
1973.72-6160,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1196.108,1202.028,Does Louisiana recognize a conditional sales type of contract for personal property?
1973.72-6160,0,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,1202.028,1212.325,"No it doesn’t, it will give full faith and credit to one made out of the state, but it will not enforce one made within the state."
1973.72-6160,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1310.1,1314.833,Very well Mr. Hobbs.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1317.88,1322.161,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.606,1629.28,"That means there is a -- you have a lien, you have to -- there has to be balance due I take it?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1629.28,1632.569,"Yes sir, I believe that that’s so."
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1636.913,1649.947,"Yes, but the -- you may have a vendor’s lien but not have the right to possess because the balance may not be due, may not be unpaid."
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1655.038,1658.019,"No Your Honor, I think that that’s so but beyond that --"
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.019,1659.897,What about that in this case.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1664.584,1680.289,"Well Your Honor, the allegations in the petition, in the initial affidavit pursuant to which this action was commenced were to the effect that the balance was unpaid and was due and that has never been contested nor contradicted and it could’ve been contested and contradicted."
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.289,1685.389,"But never been admitted -- never been admitted either, has it?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1685.389,1699.968,"No sir, but there has -- I submit, there has been a finding to that effect implicit in the decision of the Court at the hearing to set aside the writ of sequestration."
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1699.968,1716.157,"I understand it only -- the -- there’s always a vendor’s lien in -- under Louisiana law, when personal property, when a chattel is sold and the full purchase price is not then in there paid, there’s always a so called vendor's privilege, isn’t it?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1716.157,1717.15,"Yes sir, that’s true."
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1717.15,1719.557,"And that’s all the submission amounted to, wasn’t it?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1719.557,1732.689,"No, I think that it goes to something more than that because it’s an admission that it has not been extinguished, that its still, that it has not been extinguished, that it’s still in existence as of the time that the case has come on for a hearing before the Court."
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1732.689,1741.822,"And that would simply be an admission of no more than that the full purchase price has still not yet been paid, isn’t that right under Louisiana law?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1741.822,1743.24,I think that it goes beyond that.
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1753.417,1774.385,"Well simply, and the only thing that would extinguish it as I understand it at least under Louisiana law of which I’m generally very ignorant, is that until the full purchase price has been paid plus whatever interest and service charges there maybe, the vendor’s lien remains and is not extinguished, isn’t that correct?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1777.699,1777.877,No sir.
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1792.642,1799.043,Your argument is -- I take it that the -- at this -- here you have the burden of showing that your seizure was proper?
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1803.375,1804.021,Yes sir we do.
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1804.021,1812.792,And in order for them not to set us -- in order for the court not to set aside the writ and the sequestration and collect on your bond that there was any damages.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1817.94,1820.546,Exactly so sir.
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1821.069,1829.993,But I -- that’s you and your brother are not in agreement as to that factual issue or as to that question of Louisiana Law?
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1829.993,1831.509,That is a correct statement.
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1875.286,1887.512,What is the (Voice Overlap) -- what do you think the standard is under Louisiana law at the hearing to quash the seizure such as what’s held in this case.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1891.787,1892.577,Yes sir.
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1892.577,1902.923,"What standard does the court apply, probable cause or it’s sort of like a preliminary hearing you’ve established whether there’s a reasonable basis for the claim?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1902.923,1912.7,"In essence, I would submit Your Honor that at that hearing there is an inquiry into the probable validity of the claim."
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.7,1913.025,Is that --
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1913.025,1922.057,"In a sense, akin to the position asserted by Justice Harlan in the concurring opinion in the Sniadach case."
1973.72-6160,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1946.44,1953.245,Of the showing of the valid vendor’s lien standing along would not justify it and then -- let me ask you this question hypothetically.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,1974.024,1976.083,"Yes sir, I think so."
1973.72-6160,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2022.011,2028.914,That’s the basis for your saying there is an implicit judicial determination of a default here?
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2028.914,2034.412,Yes sir.
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2099.654,2111.137,"If that’s true of course and -- then the Fuentes in all its ramifications was fully satisfied, wasn’t it, this case, is that your point?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2111.137,2111.676,"No sir, I don’t think --"
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2111.676,2115.154,There was a prior determination --
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2115.154,2115.71,I --
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2115.71,2129.805,"-- of all of the issues that had to do with who should have relevant possession of the property before the property was taken then I should suppose that Fuentes if broadly read was fully satisfied, wasn’t it?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2129.805,2131.171,"No, I don’t think that that’s so Your Honor."
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2131.171,2132.397,"Well, then what is your point?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2132.397,2145.769,"Well, the reason for that is that the prior judicial determination was ex parte and the question is whether or not the Louisiana ex parte prior judicial determination satisfies --"
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2145.769,2146.157,I see.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2146.157,2148.302,-- the rule that’s set forth in the Fuentes case.
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2148.302,2149.987,You don’t say there was prior --
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2149.987,2150.901,There was --
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2150.901,2153.572,-- hearing of it in the sense of any kind of an adversary hearing (Voice Overlap) --
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2153.572,2155.867,"There was not an adversarial hearing, no sir."
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2155.867,2156.645,Right.
1973.72-6160,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2156.645,2168.996,"On page 23 of your brief you -- beginning at the middle page you say in order to meet the burden of establishing that the writ was properly issued, the vendor must establish and then you list six elements."
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2186.267,2193.142,This is the burden that falls on him at the time of the purchaser's motion to dissolve the writ.
1973.72-6160,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2193.142,2196.211,And do you -- was that an adversary hearing?
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2196.211,2197.907,"Oh, yes sir it was."
1973.72-6160,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2262.418,2271.029,"Well, I suppose too that since you’re from New York and your opponent is from Boston, neither of you can contribute much personal knowledge of Louisiana."
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2271.029,2274.196,I recognize that problem and appear that that so Your Honor.
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2349.858,2353.326,"What is that, a lien as existing?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2353.326,2354.345,Yes sir.
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2354.345,2355.808,And what else?
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2355.808,2369.716,"And that there is a probable validity to the claim being asserted by the party commencing the lawsuit, seeking the taking of the property."
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.716,2377.058,"But experience that some of us had with a computer, if all computer had made a mistake, that’s it?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2377.058,2377.903,"Well, Your Honor, this is a certain --"
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2377.903,2381.039,Under the Louisiana law is that it or not.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2387.363,2395.212,"Your Honor, there’s some question in my mind as to the answer to that question because I --"
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2395.212,2411.593,"Well, you have taken the burden of showing us in your answer to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question that this was a fully valid complete ex parte hearing, you’ve taken on that, now, you say you don’t know."
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2411.593,2411.74,Well --
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2411.74,2414.308,We won’t take which one you want to stand on?
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2414.308,2421.632,"Sir, this is a situation in which the Court has the opportunity to make the inquiry into the claim --"
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2421.632,2422.014,Did it?
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2422.014,2423.487,-- and the party seeking the issuance of the writ --
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2423.487,2424.511,Did it?
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2426.302,2429.658,"Your Honor, you can’t tell from the record in this case and I --"
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2429.658,2431.57,-- then you can’t say there was a full hearing.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2438.506,2459.688,"No sir. There was a ex parte hearing, the application was made to the court and under the Louisiana decisions that we’ve cited in our brief, it is the responsibility of the court to undertake an evaluation of the claim and look into these facts that are alleged in the petition to make a determination that as to the propriety of the issuing of the writ."
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.688,2467.152,"And two facts are one that there’s a lien in two it was three-fold, that’s all there is, isn’t it?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2467.152,2471.082,"And that the property is in the possession of the vendee, yes sir."
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2471.082,2473.736,And that’s all it is?
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2473.736,2487.044,I think it is but I’m not entirely clear on that and the reason for that is because I do have some trouble in reading precisely what the Louisiana Supreme Court did --
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2487.044,2497.351,"I answer me, clearance in reading, Louisiana law, the Supreme Court’s opinions, I think you should go on down and look at it because it’s the civil law."
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2497.351,2535.124,"Yes sir and I appreciate that some of the problems in the civil law and in fact, Justice Holmes has addressed himself to the Question of dealing with problems under the civil law and he said, “When we contemplate such a system from the outside, it seems like a wall of stone, every part even with all the others except so far as our own local education may lead us to see subordinations to which we are accustomed.”"
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2561.657,2573.518,But you have taken the burden of showing that you’ve got a full and fair hearing and you now say you don’t know what it was?
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2573.518,2574.023,No sir.
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2588.145,2606.013,"Well the -- their reasoning was as I understand it and I’ve just reread it here in the bench was that the vendee purchased the property, was implied in law knowledge of what the law of Louisiana was."
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2606.013,2607.945,"Your Honor, I submit there is an ultimate ground in the decision."
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2607.945,2609.148,Was that what they said.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2609.148,2623.101,Yes sir it did. But I submit there is an alternate ground of decision in this case which would be appropriate to consider in the court and this is set forth on page 29 of the appendix.
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2645.082,2656.424,"But now, what if anything in the record of this case justified the statement that the -- that this case comes within that language of Fuentes."
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2663.992,2680.073,The answer to that question Your Honor is the un-contradicted allegations made in the petition in this case to the effect that the respondent had reason to fear that the petitioner would alienate or dispose of the property.
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2680.073,2684.559,Isn’t that part of the form used in every single one of this in Louisiana?
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2684.559,2693.162,"Your Honor, I don’t know the answer to that question, but I submit that this -- in this case, it was a fact, it was a sworn statement that was never contested."
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2693.162,2704.452,"But what if it were a part of the form used in every single one of these or they used routinely and traditionally in every single one of these in Louisiana, would you say that was -- had came within the exception?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2707.391,2719.168,"No sir, I would think that it would be completely inappropriate that the -- that there must be a stronger showing that merely pro forma showing."
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2719.168,2720.801,And is there anything in this case --
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2720.801,2723.626,And the suggestion here is that this is pro forma of showing.
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2723.626,2724.158,Yes.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2724.158,2744.584,"In that regard, I suggest that in part that maybe attributable to that fact that this case arose before the Fuentes case was decided and before the parties and indeed the country knew what was required for a showing that would have to be --"
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2744.584,2750.522,But it came to the Supreme Court of Louisiana after Fuentes obviously because they dealt with Fuentes.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2750.522,2751.495,Sir?
1973.72-6160,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2751.495,2757.089,"By the time it got to the Supreme Court of Louisiana, Fuentes had been decided quite clearly."
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2757.089,2774.355,Yes sir it did.
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2945.863,2968.568,"My question is, is justice Stewart’s -- in your appendix C, Supreme Court of Louisiana is the affidavit which uses the language that he might run away with materials and it appears that it’s a form just filled in."
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2968.568,2971.176,"Your Honor, what page is that?"
1973.72-6160,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2971.176,2984.25,This is the appendix C in the petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana which is on file here in this Court.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,2994.113,2999.781,"Yes sir, I do."
1973.72-6160,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3054.883,3060.923,"Mr. O’Sullivan, are you asking, you are not asking I take it that Fuentes be overruled."
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3060.923,3061.814,"No sir, no."
1973.72-6160,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3080.881,3083.827,And you are content to rely on those distinctions.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3083.827,3084.991,Yes sir.
1973.72-6160,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3084.991,3090.093,"So, if we don’t agree with you we should reverse it?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3090.093,3091.712,That decision of the court below.
1973.72-6160,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3091.712,3097.931,"If the Fuentes governs this case, the decision should be reversed?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3102.088,3103.3,That is correct Your Honor.
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3103.3,3107.085,You don’t hesitate that we overrule or modify the Fuentes language?
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3107.085,3109.395,No sir.
1973.72-6160,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3109.395,3111.102,"Mr. O’Sullivan, before you sit down --"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3111.102,3111.531,Yes sir.
1973.72-6160,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3111.531,3116.356,"Would you look at page 36 of the appendix, do you have it there?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3116.356,3122.902,"Yes sir, I do."
1973.72-6160,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3122.902,3130.81,Can you tell me what that disposition is by the Supreme Court of Louisiana and of what?
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3130.81,3143.099,"Oh, Your Honor that is an application for a rehearing that was made by the petitioner below after the decision had been rendered by the Louisiana Supreme Court and the decision was --"
1973.72-6160,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3143.099,3145.677,"Made by whom, by Grant or by Mitchell?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3145.677,3146.248,By Mitchell.
1973.72-6160,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3146.248,3146.564,I see.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3146.564,3147.9,For rehearing and the --
1973.72-6160,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3147.9,3148.133,Right.
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3148.133,3150.157,-- and the request for rehearing was denied.
1973.72-6160,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3150.157,3151.87,"Right, thank you."
1973.72-6160,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3151.87,3169.404,"May I ask -- as a further question along the lines of Mr. Justice White’s inquiry, why you don’t as an alternative take the position of Fuentes should be overrule?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3174.267,3202.399,"Well, Your Honor, I thought about that and I feel disturbed as my brother Hobbs does about the fact that there have been so many other jurisdictions and courts that have passed upon them and have acted upon the decision in the Fuentes case and concluded that it was an appropriate rule in the jurisdictions in which it applied and adopted it."
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3203.45,3206.232,As a matter of federal constitutional law which is at --
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3206.232,3207.453,Yes sir.
1973.72-6160,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3207.453,3208.414,I suppose they have --
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3208.414,3217.163,"Are there any -- the decisions weren’t necessarily voluntary, it doesn’t say."
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3217.163,3236.74,"I detected some lack of enthusiasm in some of the decisions including, I might add the decisions, the many decisions that have recently been coming down in regard to self-help in which the courts have seen to be reluctant to extend the rule in the Fuentes case to the self-help situation admittedly on --"
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3236.74,3244.179,"In the jurisdictions that have responded by the legislation, I guess there had been some --"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3244.179,3248.837,"I Your Honor, I’m not aware of any states in which there has been legislation of yet."
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3248.837,3258.589,So the decision have -- I suppose that issue have been on provision of the Uniform Commercial Code in some states permitting what the -- the repossession?
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3258.589,3259.27,Yes sir.
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3259.27,3261.882,"That’s Article 9, Section 9-503."
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3261.882,3265.174,"5 -- 9-503, yes sir and just recent --"
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3265.174,3272.834,"Is that provision that has been at issue on this been held unconstitutional under Fuentes, in this other -- in these decisions?"
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3272.834,3293.634,"I would submit Your Honor that the great number of the decisions involving an application of that section of the Uniform Commercial Code have held that action under that section was not unconstitutional on the ground that it didn’t constitute state action, and just recently the -- both the Eighth and Ninth Circuit have come down on the side --"
1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3293.634,3294.62,On the side of self help.

1973.72-6160,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3299.738,3314.999,What -- of what state statutes have been at issue where Fuentes is not implied to a bit -- what provision of the Uniform --
1973.72-6160,1,43159,thomas_j_osullivan,,3314.999,3316.862,The Uniform Commercial Code?
1973.72-6160,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3324.949,3327.247,"Mr. Hobbs, do you have anything further?"
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3327.247,3328.127,"Yes, I have a few."
1973.72-6160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3328.127,3350.352,"Let me ask you before you get started whether at the hearing to dissolve the writ of sequestration, there was either opportunity to prove an the absence of a default or whether there was an effort to prove the absence of a default?"
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3354.509,3361.616,The law of Louisiana is not clear as to what is relevant at that post-seizure hearing.
1973.72-6160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3409.706,3418.279,"Well, wouldn’t the -- as a practical matter if you could prove that you were not in default, that would end the whole matter here to get your merchandise back, wouldn’t you?"
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3418.279,3423.173,"Certainly, if the statute had been declared unconstitutional, I would have gotten the property back."
1973.72-6160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3462.452,3464.688,Were you in in this case from the beginning?
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3464.688,3473.026,I was in the case initially and I left Louisiana before it was argued in the Louisiana Supreme Court but I --
1973.72-6160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3473.026,3473.985,But you were in at the --?
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3473.985,3474.924,I was in at the outset.
1973.72-6160,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3474.924,3476.124,Outset.
1973.72-6160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3476.124,3483.254,What is the practice in the parish of Orleans about the issuance of this writ of sequestration?
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3495.847,3512.511,"The -- I think the practice is that the -- is that a petition which I characterize and I think fairly so as a pro forma, that is a -- it’s a legal form that’s used over and over again, is presented to the judge."
1973.72-6160,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3570.919,3590.321,"Or would the -- the hearing if you would want before a seizure, would the standard that would be applied be one of probable cause or what or would the Court have to turn primarily that will be --"
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3590.321,3590.972,I --
1973.72-6160,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3590.972,3595.87,That was due unpaid and overdue unpaid --
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3595.87,3601.662,I do not think that the issue should finally -- be finally resolved if we have a very short mini hearing.
1973.72-6160,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3601.662,3605.456,I take it -- take a standard like for a preliminary injunction would decide it?
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3605.456,3612.182,"Yes sir or yes, I do."
1973.72-6160,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3612.182,3620.937,"Well, how do you distinguish the standard in Bell and Burson from the one you have in mind?"
1973.72-6160,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3625.997,3626.924,The basic distinction --
1973.72-6160,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3626.924,3636.558,A reason to believe that a jury might find the driver negligent but no final determination of the issue of the --
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3636.558,3638.327,I think that would be sufficient.
1973.72-6160,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3640.211,3642.467,"Well, that’s sort of a probable cause kind of the thing?"
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3642.467,3647.874,"Yes, I’m willing to concede any standard at this point and that prior hearing if you’ll give me the prior hearing."
1973.72-6160,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3647.874,3650.62,That’s right.
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3650.62,3653.01,But I would like to examine the statutes.
1973.72-6160,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3653.01,3667.602,"How about the probable cause, standard -- do you think that there must be a probable notice put an opportunity to appear first that you can’t just decide the probable cause issue on the basis of affidavits."
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3676.205,3684.106,"If that affidavit was presented in the adversarial context, that is where one party presents his side of the case."
1973.72-6160,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3690.344,3693.447,"That is on the probable -- for instance, say for summary judgment?"
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3693.447,3720.061,"I would suggest, if we had a requirement in Louisiana that there was a detailed showing of all that the creditor knows and the judge was given the discretion as a judge and the federal Court has given the discretion in issuing a TRO that we would have a very different situation and it should be closely examined and determined whether those safeguards are accurate, but this is not the case."
1973.72-6160,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3720.061,3735.15,"Well, if it is relevant, what kind of a hearing you’re talking about is whether you’re entitled to it or you’re talking about a kind of hearing on the merits before any transfer of possession is concerned?"
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3735.15,3735.35,No.
1973.72-6160,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3735.505,3736.217,It might be one thing.
1973.72-6160,2,39482,robert_j_hobbs,,3743.932,3773.191,"I would also in conjunction with the request on what is relevant at that post-seizure hearing, there is one case in which a judge had a post-seizure hearing did enter a judgment on the merits against the dispossessed party, that case was reversed, it was held that that was not to be determined at that motion to dissolve and I cite that in my reply brief, it's Tucker versus Shawna (ph) case."
1973.72-6160,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3825.126,3826.018,Thank you gentlemen.
