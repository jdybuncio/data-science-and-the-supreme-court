2003.02-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.743,"02-1632, Ralph Howard Blakely, Junior, versus Washington."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,11.867,16.597,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,50.588,53.272,"But it's still within the statutory maximum, is it not?"
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,53.272,65.327,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the statutory maximum as Apprendi defines that term, as Apprendi and Ring define that term, is the highest sentence that is allowable based on the facts and the guilty verdict."
2003.02-1632,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.121,107.203,"Well, I assume that if your position were adopted it would invalidate the Federal sentencing scheme that we have too, wouldn't it?"
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,107.203,109.144,"I don't think so, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-1632,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,109.144,109.887,Why not?
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,109.887,116.657,"Well, the big difference, the biggest difference between the Federal system and Washington, is the Federal system is a system of court rules."
2003.02-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,129.205,131.435,"Two wrongs... two wrongs make a right, I would say right."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,131.435,134.862,--That can sometimes be the case.
2003.02-1632,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.724,142.747,I can't see much difference.
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,151.226,157.792,"--Well, that may well be the case, Justice O'Connor, I don't think you have to decide the Federal... that issue in this case."
2003.02-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,183.676,190.18,"We did think a big deal in Mistretta, did we not, about the fact that the sentencing commission is in the judicial branch."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,190.18,191.378,Absolutely.
2003.02-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,226.589,240.047,"But if the guarantee of jury trial for a finding of fact in Apprendi, it is to be logical, why should it make any difference whether the court or the legislature sets out the scheme?"
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,240.047,250.366,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there are two parts of Apprendi, one is... footnote 16 of Apprendi, this Court talked about the democratic constraints that operate on legislatures vis-a-vis courts."
2003.02-1632,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,266.796,279.344,So are you here to say if Washington State's legislature said that for a burglary conviction that a judge can sentence anywhere from 10 to 20 years.
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,283.143,287.479,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe that that's what the holding in Apprendi and Ring would dictate."
2003.02-1632,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,287.479,288.844,What about the other half.
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,307.707,312.332,"Well, I think that is what's happening in this case, Justice Souter."
2003.02-1632,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,316.297,334.213,"Why isn't the same... I mean, no matter whether it's happening under the... under the immediate authorization of legislation setting up the guidelines or legislation that sets up, or that authorizes a component of judiciary set guidelines, isn't the same thing going on?"
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,334.213,343.623,"--Well, from the defendant's point of view you might say that it is, but there is a difference in that Apprendi talks... the baseline of Apprendi is deciding what are elements."
2003.02-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.431,387.545,"I guess the tough question is whether the sentencing guidelines, or rather the Sixth Amendment are unconstitutional, right?"
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,387.545,390.229,"I think the Sixth Amendment is constitutional, Justice--"
2003.02-1632,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,390.229,409.548,"I just wonder what if the statute in the guidelines case, says to the judge, Judge, you must impose a sentence that the commission has written unless you depart for certain reasons."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,441.97,449.855,"--The difference is, in the Washington scheme the legislature has in effect... the legislature has codified the sentencing grid."
2003.02-1632,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,464.222,474.791,"You know the reason... the difference is that in sentence... the Federal statute says, Judge, you must apply the grid of sentence."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,488.165,490.273,--I'm not sure I--
2003.02-1632,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,490.273,500.137,"In the Washington statute, it says, Judge, if you have an ordinary case, you must sentence the person to three years."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,527.508,542.452,"--The reason it makes a difference is because in the Washington system, in the state system the legislature has, as a policy choice with democratic constraints operating upon it, selected a maximum that it's not prepared to let judges go above."
2003.02-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,591.038,600.447,"You can... isn't the one... isn't that Washington prescription, that we talked about in the Williams case, leaving it almost completely up to the judge?"
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,600.447,602.471,"It's not, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,641.935,650.325,"So if you prevail the jury gets the list of... of all the 11 factors, plus whatever else the judge thinks might come up?"
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,656.052,661.171,"Well, in a typical system, Justice Kennedy, there are one, two, maybe three aggra... proposed aggravating factors."
2003.02-1632,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,677.146,680.862,Most... most of these cases like this one come up on pleas.
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,738.696,745.672,"So long as the guilty plea does not include any stipulation to an aggravating fact, yes, the top would be the standard range."
2003.02-1632,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,746.21,751.328,"So the defendant would have to say, yeah, I stipulate to 31 more."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,752.814,755.209,"--Well, I'm not sure it would work exactly that way, Justice O'Connor."
2003.02-1632,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,758.886,760.538,"Justice Ginsburg, down there."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,760.538,760.744,--I'm sorry.
2003.02-1632,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,775.649,778.91,"Well, if he didn't agree to that, there wouldn't be a plea."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,794.679,796.333,"Absolutely, Justice Souter."
2003.02-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,796.333,802.732,Do judges typically impose the higher penalty where there's been a plea.
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,816.107,822.505,"Well, the way it works right now in Washington, is that if the defendant enters a plea, there's a presentence report that goes to the judge."
2003.02-1632,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,844.88,856.026,"Are you saying that that hearing... you'd have to convene a jury specially... in this case it was a guilty plea, and the prosecutor was satisfied with 49, 53 months."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,890.121,899.742,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, certainly my case doesn't stand or fall on the fact that the judge is the one that did this hearing."
2003.02-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,915.346,916.711,"--That's right, he can turn down the deal."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,916.711,916.961,Yeah.
2003.02-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,916.961,922.367,"I mean, and does he only get the presentence report after the plea is accepted?"
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,923.936,925.506,"I think it varies, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.506,943.089,"Well, so long as he has it in front of him, before he rules on the plea, he can effectively achieve what Justice Ginsburg is concerned about by simply refusing to accept the plea, unless the defendant is willing to confess to one of the aggravating factors."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,943.089,944.369,"That's right, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-1632,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,944.369,946.433,So this moves the entire system.
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,990.317,996.094,"Well, I think that you're right that Apprendi works in plea bargaining, but with all due respect I'm not sure that I accept that doesn't work in--"
2003.02-1632,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,996.094,996.466,Okay.
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1019.767,1024.847,"--Well, Justice Breyer, the same thing happens for example when there's a lesser included offense in the case."
2003.02-1632,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1024.847,1029.592,"Of course it does, but they're very limited numbers and you can work with a few."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1036.94,1042.762,"Well, as I said, the typical situation in Washington is more like two or three aggravators."
2003.02-1632,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1070.216,1071.619,"You know, but I'm just curious."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1092.879,1100.104,"--Well, Justice Breyer, one other point is important here because, in many cases it's not going to be such a big problem."
2003.02-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1124.791,1129.538,I don't see the problem... I don't see the problem of challenging it.
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1136.597,1137.256,--That's correct.
2003.02-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.256,1142.996,"So the prosecution puts on one of the customers in the bank who says, you know, he was using a gun."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1165.575,1176.265,"Well, I think that's generally the case, and that's why I said it's just like what might happen for example in a lesser included case, when murder and manslaughter was charged and it was the defendant's position that it wasn't him."
2003.02-1632,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1176.887,1186.007,"Yeah, put on the witness that says I want to tell you... they say he hit her with a gun and your witness wants to say, oh no he only he brandished a gun, he didn't hit her."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1190.92,1191.458,Right.
2003.02-1632,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1193.232,1195.173,"Well, sometimes works, sometimes not?"
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1195.173,1195.545,--Right.
2003.02-1632,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.545,1199.51,"The bizarre thing about this, which of course I said I'm in the minority here."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1245.29,1253.835,"Well, Justice Breyer, I think the Constitution doesn't prevent Congress or any legislature at all from regularizing criminal sentencing."
2003.02-1632,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1253.835,1255.199,True.
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1255.199,1264.609,"Sentencing guideline systems are fine, and Apprendi says nothing about whether legislatures can come in, and regiment out and separate all the factors."
2003.02-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1278.521,1285.58,Transfer that whole... your rationale to the Federal system and you have the grand jury first indict us to the aggravators?
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1285.58,1290.288,Well--
2003.02-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1290.288,1290.743,Why not?
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1290.743,1294.829,"--Well, assuming the Federal system... if you're assuming the Federal system was covered by Apprendi."
2003.02-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1295.861,1300.941,"I'm saying, assuming we apply your rule to the Federal system, I don't know how we couldn't, quite frankly."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1304.656,1312.419,"--Well, to whatever extent a grand jury needs to charge aggravated crimes I think they would need to charge it and then apply--"
2003.02-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1312.419,1315.225,"Well, didn't Apprendi say that all the elements had to be charged?"
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1315.225,1316.339,--Yeah.
2003.02-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.738,1325.217,"Why don't you just say yes, what's so outrageous about that."
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1341.231,1344.369,"I'm stumbling over the grand jury because this is a state case, and not a Federal one."
2003.02-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1344.369,1344.658,Yes.
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1347.053,1347.442,Right.
2003.02-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1347.442,1351.983,Obviously we've never held the Seventh Amendment grand jury requirement applied to the state.
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1351.983,1353.203,Right.
2003.02-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1360.816,1365.629,It seems to me you're... you may not be defendant friendly in all instances.
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1389.862,1393.949,"--Well, it can, but I think it's important to look at the injustice in this case, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-1632,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1406.042,1415.867,"Well, the cap for the kidnaping I, was much higher, and judges so often when they see aggravating circumstances get close to whatever the cap is that they're applying."
2003.02-1632,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1417.065,1430.689,"--Mr. Fisher, if you're... if you are correct here, I suppose all 50 states have sentencing schemes that would fall as a result, isn't that right?"
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1430.689,1433.578,"By my study, Justice O'Connor, I don't think that is correct."
2003.02-1632,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1433.578,1435.519,Why not?
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1435.519,1439.151,"Well, there are only about 17 states that have guideline systems right now."
2003.02-1632,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1461.525,1466.149,Upsetting the systems for States does not seem to trouble us in other areas.
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1469.327,1479.812,"That's right, Justice Scalia, and obviously this Court has thought a lot about that issue already in the prior Apprendi case, as to what... what the effects of its rulings are going to be."
2003.02-1632,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1479.812,1485.674,I guess I'd be afraid the effect is going to be enshrine the plea bargaining system forever.
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1513.832,1514.153,I'll try.
2003.02-1632,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1514.153,1516.925,You agree that it's undemocratic?
2003.02-1632,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1516.925,1521.195,What is undemocratic... leaving it up to judges?
2003.02-1632,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.87,1542.106,"Very well, Mr. Fisher."
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,1545.699,1546.647,"You are, Your Honor."
2003.02-1632,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1664.297,1665.328,Excuse me.
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,1669.414,1669.886,--Not--
2003.02-1632,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.886,1673.335,"Just... you can give them up to 10 years, but if you want to give them two years, that's okay."
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,1674.328,1675.647,--That's exactly right.
2003.02-1632,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1756.35,1757.631,But may I ask you this.
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,1848.448,1855.879,"There is a fact component, but if we look only at the fact component, Justice Souter, we will be taking a very impoverished view of what this statute does."
2003.02-1632,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1883.743,1890.968,"But whatever it does select, they've got to be facts which at least would morally justify going above the ceiling."
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,1899.968,1901.083,I disagree with that.
2003.02-1632,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1901.083,1904.631,"Well, I don't think I understand what you're talking about."
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,1909.832,1910.454,Well--
2003.02-1632,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1910.454,1919.992,"Can he be reversed if there's nothing in the record that shows the fact... I mean he says I'm giving him another 10 years, because he used a gun."
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,1928.62,1929.28,--He could.
2003.02-1632,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.28,1929.856,Of course.
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,1932.252,1936.589,"No, I disagree with you, Judge, but he would be reversed for two reasons."
2003.02-1632,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.849,1952.276,"You call it an abuse of discretion, call it whatever you like."
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,1961.685,1964.081,Two... let me make two points about that.
2003.02-1632,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.92,1991.035,It wasn't pure whim.
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,2021.211,2025.176,"--Well, no particular fact is entitled... is required to be found."
2003.02-1632,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2025.798,2033.721,"No particular fact is entitled to be found, but a fact which the judge can select from among, but he has to select a fact."
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,2043.63,2061.751,"--That process that you're describing where the judge takes a look at the case... at the individual before him, and selects what facts are going to be relevant, and decides what weight to give them, and weighs that fact against competing interests in sentencing is exactly the kind of process that the judge went on... went through in Williams."
2003.02-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2066.831,2070.396,"Yes, but in Williams there was no intermediate level that he couldn't go above."
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,2085.527,2088.379,"--I disagree with that, very respectfully."
2003.02-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2088.379,2090.358,Without additional procedure before the judge?
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,2090.358,2093.951,There's always going to be an additional procedure before the judge.
2003.02-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2095.931,2100.1,Which require the judge to find a fact that had not been established previously.
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,2100.1,2101.958,Yes.
2003.02-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.182,2111.7,"But why not, if it increases the sentence by five years."
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,2113.846,2125.818,"--That is... it is alike only in the superficial sense, Justice Stevens, because you're... it ignores the process that leads to the selection of that fact and the way that fact is weighed, and the way it's used."
2003.02-1632,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2125.818,2127.304,But Martin... did Martin?
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,2161.112,2161.938,That's correct.
2003.02-1632,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.799,2190.257,"Whatever else he does, the fact is, you're being sent up the river for an additional three years, on the basis of a fact finding by a judge that more likely than not you were carrying a gun."
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,2195.542,2200.781,"--It... it's the same process, Justice Scalia, that you went through in Williams."
2003.02-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2207.718,2213.413,"But the legislature hadn't put an intermediate level on what he could do without the additional finding, which you have here."
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,2213.413,2214.034,--That's right.
2003.02-1632,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2232.155,2240.905,"But it is correct that that intermediate limit is something he cannot go above, unless he makes an additional finding of fact?"
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,2243.013,2243.606,That's true.
2003.02-1632,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2256.963,2268.398,"This is a pretty hefty... I mean if we look at it in practical terms, on the night of incarceration, this was 30 months added on, right?"
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,2270.506,2271.992,--That's correct.
2003.02-1632,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2283.675,2287.307,But he didn't plead to... he pled to kidnaping II.
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,2287.307,2298.264,"He pled and he was specifically told, Justice Ginsburg, that he could receive up to 10 years, and that the court had the right to go up to that amount if the court found aggravating circumstances."
2003.02-1632,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2392.053,2406.188,"Are there any states, or many states, where juries hear as many as 10 factors as part of their determination, and then make special findings in the matters?"
2003.02-1632,1,31216,john_knodell_iii,,2406.188,2411.828,"I don't know of any and I would suggest to Your Honor that that kind of a system is really impractical for a number of reasons, we take it."
2003.02-1632,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2444.437,2445.263,"I thank you, Mr. Knodell."
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2447.288,2454.225,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2469.54,2476.106,"Do you agree that the two standards together, that if this is invalid, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are invalid?"
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2476.106,2489.519,"Justice Scalia, the United States will argue if this Court applies Apprendi to the Washington guideline system, that it should not be further extended to the administrative guidelines that are created by the sentencing commission."
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2489.519,2492.574,"The answer is no, you don't agree."
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2492.574,2493.606,The answer is--
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2493.606,2498.602,You think it is possible to uphold the sentencing guidelines and yet find this to be unlawful.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2498.602,2504.546,--I think it's possible and the United States will certainly contend that this Court apply--
2003.02-1632,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2504.546,2506.875,But you don't mean it's easily... it's not--
2003.02-1632,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2506.875,2509.997,"--It is consistent with what we said in Apprendi, isn't it?"
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2509.997,2518.004,"--Well, there are some obstacles to it that the Court should be aware of before it concludes that Apprendi can easily be applied to Washington and not to the Federal guidelines."
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2537.777,2540.545,The sentencing commission is in the judicial branch.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2540.545,2543.479,For administrative purposes--
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2543.479,2546.739,That was a very important part of our opinion upholding the sentencing commission.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2549.711,2555.367,--The sentencing guidelines themselves are not self-operative.
2003.02-1632,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2570.682,2572.662,How are the members of the sentencing commission appointed?
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2572.662,2575.884,--They're appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2584.429,2587.029,But they are... the commission is in the judicial branch.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2590.744,2592.48,"--Well, certainly, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.48,2593.345,It is the judicial branch.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2593.345,2599.639,"The Court held it in the judicial branch but the question is, what status the guidelines have, not which branch the commission is in."
2003.02-1632,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2599.639,2601.247,So what is your distinction.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2669.961,2675.041,"Thank you for the lead in, Justice Breyer."
2003.02-1632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2704.595,2707.667,Not only that but the judge didn't even have to make any findings.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2710.828,2713.429,I think that that would probably have been reversed even at--
2003.02-1632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2713.429,2719.168,"I don't think so at that time, there was very little appellate review of sentencing on Williams that was decided."
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2719.168,2723.255,--Very little but sheer arbitrariness would probably not have sufficed even under Williams.
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2723.626,2727.341,"Well, he could be foolish enough to say that, you know I don't like the way you comb your hair."
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2730.314,2730.851,--What he did--
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2730.851,2731.966,He didn't have to give a reason.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2731.966,2734.566,--But what happened in fact in Williams is critical.
2003.02-1632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2755.66,2759.375,"Not only does he have wide open discretion, but he has no obligation to make those findings."
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2763.256,2777.291,"--But what the legislature expects, Justice Stevens, when it gives wide ranges to judges, is that they will exercise their discretion based on facts to sentence the most serious offenders at the top of the range and the least serious--"
2003.02-1632,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2777.291,2780.552,That's what they expect under sentencing guidelines and what they expect today.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2783.402,2811.925,"--Well, Justice Stevens, what I would submit to the Court is that when a legislature established a wide range, say, 10 to 30 years in prison for a particular offense, it expected that the judges that heard criminal cases would use their experience and discretion to take into account all of the circumstances of the offense and the offender and determine whether rehabilitation and retribution were properly served by a longer sentence, or a least harsh sentence."
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2818.984,2823.071,"But it wasn't just facts, you left a lot of discretion to the judge."
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2851.966,2852.438,--I--
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2852.438,2852.998,It's a different system.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2852.998,2866.001,"--I agree with that, and it was a large purpose of the sentencing guideline system to provide some centralization for the policy decisions that are made in sentencing to ensure uniformity, and proportionality."
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2891.059,2892.34,"Mr. Dreeben, just answer me this."
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2916.322,2916.944,--It means--
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2916.944,2927.262,What is the limitation upon the legislature's ability to require facts to be found and yet those facts not to be found by the jury.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2927.262,2937.377,"--It means, Justice Scalia, that the facts... that the legislature itself identifies as warranting the harsher punishment shall be found by the jury."
2003.02-1632,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3014.365,3018.74,Does that mean that the facts that are elements of the crime must be found by the jury.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3025.427,3040.166,"That is exactly right, and that is exactly what Washington purported to do when it said there are illustrative factors that we are going to put in a statute that replicate what we know judges have traditionally done, but we are not eliminating your discretion to find other facts."
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3043.139,3047.226,What determines whether a fact is... it's so facile it's a wonderful solution.
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3047.226,3050.198,What determines whether a fact is an element of the crime or not?
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3050.198,3051.274,--Precisely what you--
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3051.274,3054.368,"You get whacked another five years, another five years for it."
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3064.316,3065.142,--It's not a label.
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3114.554,3117.626,"But it used to... they have cabined it, judges can be reversed."
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3128.922,3129.21,They have cabined.
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3130.036,3130.202,It's reversible.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3130.202,3144.608,"Justice Scalia, but my point of the... the point of my hypothetical in which the legislature says to the sentencing judge, find facts, put the worse offenders at the top, apply the following three policies of sentencing."
2003.02-1632,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3148.035,3148.24,Okay.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3174.124,3174.124,That's right.
2003.02-1632,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3174.124,3174.95,Have I got the key?
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3174.95,3176.065,If the delegation--
2003.02-1632,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3176.065,3179.574,"Rephrase it, because I'm trying to get the precise key to what... to what it is."
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3184.282,3207.438,"--Well, Justice Breyer, if what the legislature does is say to the judge, here's a standard range, but you in the exercise of your discretion identifying whether a factor takes the case outside what the sentencing commission calls the heartland, what Washington calls the standard range, then in that event you may go up to what we have defined as the statutory maximum."
2003.02-1632,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3220.441,3223.142,Is that the nub of your argument?
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3241.701,3262.234,"That is what it boils down to, Justice Souter, because we're starting from a spectrum at which one end lies Williams versus New York, in which the Court fully accepted that it is entirely constitutional for a judge to say, in my courtroom if you commit a kidnaping and you engage in deliberate cruelty which I'm going to find by a preponderance of the evidence, you're going to get the maximum."
2003.02-1632,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3262.234,3262.417,All right.
2003.02-1632,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3292.865,3300.955,"I think that follows directly from Williams versus New York, and it's an additional reason why this Court should be very reluctant to apply Apprendi to sentencing guideline systems."
2003.02-1632,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3322.67,3325.642,I think you understated the prior... the prior system.
2003.02-1632,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3346.241,3348.47,"Thank you, Justice Scalia."
2003.02-1632,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3506.366,3355.9,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1632,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3507.563,3508.966,"Thank you, Mr. Fisher."
