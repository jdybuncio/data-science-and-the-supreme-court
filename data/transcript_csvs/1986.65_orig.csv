1986.65_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.388,"We will hear argument next in No. 65 Original, Texas versus New Mexico."
1986.65_orig,0,20248,charlotte_uram,,65.975,66.646,That's correct.
1986.65_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,99.116,102.646,I take it New Mexico accepts the determination of the shortage--
1986.65_orig,0,20248,charlotte_uram,,102.646,103.786,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.65_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,103.786,104.364,--or the shortfall?
1986.65_orig,0,20248,charlotte_uram,,104.364,109.065,"The master found that there were 340,000 acre feet departure."
1986.65_orig,1,39562,renea_hicks,,1920.719,1944.709,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think on the question of what New Mexico has termed retroactive relief, which is really giving Texas the water that it failed to deliver over all those years, the 1983 unanimous decision of this Court has already settled that question."
1986.65_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2023.978,2038.58,"Mr. Hicks, do you say that the master can and that this Court can consider the equities involved in ordering any relief by virtue of the shortfall?"
1986.65_orig,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2048.342,2052.418,"--I want to give the careful answer to that, and it is important."
1986.65_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2065.679,2067.148,What about the remedy stage?
1986.65_orig,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2067.148,2080.034,"Now, at the remedy stage I suppose that Texas could have tried to insist that it is our water, it has been determined that it is our water, deliver very bit of it right now in New Mexico."
1986.65_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2082.469,2094.277,"No, I am asking whether the Court in your view and the master have power to consider the equities in determining the remedies."
1986.65_orig,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2094.277,2097.26,Only to a limited extent.
1986.65_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2116.957,2117.332,There isn't that much water in the river.
1986.65_orig,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2117.332,2117.738,--Excuse me?
1986.65_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2117.738,2119.441,There isn't that much water in the river.
1986.65_orig,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2119.441,2125.424,"That's right, so to that extent the equities can be taken into account in ordering the relief."
1986.65_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2132.031,2165.283,"Well, I mean, let's suppose, and this isn't your situation, I guess, but let's suppose that we have existing, preexisting uses in New Mexico and land being farmed for many generations, and dependent upon the water, and we have land in Texas which has never received the water that it says it was entitled to receive, and it has no immediate consequence of a delay in receiving the shortfall."
1986.65_orig,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2173.094,2173.999,"No, I don't think so."
1986.65_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2173.999,2182.09,I would have thought we had some residual equitable power to be concerned about this.
1986.65_orig,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2182.09,2208.627,"In the courts... I think the only equitable considerations that the Court can give are realistically how much time should New Mexico be given to get this water down given the circumstances in the basin, and it isn't the individual economic circumstances of the people that live along the river, because you have to remember there used to be farmers in Texas farming this land."
1986.65_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2219.232,2224.793,"Up to a maximum of 10,000 acres ready to receive it, right?"
1986.65_orig,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2224.793,2231.759,"--They are ready to receive for the past, the payback, the debt, 34,000 acre feet a year."
1986.65_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2252.86,2257.39,How about monetary damages in lieu of water to make up the shortfall?
1986.65_orig,1,39562,renea_hicks,,2257.39,2259.779,--I don't think the compact allows that.
