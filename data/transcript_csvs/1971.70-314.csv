1971.70-314,0,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,96.613,99.613,It is not -- it's in the regular established place of business.
1971.70-314,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,131.403,135.598,"Mr. Kolisch, would you explain for me why it isn't important to my response?"
1971.70-314,0,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,136.216,146.586,"It -- it is not important in this case because there isn't any question that under the special venue statute, the defendant here is clear."
1971.70-314,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,188.346,192.796,What's the consequence of venue if your position is correct?

1971.70-314,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,199.449,204.247,"And therefore, it seems to me to cut the other way, there is very important in your case."
1971.70-314,0,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,204.247,214.956,"I thought you asked me, Mr. Justice Blackmun, whether or not if we had a regular and established place of business and whether or not we had committed acts of infringement here."
1971.70-314,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,240.359,250.323,"But the consequence of your position is that an American party in claiming infringement would be without any remedy, is that not correct?"
1971.70-314,0,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,250.323,257.666,It is possible at -- in certain limited situation and we're willing to assume it for the purposes of this case.
1971.70-314,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,305.577,311.776,"In each of those cases, Mr. Kolisch, if there was a district in the United States where they could have been sued, was there not?"

1971.70-314,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.74,1724.865,"Mr. Cross, you say that the Bowers case reasoning supports your construction of the Act of 1897."
1971.70-314,1,26725,harry_m_cross_jr,,1732.086,1740.93,"It's a statement of the case, statement of the history."
1971.70-314,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.3,1895.947,"That was the first time that -- isn't it, that dealt with by statute?"

1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,1998.08,2003.956,"The statement by this Court in Stonite, I think is -- is quite illuminating."
1971.70-314,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2114.17,2121.212,"If the Court knew it in -- at the time of Stonite, there was no occasion for the Court to pass under them because that wasn't -- that wasn't the fact before it."
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2121.212,2121.431,No.
1971.70-314,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2186.667,2192.508,And is there any -- is there any bills to clarify this situation that you know of?
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2192.508,2192.893,No.
1971.70-314,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2220.625,2220.713,"Well, if --"

1971.70-314,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2234.507,2238.52,And including alien patent cases.
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2238.52,2243.393,It cited the Sandusky case which was a case involving an alien.
1971.70-314,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.425,2246.198,And holding that you could sue an alien anywhere.
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2246.198,2246.49,Yes.
1971.70-314,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2246.49,2247.54,In a patent case.
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2247.54,2248.723,Yes.
1971.70-314,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2248.723,2257.259,And it says that 1391 (d) was intended to codify this rule.
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2257.259,2265.118,It says that 1391 (d) was intended to codify this and to resolve a conflict between the lower District Courts.
1971.70-314,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2267.304,2273.84,"Well, it resolved the conflict, alright, then -- and -- and resolved it in favor of letting the alien be sued anywhere."
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2273.84,2274.248,No.
1971.70-314,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.031,2280.341,But you said it resolved --
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2280.341,2292.72,"It simply codified the general venue statute which is -- you see there haven't -- with respect to alien, there haven't been any statute with respect to aliens that have been recognized judicially that an alien can be sued any place."
1971.70-314,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2292.72,2294.961,But you said they codified the judicial rule.
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2294.961,2296.875,The judicial rules that an alien generally could --
1971.70-314,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.875,2297.074,Yes.
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2297.074,2297.875,-- be sued any place.
1971.70-314,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.875,2298.59,Exactly.
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2298.59,2298.679,But not --
1971.70-314,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.679,2302.827,"-- but when -- but when they codified it, they cited a patent case against an alien."
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2302.827,2309.45,That patent case talks about general venue as well as patent and the other case is limited to general.
1971.70-314,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2316.15,2321.345,"Judge Mansfield, didn't -- probably have relied on the argument --"
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2321.345,2321.934,The revisors.
1971.70-314,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2321.934,2325.126,"-- argumentative lines suggested by my Brother White's question, did he not?"
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2325.126,2325.747,Yes.
1971.70-314,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2343.022,2346.559,Well maybe Sandusky was wrong but how about Congress?
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2346.559,2347.469,Congress never expressed --
1971.70-314,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.469,2364.238,"And the Congress might -- in -- in putting 1391 (d) on the books, I doubt if you'd been the reviser, if you hadn't intended to codify the result of Sandusky, you certainly wouldn't have cited Sandusky and even for the general proposition, would you?"
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2364.238,2371.538,"The way obviously in which this would have been done was an amendment to 1400 (b), defendants except aliens."
1971.70-314,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.584,2381.614,Right.

1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2386.809,2389.935,"So I think obviously, that's the case it would have been made."
1971.70-314,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2389.935,2390.05,Thank you --
1971.70-314,2,31275,j_pierre_kolisch,,2390.05,2390.964,Thank you.
1971.70-314,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2390.964,2391.823,-- Mr. Kolisch.
