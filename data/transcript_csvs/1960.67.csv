1960.67,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,23.837,"Number 67, Abraham Braunfeld et al., Appellants, versus Albert N. Brown, Commissioner of Police of the City of Philadelphia et al."
1960.67,0,43056,theodore_r_mann,,34.602,36.817,May it please the Court.
1960.67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,100.618,116.061,"Mr. Mann, before you proceed, as a matter of information is the observance of Sabbath day of the -- the Sabbath confined along those who profess the Jewish Faith to Orthodox Jews' don't -- conservative Jews also to --"
1960.67,0,43056,theodore_r_mann,,116.061,117.168,"Yes, sir."
1960.67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,124.58,126.087,Yes.
1960.67,0,43056,theodore_r_mann,,126.087,131.66,Conservative Judaism certainly is in pretty much the same category as Orthodox Judaism.
1960.67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,131.66,133.861,And perhaps some other branches of Judaism.
1960.67,0,43056,theodore_r_mann,,133.861,137.855,"Reform Judaism, perhaps it might be said to a lesser extent."
1960.67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,150.322,155.597,And did you -- do you know how many Orthodox Jews there are in Pennsylvania?
1960.67,0,43056,theodore_r_mann,,155.597,157.297,"In Pennsylvania, no, sir, I do not."
1960.67,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,387.878,390.658,(Inaudible) and numerically unimportant Jews in the (Inaudible)?
1960.67,0,43056,theodore_r_mann,,390.658,391.165,They are --
1960.67,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,391.165,393.154,And that --
1960.67,0,43056,theodore_r_mann,,393.154,395.515,"-- numerically unimportant, yes, sir, in the state of Pennsylvania."
1960.67,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,395.515,396.289,That is the Seventh Day Adventist.
1960.67,0,43056,theodore_r_mann,,396.289,398.593,Seventh Day Adventist and Seventh Day Baptist --
1960.67,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,398.593,398.839,Alright.
1960.67,0,43056,theodore_r_mann,,398.839,428.428,"-- in course of it [Laughs], but that is what accounts for the legislation in its present form permitting of no exceptions, not taking into consideration in the slightest degree the problems which this kind of legislation creates for these kinds of people and I submit that in such situations, aside from the First Amendment question, in such situations, the scope of this Court's judicial inquiry must be correspondingly greater."
1960.67,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,489.414,497.495,I suppose the recent elections prove that very small minority may have very big results.
1960.67,0,43056,theodore_r_mann,,497.495,503.995,I don't know that the recent election involved small minorities as small as the minorities involved in this case.
1960.67,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,503.995,509.384,"Well, I thought in some states, this is involving the smaller minorities."
1960.67,0,43056,theodore_r_mann,,509.384,512.609,"That will never be established to the satisfaction of anyone, I'm afraid."
1960.67,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,512.609,515.114,But it's just arithmetic.
1960.67,1,20567,david_berger,,2026.063,2030.095,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Honorable members of this Court."
1960.67,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2324.211,2328.411,Does Pennsylvania have like Massachusetts has a one-day-in-seven law?
1960.67,1,20567,david_berger,,2328.411,2329.026,"No, sir."
1960.67,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2796.585,2804.246,Any doubt -- and any doubt that the Fourteenth Amendment protects intrusions into religious freedom have any doubt.
1960.67,1,20567,david_berger,,2804.246,2805.442,"Well, Iâ€™ve been talking about that --"
1960.67,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2805.442,2807.341,"-- very specific, very different-"
1960.67,1,20567,david_berger,,2807.341,2807.815,I say --
1960.67,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2807.815,2810.608,It is important to keep in mind.
1960.67,1,20567,david_berger,,2810.608,2824.786,"Well, I have no doubt either, Mr. Justice Frankfurter but I say that there is no interference with the free exercise of religion as a result of Pennsylvania's Act of 1959."
1960.67,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2917.849,2921.295,"If that is the design, you would agree that it would be bad."
1960.67,1,20567,david_berger,,2921.295,2926.982,"I would have to agree if that were the design, sir, but that is not this case."
1960.67,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3087.657,3099.821,"You're not -- you're not suggesting that the discrimination or the interference or impact, whatever you call it, must affect the same -- the religious group as an entire group --"
1960.67,1,20567,david_berger,,3099.821,3100.288,I would suggest --
1960.67,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3100.288,3110.445,-- or that the body rather than -- than come within that religious groups who'll be called a religious troopers are affected.
1960.67,1,20567,david_berger,,3110.445,3132.281,"I am suggesting, Your Honor that where it becomes a matter of degree that where the impact is personal and dependent upon not the religion you observe but all of it -- of the kind of work you're doing, nonreligious work you're doing, that in that situation, I don't think this is kind of impact which the Court has in mind."
1960.67,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3211.818,3212.817,"Well, he -- excuse me --"
1960.67,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3212.817,3214.325,"Now, go on."
1960.67,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3214.325,3228.268,The -- the points you're making that this favors or rather that -- that this -- this harms more broadly and more largely people who are not of -- not Sabbatarians and who may indeed profess any religion.
1960.67,1,20567,david_berger,,3243.763,3243.888,We --
1960.67,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3243.888,3245.97,-- practice some other day of the week.
1960.67,1,20567,david_berger,,3245.97,3248.014,We have two answers to that.
1960.67,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3290.315,3296.221,"If you don't favor, Mr. Berger, do you favor in any -- in any natural use of that word."
1960.67,1,20567,david_berger,,3306.235,3306.459,"No, I don't."
1960.67,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3306.459,3308.309,You don't favor it -- to equalize matters.
1960.67,1,20567,david_berger,,3308.309,3308.987,That's right.
1960.67,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3369.241,3375.59,"Does your general Sunday statute be open, not this one, have any exemption in it?"
1960.67,1,20567,david_berger,,3375.59,3377.451,"No, sir, it does not."
1960.67,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3388.48,3389.436,Yes.
1960.67,1,20567,david_berger,,3389.436,3398.954,"Now, It is because of this analysis that we have concluded that, number one, there is no establishment of a religion at all."
