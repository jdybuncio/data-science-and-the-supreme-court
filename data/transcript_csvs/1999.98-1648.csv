1999.98-1648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.247,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-1648, Guy Mitchell v. Mary L. Helms."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,12.108,15.561,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,159.945,160.396,Mr. McConnell...
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,160.396,161.238,that this Court has laid down.
1999.98-1648,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.238,168.523,"the Fifth Circuit relied primarily on Meek and Wolman, I gather, in its decision."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,176.698,179.07,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't think that you actually have to overrule them."
1999.98-1648,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.997,206.438,"But, Mr. McConnell..."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,206.438,207.379,religious in nature.
1999.98-1648,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,207.379,210.992,that was contrary to fact because the public schools were getting those same benefits.
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,226.463,238.13,"Well, Your Honor, I'm not going to plead here for keeping Meek and Wolman alive, which I consider to have been decisions that have led to tremendous misunderstanding and mischief in this area and..."
1999.98-1648,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.13,257.473,"Indeed, you...  you probably would welcome the notion that if you have a statute that is narrowly directed to...  to religious schools, but which gives them nothing more than what is already given to public schools under another statute, that is not a...  that is not a statute that is narrowly targeted to religious schools."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,257.473,260.074,"Yes, I agree with you and Justice Ginsburg on that."
1999.98-1648,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,277.354,278.436,"Well, let me just ask you a question on that."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,287.122,293.746,"Your Honor, this statute does contain a supplement/ not supplant requirement which is enforced."
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,296.969,297.49,That's what I thought.
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,297.49,303.474,But we also do urge the Court to be...  not to treat that as a constitutional requirement.
1999.98-1648,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.51,318.435,"So, in your view, it would be perfectly constitutional for the...  in a neutral statute to say we will provide all the computers and all the desks for both public and private schools."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,318.435,319.016,"Well, no, Your Honor."
1999.98-1648,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,322.147,322.538,But that's the...
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,322.538,322.848,here.
1999.98-1648,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,322.848,325.729,"That's the place where your position would take us, wouldn't it?"
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,325.729,330.822,"Well, that's the place where some earlier decisions of this Court seem to take us...  take a reason..."
1999.98-1648,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,330.822,334.555,"Well, I'm...  I'm just asking you whether that's...  that's where your position would take us because..."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,334.555,334.936,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,347.114,350.995,I guess I'm...  I'm not sure what...  what your answer is to Justice Stevens.
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,360.492,362.535,That is our...  our submission.
1999.98-1648,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,362.535,362.874,Right.
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,362.874,366.175,"However, but even if it were, this stat...  this case would still come out..."
1999.98-1648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.175,366.466,"No, but let's...  let's..."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,366.466,367.487,as we say...
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,367.487,378.914,"Let's assume it is not a constitutionally required distinction and, therefore, at least in some categories of aid, there could be a complete supplantation..."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,378.914,379.896,Whether there could...
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,379.896,382.437,and I take it that is also your position.
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,382.437,387.53,"Whether there is a complete supplantation is another question, but whether there might be some degree..."
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,387.53,405.391,"Well, but if the distinction...  if the distinction is not required, then I presume there are certain categories of aid in which the government in effect or categories of supply to...  to sectarian schools that the government could take over completely without violating any constitutional norm."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,405.391,405.912,"Well, I..."
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,405.912,411.074,Maybe I don't understand what you say when you say the...  the distinction is not constitutionally required.
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,411.074,414.057,"Well, it...  it...  this is not, of course, an either/ or proposition."
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,428.506,429.167,"Well, that's what..."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,429.167,432.62,"On the other hand, a complete supplantation might present a different issue."
1999.98-1648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.62,444.759,"Well, what about a situation where the...  the county says, well, we're building a new public school and, just in...  to be neutral, we're going to build a new parochial school, too, at our expense?"
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,444.759,454.332,"Your Honor, first, I do...  I believe so much depends, Your Honor, upon the way a statute is designed, what its..."
1999.98-1648,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,454.332,454.673,"Well, could..."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,454.673,455.694,enforcement mechanisms are...
1999.98-1648,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,455.694,456.045,But why...
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,456.045,456.485,and so forth...
1999.98-1648,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,456.485,457.625,Why don't you...  could...  could you answer that question?
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,457.625,464.52,but I...  I strongly expect that the entanglement that would be entailed under such a program would be excessive.
1999.98-1648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,464.52,464.941,"Well, no, that..."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,464.941,466.29,So it's hard for me to imagine...
1999.98-1648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,466.29,466.781,Well...
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,466.781,467.452,that such a provision...
1999.98-1648,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,467.452,467.933,let's say...
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,467.933,468.163,be constitutional.
1999.98-1648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,468.163,476.759,there's...  we're not going to do anything until we turn this school...  the lock or the turnkey job on the school and that's it.
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,476.759,481.972,The...  the different...  may I explain the difference between that and this case?
1999.98-1648,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,481.972,482.573,"Well, I hope you will..."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,482.573,483.034,Because I think it will...
1999.98-1648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,483.034,483.752,get to an answer fairly soon.
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,483.752,485.304,"Well, I...  well, the answer is..."
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,485.304,485.575,The Chief Justice often...
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,485.575,486.125,I do believe that...
1999.98-1648,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,486.125,486.664,encourages counsel...
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,486.664,487.555,that would be...
1999.98-1648,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,487.555,489.077,to answer yes or no when they can and then explain.
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,489.077,497.993,"I do believe that would be unconstitutional, Your Honor, but it's hard to say for sure because it would depend to a certain extent upon the nature of the program."
1999.98-1648,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,497.993,504.746,"Well, then doesn't that mean that...  that supplant and supplement perhaps do play a role in...  in this doctrine?"
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,504.746,522.857,"It may very well play a role, but as an absolute rule, Your Honor, it would be...  it would...  as...  as...  if supplement/ not supplant meant that there could be no displacing of any expenditure, however small, that would be a...  a very damaging holding."
1999.98-1648,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,522.857,523.688,You're...  you're talking about...
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,523.688,524.049,At the other extreme...
1999.98-1648,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.049,527.001,supplementing...  everybody is talking about supplement and supplant as though that's an easy call.
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,548.944,551.627,"Your Honor, that is one of many problems."
1999.98-1648,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,560.413,561.805,"Yes, Mr. McConnell."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,561.805,562.095,and...  and a...
1999.98-1648,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,562.095,566.866,"It may be a very difficult line to draw, but I'm...  but I'm really seeking what is your limiting principle."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,577.935,578.444,"Well, the three..."
1999.98-1648,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,578.444,579.165,What is the limiting principle?
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,579.165,583.92,"The three criteria, and there's not...  neutrality is just one of the three criteria laid down in Agostini."
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,598.008,601.141,"But on the Chief Justice's question, every one of those criteria is satisfied."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,619.202,625.815,"Again, Your Honor, it may very well be that there are some limitations having to do with total supplantation..."
1999.98-1648,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,625.815,626.486,"Well, what are they?"
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,626.486,628.296,where the government provides the entire amount.
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,628.296,630.009,"That's Justice Stevens' question, and it's mine."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,631.598,637.733,"The facts of this case are so far from that, that they are not very useful and..."
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,637.733,644.568,"But we'd like to know what the principle is that we ought to bear in mind in...  in deciding all of these cases, and I want to know what yours is."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,644.568,657.257,"Your Honor, what I would recommend to you is that the...  is that the three principal criteria of Agostini be reaffirmed and that the lower courts be asked to evaluate specific..."
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,657.257,657.848,"No, but that does not..."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,657.848,659.22,statutes and circumstances.
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,659.22,680.414,"With respect, I don't think that answers our question because it seems to me that in answer to the question a moment ago, in referring to the three Agostini principles, you in effect came up with a scheme which would lead to the conclusion in the Chief Justice's hypothesis that building the school for the...  for the parochial school would be entirely constitutional."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,688.98,700.056,"Your Honor, as...  as the government assumes a larger and larger share of the...  of the expenses of the school, the entanglement problems grow exponentially because it..."
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,700.056,702.567,There is no entanglement problem in building that school.
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,704.62,711.005,The entanglement comes in the various conditions and limitations that are going to be attached to the use of the school.
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,711.005,714.256,"In the hypothesis, the government says here's the school, it's yours."
1999.98-1648,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,714.256,719.18,"Your Honor, the government has never simply said here is the school, it's yours."
1999.98-1648,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,719.18,722.271,"Maybe it hasn't, but the Chief Justice just did, and...  and that's...  that's the..."
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1077.564,1089.112,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1648,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1119.873,1124.766,"Well, you're...  you're...  when you speak of a requirement, Ms. Underwood, you're talking about a statutory..."
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1124.766,1124.936,Yes.
1999.98-1648,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1124.936,1125.376,requirement.
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1125.376,1125.717,Yes.
1999.98-1648,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.421,1136.943,But I understood you to...  your brief to take the position that this supplement/ supplanting distinction is constitutionally mandated.
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1136.943,1168.053,"The supplement-and-not-supplant distinction or something like it is...  I wouldn't say...  go so far as to say that it itself would always be constitutionally mandated, but it performs the function here of guaranteeing two things, guaranteeing...  helping to ensure two things: that the government aid doesn't go to the religious mission of the school and that the aid doesn't become so substantial as to in effect subsidize the whole operation of the school"
1999.98-1648,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1168.053,1169.595,"Well, why...  why would that be bad?"
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1224.149,1246.856,"Well, the constitutional problem that it would raise is the one that this Court has repeatedly recognized as the separate concern that when so much aid...  when the core functions of...  of a religious school are subsidized by the government, at some point it becomes impossible to say that it is only the secular function that is being supported, that the aid is..."
1999.98-1648,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1246.856,1249.567,"No, but in my hypothetical, the...  the state has tried to be careful about that."
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1272.942,1275.123,"Well, I..."
1999.98-1648,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1275.123,1275.914,Ms. Underwood...
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1275.914,1276.214,Yes.
1999.98-1648,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1276.214,1282.579,does that bring to mind perhaps this Court's holding in Ball on the Community Education Act?
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1284.422,1285.551,Yes.
1999.98-1648,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.174,1354.446,Is this sort of a mystic appearances problem?
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1355.676,1356.498,"Well, I don't think it's mystic."
1999.98-1648,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.302,1366.856,"The government is paying for the secular education, which is...  which is provided in the school."
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1366.856,1368.335,"Well, the government is paying..."
1999.98-1648,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.335,1371.477,It...  it has made a determination that it costs that much to provide it.
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1378.002,1394.001,The problem is that at some point while your...  while your hypothesis has the number of dollars being...  the dollars that the secular part of the education...  that would require overturning a long line of this Court's cases holding that the government can't directly...
1999.98-1648,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1394.001,1402.897,"I take it, the principle you're talking about...  you don't get in a sentence all of the gray areas and the gradations that you might be talking about."

1999.98-1648,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.323,1426.692,May I ask one question about the distinction?
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1441.482,1445.356,I think that's a...  a...  possibly a boundary question.
1999.98-1648,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1451.56,1452.392,Everybody should have a computer.
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1452.392,1452.692,Yes.
1999.98-1648,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1458.015,1474.844,"Ms. Underwood, I take it, in response to an earlier question, you spoke of secular materials, and just recently, you spoke of the need to monitor even materials that were...  were provided, which did not supplant."
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1496.31,1509.376,"Well, they present slightly different issues of monitoring, although, of course, even a textbook with preestablished content can be used by a teacher in a wide variety of ways, including religious ways."
1999.98-1648,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1509.376,1522.076,"But at...  at some...  basically, on the textbook theory, if we follow our prior cases, once the textbook has been screened as having no independently religious content, the government's interest in the textbook constitutionally is over."
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1525.348,1525.659,Yes.
1999.98-1648,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1525.659,1527.689,But that is not the case for the computer.
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1527.689,1528.921,That's correct.
1999.98-1648,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1528.921,1530.25,And the reason is?
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1530.25,1541.74,"The reason...  the reason is that, on the one hand, one could say that a computer is even more neutral than a textbook, it has no content of its own, and on the other hand, it is capable."
1999.98-1648,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1561.533,1563.092,And that's why the monitoring is required.
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1563.092,1563.593,That's correct.
1999.98-1648,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1563.593,1572.269,"Well, what if...  what if you have a lectern, you know, and you can put a secular book on it or you could put a very religious book on it?"
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1575.541,1590.41,"Well, I think if lecterns were provided with Title 6 funds, there...  I mean, there might well be a restriction that they not be used in the theology classroom or, for that matter, the pulpit of the chapel when...  when worship services were engaged in."
1999.98-1648,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1590.41,1593.843,"Well, isn't the lectern in effect like the general bricks and mortar prohibition?"
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1601.818,1630.205,"Yes, although a lectern, not being the whole school, but something that's used in an individual class, one could imagine putting a lectern in the chemistry lab and having it be part of the...  the furnishing of a chemistry lab that was more elaborate than the school had previously been able to or inclined to undertake and...  and be subject to the restrictions that are imposed on those facilities, those..."
1999.98-1648,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1630.205,1646.458,"Does the government feel that the jurisprudence here would be helped if we started developing, more or less, hard-and-fast categories, like no bricks and mortar and, hence, no lecterns and no desks, but textbooks are okay and maybe other books are okay?"
1999.98-1648,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1652.491,1654.723,"Well, it might be helpful."
1999.98-1648,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.021,1685.513,"Thank you, Ms. Underwood."
1999.98-1648,2,34114,lee_boothby,,1688.946,1694.349,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1648,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1741.43,1749.204,Would you give me an example of some supplementation that you think is appropriate under the First Amendment?
1999.98-1648,2,34114,lee_boothby,,1749.204,1763.024,"I think in the Agostini case, that represents an example where, as the Court clearly pointed out, the Chapter 1 program was a supplemental program."
1999.98-1648,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1803.28,1813.806,"Well, the Court has allowed the furnishing of textbooks to students, even though those students...  to all students, public and private and parochial, right?"
1999.98-1648,2,34114,lee_boothby,,1813.806,1815.118,That...  that is...
1999.98-1648,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1815.118,1815.649,You would accept that...
1999.98-1648,2,34114,lee_boothby,,1815.649,1816.109,Yes.
1999.98-1648,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1816.109,1818.871,or is that...  does that violate the Constitution?
1999.98-1648,2,34114,lee_boothby,,1818.871,1819.439,"No, I..."
1999.98-1648,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1819.439,1820.24,Was that decision wrong?
1999.98-1648,2,34114,lee_boothby,,1820.24,1821.773,"No, I don't think so."
1999.98-1648,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1866.45,1867.05,"Well, it's fair...  it's fair..."
1999.98-1648,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.05,1867.411,"Well, yeah."

1999.98-1648,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1912.16,1913.121,What about textbooks?
1999.98-1648,2,34114,lee_boothby,,1923.007,1923.768,No.
1999.98-1648,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.768,1925.809,The schools didn't have textbooks before?
1999.98-1648,2,34114,lee_boothby,,1925.809,1926.58,No.

1999.98-1648,2,34114,lee_boothby,,1930.253,1936.648,"Well, when I went to parochial school, I had to buy my textbooks, and so it was a cost either to either myself and my parent."
1999.98-1648,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1936.648,1942.852,"Well, everybody who goes to parochial school has to pony up the money to...  for the school and...  and tuition."
1999.98-1648,2,34114,lee_boothby,,1944.572,1976.592,"As I understand, for instance, in...  in the Zobrest case, the question was there as to whether the...  the government funding relieved the school of a cost they would otherwise have to assume and with reference...  as...  as you've just indicated, Justice Scalia, when you went to...  to the parochial school, you had to pony up with the amount of money that was necessary in order to provide the textbooks."
1999.98-1648,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1981.896,1982.457,I see.
1999.98-1648,2,34114,lee_boothby,,1982.457,1999.917,"It was...  it was direct aid to...  to the parent, and I...  and I think the supplement-and-not-supplant requirement that's in Chapter 2 is just another way of saying that we will not give direct aid to the school, but it is permissible to give aid directly to the parent."
1999.98-1648,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2001.289,2001.81,"Well, what is it?"
1999.98-1648,2,34114,lee_boothby,,2030.109,2032.08,"Well, I would respectfully disagree with that."

1999.98-1648,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2129.174,2133.347,Did that make the point that the parents were paying for the textbooks?
1999.98-1648,2,34114,lee_boothby,,2133.347,2140.851,"Well, the point was made in Cochran that it...  it...  it did not relieve the school of a cost of otherwise educating the student."
1999.98-1648,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2144.433,2147.094,How about the cases that have come after Allen?

1999.98-1648,2,34114,lee_boothby,,2168.22,2189.984,I understand the termto mean generally the same thing as...  as...  as Your Honor indicated in the Zobrest case that it did not relieve the school of a cost that they would otherwise have to bear in...  in the education...  the core education of the...  of the students that were in...

1999.98-1648,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2245.353,2247.053,"Well, then you must be doing it school by school."

1999.98-1648,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2256.509,2256.9,I can see that.
