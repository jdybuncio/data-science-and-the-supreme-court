1981.80-327,0,19154,c_clark_hodgson_jr,,14.008,40.156,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, my client's petition to this Court raises for review the question of whether or not taxpayers who are unable to meet the criteria of Flast against Cohen and any other Article III decision of this Court will nonetheless be able to challenge the transfer of federal surplus property."
1981.80-327,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1139.117,1182.396,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I agree with Mr. Hodgson that there probably are other plaintiffs who could bring the suit in this case, but it is correct, as he also pointed out, that this Court in Schlesinger said that the lack of a better plaintiff does not mean that this plaintiff has standing, and indeed it is worthy of note that in the companion case, United States versus Richardson, this Court went one step further, and said that the fact that there is not a plaintiff who has standing in the traditional Article III sense is a good indication that it is the kind of case that ought to be left to the political branches of government rather than to the judiciary."
1981.80-327,2,34114,lee_boothby,,2078.234,2103.782,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I believe that this is the first opportunity which this Court has had to address the question of standing as it impacts on the establishment clause since the landmark decision which had been discussed here of Flast versus Cohen some 13 years ago."
1981.80-327,3,19154,c_clark_hodgson_jr,,4560.407,4569.68,"You seem to be positing the existence of a free exercise injury in fact, Article III, and I would say yes."
