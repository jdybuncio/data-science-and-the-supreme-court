1964.491,0,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,0.0,9.83,-- of Section 305 of the Postal Service and Public Employees Salary Act of 1962.
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,1781.938,1785.193,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.491,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1934.768,1937.992,"Mr. General, so you admit that the National Security felt that --"
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,1937.992,1946.726,The matter was reviewed by the National Security of Council and it concluded that the statute serves no useful purpose.
1964.491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1990.518,1992.323,So that was an amendment to what?
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,1992.323,1997.968,To the pay-raise bill.
1964.491,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1997.968,2000.048,Which one?
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2000.048,2002.179,The one that we all finally got Your Honor.
1964.491,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2002.179,2002.433,Oh.
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2002.433,2011.925,I do not make excuse of it Your Honor.
1964.491,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2084.623,2086.397,"What did you say, that was all authored by?"
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2086.397,2093.728,"The ori -- the -- it stemmed from a bill originally offered by Senator Butler of Maryland, I think."
1964.491,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2105.042,2107.239,Thank you.
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2107.239,2111.483,Ultimately there -- went through the Congress.
1964.491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2176.052,2185.251,"But if a speech reprinted in the Time were put in a letter form in Russia and sent here that would be “communist propaganda”, isn't it?"
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2185.251,2189.611,If it were printed in pamphlets form so that it's not sealed.
1964.491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2189.611,2191.24,Although it appeared in the New York Times.
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2191.24,2195.382,"That would be treated as ""communist political propagandas""."
1964.491,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2397.21,2397.734,How will the man know --
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2397.734,2398.288,I --
1964.491,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2398.288,2405.124,How will the man know whether he's on the list that the Postmaster General thinks he ought to look at this mail?
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2405.124,2408.776,I don't suppose he would.
1964.491,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2412.636,2416.305,I am talking about -- I'm talking abut this mail.
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2416.305,2417.906,"Well, you're talking about the mail that as --"
1964.491,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2417.906,2418.246,(Voice Overlap)
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2418.246,2420.826,The man I described as bookseller sends this out.
1964.491,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2420.826,2426.587,"Mail that's sent to him like I get all the time that I never ask for, some of it are never wanted."
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2433.077,2433.608,No.
1964.491,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2450.425,2450.513,"Yes, but --"
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2450.513,2465.517,I was saying that the Postmaster General or has on occasion made spot checks of the matter deposited in the mails by such a person to see whether he was obliged to provide Section 305 to it.
1964.491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2465.517,2480.226,"Well, does that mean, for example if John Jones had addressed to him a box of a thousand pamphlets with a communist manifesto from Moscow, it might be that the Post Office would see how many of those he dropped in the mail, is that it?"
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2480.226,2486.37,It might be that the Customs Bureau would discover that John Jones was getting a great deal of this.
1964.491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2486.37,2487.316,Yes.
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2487.316,2500.278,"And it might then say to the Post Office, “John Jones is getting a great deal of foreign communist propaganda, you would better see whether Section 305 applies to it”."
1964.491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2505.378,2507.249,Apply it to what he is mailing.
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2507.249,2508.649,Might look at what he is mailing --
1964.491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2508.649,2509.05,Yes.
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2509.05,2510.84,-- and then apply the steps of the statute.
1964.491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2510.84,2511.818,Yes.
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2511.818,2515.37,His mail would -- what he deposits would go into the mail.
1964.491,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2577.031,2579.405,Are you going to tell us why?
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2579.405,2585.462,"Because I think that the foreign -- well, I have to face up the question of the rights of the recipients."
1964.491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2594.711,2594.747,"Well, any --"
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2594.747,2599.317,"So I say, I have to face the problem with the rights of the recipients and I intend to do it."
1964.491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2599.317,2612.002,But what I meant was you're going to say why that this same kind of law couldn't be constitutionally applied to people in this country who want to send this same politic -- “communist propaganda” inside the country.
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2612.002,2612.181,Oh!
1964.491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2624.483,2624.844,And the other --
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2624.844,2626.008,When he is abroad.
1964.491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2626.008,2633.169,"Do I understand yet on his mail on behalf of the Hanoi Government from South Vietnam, it's not screened?"
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2633.169,2637.357,At the present time the South Vietnam may not be --
1964.491,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2637.357,2637.731,It's being screened.
1964.491,1,15704,archibald_cox,,2637.731,2639.492,-- screened.
1964.491,2,36133,marshall_w_krause,,5506.691,5507.77,May it please the Court.
1964.491,3,34199,leonard_b_boudin,,7351.547,7353.344,May it please the Court.
