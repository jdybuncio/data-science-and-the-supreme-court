2002.01-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,8.032,"We'll now hear argument in our first case, Number 1209, the Boeing Company against the United States."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,8.838,13.16,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,88.155,90.883,"Where do you... do you get that proposition in the statute, Mr. Geller?"
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,90.883,94.59,"Justice Scalia, we get it out of two separate statutory provisions."
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,97.68,98.837,Where are these to be found?
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,98.837,103.667,These are... this is found on page 27a of the appendix to the petition.
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,144.666,153.138,"I... I suppose that... that R&D expenses have to be attributed in a lot of other instances under the code, don't they?"
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,165.947,167.181,Yes.
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.976,176.174,"Well, why is that?"
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,177.352,177.515,"--Well, as I hope to--"
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,177.515,182.493,"--okay elsewhere to... to produce this result, but not okay here to produce this result?"
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,182.493,202.156,"--Because it... the DISC provisions are unique in a number of respects, one of which it allows the taxpayer to engage in a particular grouping of transactions, and the... the... as we'll talk about in a few minutes, the R&D regulations insist that R&D be attributed in a way that disregards the particular groupings that the taxpayer has selected."
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,236.784,238.311,Where... where did Congress say that?
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,238.311,244.239,"Congress said that in the reports of the House, of the tax-writing committee."
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.239,247.953,"Just for my benefit, when it's in the statute, would you say Congress said it."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,250.957,251.652,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,251.652,254.187,"Because when you say Congress said it, I thought you mean it's in the statute."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,254.187,255.774,"Well, it's not in the statute."
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,278.574,281.745,And I'm sure everybody who voted for that knew about those statements.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,281.745,291.148,"--Your Honor, these were specific statements that went to the heart of the issue that's before the Court today, and we've quoted them at page 22 of our brief, the blue brief."
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,295.143,297.442,The committee said.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,298.557,301.337,"--The committee reports said... excuse me, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,317.344,328.817,But... but why does 861 get you out of the general allocation provisions any more than 994 does?
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,346.01,346.175,Yes.
2002.01-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,346.175,349.976,"But the regs that we're talking about, which the Government relies on, are under 861."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,349.976,358.539,"Yes, but the... the regulation, Justice Kennedy, that the Government relies on was added to 861 after the DISC regulations were finalized."
2002.01-1209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,389.188,391.562,"Mr. Geller, there's one problem."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,405.249,405.881,--Yes.
2002.01-1209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,405.881,408.683,That... that's Boeing's creation.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,434.453,436.922,"Not... not quite, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.01-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,501.459,503.646,"Mr. Geller, can I ask you a factual question that will help me understand?"
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,508.681,508.864,No.
2002.01-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,510.051,517.796,"So that what difference would it make whether it was the 747 program, or the 727 program if the DISC sells them both anyway?"
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,517.796,533.29,"Because, Justice Stevens, under the statute, combined taxable income or export income is... is to be determined on the basis of product groupings, or at least, the taxpayer has the option of choosing to group by different products rather than by all the sales of the DISC."
2002.01-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,572.927,581.586,"But, of course, the converse, I suppose under your view, all of the R&D would go to the domestic corporation because it all takes place before the product is put on the market."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,581.586,582.335,No.
2002.01-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,595.282,595.403,Right.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,595.403,601.803,"And nonetheless, the regulations are quite clear that the deductions have to be allocated to that class of gross income."
2002.01-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,624.497,627.534,"Well, what... what do you say to at least this argument of the Government?"
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,716.166,719.211,"Well, Justice Souter, you've described the Government's position."
2002.01-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,726.05,728.6,"Well, there's... there's... certainly there is some degree of deference here."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,728.6,729.541,There is some degree of reasonableness.
2002.01-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,729.541,730.436,We can argue whether it's Chevron or not.
2002.01-1209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,730.436,733.139,It was a notice and comment regulation.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,733.139,735.265,"It was, but it was promulgated under section 7805."
2002.01-1209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,741.69,746.017,But you... if it's... whether you call it... if you call it an interpretive regulation--
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,746.017,746.154,--Yes.
2002.01-1209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,746.154,748.514,--it still deserves some respect from a court--
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,748.514,748.704,Yes.
2002.01-1209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,748.704,749.22,--does it not?
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,749.22,753.342,"Yes, it does but it has to be consistent, obviously, with the legislative scheme that it's interpreting."
2002.01-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,770.846,771.452,Sure they do.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,771.452,771.81,--It--
2002.01-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,771.81,777.138,"But the most precise way to match it, I... I would suppose, is the capitalization way."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,785.812,796.429,"--Well, I don't accept... they can't capitalize it, Your Honor, because Congress made a judgment in section 174 of the code in order to encourage R&D to allow it to be immediately deducted in the year in which it's incurred."
2002.01-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,796.429,796.902,Absolutely.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,804.02,806.38,"Yes, but the Government's regulation here is not close at all."
2002.01-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,817.124,819.283,"Well, sometimes... sometimes they do and sometimes they don't."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,828.203,829.345,"--Well, look at what the 8(e)(3) regulation does, Your Honor."
2002.01-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,851.448,853.837,"Well, here... may... may I interrupt you with this question?"
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,853.837,853.963,Sure.
2002.01-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,853.963,856.083,You say it has no relation whatsoever.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,882.725,882.859,Yes.
2002.01-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,919.974,920.616,"Oh, you've got to show the relationship--"
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,920.616,921.953,"Yes, factual relationship."
2002.01-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,921.953,927.125,--but it doesn't follow from that that there is no benefit to product lines outside of that relationship.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,927.125,936.143,"Yes, but if there... there could well be a spill-over benefit to future product lines, but that doesn't, A, mean that it's not directly and factually related a specific current program."
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,961.611,962.164,That's so.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,990.332,990.663,861.
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,990.663,994.296,"861, which is for allocation of all kinds of things--"
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,994.296,994.555,Well--
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,994.555,996.59,"--for Puerto Rico, to abroad, et cetera."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,998.227,998.984,--But--
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,998.984,1015.603,"And lo and behold, what they did in 861, after DISC was passed, is they changed the 861 rules, and in those changed rules, it says you're going to allocate everything to a SIC category called transportation services."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1021.685,1021.983,--Yes.
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1021.983,1022.355,All right?
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1024.194,1025.239,That's... that is the--
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1025.239,1025.417,All right.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1028.126,1028.359,--What's legally--
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1028.359,1031.938,"--since Congress told them to use 861, and here they're using it."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1031.938,1034.323,"--Well... well, there are a number of things wrong with that, Justice Breyer."
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1056.284,1056.737,That's right.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1069.636,1070.102,"Oh, absolutely."
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1070.857,1070.98,--for everything.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1074.979,1075.575,"No, no, no."
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1079.061,1080.888,So you're saying DISC has to be different.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1080.888,1082.54,"--I'm saying DISC is different, Justice Breyer."
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1082.54,1083.021,"Okay, what in--"
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1083.021,1083.992,"And let me explain, if I could--"
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1083.992,1084.141,--Yes.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1084.93,1085.079,--why DISC is different.
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1085.079,1085.802,--That's... we are.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1085.989,1088.239,DISC is different because... for two reasons.
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1157.721,1159.998,I'll assume the example was identical.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1159.998,1161.094,--It is identical.
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1161.094,1162.445,And I will take your words that you have just said.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1162.445,1162.994,Yes.
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1162.994,1174.307,And I will ask you why a different person quoting those words couldn't make the identical argument in respect to the tremendous tax advantages given to Puerto Rico--
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1174.307,1175.453,Because--
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1175.453,1183.4,--or in respect to the supreme importance of having allocation between Europe and the United States among subsidiaries--
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1183.4,1185.335,--You'd have to look... you'd have to look--
2002.01-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1185.335,1185.944,--and principal corporations be accurate.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1185.944,1187.72,--You'd have to look at those statutes.
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1228.974,1230.651,"Yes, but that doesn't mean when... you say in accordance with 861."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1233.025,1234.192,--Yes.
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.192,1236.232,"--861 as it may be amended from... or, you know--"
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1236.232,1236.357,I--
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.357,1239.588,--as it may be interpreted from time to time by... by--
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1239.588,1239.984,--Not... not--
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1239.984,1240.818,--by Treasury?
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1240.818,1251.065,"--I believe, Justice Scalia, not if an aberrational... not if a rule could be put in several years later that's inconsistent with the rules that the tax-writing committees and that the Treasury Department assumed--"
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.065,1251.195,But that--
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1251.195,1252.636,--would be the 861 rules.
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.636,1253.645,--That's a different argument.
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1254.088,1255.165,That excepts--
2002.01-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.165,1263.132,"--What I'm saying is it doesn't seem to me, even if you believed in... in legislative history, you can't rely on the fact that they say it's going to be done pursuant to 861."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1265.945,1266.436,--But not pursuant to the rules.
2002.01-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1285.398,1306.628,"If you... if you want me to say that a regulation drawn after a statute was enacted, another statute, is... is invalid because the intervening statute is... is applicable instead, what... what case do I cite, or what rule?"
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1312.179,1312.322,--It is.
2002.01-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1394.956,1398.369,"Now... now, perhaps you can help me here because this is a complicated statute."
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1415.003,1416.148,"Yes, that's the Government's argument."
2002.01-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1428.123,1429.102,And where... where does it say that?
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1429.102,1443.135,"--It says it in the language that I just read to you, that the... all... that the costs deductible in a taxable year shall be allocated to the items of gross income resulting from such grouping."
2002.01-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1447.671,1447.945,"Where were you reading from, Mr. Geller?"

2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1466.095,1466.422,That's right.
2002.01-1209,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1466.422,1466.898,Correct?
2002.01-1209,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1466.898,1468.139,"That's exactly right, Justice O'Connor."
2002.01-1209,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1468.139,1473.608,And this is how Treasury initially thought the DISC scheme should be--

2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1725.395,1727.454,--No.
2002.01-1209,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1756.917,1776.007,"Well, this is kind of simplistic, but it does seem that in... in the 1970s, Congress wanted to encourage exports, and to do that, they thought they should make some income tax advantages for companies producing products for export."
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1812.559,1814.946,"Oh, clearly that's not the case."

2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1974.557,1977.361,--It's 33 of the petition appendix.

2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2046.906,2048.253,You take the gross receipts for that group--
2002.01-1209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2048.253,2048.496,--and you subtract the costs.
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2048.496,2049.972,--and then you allocate costs--
2002.01-1209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2049.972,2050.264,Yes.
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2050.264,2051.005,--under 861.
2002.01-1209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.005,2051.15,Right.
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2052.706,2052.878,Right.
2002.01-1209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2052.878,2054.116,So we go to 861--
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2054.116,2054.364,Right.
2002.01-1209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2054.364,2063.447,"--and he says, now, if you look at 861, and try to allocate according to 861 to the group that they've picked out, it's seriously nuts, basically."

2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2188.929,2189.237,--No--
2002.01-1209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2189.237,2191.846,"But he says, you know, sometimes it is clear."
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2219.385,2229.681,"--The... a reason why the regulation is reasonable is because if, as I have just said, the statutory default cases... you can apply it against all income."

2002.01-1209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2366.951,2370.487,Where does the statute say you could just apply it across the board?
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2378.258,2385.329,"I'm talking about section 861, which is at page 26a of the petition appendix."

2002.01-1209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2408.562,2414.669,"Well, his argument is that it can... that... that the research on fish can definitely be allocated to fish."
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2414.669,2421.299,"If... if it's currently deducted, it cannot be definitely allocated to an item of income."
2002.01-1209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.902,2449.26,It says item or class of gross income.
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2449.26,2449.476,--Right.
2002.01-1209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2449.476,2451.402,What is... what is class of gross income?
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2451.402,2457.843,"Well, for example, if they group products, they... they group all the sales of Boeing 707s."
2002.01-1209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.518,2465.844,For that year.
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2465.844,2466.362,--and they share--
2002.01-1209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2466.362,2467.585,You're saying it has to be that year.

2002.01-1209,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.667,2538.569,"But isn't it true, just going back to Justice O'Connor's thought, that... that the consequence... the Government's position is that all research and development cost gets allocated to the DISC when you're in a business like they are?"
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2538.569,2552.815,"I think that's... I don't understand the factual context of that statement, but the... the answer is all research costs, like every other type of cost gets charged against the income... against foreign sales income to the extent that--"

2002.01-1209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.26,2597.703,If... if the DISC is 25 percent of its sales--
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2597.703,2598.147,--If all--
2002.01-1209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2598.147,2599.593,--25 percent of its R&D--
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2599.593,2599.801,--Correct.
2002.01-1209,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2622.073,2629.281,"--What are the... just out of curiosity, what are the rough proportions of... of overseas and domestic sales?"
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2629.281,2640.057,"I believe the record says something like two-thirds of Boeing's sales during this whole 10-year period were overseas and, therefore, I assume, made through the DISC."
2002.01-1209,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2640.057,2659.71,"But just as a housekeeping matter, if Boeing were to prevail here, would it still be open for the Government to say, well, all right, you can allocate along your product lines, but the Blue Sky portion still has to be greatly increased?"
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2659.71,2662.861,"You mean, would it be open at this stage--"
2002.01-1209,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2662.861,2663.021,I think I've got the right color.
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2664.889,2665.478,--Yes.
2002.01-1209,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2666.28,2667.612,And that was about some 20 percent.

2002.01-1209,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2697.063,2710.948,"Mr. Jones, I thought... maybe I'm confused, but I thought the Government's position was Blue Sky, product-specific... this is R&D and we treat R&D a certain way and we don't buy into that line, which is set by the company."
2002.01-1209,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2710.948,2726.022,"Oh, I agree completely, but... but I understood Justice Kennedy to be saying that if the Court adopted Boeing's approach, would there then be a factual question about what part... whether the Blue Sky amount was accurately described in the record."
