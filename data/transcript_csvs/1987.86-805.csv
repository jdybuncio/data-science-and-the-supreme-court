1987.86-805,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.609,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 86-805, Billy J. B.J.> [""] Pinter v. Maurice Dahl."
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,13.12,15.491,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,291.282,297.146,"Mr. Sparks, was the legal prospectus the one that would have pertained to the transaction that gave rise to this suit?"
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,297.146,298.506,"The record does not say, Your Honor."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,298.506,300.398,Do you contend that it was?
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,300.398,301.107,Sir?
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,301.107,304.99,Are we supposed to draw that inference from what you are telling us?
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,304.99,319.929,"The only inference that I would like the Court to draw is that Mr. Dahl was aware of the need to draw a prospectus in becoming involved in the oil and gas business, and had hired Mr. Minor for that purpose, and fired him when he discovered that he had spent $10,000 in that way."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,387.454,391.036,You mean he introduced him to his former employee?
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,391.036,400.023,"Mr. Kirk, the new employee, introduced Mr. Dahl, his employer, to Mr. Pinter, an oil man, who was in the Oklahoma oil and gas business."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,400.023,401.044,"Oh, I misunderstood you."
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,404.186,405.305,"No, sir."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,405.305,406.206,I am sorry.
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,408.268,411.21,Mr. Kirk was working for Mr. Dahl.
1987.86-805,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,609.619,616.405,"When you say blank investment contracts, Mr. Sparks, do you mean that the contracts were all written out but unsigned?"
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,616.405,617.063,"No, sir."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,638.297,640.798,"While you are interrupted, Mr. Sparks."
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,640.798,641.239,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,641.239,646.472,"This transaction with Mr. Gottsch, the first half that you described, was Gottsch one of the Plaintiffs?"
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,646.472,648.114,"No, sir, he did not sue."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,664.986,667.636,What does that have to do with the claims of the eleven other people?
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,667.636,675.813,The only importance that Mr. Gottsch has is that I believe that it is very fair to say that Mr. Dahl solicited Mr. Gottsch.
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,675.813,677.654,Maybe he solicited a lot of people.
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,681.226,688.8,"Well, to me, sir, it is circumstantial evidence of Mr. Dahl's solicitor type behavior."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,714.886,715.307,Yes.
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,724.624,725.125,"No, sir."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,733.18,742.736,"Supposedly you proved that he committed an egregious violation with respect to Mr. Gottsch, would that be a defense that Mr. Pinter could assert in the claim?"
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,742.736,745.949,"It would be evidentiary of his conduct in pari delicto; yes, sir."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,826.89,832.644,"May I ask, you are only claiming in pari delicto insofar as the claim by Dahl against Pinter?"
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,832.644,833.104,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,833.104,838.347,You are not claiming that it has any bearing on the claims of the other eleven or right to contribution or anything like that?
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,838.347,843.332,We did not appeal with regard to 12(1) violations as to the others.
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.367,857.782,"What is the statutory basis, or is a state law basis, for your contribution claim?"
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,857.782,864.587,"The securities laws, Your Honor, Section 11, for example, provides for a right of contribution between joint tort feasors."
1987.86-805,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,864.587,866.517,That is because he is a seller?
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,866.517,867.867,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-805,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,867.867,870.819,"You claim that he is a seller, and therefore a joint tort feasor with Pinter?"
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,870.819,872.311,"That is correct; yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-805,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,876.274,883.076,And the Court of Appeals rejected your claim that he was a seller?
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,883.076,884.028,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-805,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,895.956,897.676,And both issues are here?
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,897.676,898.427,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-805,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,905.263,907.403,But what?
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,907.403,918.089,"But that he was not motivated by a desire for pecuniary benefit directly or indirectly, which seems to me to fall right in the face of the Dirks opinion which talks about representational benefit at the very least."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.973,1108.365,"Mr. Sparks, I am sorry to interrupt you again."
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,1114.459,1118.142,"It is a Section 12 lawsuit from the standpoint of the Plaintiffs; yes, sir."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.142,1122.253,"Section 11 applies to misstatements in prospectuses, does it not?"
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,1122.253,1124.446,Section 12.2.
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.446,1129.579,"Section 12 is where you have no registration at all, is it not?"
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,1129.579,1130.628,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.628,1133.801,"So the contribution right does not apply to this case, does it?"
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,1133.801,1135.413,"I believe that it does, Your Honor."
1987.86-805,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.377,1147.171,Has any court so held in a Section 12 case?
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,1147.171,1150.113,"No, Your Honor, no court has so held in a Section 12 case."
1987.86-805,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1173.207,1186.406,"Of course, Mr. Sparks, I thought that both the District Court and the Fifth Circuit determined that Mr. Dahl lacked any sort of pecuniary gain motivation."
1987.86-805,0,18042,braden_w_sparks,,1186.406,1188.798,"No, Your Honor, that is not correct."
1987.86-805,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1207.449,1209.892,"Thank you, Mr. Sparks."
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1211.672,1223.6,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1286.952,1316.352,"Mr. Taranto, suppose the primary Defendant here, suppose Mr. Pinter, were a philanthropist, and it were shown that he really did not expect to make any profit from this stock, but just to benefit his friends and associates that he was selling their interests in the wells, would that be enough to exempt him from liability under 12(1)?"
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1316.352,1317.521,"No, I do not think so."
1987.86-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1323.585,1325.525,"No, but he comes under the same language."
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1339.416,1358.237,"Well, the financial interest test does not go to the in pari delicto defense, but it goes only to whether a person other than the person passing title can also be a seller, and therefore conceivably liable to the other people that he solicits."
1987.86-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.237,1364.641,"I understand that, but that is the first step to establishing the in pari delicto defense."
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1374.339,1386.687,We think that Section 12 is firmly rooted in the common law remedy of rescission where financial interest does not play a role as to the person who passes title.
1987.86-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1454.861,1459.274,"But that it not necessary, you say, to align Pinter on the selling side?"
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1459.274,1459.885,No.
1987.86-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1486.041,1486.652,That is the key then.
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1502.243,1504.103,"Yes, I think that is right."
1987.86-805,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1504.103,1506.595,Even if you are an agent of somebody else?
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1506.595,1522.206,"If you are an agent for the seller, there is very likely to be some kind of interest of your own, presumably a continuing relationship with the seller, if you are carrying on the activities for the seller."
1987.86-805,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1522.206,1530.67,"Supposing the person holding title is an agent of someone else just for the purpose of holding title, and he passes it when he is told to by his principal?"
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1530.67,1540.277,It sounds to me as though... I am somewhat confused by who exactly is passing title in the course of that transaction.
1987.86-805,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.277,1545.911,"Whoever is holding title passes title, and supposing that the person holding title is an agent for that purpose for somebody else?"
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1545.911,1553.315,I think that anybody who is the holder of title before--
1987.86-805,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.315,1554.076,Who passes title is the seller.
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1554.076,1555.578,"--is a seller, that is right."
1987.86-805,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.108,1559.069,If I can ask one other question about the seller.
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1570.655,1572.357,"--Oh, yes, absolutely."
1987.86-805,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1572.357,1579.622,And is it also not possible that he could be a seller and nevertheless the claim of contribution would fail?
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1579.622,1580.623,Yes.
1987.86-805,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1580.623,1583.605,So it may be true that we do not have to decide the seller issue?
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1583.605,1585.185,That is right.
1987.86-805,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1599.196,1613.885,"Do you also think, Mr. Taranto, that the District Court and the Fifth Circuit did not make the necessary determination about the pecuniary interests that Dahl might have had?"
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1613.885,1615.165,"Yes, we do."
1987.86-805,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1634.98,1637.992,So you think that we need to remand on that?
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1637.992,1638.843,"Yes, we do."
1987.86-805,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1638.843,1643.846,And that means that we have to also address the merits of the contribution issue?
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1643.846,1648.677,"Well, it seems to us that that issue has not been briefed."
1987.86-805,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1678.968,1682.431,"Mr. Taranto, would you do one more thing because your time is short."
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1688.885,1692.556,The difference I think is really one of emphasis.
1987.86-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1739.079,1743.84,You mean on the whole and not necessarily to these particular Plaintiffs?
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1743.84,1744.441,That is right.
1987.86-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.757,1770.067,But you would not say in the colloquy that was going between counsel and Justice Stevens that the offering to someone who was not one of the Plaintiffs here is merely confirmatory or circumstantial evidence of the necessary qualification?
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1770.067,1774.001,We think that that could be evidence of--
1987.86-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.001,1774.772,Direct evidence.
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1774.772,1776.622,--Direct evidence of a promoter role.
1987.86-805,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1776.622,1778.094,May I ask one more question.
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1805.361,1821.592,I think that without factual findings by the District Court made in the light of a broad enough understanding of what kinds of financial interests can qualify for this test to align him on the selling side of the transaction that further findings should be made.
1987.86-805,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.809,1840.594,"Mr. Taranto, I do take it that you disagree with the Court of Appeals on the standard to be applied in determining the in pari delicto defense?"
1987.86-805,1,40639,richard_g_taranto,,1840.594,1841.064,Yes.
1987.86-805,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.499,1849.98,Thank you.
1987.86-805,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.98,1852.571,"Thank you, Mr. Taranto."
1987.86-805,2,32768,john_a_spinuzzi,,1855.353,1861.257,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2193.495,2196.317,What did the Court of Appeals find on this point?
1987.86-805,2,32768,john_a_spinuzzi,,2196.317,2197.987,--It made no finding whatsoever on that.
1987.86-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2197.987,2207.564,"Did not its opinion assume, it seems to me, did it not appear to assume that he was a substantial factor?"
1987.86-805,2,32768,john_a_spinuzzi,,2207.564,2209.246,"Yes, sir, it did."
1987.86-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2216.67,2218.149,I understand that.
1987.86-805,2,32768,john_a_spinuzzi,,2220.532,2224.634,"No, I am not challenging the Court of Appeals, but I am challenging their precedent, yes."
1987.86-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2328.543,2329.835,I do not understand what you are saying.
1987.86-805,2,32768,john_a_spinuzzi,,2337.669,2339.472,Mr. Dahl is not liable.
1987.86-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2347.086,2352.629,"What would make Dahl liable in your view, does he have to be the actual seller who transfers title?"
1987.86-805,2,32768,john_a_spinuzzi,,2352.629,2354.041,That would be one.
1987.86-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2356.001,2357.643,"I am sure that would, but what else?"
1987.86-805,2,32768,john_a_spinuzzi,,2357.643,2359.545,I think that there are other situations.
1987.86-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2406.145,2414.271,"And that is the only thing that the language, offers or sells, that the word offers brings in beyond the transfer of title?"
1987.86-805,2,32768,john_a_spinuzzi,,2414.271,2415.792,It does not really quite say that either.
1987.86-805,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2434.685,2437.147,And the offerer is liable to nobody?
1987.86-805,2,32768,john_a_spinuzzi,,2437.147,2440.168,"It does not say that specifically in the statute, no."
1987.86-805,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2560.157,2569.292,"Mr. Spinuzzi, what is Mr. Dahl's account of why he did all of this, just to get his friends in on this good deal?"
1987.86-805,2,32768,john_a_spinuzzi,,2569.292,2571.543,"--Yes, sir, it really was."
1987.86-805,3,18042,braden_w_sparks,,3331.446,3335.07,May it please the Court:
1987.86-805,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3408.318,3411.92,"Thank you, Mr. Sparks."
