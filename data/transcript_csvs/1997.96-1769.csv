1997.96-1769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.887,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 96-1769, the Ohio Adult Parole Authority v. Woodard."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,10.387,14.245,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,66.645,69.738,"Well, let me ask you something, Mr. Klatt."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,100.523,103.473,I believe there would be a limit under that--
1997.96-1769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,103.473,104.348,So what we have to decide--
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,104.348,105.066,--There would be an equal--
1997.96-1769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,105.066,107.909,"--is, what are the limits, and how do we draw that line."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,107.909,109.128,--Yes.
1997.96-1769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,109.128,118.233,"So you do concede that there would be some equal protection concerns, certainly, constitutionally imposed?"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,118.233,133.07,"Yes, Your Honor, we do concede that, not rational basis equal protection, but certainly a suspect category, perhaps even a substantive due process problem in an outrageous circumstance."
1997.96-1769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,133.07,141.552,"The court of appeals here, as I understand it, based its ruling on the Due Process Clause, not the Equal Protection Clause, is that correct?"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,141.552,142.676,That is correct.
1997.96-1769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.676,148.08,"I don't see... what difference would that make, what clause you're proceeding under?"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,148.08,155.031,"Your Honor, I don't believe it would make a difference in terms of equal protection, rational basis and due process."
1997.96-1769,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,183.19,202.341,"Mr. Klatt, are you then saying that what... there may be some process due, but whatever process due it has been allowed, or are you taking the position that due process, as distinguished from equal protection, your answer to Justice O'Connor, due process doesn't enter into it?"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,235.686,249.992,"Your Honor, our position is that fundamentally, because there is no underlying life, liberty, or property interest, that a Governor could make a clemency decision in an arbitrary manner."
1997.96-1769,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,280.481,286.992,"So it could be totally arbitrary as long as it's not a denial, so you're saying there is an equal protection check but not a due process check, is that--"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,286.992,287.258,--Yes.
1997.96-1769,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,289.975,315.388,"--Then it does matter on your analysis that, although the State... although there is no... in your judgment, although there is no life interest to be protected, and although the State is not obligated to give any clemency consideration at all, it still does not matter on your analysis that the State has chosen to do it, that that does not implicate a due process concern."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,315.388,328.709,"It does not implicate it on these facts for the simple reason that Ohio, in enacting the power, did not in any way create standards or criteria that limit the discretion of the decisionmaker."
1997.96-1769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,328.709,331.1,"Well, that's certainly what Dumschat held, wasn't it?"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,331.1,337.066,"That's exactly what Dumschat held, Your Honor, and it's a case that we rely very heavily on."
1997.96-1769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,345.516,355.372,"And the answer that the respondents give is that they say because this is a death penalty it is necessarily a part of the criminal process, and Dumschat was not."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,357.557,397.918,"They, of course, make a number of arguments, Your Honor, but that is one of them, and I believe the argument is flawed for the simple reason that the Court in Dumschat, relying I think principally on the Greenholtz analysis, basically said that if the interest that was at issue... and in that case I admit it was a liberty interest, not a life interest, but I don't think that matters, because what the Court was saying is, if the interest that was at issue was contemplated and encompassed in the underlying conviction and sentence, that that interest has been adequately safeguarded, and--"
1997.96-1769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,397.918,413.442,"Now, suppose... and I suppose it's not too unimaginable a hypothetical... that the clemency authorities said that you may not consult counsel in preparation for your clemency hearing."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,413.442,428.513,"--Well, I think that would... it sounds as if you're asking a straight right to counsel question."
1997.96-1769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,428.513,428.966,Yes.
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,431.231,435.511,"It would be I think just under the Sixth Amendment, which of course is not at issue in this case."
1997.96-1769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,451.301,459.282,"Well, but in my hypothetical he has a counsel but he's forbidden to consult the counsel in preparing his written submission to the clemency board."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,459.282,464.78,"I don't believe that would violate due process, because there is no underlying--"
1997.96-1769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,464.78,466.747,"Well, would it violate any provision of the Constitution?"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,466.747,470.59,--It potentially could violate the Sixth Amendment.
1997.96-1769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,473.479,482.07,"Well, of course, now the Sixth Amendment is applicable to the States via the Fourteenth, and then you're right back into the question of having to have a life, liberty or property interest."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,483.163,486.303,It certainly is a life interest here.
1997.96-1769,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,505.122,519.274,"Does it follow from your argument that there is no due process implication to the provision of direct appeals in criminal cases, no due process implication in providing the cert process that we do?"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,519.274,522.991,"I don't believe that does follow, Your Honor."
1997.96-1769,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,530.222,544.201,"Oh, I will grant... I'll grant you that, but what I was picking up on was the statement you made ago in one of your answers, I guess, to Justice Kennedy, that the interest being protected had been protected in the underlying proceeding."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,573.564,576.156,"If I implied that, I misspoke."
1997.96-1769,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,602.364,607.801,"Right, but on your theory why shouldn't the due process stop at the conviction?"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,607.801,616.719,--Because the other processes are part of the system for adjudicating the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
1997.96-1769,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,617.499,618.905,"So the adjudication's not final, in other words."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,618.905,619.187,--Correct.
1997.96-1769,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,619.749,632.76,"Then under your position, as I understand it, a State could totally abolish appeal and say after the trial court proceedings are over whether or not the man will be sentenced or executed should be left entirely to the unbridled discretion of the Governor."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,632.76,633.65,Yes.
1997.96-1769,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,633.65,634.213,They could do that.
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,634.213,634.65,Yes.
1997.96-1769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,634.65,638.274,"That's certainly consistent with the reasoning in Evitts, is it not, that--"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,638.274,638.665,I believe--
1997.96-1769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,638.665,646.084,"--you can't block an appeal from an indigent if the State provides one, but the State under Durston v. King doesn't have to provide one."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,646.084,648.457,"--I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,648.723,659.312,"And if there's anything that seems harsh about that, I suppose it is the deprivation of the appeal, not the deprivation of additional procedures in the pardon."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,659.312,660.78,"--I would agree, Your Honor."
1997.96-1769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,681.788,691.754,"Well, we have said in cases such as the Herrera case, in talking about the finality of habeas corpus, that there is always clemency."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,695.063,724.442,"Well, I would contend, Your Honor, that simply acknowledging the existence of a power of another branch of Government does not, in and of itself, make it part of the process, and in fact, as I mentioned earlier, as a matter of constitutional structure, clemency is one of the checks and balances that we believe exists, certainly under Ohio's constitution, that is an executive branch's check on the judicial system."
1997.96-1769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,730.533,750.947,"Well, Mr. Klatt, in Dumschat this Court's opinion said that unlike probation pardon and commutation decisions have not traditionally been the business of the courts and, as such, they're rarely subjects for judicial review."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,792.15,801.739,"Well, I certainly would hope that you wouldn't, but I believe that Ohio's death penalty clemency procedure in this case would survive such scrutiny."
1997.96-1769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,801.739,807.486,Are you going to address the allegations with any particularity or specificity in giving me that answer?
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,807.486,809.876,I'd be certainly happy to.
1997.96-1769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,860.356,863.731,"I didn't quite... was the stay application, a request for a stay--"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,863.731,864.525,--Of the execution--
1997.96-1769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,864.525,866.978,"--of the execution by the Governor, so that the--"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,866.978,867.572,--No.
1997.96-1769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,867.572,869.728,"--clemency process could take place, or it was just--"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,869.728,870.446,I'm sorry--
1997.96-1769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,870.446,873.101,--a collateral... additional collateral attack on the conviction?
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,873.101,881.893,"--It was a stay obtained in the Sixth Circuit, a stay of execution so that he could pursue Federal habeas."
1997.96-1769,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,885.329,915.442,"The problem that I'm having is, this case is in an interlocutory posture, and so looking at the opinion, I thought perhaps the circuit has just held that the Due Process Clause could, in some conceivable circumstance, be violated, and can we say now that we could never even imagine a circumstance, so matter how bizarre or peculiar or unfair the system was, that it couldn't possibly be a violation no matter what, and the same, really, in a sense is true of the Fifth Amendment part."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,938.73,956.191,"Well, it's our position, Your Honor, and we are taking an absolute position, that with respect to due process there is no due process protections that apply here for the simple reason, as I stated earlier, that there is no underlying life, liberty, or property interest to--"
1997.96-1769,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,956.191,964.564,I suppose we could put the same kind of questions if you were arguing about the executive power to appoint or to... in the Federal context to recognize a foreign nation.
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,969.64,972.014,"--Some power, some delegation of power is absolute."
1997.96-1769,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,974.028,987.696,"Mr. Klatt, I thought that that was one of the arguments that you made, but in your first exchange with Justice O'Connor you said yes, there'd be an equal protection check, so I was thinking that your argument was kind of like a, what's labeled political question."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1011.248,1013.606,--I may have misspoke.
1997.96-1769,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1018.635,1029.756,"But if you're using the political question doctrine, that model, it isn't that as to one clause or as to another clause, it's even... it's a First Amendment violation, whatever."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1032.769,1041.345,"--We're not going quite that far, because we have acknowledged that there might be some outrageous circumstance where there could be--"
1997.96-1769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1041.345,1041.891,What is outrageous?
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1060.774,1061.165,--No.
1997.96-1769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.165,1069.896,"And if we can't intervene in that case, I suppose we can look to see if they are identical circumstances, so the ball game's over."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1083.188,1085.937,I'd be happy to respond--
1997.96-1769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1085.937,1088.733,Don't you think that if you give away the Equal Protection Clause--
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1089.749,1110.24,"--It's the position of the State of Ohio that since the clemency power comes from the constitution, at least the Ohio constitution, in Ohio, that it can't violate another expressed provision of the Constitution, and the only one I can think of would be a racebased decision."
1997.96-1769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1111.725,1124.469,"Why, because that is currently a very enraging thing, but why is that any more enraging than two identically qualified people, and the Governor says, I like this guy, you get it, you don't get it?"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1125.516,1137.464,"--Well, even in Dumschat the Court seemed to indicate that you could deny clemency for any reason or no reason at all for any constitutionally permissible reason."
1997.96-1769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1149.35,1159.97,"So, supposing the Governor has complete control over the use of the Ohio State stadium for the Ohio StateMichigan game, and he decides that only white people will be admitted for that game."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1171.076,1179.557,"I believe it would, and that's I think our essential point, and I don't think quite frankly from a practical standpoint it's that much of a concession."
1997.96-1769,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1188.71,1205.467,"It's easy enough if you limit it to race alone, but once you say you're entitled to equal treatment, why isn't he entitled to come to the court and say, look, just last year somebody was pardoned who has, you know, exactly the same qual... or no better qualifications?"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1211.512,1216.089,"Well, certainly, race is not the only basis, but the--"
1997.96-1769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1216.089,1225.179,"Well, I guess if it's a racebased discrimination we apply heightened scrutiny to it, and if it's not, you have a totally different standard, wouldn't you say?"
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1237.471,1239.658,"--That would be intermediate scrutiny, which would be higher."
1997.96-1769,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.658,1243.75,"We could review his pardoning power on such a challenge, you would agree."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1243.75,1247.216,"That, I think, is a very close question."
1997.96-1769,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1248.044,1251.231,You want to have it both ways on almost every hypothetical.
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1267.834,1268.553,"--That's exactly it, Your Honor."
1997.96-1769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1268.553,1284.233,"And your argument as I understood it was that once there has been a final adjudication through the appellate process which has resulted in a judgment that this individual should lose his life, that there is no life interest left for the Due Proces Clause to protect."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1289.168,1289.527,Yes.
1997.96-1769,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1289.527,1315.58,"So that if we disagree with you on that, if we say, for example, well, clemency really is part of the adjudicatory process, or if we were to say, well, if you grant a clemency proceeding you've got to have some minimal process for it, you would lose, but at least you would lose because we were rejecting that absolutist analysis as being sufficient, but that's still consistent, I think, with your position on equal protection."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1315.58,1318.048,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1318.048,1321.515,"Well, Mr. Klatt, you never have answered my question."
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1340.523,1343.008,"Correct, and I didn't--"
1997.96-1769,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1343.008,1343.725,--clemency hearing.
1997.96-1769,0,45199,william_a_klatt,,1353.55,1359.11,--I believe we would win even if there were some level of due process protection.
1997.96-1769,1,42151,s_adele_shank,,1585.69,1590.938,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1769,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1606.29,1613.772,"Well, we deal, Ms. Shank, don't we, with the facts that were alleged with respect to the Ohio parole, Ohio clemency process."
1997.96-1769,1,42151,s_adele_shank,,1624.018,1637.637,"We are bound by what's in the pleadings and by the process as it appears in the record, Your Honor, and if I understand your question, I think you're asking if the Court can make a decision on those facts alone."
1997.96-1769,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1637.637,1661.081,"Well, the... I got the intimation, perhaps mistakenly, from your statement that if we could conceive of some clemency process somewhere that had some sort of provisions in it that would be so arbitrary we would say due process applies, we should bring that to bear on this case, but we're dealing with an established system of clemency in Ohio, are we not?"
1997.96-1769,1,42151,s_adele_shank,,1661.081,1673.78,"And I agree, it has to be some process that you can conceive within the procedure that is present here, but I think there are many such conceivable fact situations that may or may not be able to be proved on remand."
1997.96-1769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.78,1690.226,But I thought the remand was limited to whether the district court could find that the coercion to confess guilt was an unconstitutional condition.
1997.96-1769,1,42151,s_adele_shank,,1690.226,1690.897,"Your Honor, that--"
1997.96-1769,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1690.897,1698.629,"Wasn't that what the remand was limited to, or was it remanded for the district court to come up with any other due process violation?"
1997.96-1769,1,42151,s_adele_shank,,1698.629,1712.858,"--Well, it was remanded with respect to both the Sixth Circuit's analysis of Evitts v. Lucey and the idea that clemency is, in fact, as it is, an integral part of Ohio's criminal justice system as well as on the Fifth Amendment issue."
1997.96-1769,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1733.521,1741.58,"Well, I would assume we at least have to look at the facts alleged in this complaint, not some conceivable set of facts from somebody else."
1997.96-1769,1,42151,s_adele_shank,,1741.58,1742.674,"--Again, Justice O'Connor--"
1997.96-1769,2,45199,william_a_klatt,,3328.238,3329.283,Thank you.
1997.96-1769,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3353.196,3361.754,Suppose it was very clear that silence would be not only an adverse inference but would likely result in denial of clemency.
1997.96-1769,2,45199,william_a_klatt,,3361.754,3365.628,You might have compulsion under those circumstances.
1997.96-1769,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3366.799,3382.23,"What if the... I don't know if she wants this argument, but the strongest point, I thought, going back to the complaint, would be a Mathews v. Eldridge point, that all she wants is you to postpone this hearing until it's 45 days before the real execution, and you won't do it."
1997.96-1769,2,45199,william_a_klatt,,3421.528,3430.399,"Well, I would respectfully disagree, that there is a very important, legitimate State interest in the timing of obtaining the information."
1997.96-1769,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3434.616,3449.171,"--Sure there is, but everybody else, everybody without a stay it's 45 days before, it's before the real execution, so what's your interest in getting that information 6 months before the execution, where all that's happened is that there's been a court order delaying it for 6 months."
1997.96-1769,2,45199,william_a_klatt,,3449.171,3454.655,"--Well, if I understand your question, I don't know that the State would have an interest at that point--"
1997.96-1769,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3454.655,3469.945,"Here they ask... they pointed out, they enclose, attached to the complaint, the court order of Ohio making the execution date not 45 days after September 9, but sometime after the following January 18, and still the board, they say, wouldn't postpone the hearing."
1997.96-1769,2,45199,william_a_klatt,,3471.242,3472.086,--That's correct.
1997.96-1769,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3486.845,3494.56,I suppose for Mathews v. Eldridge to apply there has to be some protected interest under the Due Process Clause in the first place.
1997.96-1769,2,45199,william_a_klatt,,3494.56,3497.996,"Absolutely, and fundamentally--"
1997.96-1769,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3497.996,3499.079,"Thank you, Mr. Klatt."
