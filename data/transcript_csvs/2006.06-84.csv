2006.06-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.778,"We'll hear argument first this morning in 06-84, Safeco Insurance Company versus Burr, and 06-100, GEICO General Insurance Company versus Edo."
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,12.871,16.401,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.147,143.678,"Well, it's also used in the phrase ""knowing and willfully""."
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,154.422,157.531,"Well, it actually says ""willfully and knowingly #""--"
2006.06-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,157.531,162.965,"In one formulation or another, but it combines the two words, knowing and willful."
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,162.965,178.929,"--Well, this Court, though, has held that willfully and knowingly, when that phrase is used together, it's been discussed in a number of cases including Dixon recently, that it means... willfully means knowledge that the conduct violates the law, and knowingly means knowledge of the relevant facts."
2006.06-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,184.801,186.112,You mean willfully alone?
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,186.112,187.456,--It--
2006.06-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,187.456,195.827,"Where... where it... where it means what you think it means, which is knowingly, that does not mean knowing the facts?"
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,204.964,214.024,"--Your Honor, in Ratzlaf, the phrase was willfully, not willfully and knowingly, and the Court held that it meant that you knew that your conduct violated the law."
2006.06-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,235.186,250.946,"So that if you're the CEO of your company, and a lawyer... Federal counsel comes in and says we've got a real issue under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I need to brief you on that, we need to make an important decision about whether we are complying, you say I don't want to hear about it, I don't want to know about it."
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,253.914,265.502,"--Well, under... some cases have suggested that there could be a willful blindness instruction that would govern whether you define that as knowing or not."
2006.06-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,266.002,267.954,So it doesn't have to be actual knowledge?
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,267.954,277.513,"--I think that the best reading of knowingly is actual knowledge or something that is, that is everything but, you know, that really is--"
2006.06-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,277.513,278.42,How about reckless disregard?
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,278.42,301.238,"--Well, conscious disregard is a recklessness standard, and even if the Ninth Circuit correctly determined that this should be interpreted as a recklessness standard, this Court has defined recklessness to mean that it has to be conscious disregard, actual knowledge of a high risk of, of... of harm or in this case illegality."
2006.06-84,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,318.277,329.056,"Since the term knowingly or knowing appears in two places in 1681n, can't we infer from that that willfully in that provision also means something different?"
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,329.056,336.036,"--I think the way it's used, it says knowing, knowingly that they did not have a permissible purpose."
2006.06-84,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,343.533,345.719,I thought the statute says what the permissible purposes are.
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,345.719,353.435,"--It does, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the individual knew precisely what the statute said."
2006.06-84,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,410.194,426.938,"Would you say it's all right to use the model penal code definition of reckless, which is basically what you... taking it here, you would have to consciously disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the action is unlawful?"
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,426.938,428.155,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-84,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,428.155,434.324,"If you come across anything that would use that, I mean ""reckless"" itself is unclear."
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,440.431,448.475,"But I think you can look to the way this Court described recklessness in Farmer vs. Brennan as well, though, as well as--"
2006.06-84,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,448.475,448.788,What's the difference?
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,448.788,450.928,"--The difference is just, there is two forms of recklessness."
2006.06-84,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,487.303,489.818,"Well, you said there is no way they couldn't have been conscious of the risk here."
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,494.848,495.598,The question is--
2006.06-84,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,495.598,499.253,"But consciousness, I mean, maybe it should come in in the standard, but I don't know that that would help you."
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,499.253,505.689,"--I think the issue of conscious... the risk, though, it has to be a high risk."
2006.06-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.192,539.518,Suppose there is a fair ground for believing it was lawful.
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,550.342,554.388,"--I don't, I don't think so, Your Honor, if, in fact, it was a fair ground for--"
2006.06-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.388,555.856,But I think I'm violating.
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,555.856,557.965,--I don't... yes.
2006.06-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.008,565.195,I'm a better lawyer than my advisors.
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,566.008,572.255,"--Your Honor, I think if it's an area where the law is truly unsettled."
2006.06-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,612.911,617.549,Would you look to the subjective intent of the actor at all?
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,617.549,618.346,Only--
2006.06-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.346,628.701,"Or would you just look to the outcome and say, well, you know, it was a close question, so even if the actor indeed thought he was in violation, it was a close question; it's okay?"
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,628.701,640.213,"--I don't think you would look at the intent until you found that there... there was no reasonable ground or at least no, no... no fair ground for debate about the question."
2006.06-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,649.646,655.299,"I must say that... that is not the normal meaning of willful, willfully violating the law."
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,655.299,656.705,"Well, I think in Screws--"
2006.06-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,656.705,662.782,"You're changing it to mean willfully, willfully and blatantly violating the law."
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,662.782,664.061,--I don't think so.
2006.06-84,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,664.061,670.247,"I mean, if I know that what I'm doing is in violation of the law, even if it's a close question, it seems to me I am willfully violating the law."
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,670.247,672.247,"Your Honor, Screws says you can't know the unknowable."
2006.06-84,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,697.188,698.767,Is it really billions?
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,702.499,705.81,--I believe that there are two certified class actions.
2006.06-84,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,713.838,727.958,"Would you, would you, as representative of the insurers, would you have a sound objection to class action certification in these cases?"
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,727.958,733.237,"--Your Honor, I'm sure there would be some bases to resist."
2006.06-84,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,736.829,738.125,"And gone to, gone to judgment?"
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,738.125,776.422,"--I do not believe any have gone to judgment, but I don't, I don't... I think that the point is that if you allow a thousand dollar penalty or the potential for a thousand dollar penalty for every consumer who didn't get a notice, simply because they may have gotten a better price if they had even better credit, across the country, if you interpret the statute that way, and then you can say you can get this thousand dollar, what is in essence a penalty, and you multiply that by the number of consumers, then you certainly have the potential for very, very substantial liability."
2006.06-84,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,776.422,781.749,"It's a question how many will sue for a thousand dollars, given the litigation costs."
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,781.749,792.62,"Well, given that these are proceeding as class actions, the answer is there is plenty on the line to incentivize plaintiffs' attorneys to bring these class actions, and they have been brought, and this is a class action."
2006.06-84,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,794.118,796.351,"They haven't... neither has been certified, has it?"
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,796.351,796.929,"No, it has not."
2006.06-84,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,816.703,822.263,"I have just two, two questions on, on willful and then... because you may want to talk about the other issue in the case."
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,835.43,836.04,--Well--
2006.06-84,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,836.04,843.755,"We find all the time that a right is not clearly established under AEDPA, and so forth... and disregard what I just said."
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,855.578,863.215,"--Except Screws, Your Honor, actually says that it was adopting a criminal recklessness standard, not a knowing standard, but a reckless standard."
2006.06-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,936.545,940.841,"Well, just because an issue is one of first impression doesn't mean there's a high degree of uncertainty."
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,944.277,945.448,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2006.06-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,945.448,945.87,First impression.
2006.06-84,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,945.87,955.366,"It certainly... this Court has made clear that if the language of the statute is very plain, then, of course, that can be noticed, that can be adequate warning."
2006.06-84,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,978.403,979.716,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,992.726,996.162,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-84,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1045.438,1047.734,It is a subjective standard or an objective standard?
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1047.734,1050.186,--It has both in this context.
2006.06-84,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1070.101,1077.581,"So if the potential liability, as in these cases, is huge, then you have to be even more careful because there is liability so great."
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1083.47,1086.968,"No, to the extent you're talking about dollar liability, I don't think that's true."
2006.06-84,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1194.332,1198.564,"May I also ask, do you agree with the Petitioner on the meaning of adverse action?"
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1198.564,1201.735,"No, we agree with Respondents on the meaning of adverse action."
2006.06-84,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1201.735,1204.407,Correct me if I'm wrong.
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1222.835,1223.194,Right.
2006.06-84,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1297.196,1297.633,Right.
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1297.633,1298.555,So have you been hit in the pocketbook.
2006.06-84,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1298.555,1306.958,"So if they lower, if they lower the rates, you still say that that fits the meaning of adverse action because they might have lowered them further if the information hadn't been erroneous?"
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1306.958,1330.012,"It could have, and here... in this sense, it could be: In the same way that I, sort of the flip side, but in my office, if everybody in the hallway gets a 5 percent salary increase and I only get a 1 percent salary increase, I am certainly better off, but if the reason I got a lesser increase is because of my gender or because of my credit report, it's an adverse action."
2006.06-84,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1332.479,1333.806,That isn't how the statute defines it.
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1333.806,1334.447,--Excuse me?
2006.06-84,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1334.447,1340.319,The statute says an adverse action is an increase in a charge for... in connection with underwriting.
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1340.319,1341.194,But it also--
2006.06-84,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1341.194,1341.679,That's what it says.
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1368.325,1372.979,"--The definition again on 3A includes not just increase, but includes an unfavorable change in the terms."
2006.06-84,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1375.276,1380.493,"You mean unfavorable change in terms, unfavorable change in terms."
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1380.493,1380.915,--Exactly.
2006.06-84,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1380.915,1384.615,"Well, suppose you don't have, you don't have any terms because you never did it before."
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1385.974,1393.408,"If you're a new customer... and again, I want to reiterate that, how this applies to existing accounts is complicated--"
2006.06-84,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.408,1396.018,"You mean those words ""change in terms"" refer to rates, in other words?"
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1404.232,1408.122,"--Well, you can have a change in terms that is not necessarily an increase."
2006.06-84,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1413.745,1414.494,"No, no, I understand that."
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1445.279,1465.254,"And Justice Breyer, my response is that if the content of the information in your credit report would have made you... had it been better information you'd have gotten a better rate, a better result, your pocketbook wouldn't have been hit as hard, you have a dollars and cents injury because of the content of the information, then you had an adverse action."
2006.06-84,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1465.254,1467.926,"Okay, so your response is just to repeat my question and say that's right?"
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1467.926,1468.237,No.
2006.06-84,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1492.758,1496.507,"How do you fit, how do you fit that within the language of the statute?"
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1535.272,1540.551,"Well, to begin with, that may be why Petitioners' position here certainly was not reckless and the Ninth Circuit erred."
2006.06-84,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1550.002,1556.529,"I read the term as, as one of the Justices here does, not referring to the rate."
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1574.491,1575.756,--Or it could be a reduction in the terms.
2006.06-84,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1606.057,1606.385,--Which is where?
2006.06-84,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1606.385,1608.182,And that's on page 6a on our appendix.
2006.06-84,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1608.182,1608.76,Thank you.
2006.06-84,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1608.76,1610.01,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,1615.039,1618.257,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2006.06-84,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1654.742,1676.295,"What do you say to the argument from drafting history that looks at the history both of little n and little o and it points out that as originally, in the original bill, little o providing for the actual damages required a finding of gross negligence?"
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,1718.389,1727.573,"Justice Souther, I think the only thing we can say about that is Congress reduced the culpability for the actual damages from gross negligence to negligence."
2006.06-84,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1731.789,1743.192,"But the fact that they had originally drafted n as it is, in contrast to the original o, does tell us, doesn't it, something about what they had in mind in n."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,1751.704,1767.415,"No, Justice Souter, I suggest that what you can infer from that is that, if anything, is perhaps Congress wanted to move, make clear that under o the actual damages aren't close to willful or reckless, so they reduced gross negligence to negligence in that circumstance."
2006.06-84,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1781.692,1788.329,"Well, I mean, there's no question it has been and that is sort of the usual reading in the civil context."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,1810.055,1828.704,"--I think if anything, Justice Souter, here the context should be the actual statutory terms used, and in Section 1681n(b) they expressly required the knowing standard and that's a knowing violation of the law, as Justice Alito's question seemed to draw out, a knowing impermissible purpose."
2006.06-84,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1879.685,1894.49,"Counsel, even if you're right about the standard, how can you suggest that it's willful here when you have no judicial construction, you have no administrative construction, you have the statutory language that at least the questions this morning have suggested is not perfectly clear?"
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,1900.005,1908.252,"Mr. Chief Justice, of course we believe and the statute is in fact clear, you do not need further interpretation by the Court."
2006.06-84,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1908.252,1913.732,"So if we don't agree with you on that, you would lose on the application of the willfulness standard?"
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,1913.732,1915.997,If you don't agree with us--
2006.06-84,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1915.997,1922.277,"In other words, your, your, your conclusion that this was a willful violation depends upon your assertion that the statute is perfectly clear?"
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,1922.277,1933.428,--I think that there is a level of objective component that the statute at least has to be understood by a reasonable person at some level using standard statutory construction.
2006.06-84,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1955.435,1957.012,You're talking about the Ball letter?
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,1957.012,1958.215,I am talking about the Ball letter.
2006.06-84,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1958.215,1962.9,"That wasn't even binding on the commission, so why would that be regarded as authoritative?"
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,1962.9,1966.899,"It was not, and we are not suggesting it is, although it's entitled to Chevron deference."
2006.06-84,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1996.7,1998.059,"Well, how could that be?"
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2046.741,2047.413,--Yes.
2006.06-84,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2047.413,2048.101,Yes.
2006.06-84,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2099.736,2102.016,This is a different question.
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2104.141,2105.499,"Yes, and this is the adverse action question."
2006.06-84,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2105.499,2107.03,You haven't addressed adverse action at all.
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2107.03,2108.778,And I'm happy to do so now.
2006.06-84,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2108.778,2109.95,Yes.
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2132.238,2141.829,"Divided in the sense... well, the Ninth Circuit of course overturned the district court's ruling so there's no current division, but if that's what you mean, yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-84,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.876,2185.436,"It's pretty sloppy lawyering, don't you think, any action that even be considered to have... wow."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2187.481,2189.481,--That was--
2006.06-84,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.481,2192.791,Any action that can even be considered to have a negative impact.
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2192.791,2193.713,"--That was guidance, Your Honor."
2006.06-84,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2193.713,2194.759,This is guidance?
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2194.759,2195.572,That was guidance.
2006.06-84,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.1,2205.927,"But you know, I would tell my CEO ignore that, that it's meaningless."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2205.927,2210.909,"In addition, the CEO would have the guidance provided by the Ball letter."
2006.06-84,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2235.696,2238.648,But this is not an antidiscrimination provision.
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2250.393,2255.344,"And Your Honor, I was only using that example to try and explain the statutory language."
2006.06-84,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2255.344,2262.561,"It doesn't explain it because if you have an increase in the charge based on race, of course that's an increase based on race."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2262.561,2263.28,"Well, here we have--"
2006.06-84,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2263.28,2273.071,"And if you refuse to give a person the best rate, and lower his rate but not the best rate, based on race, that is not an increase based on race."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2275.509,2279.459,--You're charging someone more based on credit.
2006.06-84,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2279.459,2283.412,"That's true, and it's a discrimination, but you didn't increase the rate."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2284.615,2286.582,I think--
2006.06-84,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2286.582,2287.909,"It's still a discrimination, it's still unlawful."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2287.909,2295.407,"--Applying it to credit, a natural definition that is charging someone more than you charge others is an increase."
2006.06-84,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2295.407,2301.874,"When you say more, in order for there to be an adverse action there has to be an increase or an unfavorable change."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2320.708,2333.187,"Because charging someone more than someone else who qualifies for that better rate based on their credit, is increasing them, charging them more, but it's also evident from the statutory purpose, which I think was a question you asked--"
2006.06-84,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2333.187,2333.922,Let me look at the language.
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2361.552,2372.0,"--We believe that it's a standard dictionary definition, to charge someone more for insurance than they would otherwise qualify for is increasing their charge."
2006.06-84,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2372.0,2372.672,Which dictionary shall I look at?
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2372.672,2374.609,I think we can look at any dictionary.
2006.06-84,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2375.734,2382.2,"They're making this argument, and I think you got close to it a minute ago when you alluded to statutory purpose."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2398.801,2399.286,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-84,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2399.286,2405.221,And you want this consumer alerted so the consumer can ask to see the report and correct it if possible.
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2405.221,2406.111,That's exactly right.
2006.06-84,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2406.111,2418.7,"Reading the adverse action the way you read it, it would give the consumer or consumers a tip-off in the maximum number of cases."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2483.924,2500.105,"I think it has to be an increase based on some aspect, but the only way to give effect to that statutory purpose is an increase above what you would otherwise qualify for had you had better credit and of course--"
2006.06-84,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2500.105,2506.555,"Well, that's a way to give every conceivable effect to that policy."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2526.89,2536.262,--I don't think the notice is problematic because you're alerting the consumer to check that the information that the insurance company expressly relied on to increase your charge--
2006.06-84,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2536.262,2538.09,To set the charge.
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2542.697,2545.743,--I don't think you need a prior charge to suffer an increase.
2006.06-84,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2556.518,2559.392,"By that you're talking linguistically, but I am interested in the purpose."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2626.601,2627.255,Sure.
2006.06-84,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2686.107,2689.544,"Don't you have that right independently, though, every year to look at a copy of your credit report?"
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2689.544,2694.167,"Well, what's significant here, that has been added to the statute in the last two years."
2006.06-84,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2721.422,2726.045,"When you say you look at the increase with respect to the best credit rate, why is that?"
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2731.574,2738.119,"Because that... GEICO's argument, and I think that's what they want, presumes they're looking at accurate credit information."
2006.06-84,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2758.36,2766.795,"I don't understand what pertinence that has to my question which is, why do you get to pick the best credit report as the baseline from which you would measure your hypothetical increase?"
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2766.795,2780.32,"--Because under GEICO's theory of the statute you may never get notice, even though you're being charged more for insurance based on inaccurate information, as long as you're not charge... your charge doesn't move below average."
2006.06-84,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2793.424,2799.671,Why do we... how do we know that they were intended to be protected in this way by getting this notice?
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2801.795,2810.699,"Because going through the statute and the increase based on credit, and then the notice will give them the opportunity to check."
2006.06-84,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2826.723,2827.301,Okay.
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2827.801,2828.52,--based on inaccurate information.
2006.06-84,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2828.52,2847.121,"--Your basic argument is the statute, the definitions of adverse action have got to be read in a way that maximizes the occasion upon which a consumer will get a notice that may lead that consumer to ask to see his credit report."
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2848.745,2850.994,"Both based on the premise and purpose of statute, yes."
2006.06-84,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2850.994,2851.525,All right.
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2851.525,2868.144,"Briefly addressing the application of the standard to the facts in this case, we do think it's appropriate to remand for further consideration in light of some new developments."
2006.06-84,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2880.013,2881.888,I've read your reference to those documents.
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2884.168,2892.259,"--Because those documents directly address the subject of standard here, that GEICO was reckless or understood their--"
2006.06-84,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2892.259,2894.603,How do those documents shed any light on recklessness?
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2895.945,2897.475,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2006.06-84,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2897.475,2903.379,"How do the documents that you describe shed any light on the extent of their recklessness, if any?"
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2903.379,2919.841,"I want to be careful, because I had presented... I asked to lodge them with the Court and I can quote them if necessary, but within those documents there is direct evidence that GEICO interpreted the statute exactly how we do, that not putting someone in the best tier based on credit--"
2006.06-84,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2919.841,2920.184,Who's GEICO?
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2932.446,2933.429,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.06-84,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2967.151,2971.118,I still don't really understand this part of the case very much.
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2988.096,2992.126,If the statute was clear and the guidance--
2006.06-84,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2992.126,2992.845,If the statute's clear.
2006.06-84,2,42140,scott_a_shorr,,2998.312,3003.499,"--And with respect to the district court, we believe the district court here clearly erred, as the Ninth Circuit found."
2006.06-84,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3029.659,3031.017,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.06-84,3,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3033.813,3043.56,"If I could start by just responding to the issue of the new document, I just want to emphasize that this document was created by people who weren't lawyers."
2006.06-84,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3186.705,3187.548,Why did they use credit reports?
2006.06-84,3,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3195.873,3210.571,"Well, generally there are about 15 factors that they look at to try to come up with a prediction of loss ratio, and someone who has a good credit history is generally regarded as responsible, and responsible people tend to make less claims."
2006.06-84,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.116,3213.413,Yeah.
2006.06-84,3,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3231.578,3237.919,"Well actually, I think that when you factor in employment, it has... it has the opposite effect."
2006.06-84,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3254.224,3254.411,No.
2006.06-84,3,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3266.626,3271.733,"That if you... that in other words, if you gave someone a lower salary--"
2006.06-84,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3271.733,3276.341,It adversely affects any current or prospective employee.
2006.06-84,3,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3287.992,3303.658,"--Your Honor, I think that if GEICO in this example, if you actually pay them less because you looked at their credit report, then GEICO would concede that that is in fact an adverse action."
2006.06-84,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3306.236,3306.689,"Thank you, Miss Mahoney."
