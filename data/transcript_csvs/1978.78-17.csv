1978.78-17,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,40.559,"We'll hear arguments next in the case originally scheduled for the opening argument, United Gas Pipe Line, 78-17 and the consolidated case."
1978.78-17,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,43.842,46.866,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-17,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,394.426,396.371,"Mr. Allen, you mentioned a hearing and proceeding."
1978.78-17,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,399.958,401.271,There is not routinely a hearing.
1978.78-17,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,426.032,429.545,I got the impression from the briefs that normally there’s not a hearing.
1978.78-17,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,429.545,430.557,Normally there’s not a hearing.
1978.78-17,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,430.557,433.744,Yeah.
1978.78-17,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,433.744,446.265,"But in any of that Commission -- in the Court of Appeals view, the facts that were believed to be true in 1966 made the Commission's participation in the abandonment process unnecessary."
1978.78-17,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,671.797,674.241,And the Commission is different.
1978.78-17,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,674.241,687.066,"And the Commission is different, that’s absolutely correct, but in any event no one had any opportunity to examine the facts in the kind of proceeding that Section 7(b) contemplates."
1978.78-17,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,697.96,706.605,"Mr. Allen I think your position is, if I'm not mistaken that even if they did demonstrate to put the Commissioners on the stand, that yes we would have granted it, you'd still say they didn’t have statutory authority."
1978.78-17,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,706.605,710.218,Absolutely that would be our second and principle argument.
1978.78-17,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,765.523,783.818,Do you think that might put a premium on having some lawyers go around pursing Mr. Justice Marshall’s suggestion and get affidavits from the former members of the Commission as some lawyers do going around the jurors --
1978.78-17,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,783.818,789.481,It would put a tremendous premium on such activity Your Honor.
1978.78-17,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.505,990.281,Mr. Allen may I ask you one very trivial question?
1978.78-17,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1006.423,1014.251,As far as I can see this is the only significant adverse consequence.
1978.78-17,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1014.251,1018.654,"So this is a significant consequence in itself, I just wonder anything else."
1978.78-17,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1018.654,1032.076,There might be the Commission’s ability to monitor reserves of natural gas and the Commission may have some particular reasons to enforce --
1978.78-17,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1032.076,1035.903,I can see how the Commission might want to kind of clean up and keep it’s files current or something of that --
1978.78-17,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1035.903,1036.619,Well that’s right and if somebody --
1978.78-17,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1036.619,1040.376,Was there any sanction on the operator?
1978.78-17,0,38596,richard_a_allen,,1040.376,1056.854,"Well if an operator willfully refused to file an abandonment application as he was required to, the Commission might have some regulatory reasons to take sanctions against him, even though his supply had depleted."
1978.78-17,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1064.732,1066.454,Mr. Bemis.
1978.78-17,1,33776,knox_bemis,,1066.454,1070.371,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1978.78-17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1266.156,1268.994,"This has happened with coal mines for example, hasn't it?"
1978.78-17,1,33776,knox_bemis,,1290.983,1291.558,"That’s exactly, right."
1978.78-17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1291.558,1295.493,"Exactly the situation we would have here, could have here?"
1978.78-17,1,33776,knox_bemis,,1295.493,1297.848,"Yes, that’s very close to this situation."
1978.78-17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1304.522,1308.245,New equipment just developed over period of--
1978.78-17,1,33776,knox_bemis,,1308.245,1311.524,That is correct too.
1978.78-17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1655.396,1657.417,Very well.
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,1658.873,1662.281,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-17,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1839.549,1841.788,We’ll resume at 1 o’clock Mr. Cunningham.
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,1841.788,1858.056,Very good.[Luncheon Break]
1978.78-17,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1858.056,1861.058,"Counsel, you may resume."
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,1861.058,1863.743,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1929.543,1934.491,Mr. Cunningham how far back does the (Inaudible) run?
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,1934.491,1936.824,It has a history of about 40 years Your Honor.
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1936.824,1939.534,"No, I mean will it go back that long?"
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,1939.534,1940.221,You mean the --
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1940.221,1949.175,Would you say that this could send us into -- should have been done 40 years ago as hadn’t been done?
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,1949.175,1960.85,"Your Honor, the principle I think would be applicable regardless of the time span between the date the filing should have been made and the date of filing was actually made."
1978.78-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1973.273,1983.969,"Mr. Cunningham, under your theory should not the Commission have been directed to hold the hearing that was never held, because he didn’t file at the right time and that’s not what the Court of Appeals ordered."
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,1983.969,1986.823,"Your Honor, there was a hearing before the Commission --"
1978.78-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1986.823,1987.9,They didn’t make all these findings.
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,1994.975,2007.422,They refused to apply the Act retroactively not on the grounds that if they had applied the Act retroactively that they would have found in 1966 that the reserves were totally exhausted.
1978.78-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2007.422,2022.365,"No, but what I’m saying is that if your theory were correctly applied by the Court of Appeals, should not the Court of Appeals have remanded the matter to the Commission with directions to hold a hearing and decide what it would have decided in 1966, if a timely application had been filed?"
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2022.365,2042.026,"No Your Honor, because the evidence in 1966 was that of Haring, who was a petroleum geologist who testified that at the time his reserves were depleted in 1966 that neither he nor United or anyone else knew of any further reserves."
1978.78-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2059.251,2069.781,You’re saying that the Court of Appeals has found as a fact that this is true and it is so clear that we know that the Commission would have come to the same conclusion if they had a hearing?
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2069.781,2073.222,"The evidence in the record is un-controverted, Your Honor."
1978.78-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2082.159,2088.096,"It didn’t move well, that’s not the standard of review of course, just contrary to the evidence, there had been no substantial evidence supporting the contrary finding."
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2088.096,2100.875,There would have been no substantial which would have supported the finding that the reserves were not depleted in 1966.
1978.78-17,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2288.898,2302.768,"Isn’t that episode with one of the good indications why these abandonments should always be a matter of records, so that your title examiner can know what the situation is?"
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2302.768,2318.715,"I think they should be a matter of record Your Honor, but in most states the abandonment orders of the Commission are un-recordable and indeed inquiry to the Commission would prove useless, for the reason that the Commission’s records are not kept so that the Commission can –-"
1978.78-17,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2318.715,2321.148,"Well, when you say they’re un-recordable under State law you mean?"
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2321.148,2321.577,Yes.
1978.78-17,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2321.577,2335.485,"Well, but a careful examiner when he’s dealing with this kind of property isn’t going to rely just on the registered deeds or the registrar whatever it maybe, he is going to communicate with the Commission, isn’t he?"
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2335.485,2349.329,"That was my point Your Honor, inquiry to the Commission would be fruitless for the reason that the Commissions records are not kept in a manner so that it can be determined whether abandonment has been granted with respect to any particular tract."
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2392.612,2399.664,How much would it have cost to have filed this abandonment approximately?
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2399.664,2400.749,"I’m sorry Your Honor, I didn’t understand."
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2400.749,2412.034,How much in a United States Dollars and cents would it approximately cost to carry through and abandon the proceedings in the 1960s?
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2412.034,2416.944,At the time your honor the cost would not have been great for the reason --
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2416.944,2430.825,Why in the world do we have to bend all of the law around to protect a company with counsel who deliberately didn’t follow the rule.
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2430.825,2433.222,Your Honor although the Harings failed to file --
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2433.222,2440.764,"I just want to give you a break there, it will cost you so much money, but you can’t even help me with that, can you?"
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2440.764,2455.5,"It would not have been costly at that time to file Your Honor for the reason that the Commission withheld processed the abandonment papers and did not hold a formal hearing, an evidentiary hearing on it."
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.011,2523.131,"What happens if you in complete innocence and in good faith to fail file your petition for certiorari in this Court on time, what happens to you?"
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2523.131,2524.031,"Well, Your Honor the --"
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2524.031,2531.82,"With all the good faith in the world, what happens?"
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2531.82,2537.281,"Well, Your Honor you are right, of course, but that’s not the situation in this case."
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2537.281,2540.457,And I don’t want to bend it over either?
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2540.457,2562.455,"Well, we would ask you Your Honor to consider that the filing -- that Haring was in good faith in failing to file and reason to believe that it was not necessary to file whereas in Your Honor's situation no one would believe that it is unnecessary."
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2562.455,2568.461,"No, mine is that you thought you had 91 days and you only had 90."
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2568.461,2573.689,"Well the statute very clearly sets forth that you have 90 days Your Honor, whereas --"
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2573.689,2578.791,(Inaudible) in good faith.
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2578.791,2612.876,"I don’t think, Your Honor and I pointed out that the doctrine was not applicable to mere inadvertence although ignorance but rather it is applicable to a situation where the party had reason to believe that he didn’t have to file and in this connection if there is any doubt about what the Administrative Law Judge thought about the subject, it may be laid to rest by his statement on the record at the conclusion of the proceedings."
1978.78-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2644.16,2654.484,"Without notice of United’s claim, but does that show -- does that say they didn’t know that the statute said or they didn’t get a form that said you have a file a petition of this kind?"
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2654.484,2671.39,"Without notice United was claiming rights under its contract Your Honor, which it did not do until after the negotiations with the United were over until and until year after McCombs had entered into his contract with DuPont."
1978.78-17,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2671.39,2677.252,"Isn’t this -- the statutory language pretty clear in this case, isn’t that the big problem?"
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2677.252,2702.511,"No Your Honor, I don’t think it is clear because if you examine the law at that time you have two cases which said that’s the Hart and the Harbor cases before the Fifth and Tenth Circuit respectively, but so -- that the petitioner, that the requirement to continue deliveries continues down to the exhausting the reserves or so long as production continues."
1978.78-17,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2902.512,2915.563,"Mr. Cunningham, I know you have already said this, but do you know of any case where the Commission actually has permitted abandonment nunc pro tunc on its own or under the mandate of the court?"
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2915.563,2931.872,"In the Hewitt and Dougherty case, Your Honor, the Commission applied the Act as if Hewitt and Dougherty had complied with the Act in 1954 before the Philips case was decided."
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2984.82,2987.651,How about little hypothetical Mr. Cunningham?
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,2987.651,2987.988,Yes sir.
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2987.988,3000.559,You got a Commission in existence now that everybody knows would not give an abandonment to anybody under certain conditions.
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3006.002,3007.018,"No Your Honor, because --"
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3007.018,3007.55,Why not?
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3007.55,3008.439,-- the application --
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3008.439,3009.155,Why not?
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3009.155,3022.992,The application of this doctrine requires a producer to come to Commission and to ask the Commission to exercise its statutory function under Section 7(b) as of the date the paper should have been filed.
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3031.186,3039.159,"Well, if I would do, what I suggest that I would do, I wouldn’t tell anybody that was the reason I would do it, would I?"
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3039.159,3049.132,"I would suggest that in that case Your Honor, the producer could not make the required showing of good faith and therefore the doctrine would not be applicable."
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3049.132,3061.291,"Well, suppose I put on 10 years later, I put on a lawyer that said, we didn’t just think you needed abandonment and lawyers they said exactly what the lawyer said in this case."
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3061.291,3062.606,"Your Honor, it’s a question of good faith."
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3062.606,3063.646,Would that be good?
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3063.646,3066.225,It’s a question of good faith in each case.
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3066.913,3071.606,I said that the lawyer said exactly what these lawyers said.
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3078.826,3080.538,That the parties were innocent that is?
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3080.538,3080.897,Yeah.
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3080.897,3081.861,And we’re in good faith.
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3081.861,3083.022,Yeah.
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3083.022,3087.283,It would depend on the facts and the circumstances of that case.
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3088.644,3092.182,"Well, the only facts are that they should have applied but they didn’t."
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3092.182,3094.982,"I don’t think that would do, that would meet the requirement showing of good faith Your Honor."
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3094.982,3098.523,What other requirements do you have here?
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3098.523,3102.366,Haring entered in 1964.
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3102.366,3108.019,"Well, all I heard you say was that the lawyer said it wasn’t necessary to file this piece of paper."
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3108.019,3108.749,No Your Honor.
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3129.087,3136.294,But what about the fact that you can shop around for Commission?
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3136.294,3137.9,The Commission in --
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3137.9,3140.364,Is that right?
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3147.373,3153.171,"Well Your Honor, the required finding is whether the available supply was exhausted as over the time --"
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3153.171,3162.466,"Well, haven’t there been cases where they held up on trade Commission cases until the whole Commission changed by delaying tactics?"
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3162.466,3166.346,"I’m not familiar with those cases Your Honor, but --"
1978.78-17,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3166.346,3173.414,"Why in the world do you think they passed the rule that you had to file for this, if you didn’t have to?"
1978.78-17,2,41142,stanley_l_cunningham,,3173.414,3176.313,It’s the same as in any filing requirement.
1978.78-17,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3460.262,3461.428,Thanks Mr. Cunningham.
1978.78-17,3,38596,richard_a_allen,,3467.148,3470.18,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-17,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3546.869,3552.666,"Mr. Allen, you say they are typically recorded in the Recorder of Deeds Office, you mean county by county?"
1978.78-17,3,38596,richard_a_allen,,3552.666,3554.528,I believe that is correct Your Honor.
1978.78-17,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3554.528,3556.547,Under what heading?
1978.78-17,3,38596,richard_a_allen,,3556.547,3558.584,They are filed with the lease.
1978.78-17,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3576.338,3584.992,Mr. Allen I think I didn’t understand say the court had did by his argument.
1978.78-17,3,38596,richard_a_allen,,3588.641,3596.434,His argument was – as I understand that the Commission is required as a matter of law and was required in this case.
1978.78-17,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3596.434,3599.106,But he says the court can do that.
1978.78-17,3,38596,richard_a_allen,,3599.106,3601.176,The court can require the Commission.
1978.78-17,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3601.176,3605.059,I think it is a little dirty to say the court has to.
1978.78-17,3,38596,richard_a_allen,,3605.059,3612.311,"Well, it is not entirely clear what his position is, but if he says that’s the law, then presumably the court would have to."
1978.78-17,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3657.008,3659.18,Is the Hewitt and Dougherty in latter category?
1978.78-17,3,38596,richard_a_allen,,3659.18,3670.175,"That is in that later category where there had been a cessation of production before 1954 and of course the person did not file for an abandonment application, because nobody thought he was subject to the Act."
1978.78-17,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3670.175,3670.854,Thank you gentleman.
