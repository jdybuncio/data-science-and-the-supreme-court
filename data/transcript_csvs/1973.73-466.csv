1973.73-466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,17.563,"We’ll hear arguments next in 73-466, Arnold against the Carpenters District Council."
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,20.092,23.077,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,111.215,112.476,That was (Inaudible)
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,112.476,112.916,Pardon sir?
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,112.916,115.589,"That was a 301 suit in state case, was it?"
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,115.589,117.421,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan it was."
1973.73-466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,483.105,487.073,"Mr. Jones, is that really before us?"
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,512.09,528.721,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, what we would submit is that this question so far as we can tell is one for the first time for this Court to decide as far as the jurisdiction of the state court to enjoin the breach of a no-strike promise by way of injunction."
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,628.336,639.117,But would this be met do you think that simply by holding applicable or pertinent federal law as to govern the state court determination?
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,639.117,640.555,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,658.453,660.814,Well that is the federal law?
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,660.814,661.582,"Yes, in the Boys Market --"
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,661.582,666.772,The federal law would produce that result and the state courts may apply federal laws as I understand?
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,666.772,668.55,That’s correct Mr. Justice Brennan I believe it --
1973.73-466,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,668.55,670.145,"[Voice Overlap] must, isn't that?"
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,670.145,671.327,I’m sorry?
1973.73-466,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,671.327,674.735,"The state courts not only may apply federal law, but they must do so?"
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,674.735,691.155,"Under Lincoln Mills, they must, yes sir and we submit that for clarity and for uniformity of National Labor Policy that that’s what this decision should mean that state courts are bound by federal law."
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1037.73,1040.7,"This is a jurisdictional dispute in this case, isn’t it?"
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1040.7,1041.555,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1041.555,1047.586,"And is it -- let’s see, I have forgotten, it is an arbitration provision?"
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1047.586,1048.143,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1048.143,1051.064,So this is mandatorily mis --
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1051.064,1052.177,"Yes, Mr. Brennan."
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1052.177,1054.714,An arbitration procedure -- mandatory arbitration procedure?
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1054.714,1055.486,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1055.486,1064.654,"So we’re not -- we don’t have in this case at least the situation you're addressing now, do we -- of simply a no-strike clause without an arbitration provision?"
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1064.654,1065.977,"That’s correct, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1065.977,1070.171,But you nevertheless are asking us to decide that?
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1070.171,1078.708,I’m asking this Court to look at that question in terms of the fact that the Boys Markets decision has left open whether or not it applies to state --
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1078.708,1084.715,"Well, I guess somebody left it open rather purposely I thought in Boys Market?"
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1084.715,1085.17,To --
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1085.17,1100.89,"We limited -- we said that the Boys Market decision dealt narrowly with the question of enjoinability of a strike in the situation where there was an arbitration provision for handling the grievance, which provoked the strike?"
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1100.89,1103.374,"That’s correct, but in Boys --"
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1103.374,1105.156,(Voice Overlap) to go beyond that.
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1105.156,1110.147,"Yes, sir but in adopting the Boys Markets decision of course, it was the dissenting opinion from Sinclair --"
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1110.147,1110.437,That’s right.
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1110.437,1123.713,"-- which setup these -- these conditions precedent to invoking the arbitration, to invoking the court's jurisdiction to enjoin the breach of a no-strike promise."
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1123.713,1133.113,"But one of those conditions, was it not, was that they determine whether or not it was an arbitrable grievance."
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1136.332,1138.005,Was one of the conditions.
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1138.005,1138.127,Yes.
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1138.127,1148.993,"In the Sinclair dissent, that was listed and adopted I think just verbatim as this Court's holding in Boys Markets was that one that had to be -- the dispute had to be subject to the grievance and arbitration."
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1148.993,1153.467,"It had to be over a grievance, which both parties are contractually bound to arbitrate?"
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1153.467,1161.375,"Yes sir and also that in the court’s order, it should order the employer to arbitrate that."
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1196.855,1218.032,"Well, but it may be that the whole underlying premise of Boys Markets was that you may enjoin violation of a no-strike provision only if there is a compulsory arbitration provision applicable to the grievance which provokes the strike."
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1218.032,1240.043,"Yes, sir and that Mr. Justice Brennan is our point in that if that is declared holding in Boys Markets then through that decision, we are dictating the substance of terms of a collective bargaining agreement because if an employer knows that in order to have a no-strike promise enforced, he has to have everything subject to the grievance and arbitration clause --"
1973.73-466,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1240.043,1240.953,Yes.
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1240.953,1258.313,"-- then we’re telling the employer you must agree if you want your no-strike promise which you paid dearly to get to have peace for a year or two years or three years, you must agree to a broad grievance arbitration clause that covers everything."
1973.73-466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1415.701,1435.155,Mr. Farley in his brief tells us that there's no binding arbitration clause here. I suppose you’d be willing or are you willing to submit the case turns on that?
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1435.155,1439.031,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we don’t believe that the case turns on that."
1973.73-466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1468.147,1475.841,Well if he is right in his position that there's no binding arbitration agreement then what happens to your case?
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1475.841,1478.21,If there is no final and binding arbitration?
1973.73-466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.786,1515.514,"Mr. Jones, wouldn’t you contend that once you get to the end of the preemption issue that if there is no preemption here, the state court has jurisdiction to decide as the Chief Justice says whether there was a binding no-strike clause of binding arbitration clause and decide whether that is required by the law?"
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1531.449,1533.892,That’s correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1973.73-466,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1574.573,1586.583,"But if the circuit court has jurisdiction, if it isn't preempted by Garmon, then I take it that it has a right to issue an injunction erroneously under Boys Market as well to issue an injunction correctly under Boys Market."
1973.73-466,0,31157,john_paul_jones,,1606.294,1624.066,"Well, that’s correct and I think that the District Court of Appeal made some mention about the application of Boys Market and the state of whether or not it’s free of error because he did not issue also an order for the employer to arbitrate."
1973.73-466,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1624.066,1626.952,Mr. Farley.
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,1626.952,1630.749,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1828.652,1842.792,"If the state court, Mr. Farley, if the state court is required to enforce the federal law, is it necessary to defer to their jurisdiction in order to accomplish that result?"
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,1842.792,1854.506,"No, Your Honor, but I would point that this Court has held long before now that state court is entertaining 301 suits are bound by federal law."
1973.73-466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1868.07,1872.253,"Well this would have to be a general jurisdiction court in the state, would it not?"
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,1872.253,1873.536,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.536,1876.067,"That’s not very low level, is it?"
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,1877.853,1881.88,"Well, I don’t know, there's 20 in Jacksonville--"
1973.73-466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1881.88,1883.394,Twenty Judges.
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,1883.394,1886.211,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1891.746,1897.517,"Well, there’s nothing unique about that, you have 27 trial judges in New York City in the federal court."
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,1897.517,1898.102,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1898.102,1903.298,"And probably I don’t know, 50 or 75 state court judges."
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,1907.59,1915.704,Just in the reasoning behind Garmon with so many different --
1973.73-466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1915.704,1924.388,Isn't your emphasis really they aren't just familiar with the federal law as the district -- Federal District Judges at least presumed to be?
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,1924.388,1931.553,"Exactly Your Honor, exactly and I don’t think that there's any question but this is the case."
1973.73-466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2033.402,2047.635,"Of course what you're defending here is the decision of your Supreme Court that says the Circuit Court in Jacksonville can’t even inquire into these issues, that they simply have no jurisdiction to look into the things that you're talking about?"
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,2047.635,2048.849,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2077.056,2086.31,"But then the kind of facts that you are just mentioning whether the Lathers did this or did that really don’t bear on the jurisdiction with, do they?"
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,2086.31,2101.371,"Only to the extent that you also have the question of the contractual agreement and if you get into Boys Market, the area of injunctive relief which this Court with this case did present to the Florida Supreme Court."
1973.73-466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2124.004,2141.698,"Well but supposing that that is the rule of Boys Market and supposing you're wrong on your Garmon point that the Circuit Court in Duval County has jurisdiction to entertain this action, but it must follow Boys Market and that’s the rule of Boys Market."
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,2154.12,2155.227,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2197.809,2200.509,"They didn’t say deferring that, did they?"
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,2200.509,2206.004,"Well, they -- not in this case."
1973.73-466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2206.525,2209.311,"So deferring, have any?"
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,2209.311,2209.686,Right.
1973.73-466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2209.686,2211.681,So there is no jurisdiction at all?
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,2211.681,2235.771,"Well, but the way they phrased it in the prior case, I believe it was Sheet Metal, but it might have been Scherer that state court -- that the state court should defer initial jurisdiction -- should defer jurisdiction at least to the point of letting the National Labor Relations Board make the initial decision as to federal jurisdiction."
1973.73-466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2284.953,2293.523,"First to mind which in, if I am reading the correct opinion, Judge McCain -- Justice McCain is the court’s opinion, isn't it?"
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,2320.908,2344.535,That I tried to point out in my brief that regardless of the dictum that the Florida Supreme Court threw out that the case that they decided was a case for injunctive relief that on the face of the complaint alleged in an unfair labor practice.
1973.73-466,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2476.75,2490.884,Of course -- what do you do about the limitation and the language of the law in Norris-La Guardia Act that says it applies to courts of the United States and certainly intimates it doesn’t apply to state courts?
1973.73-466,1,30392,joseph_s_farley_jr,,2490.884,2506.443,"Well, I don’t know that this is a case where this Court could extend the language of the Norris-La Guardia Act to state courts."
1973.73-466,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2583.224,2584.354,Thank you Mr. Farley.
1973.73-466,2,31157,john_paul_jones,,2588.622,2594.965,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, just one or two closing points."
1973.73-466,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2851.14,2852.186,Thank you Mr. Jones.
