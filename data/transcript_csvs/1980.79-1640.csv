1980.79-1640,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.504,We will hear arguments next in Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim.
1980.79-1640,0,39789,robert_e_levy,,84.437,87.422,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1640,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,121.143,126.63,Is this what is euphemistically called an adult bookstore?
1980.79-1640,0,39789,robert_e_levy,,126.63,131.867,"Euphemistically, realistically, and directly, sir, it's called an adult bookstore."
1980.79-1640,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,145.609,149.495,"Mr. Levy, I should know, but is Mount Ephraim in Burlington?"
1980.79-1640,0,39789,robert_e_levy,,149.495,149.995,"--Pardon, sir?"
1980.79-1640,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,149.995,151.662,What county is Mount Ephraim in?
1980.79-1640,0,39789,robert_e_levy,,152.245,153.164,"This is in Camden County, Judge."
1980.79-1640,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,153.164,154.114,"--Oh, is it in Camden?"
1980.79-1640,0,39789,robert_e_levy,,154.114,155.482,"It's in Camden County, sir."
1980.79-1640,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,155.482,156.032,Where?
1980.79-1640,0,39789,robert_e_levy,,157.199,160.684,"It is to the south, and, I believe, to the east of the city."
1980.79-1640,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,160.684,161.386,Small?
1980.79-1640,0,39789,robert_e_levy,,161.386,166.672,It's on the Black Horse Pike on the way to Atlantic City from the Camden-Philadelphia area.
1980.79-1640,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,166.672,167.957,"And a very small borough, isn't it?"
1980.79-1640,0,39789,robert_e_levy,,167.957,168.607,It's a small borough.
1980.79-1640,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,177.111,180.665,Would you tell us a little more about Mount Ephraim?
1980.79-1640,0,39789,robert_e_levy,,182.481,186.401,"It's zoned, if I understand, sir, in two zones."
1980.79-1640,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,218.971,220.456,"Commercial or, and residential?"
1980.79-1640,0,39789,robert_e_levy,,220.456,221.34,And/or residential.
1980.79-1640,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,221.34,223.575,And what's its population?
1980.79-1640,0,39789,robert_e_levy,,223.575,225.692,May I call on my--
1980.79-1640,1,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,225.692,228.377,"Less than 5,000 people, Your Honor."
1980.79-1640,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,228.377,233.363,"And do the residents live and work... they're living there, of course."
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,238.251,243.469,--I think that they would have to go beyond the borough of Mount Ephraim in order to provide sufficient occupations for the--
1980.79-1640,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,243.469,248.771,"Except, of course, for your client and others similarly situated, who run commercial establishments in the community?"
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,248.771,249.221,--That's right.
1980.79-1640,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,261.764,263.981,"Employment, there; yes."
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,265.548,267.434,I would think not.
1980.79-1640,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,270.719,271.369,But not now?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,271.369,274.321,--more suburban than it is urban.
1980.79-1640,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,274.321,277.506,What sort of commercial establishments are permitted?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,279.225,281.075,There is a motion picture theater.
1980.79-1640,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,296.368,297.67,And taverns?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,297.67,298.22,Taverns?
1980.79-1640,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,299.004,300.156,Restaurants?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,300.156,310.927,"There are taverns, there are restaurants with liquor licenses, and within some of those there is the live entertainment about which we had some colloquy in the lower courts."
1980.79-1640,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,460.505,465.959,"The ordinance in question is the one that appears on page 3 of your brief, is it?"
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,465.959,469.945,"Yes, sir, at 99-15B, I believe, is its designation."
1980.79-1640,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,469.945,470.511,All right.
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,479.55,480.4,Yes.
1980.79-1640,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,480.4,484.385,"And I suppose ""dinners"" means ""diners"", doesn't it?"
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,498.393,509.098,"If that is to be interpreted as it's presently being interpreted, I would imagine that if you had dead flowers they would be permitted, but live ones, because they are live entertainment--"
1980.79-1640,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,509.098,510.014,"Well, nurseries is here."
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,537.532,539.083,"--No, sir."
1980.79-1640,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,539.083,543.535,Is there one in the city?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,543.535,544.185,There is one.
1980.79-1640,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,548.403,549.97,Are newsstands here?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,549.97,552.189,I do not see them here.
1980.79-1640,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.189,553.524,Bookstores?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,554.357,557.126,Books are allowed to be sold... between gifts and stationery.
1980.79-1640,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,557.126,560.945,Yes.
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,569.916,578.956,"I've had the problem from the outset, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I cannot literally come here and say to you that this ordinance is defective as it's written."
1980.79-1640,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.309,650.216,"Well, the courts of New Jersey have interpreted this ordinance to forbid what you want to do."
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,650.216,651.201,Exactly.
1980.79-1640,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,651.201,653.57,"So it's been officially interpreted and applied to you, your client."
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,653.57,672.682,"If the lack of any issue ever reaching a court with respect to what we do in this location is the equivalent of having approved what we're doing, it may well be that if they're sustained with this ordinance on the basis of live, that they can come back tomorrow and on the basis of this ordinance now attack nonlive."
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,672.682,677.186,"Are you attacking this ordinance on its face, or as applied to you?"
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,677.186,680.588,"As applied to us, and as applied across the board."
1980.79-1640,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,690.143,707.605,"Well, it's been applied to you because you're wanting to show what the courts of New Jersey have held to be live entertainment, and that is banned by this ordinance."
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,707.605,708.188,That's correct.
1980.79-1640,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,708.188,712.74,"And so, as applied to you, you're claiming that the ordinance is unconstitutional."
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,712.74,714.858,There is no question that we are arguing about its application to us.
1980.79-1640,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,714.858,728.851,"And then you also say, I suppose, that you're entitled because it's a First Amendment case to say that because it also bans bookstores, that the ordinance is invalid?"
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,728.851,730.967,"No, it doesn't ban bookstores."
1980.79-1640,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,730.967,736.469,"Well, I mean... well, you mean as applied?"
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,736.469,747.577,"As applied, as we look at this ordinance, the fair warning that we would normally be entitled to when we are beginning to use our enterprise, I look at this ordinance and I realize that for three years I've been allowed to offer--"
1980.79-1640,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,747.577,749.595,How do you know it doesn't ban bookstores?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,749.595,755.432,--Because it specifically sets forth that as a permitted use there are books.
1980.79-1640,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.948,757.332,I see.
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,768.64,769.425,No.
1980.79-1640,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.412,887.582,"Well, you can say it's a time, place, and manner provision in the sense that it permits entertainment in certain ways, but it doesn't permit live entertainment."
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,887.582,888.718,All right.
1980.79-1640,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,908.162,923.089,"I don't know why you aren't in a position to make that argument now, because that's why your operation is in trouble on account of the ordinance, because it is live entertainment according to the authorities."
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,923.089,925.357,According to their reading of it.
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,972.818,975.601,"That wasn't a First Amendment case, really, was it?"
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,976.186,981.072,"--Yes, but isn't... well, it was First Amendment, but then it was also--"
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,981.072,981.674,"No, it--"
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,981.674,982.724,--one that dealt with the 21st Amendment.
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,982.724,985.676,--The 21st Amendment was what controlled LaRue.
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,985.676,1001.568,"Well, what happened is that it originally got up before the court, I think it started, at least the people who were affected basically by LaRue... were talking in terms of First Amendment... and we found now that there was an interplay between the First and the 21st Amendment."
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1005.972,1013.093,I would think that LaRue reflects the idea that a state may prohibit the sale of salted peanuts or potato chips in a bar if it wants to.
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1013.093,1014.145,--All right.
1980.79-1640,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1129.018,1137.538,"I gather, Mr. Levy, that what, the key to Judge Deighan's opinion is that one sentence, is it, at page 12a:"
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1148.979,1151.447,"Yes, and what he did is, he--"
1980.79-1640,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1151.447,1157.918,"Just across the board barred any live entertainment, clothed or unclothed."
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1157.918,1162.805,"--As a consequence of a zoning ordinance, both of the judges did that."
1980.79-1640,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1162.805,1175.03,"And I gather, at least we've had cases that indicate that live entertainment often has communicative aspects that are protected by the First Amendment."
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1177.515,1178.349,They do.
1980.79-1640,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1252.896,1253.279,--Mr. Levy?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1253.279,1255.965,--without infringing beyond that which would become necessary--
1980.79-1640,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1255.965,1257.648,"May I ask you a question, Mr. Levy, please?"
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1257.648,1259.233,"--Yes, sir, Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1640,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1259.233,1273.476,"If the ordinance had totally banned motion pictures, which I thought it did, but you told us there is in fact a motion picture theater on this street, but that's a protected form of communication, would you say such an ordinance would be unconstitutional?"
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1273.476,1274.476,I would say that--
1980.79-1640,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.476,1276.928,"It seems perfectly clear, so there's no vagueness problem."
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1276.928,1281.946,"--I would say that, again, we would have the problem of putting the community to the test."
1980.79-1640,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1298.708,1302.227,You have the right to do that as a defense to a criminal prosecution?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1302.227,1310.333,"--What I do is, I attempt to challenge the validity of the statute in the criminal prosecution, and therefore contain it within that."
1980.79-1640,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1310.95,1317.838,So then in a criminal trial the prosecutor has the burden of setting forth the factual justification for the ordinance?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1317.838,1319.055,--He has that burden.
1980.79-1640,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1338.685,1344.672,The issue would be the same if it were a motion picture theater or if it's a place where they have live entertainment?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1344.672,1348.374,I would say it's exactly the same wherever there's a First Amendment issue involved.
1980.79-1640,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1353.359,1361.814,But didn't you agree that a community could zone out entirely commercial uses and make it entirely residential?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1361.814,1369.837,"I have said that, and if that were part of the unspoken part of Mr. Justice Stevens' question, then I would have answered it the same way."
1980.79-1640,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1414.133,1415.435,How about newspapers?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1415.435,1422.955,"It's not listed here, unless it's an accessory use to books or stationery, which are both allowed."
1980.79-1640,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1443.685,1464.781,"But if they did strictly keep it to all commerce, they could exclude people who wanted to purvey books, movies or anything else, so long as they just made it an absolute flat ban."
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1464.781,1472.537,I would have some problem being able to speak as forcibly about the situation as I do about this situation.
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1711.072,1713.441,Let me go back to what you had said before.
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1721.03,1722.564,"No, I didn't say that at all."
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1722.564,1723.649,"They could, couldn't they?"
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1723.649,1724.316,I say it could.
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1725.016,1731.07,Then they could ban all grocery stores?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1731.07,1738.474,"--It could, but again subject to challenge as to the basis upon which there is this--"
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1738.474,1742.192,"Just because they don't want any filling stations, they don't want any grocery stores."
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1742.192,1743.044,--And if they--
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1743.044,1747.762,"And they could ban all liquor establishments, couldn't they?"
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1747.762,1749.214,"--And if they did, sir--"
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1749.214,1753.383,But you say they can't ban a theater?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1753.383,1754.199,"--No, what I've said is that--"
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1754.199,1756.218,Of the kind you've got here?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1756.218,1765.374,"--My answer with respect to the theater was that if they, they cannot ban a theater if there are other commercial uses without being subject to a challenge."
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1879.765,1883.217,How do you see the Belle Terre case as aiding your argument?
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1883.217,1907.733,"Well, in Belle Terre what we have is, there was an attempt to pass an ordinance, or there was an ordinance passed, setting forth that there would be an allowance, or a disallowance of family and friends, but that would keep the basic family unit as one that could rent, but that there could be a preventation of anyone who was not a member of the family."
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1927.91,1931.129,Finish your sentence; yes.
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1931.129,1933.698,In Belle Terre they did not sustain.
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1973.841,1975.977,I think that answers my question that I put to you.
1980.79-1640,2,39789,robert_e_levy,,1975.977,1976.577,"Thank you, sir."
1980.79-1640,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1976.577,1979.045,"Thank you, Mr. Levy."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,1982.764,1989.085,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1640,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2054.61,2061.814,"Of course, as my brother White earlier said, what we have before us is the ordinance as construed by the New Jersey courts."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2061.814,2062.83,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1640,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2062.83,2069.034,"And the ordinance doesn't even seem to allow moving picture theaters, but there is one in town, we've been told."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2069.034,2072.488,"That moving picture theater, Your Honor, would be a nonconforming use--"
1980.79-1640,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2072.488,2084.295,"But in any event, we've been told that whatever this ordinance may seem on its face to say, what it does do is permit moving pictures and an adult bookstore but not live entertainment."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2085.895,2086.912,--That's correct.
1980.79-1640,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2087.081,2093.601,"And therefore that's the ordinance as it comes to us, just as though it were written in so many words, in the ordinance."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2093.601,2099.589,"--But it is correct on a basis, not that we distinguish live entertainment and nonlive entertainment."
1980.79-1640,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2161.176,2170.149,"I didn't understand that to be the reasoning of Judge Deighan, which is the only full dress opinion we seem to have in this case."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2170.149,2184.308,"--Judge Deighan's rationale as I understand it is, he found that appellant's live entertainment was First Amendment protected, but was nonetheless subject to the reasonable exercise of the zoning power of the Borough of Mount Ephraim."
1980.79-1640,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2260.272,2263.24,"Well, flowers are mentioned, as was brought to my attention."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2263.24,2264.359,--The answer is clearly yes.
1980.79-1640,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2266.092,2270.58,"Then it says, all uses not expressly permitted are prohibited."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2270.58,2271.08,That's correct.
1980.79-1640,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2274.232,2276.817,"It' your point, let me just be sure I understand your point."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2287.891,2288.607,Absolutely.
1980.79-1640,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2314.925,2323.498,"I was under the impression that when a customer viewed one of these films, he had to put a coin in the viewing--"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2323.498,2324.098,--That's correct.
1980.79-1640,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.098,2327.632,"--Well, that's a little different from the record sales, or you're just doing it to see if you want to buy it."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2327.632,2339.59,I don't think the Borough could prohibit the record shop from charging the customer a dime or a quarter to listen to the record even if he was going to buy it.
1980.79-1640,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2361.004,2370.376,But the peepshow is more a matter of consumption than being on consignment or return in ten days and you get your money back.
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2370.376,2374.147,I don't think any of that is involved.
1980.79-1640,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2382.936,2385.388,"You don't get to view it for nothing, do you?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2385.388,2386.071,--No.
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.488,2447.296,"But, you do agree, or don't you, that the ordinance bans all live entertainment?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2447.296,2456.234,--I agree that the ordinance prohibits the utilization of land and structures in the commercial zone--
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.234,2457.901,For any live entertainment?
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2457.901,2459.786,"--for any live entertainment, Shakespeare--"
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.786,2468.542,"And, of course, I take it that a live entertainment is not permitted in any other zone?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2468.542,2469.275,--That's correct.
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.275,2473.594,So there is no live entertainment in the Borough?
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2473.594,2474.863,That's incorrect.
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2485.585,2489.621,But there is no commercial live entertainment?
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2489.621,2490.473,That's correct.
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.473,2491.306,In the city?
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2491.306,2492.073,That's correct.
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2492.073,2498.893,"And so it would ban a play, any kind of a play, for example?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2498.893,2502.511,It would ban a theater.
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.313,2508.065,"Well, it would ban a commercial theater."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2508.065,2508.849,Correct.
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.849,2510.182,Or a circus.
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2510.182,2511.151,Correct.
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2511.151,2520.039,"And it would ban any kind of commercial live entertainment, any kind of live entertainment for which a fee is charged for profit, profit making?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2520.039,2541.803,"At the point that the structure or land ceases to be an office or a home and becomes either a theater or an opera house or a concert hall or a sports arena or whatever, at that point it offends the zoning ordinance because this ordinance is created as a retail sales zone to satisfy the immediate needs--"
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2541.803,2563.483,"Now, what's your justification for saying that the ordinance is valid even though it forbids any, although it forbids among other things a commercial theater with a live cast?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2563.483,2565.835,--You're asking for a compelling state interest?
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2565.835,2566.485,Yes.
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2573.291,2579.145,"I didn't think I do because I don't really think this is a First Amendment case, but I'll be privileged to respond to the question."
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2582.213,2592.936,"Well, you would agree that live entertainment in some forms, at least, is entitled to First Amendment protection?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2592.936,2593.871,--Absolutely.
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.871,2595.438,Like a theater?
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2595.438,2596.657,Absolutely.
1980.79-1640,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2596.657,2615.518,"Would you also agree that the Borough of Mount Ephraim is entitled to prohibit, say, a rock concert that is apt to draw 50,000 people from Philadelphia and Atlantic City because of the congestion problems involved, even though it does involve live entertainment?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2615.518,2618.153,Certainly; and has.
1980.79-1640,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2624.124,2631.813,"But without all of that crowd, could you have live entertainment in the existing movie theater?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2631.813,2636.365,"I don't think you could... no, you cannot, Your Honor, you cannot."
1980.79-1640,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2636.365,2645.22,Even the high school play in the movie theater would be barred if they charged money to raise money to go to a football game or something?
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2645.22,2649.774,"The line may... I'm sorry, sir."
1980.79-1640,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2649.774,2651.357,Would it not be?
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2652.241,2660.13,At the moment that the structure in which it is being performed ceases to become a high school and becomes something other than that.
1980.79-1640,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2660.13,2663.849,"--No, no, I asked about your existing motion picture theater."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2668.419,2669.003,"Yes, it does--"
1980.79-1640,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2669.003,2672.871,It would bar the high school putting on its play in the?
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2672.871,2677.175,"--Perhaps not on a one time basis, but--"
1980.79-1640,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2677.175,2688.213,"Well, that is certainly not the way I read, and I gather that's as my brother Stewart suggested to you earlier, that's what we have to take as the reach of this ordinance, what Judge Deighan... is that the way you pronounce it?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2688.213,2688.796,"--""Deegan""."
1980.79-1640,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2688.796,2697.838,"The way, that sentence I read your colleague earlier, that it does not grant any kind of live entertainment."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2702.973,2705.675,"Well, I think there are several justifications."
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2775.219,2790.514,"Well, do you think that covers the situation if the owner of the motion picture theater says, by the way, I would... three nights a week are going to be movies and three nights a week are going to be plays?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2790.514,2792.514,"You have to appreciate, Your Honor, that that movie--"
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2792.514,2798.201,"That, you would say, movies are all right and plays are not, or not?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2798.201,2802.072,"--You have to appreciate that that movie is a nonconforming use in our borough, Your Honor."
1980.79-1640,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2812.045,2814.396,"I suppose it also precedes the song,"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2818.764,2821.35,"I'm at a loss, Your Honor."
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2821.35,2832.374,"Well, what about... does the ordinance ban the showing in this store that we have here, this adult bookstore, of movies?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2832.374,2843.999,"No, because that is... at least, it could be argued and it probably would be argued that that is the method by which they choose to sell their movies."
1980.79-1640,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2861.158,2864.96,"Mr. Fishman, let me ask one other question about the motion picture theater."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2869.664,2870.931,"--Are we discussing the movie, sir?"
1980.79-1640,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2870.931,2871.848,--The motion picture theater.
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2873.983,2875.301,"This motion picture, or a movie?"
1980.79-1640,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2875.301,2877.234,"--No, no, I'm talking about the theater, the--"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2877.234,2877.817,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1640,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2877.817,2882.005,--Does that mean that if someone else wanted to open a motion picture theater that would be prohibited by the ordinance?
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2882.005,2883.088,"I believe so, sir."
1980.79-1640,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2883.088,2895.229,"So that in a way this is like, the same case as if this is the second... this is an application to... I mean, it's not application, but if it were, to be a second place of entertainment within the area?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2895.229,2899.081,"Yes, it could be so viewed."
1980.79-1640,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2914.207,2920.544,"In other words, if they had had vaudeville in that motion picture theater before the ordinance was passed, presumably they could continue to have it then?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2922.796,2926.615,"I think so, although that's not present at all."
1980.79-1640,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2926.615,2930.0,"Well, we didn't even know about the motion picture theater until you told us about it."
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2931.269,2933.621,"I understand this, Your Honor, but it exists."
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2937.556,2948.446,"Well, if a... could there be a dinner theater that didn't have a live play but which showed movies in connection with their restaurant operation?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2948.446,2949.43,"No, sir."
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2955.834,2967.342,You're really saying that since it's not permitted there's no entertainment of any kind permitted in the Borough commercially?
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2967.342,2969.127,--The land of the Borough--
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2969.127,2970.343,Whether it's live or not live?
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2970.343,2970.91,--That's correct.
1980.79-1640,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2986.986,2994.976,Do you think that's the way your New Jersey courts construed this ordinance as banning all entertainment rather than just all live entertainment?
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,2994.976,3000.628,"--I think so, sir."
1980.79-1640,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3008.816,3016.855,"But I know, Mr. Fishman, but don't we have to... the only opinion, as Justice Stewart reminded you earlier, is the county court opinion, isn't it?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,3016.855,3017.472,That's correct.
1980.79-1640,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3017.472,3021.241,And that's all we know about what the meaning of this ordinance that has been--
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,3021.241,3021.543,That is correct.
1980.79-1640,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3021.543,3025.628,We'll resume at 1 o'clock.
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,3027.228,3028.28,Thank you.

1980.79-1640,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3118.755,3125.377,"--Mr. Fishman, how many prosecutions under this ordinance have there been?"
1980.79-1640,3,15941,arnold_n_fishman,,3125.377,3129.412,"That I've handled, only one, and that's all I would know of, Your Honor."
1980.79-1640,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3129.412,3130.395,This is the only one?

1980.79-1640,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3141.67,3144.422,There have never any other nonconforming uses?
