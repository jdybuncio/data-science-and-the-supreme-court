1986.85-5939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We will hear argument now in Number 85-5939, Eulogio Cruz versus New York."
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,11.891,16.943,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-5939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,57.003,60.538,"Mr. Dean, a moment ago you said there were two questions presented in this case."
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,68.192,69.161,Yes.
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,144.692,172.192,"Don't you think, counsel, that there is a difference between arguing that it is admissible under a hearsay exception, and making that the basis for the admission, which is not what the state is trying to do here, and on the other hand arguing that the fact that it would have been had one sought to do that, renders the co-defendant's confession admissible?"
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,172.192,184.436,"I understand the question, but I think the crucial thing here is that they are pointing to evidence which came out periodically through the record for reasons unrelated to this question."
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.195,211.936,"What sort of a record would it take, beyond what you have, to determine whether the normal hearsay exception for admissions against interest, against penal interest, would apply here?"
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,215.721,216.121,Okay.
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.217,242.471,Would you normally be able to introduce that evidence if somebody tried to get it in under the hearsay exception?
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,242.471,243.555,"Oh, absolutely."
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,262.869,269.289,"Well, you could certainly introduce it to the jury on the basis that they shouldn't believe it, therefore."
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,278.044,278.811,"Oh, absolutely."
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,287.484,300.494,"Do you know any cases that decline to apply the admission against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule on the basis that, even though it was an admission against penal interest, there are other indicia of--"
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,300.494,303.779,"--Yes, all the New York State cases."
1986.85-5939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,447.238,465.802,"--Haven't we recognized that there is a presumption against the reliability of co-defendants post-arrest confessions, and whether they contain admissions against penal interest or not?"
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,465.802,467.685,"Right, as in Lee versus Illinois."
1986.85-5939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,467.685,473.589,"Yes, as contrasted with pre-arrest, pre-custody statements against interest?"
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,473.589,478.957,"Actually, I don't read that difference in Lee versus Illinois."
1986.85-5939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,478.957,480.158,"You mean, between the--"
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,480.158,483.194,Between the pre-arrest and the post-arrest statement.
1986.85-5939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,485.729,486.612,"--Well, it may not be."
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,497.085,497.62,"Well, perhaps so."
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.815,553.088,"In the confession that is sought to be admitted against your client by the co-defendant, he didn't seek to frame your client."
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,554.873,556.357,"No, I'm talking about the--"
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.357,557.825,--the other confession?
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,557.825,559.675,--Confession that was introduced through Norberto Cruz.
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.675,562.11,I'm sorry.
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,562.11,568.097,"But in reference to that, the co-defendant in his videotaped confession said that,"
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,611.56,618.564,"Maybe, but one would think that if there was anything he was going to lie about, it would be about the question of who pulled the trigger."
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,618.564,622.398,"Well, that might not be true if to pull the trigger--"
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.398,624.933,"And he said, ""I pulled the trigger"", and not your client?"
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,624.933,639.277,"--Right, but he pulled the trigger in self defense of his brother, and of course self defense for a defendant with no prior involvement with the law and the mentality of a five-year old child could very well be a defense to murder."
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,645.047,649.335,"If you're going to lie about it, it seems to me you'd tell a more intelligent lie to say, ""My brother pulled the trigger""."
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,649.335,655.489,"--Well, in fact there was testimony in this case that Benjamin is not an intelligent individual."
1986.85-5939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.206,791.943,Is it clear that there would have been a procedural bar to this issue being raised in the New York Court of Appeals?
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,791.943,793.46,"Yes, absolutely."
1986.85-5939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,795.145,798.514,"So, it couldn't have been raised and decided in the highest court of the state?"
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,798.514,799.164,--That's right.
1986.85-5939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.701,856.803,By the court?
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,856.803,858.036,"By the court, but once--"
1986.85-5939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.036,860.005,"But that's a jury question, then."
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,860.005,860.605,--Of course.
1986.85-5939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,865.825,869.193,Or that it is unbelievable?
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,869.193,870.729,That is exactly what he argued.
1986.85-5939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,902.765,923.745,"Well, Mr. Dean, you seem to be arguing that the more reliable the co-defendant's confession is, the less the Court should be inclined to allow it into evidence, and I would have thought that the reverse would be true, that greater reliability would lead one to think it should be admitted."
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,923.745,928.916,"The co-defendant's confession, we concede, is reliable evidence of a certain sort."
1986.85-5939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1211.284,1213.486,"You mean, if it's admissible against the defendant?"
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,1213.486,1220.823,"It it's admissible and admitted against the defendant, if the state litigates the question, then of course there is no Bruton problem."
1986.85-5939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1264.419,1270.822,"Then, the New York Court of Appeals, of course, said that they interlocked."
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,1270.822,1288.301,"--The New York Court of Appeals says that they interlocked as a factual matter and any difference in the level of interlocking as to any other form, whether its reliability that it was actually uttered, or voluntariness, or truth was irrelevant to the confrontation clause question, citing Parker versus Randolph."
1986.85-5939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1288.301,1292.855,"Well, don't you think the plurality in Parker against Randolph pretty much crossed this bridge?"
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,1292.855,1322.005,"Well, the plurality crossed the bridge, although the plurality in Parker did not actually address the question of when confessions interlock, although there is a broad reading of it which would say that any time the defendant confesses, that should be the end of the inquiry because any time the defendant has himself confessed, then there's nothing that he could have done in order to challenge the co-defendant's confession in any event."
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.823,1436.88,"Mr. Dean, I understand you don't like an interlocking rule anyway, but if the Court were to follow the plurality in Parker, what is your understanding as to what interlocking should require?"
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,1436.88,1437.665,Okay.
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1497.704,1500.073,To describe that concept--
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,1500.073,1503.775,I didn't first use the word.
1986.85-5939,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1503.775,1507.06,"--Well, your description is not that of the plurality?"
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,1507.06,1509.262,That's correct.
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1533.961,1535.496,You don't mean genuinely interlock?
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,1542.15,1544.019,"--I'm using a shorthand, yes."
1986.85-5939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1544.019,1544.619,Right.
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,1544.619,1553.125,There should be a genuine look at whether this co-defendant's confession is damaging to the defendant's case.
1986.85-5939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.125,1554.325,"Thank you, Mr. Dean."
1986.85-5939,0,39086,robert_s_dean,,1554.325,1555.826,I will reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.
1986.85-5939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1555.826,1556.576,Yes.
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1561.044,1565.348,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1603.49,1610.811,"May I ask you just there, Mr. Coddington, do you take the position that the co-defendant's confession was admitted or not admitted against the defendant?"
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1610.811,1615.215,--It was admitted with limiting instructions within the meaning of Parker v. Randolph.
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1620.083,1626.506,"I understand you are arguing separately, it would have been admissible but it was not expressly admitted against the defendant, was it?"
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1626.506,1627.539,"--No, it was not, Your Honor."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1651.221,1654.906,Why do you suppose it was not argued to be admissible in the New York courts?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1654.906,1660.827,"Well, first because we thought that it was admissible under Parker v. Randolph with limiting instructions, and for our purposes--"
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1660.827,1663.196,Wouldn't you have been better off without the limiting instruction?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1663.196,1664.412,"--I certainly would have, Your Honor."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1664.412,1667.481,Do you not presume the jury followed the limiting instruction?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1667.481,1668.083,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1669.566,1675.737,"Then, if you do, what relevance does the probative value of the second confession have?"
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1675.737,1679.723,"Well, Your Honor, that goes to substantive admissibility obviously, in the Lee question."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1680.807,1696.817,"Well, for the moment, just confine your... I understand you make that separate argument, but under your interlocking argument, if you presume that the jury followed the limiting instructions, what difference does it make whether the second confession was probative or not?"
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1696.817,1703.071,"--Well, it makes a great deal of difference to the co-defendant who is tried jointly with the petitioner."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1703.071,1705.756,"We're not arguing about the co-defendant's case, now."
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1707.889,1713.493,"That's true, but we're trying them both at the same trial, Your Honor, and we have to prove both of them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt at one trial."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1719.397,1721.098,It's important in the trial of the co-defendant.
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1721.098,1721.582,--That's correct.
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1721.582,1727.586,But what relevance is it insofar as your arguing about the conviction of the petitioner?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1727.586,1729.454,I submit that that would have no importance at all.
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1732.406,1738.81,"So, then it would be totally irrelevant that the confession either interlocked or did not interlock, wouldn't it?"
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1738.81,1739.544,"--Well, no, Your Honor."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1742.512,1743.379,"Well, that's right."
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1743.379,1749.181,And I think this Court should point out that Bruton really is an exception to the general rule.
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1777.95,1779.302,Why is there no Bruton problem?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1782.337,1786.122,"--The reason for that, Judge, is that both defendants have had their say."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1810.671,1813.873,Is it any less whether there is an interlock or not?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1813.873,1824.014,"--I submit that probably it is, Your Honor, because if they interlock then you have both defendants in effect saying the same thing, and therefore there is even less temptation to look to both confessions."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.799,1828.233,It seems to me it would work just in reverse.
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1831.937,1832.82,"--Well, I disagree, Your Honor."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1832.82,1834.02,You are more apt to rely on both.
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1834.02,1846.494,"I think the jury, under those circumstances, will be more prone to follow the Judge's instructions, perhaps because... well, as a matter of common sense, they really don't need to look to the other defendant."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1846.494,1849.981,They don't need to look to it because they've heard it and it corroborates the defendants--
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1849.981,1856.885,"Well, that would make it inadmissible under Levy-Illinois, and under Parker v. Randolph, I submit that the limiting instructions were correct."
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1906.568,1915.257,"--If the confession was inadmissible, so you couldn't have any of the confessions in the case?"
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1915.257,1916.841,I'm not quite sure I understand Your Honor's question.
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1916.841,1922.078,"Well, didn't both defendants confess?"
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1922.078,1922.878,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.612,1943.408,"So, you couldn't... if you lost this case, neither confession should be admissible, because the other defendant will object to... the other defendant will always object to the admitting the other confession."
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1943.408,1944.276,"Well, I disagree."
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1944.276,1946.876,Which means that you would have to try them separately.
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1946.876,1950.847,"That's certainly true, Your Honor, and I submit that that's a very, very poor result."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1991.841,1999.528,"Then why would you give immunity to Benjamin, because under your theory... the case was tried on a theory that his testimony wasn't admitted against this defendant anyway."
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,1999.528,2000.045,That's right.
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2000.045,2003.565,"So, how would transactional immunity for Benjamin even hurt you?"
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2003.565,2005.915,"Well, as I understand my adversary's argument--"
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2005.915,2012.004,It seems to me your argument boils down to the fact that you need the co-defendant's confession and you want to establish its admissibility.
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2012.004,2013.32,--I want to do that under Lee.
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2017.056,2020.86,But one of the reasons was transactional immunity for a witness that you say you didn't need.
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2022.71,2024.978,"Well, I don't want to immunize a murderer, Judge."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2024.978,2027.78,But you don't need his testimony under your view of the facts.
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2027.78,2039.488,"Well, this I think gets into, perhaps, harmless error as I understand Your Honor's question, and I submit that Benjamin's testimony, if error at all... and I submit that it wasn't, or rather his confession, certainly was harmless error."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.476,2048.342,"Again, if it's harmless error, it's another way of saying you didn't need his testimony."
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2051.829,2058.949,"--Well, Your Honor, we do want to try these defendants jointly for the reasons of economy, of speedy justice for all the defendants."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2066.639,2069.257,Did they ask for a joint trial?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2069.257,2069.724,Excuse me?
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2069.724,2070.924,Did they ask for a joint trial?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2070.924,2071.376,"No, we did."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.376,2071.826,Pardon me?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2071.826,2072.393,We did.
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2072.393,2074.245,But the defendants didn't want a joint trial?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2074.245,2074.828,"No, they didn't."
1986.85-5939,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2074.828,2078.53,They would rather have taken the extra delay that was involved in two separate trials?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2078.53,2086.135,"The defendants would, but I wonder if this Court should allow these defendants to speak for all the other defendants who are sitting in jail awaiting trials in their cases."
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.776,2106.466,"Could I ask you, your argument about substantive admissibility--"
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2106.466,2107.532,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.532,2109.266,--wasn't raised in the state courts?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2109.266,2110.251,"No, it wasn't, Your Honor."
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.251,2113.536,And could you have raised it in the New York Court of Appeals?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2113.536,2114.836,"That's a good question, Your Honor."
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2114.836,2116.488,"Well, yes or no."
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2116.488,2120.024,"Unclear, actually."
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2120.024,2120.524,Unclear?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2120.524,2121.057,Unclear.
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.057,2122.876,You think there's no procedural bar to it?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2122.876,2125.761,"Well, the Nieves, that case came out of our office."
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.934,2161.634,"Well, let's assume no procedural bar."
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2173.408,2174.041,Okay.
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.776,2176.093,Isn't that... you understand that?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2176.093,2177.395,"--Oh, I understand that rule, yes."
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2177.395,2178.928,"Well, then why should we reach it?"
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2178.928,2183.114,"Well, here the highest court in the state expressly decided the Parker v. Randolph issue."
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.114,2183.416,"Oh, yes?"
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2183.416,2185.816,Expressly decided the Bruton issue.
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.178,2217.937,"You just don't recognize any difference between a case that's here from a federal court and from a state court, insofar as the ability of the respondent to raise any issue that would defend the judgment?"
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2217.937,2220.822,"--I understand the rule to be the same in state and federal courts, Your Honor."
1986.85-5939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2220.822,2221.591,You do?
1986.85-5939,1,37812,peter_d_coddington,,2221.591,2230.161,"Yes, I do."
1986.85-5939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2280.88,2282.246,"Thank you, Mr. Coddington."
1986.85-5939,2,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2287.783,2298.055,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-5939,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2366.283,2368.349,"And how do you define ""interlocking""?"
1986.85-5939,2,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2368.349,2377.341,"We defined it, Justice Blackmun, as the two confessions being substantially the same and consistent on all the major elements of the offense."
1986.85-5939,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2458.709,2462.161,Do you think the confessions in this case satisfy your test?
1986.85-5939,2,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2462.161,2472.969,"We do, Justice Stevens, and we would note that all of the courts below that addressed the matter found that the statements interlocked and that both of them independently established all of the elements of the offense."
1986.85-5939,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2514.38,2526.354,"But then, if you make that assumption, why do you have to have all of the elements interlock, if you presume that the jury follows the instruction and disregards the co-defendant's confession?"
1986.85-5939,2,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2526.354,2537.745,"--Because, for example, if one confession makes out all of the elements to, say, a murder and the other one only makes out the elements to a manslaughter, then the jury might be tempted to fill a gap."
1986.85-5939,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2642.527,2647.431,"Oh, but there is this disparity, that there's no question at all that that confession was in fact made."
1986.85-5939,2,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2654.284,2659.588,"--Well, we would disagree with petitioner's characterization that there really is a serious question about whether the confession was made."
1986.85-5939,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.588,2660.607,"Well, at least you can make the argument."
1986.85-5939,2,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2662.94,2663.559,That's correct.
1986.85-5939,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2774.345,2781.701,"To the extent that it is more reliable and more credible, the more likely the jury is to have ignored the instruction and relied upon it?"
1986.85-5939,2,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2784.637,2792.742,--And they cross for the petitioner who throughout the litigation had argued strenuously that the co-defendant's confession was strongly reliable.
1986.85-5939,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2794.308,2796.527,One of the beautiful things about the legal profession.
1986.85-5939,2,39674,robert_h_klonoff,,2796.527,2797.96,--That's correct.
1986.85-5939,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2896.576,2897.426,"Thank you, Mr. Klonoff."
1986.85-5939,3,39086,robert_s_dean,,2901.278,2907.766,I would just like to address a few points that my opponents made.
1986.85-5939,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3084.881,3102.159,"I suppose whether you want to consider all those other factors for purposes of determining whether they interlock, depends on what you think the purpose of interlocking is, and perhaps if the purpose is what the government suggests, that it will make it less likely that the jury will disobey its instructions, you may be right."
1986.85-5939,3,39086,robert_s_dean,,3115.335,3116.501,"Right, but in this case--"
1986.85-5939,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3116.501,3118.87,Then in that case all you really need is the interlocking facts.
1986.85-5939,3,39086,robert_s_dean,,3118.87,3133.713,"--No, because in this case, assuming that the jury is not going to be able to obey the limiting instructions and that they are going to consider the co-defendant's confessions, and the question is really, does that damage the defendant's case."
1986.85-5939,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3155.793,3158.293,"Your time has expired, Mr. Dean."
1986.85-5939,3,39086,robert_s_dean,,3158.293,3159.578,Thank you.
1986.85-5939,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3159.578,3162.332,The case is submitted.
