1982.81-897,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.524,We will hear arguments next in the Director of the Office of Workers' Compensation against Perini.
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,57.116,58.099,Thank you.
1982.81-897,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,146.969,149.905,"Mr. Churchill did not petition for cert, did he?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,149.905,151.355,"No, he did not."
1982.81-897,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,151.355,153.169,Do you know why?
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,153.169,157.65,I am uncertain as to the actual circumstances for that failure.
1982.81-897,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,161.354,167.352,"Yes, I know, but he... if there is jurisdiction here, it has to be because you petitioned."
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,167.352,169.099,Yes.
1982.81-897,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,169.099,173.927,But it would have been so simple for... Is there any barrier to his petitioning for cert?
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,173.927,176.083,"Not that I am aware of, Justice Blackmun."
1982.81-897,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.806,283.304,Doesn't that strike you as rather strange?
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,283.304,284.349,No.
1982.81-897,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,314.152,324.131,You say it might be different if you had been the... yourself seeking review in the Court of Appeals rather than supporting the judgment of the board.
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,324.131,328.756,There is currently something of a conflict among the circuits.
1982.81-897,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,345.653,348.558,What did you lose?
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,348.558,354.851,--There is an important coverage question at issue here.
1982.81-897,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,354.851,356.618,What did you lose?
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,356.618,357.57,We--
1982.81-897,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,357.57,359.508,How much did you lose?
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,359.508,363.504,"--We didn't lose any monetary amount, if that is the question."
1982.81-897,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,363.504,365.037,"Well, what did you lose, prestige?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,365.037,375.515,"No, we lost the ability to effectively administer and interpret... to fulfill our administrative responsibilities under the Act."
1982.81-897,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,375.515,376.783,Mr. Wilkins--
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,376.783,377.126,Yes.
1982.81-897,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,377.126,385.748,"--your argument about standing doesn't really address itself, though, to the Article 3 standing question for constitutional purposes, does it?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,385.748,395.68,To the extent that we... we argue that we have administrative interests in interpreting the Act.
1982.81-897,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,411.469,427.574,"But as I understand your administrative argument, it is to the effect that you have to give advice to employees, and you would be better able to do that if you could get an answer to these questions, and is that really not in the nature of asking an advisory opinion?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,427.574,428.728,"Not really, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-897,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.319,477.02,"Well, certainly a lot of government agencies can come here without showing out of pocket loss."
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,479.114,480.273,Exactly.
1982.81-897,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,543.026,545.76,"--May I stop you right there, Mr. Wilkins?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,557.771,564.034,"--Prior to 1972, no, because the pier would have been considered land because it was permanently attached to land."
1982.81-897,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,564.034,567.766,Why wouldn't a sewage treatment plant be like a pier?
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,567.766,571.015,The sewage treatment plant itself might have been like a pier.
1982.81-897,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,584.104,585.352,I see.
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,585.352,601.567,"Although there has virtually been no... although there is no explicit discussion of the maritime employment requirement, or virtually none, prior to '72, the reported cases of this and other federal courts make it very clear that employment on the water was considered maritime."
1982.81-897,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,630.052,632.146,"--Mr. Wilkins, let me go back to that last quotation."
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,639.112,652.698,"If he had to go aboard the barge to end the delivery, and he was required to do that in the course of his employment, under pre-1972 law and under the historic construction of the term, while he was on the barge, yes, he would have been covered."
1982.81-897,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,652.698,656.415,"So if he were bringing a pizza out to Mr. Churchill for lunch, he would be covered?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,656.415,664.552,"If he was required to deliver that pizza in the course of his employment and go upon the actual navigable waters in the course of his employment, yes."
1982.81-897,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,664.552,668.705,"Mr. Wilkins, if you win, does Churchill get the money?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,668.705,670.315,"Yes, he will, Your Honor."
1982.81-897,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,670.315,672.628,And he doesn't pay anything to get it?
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,672.628,677.705,"He has retained his own attorney, and his own attorney has filed various briefs."
1982.81-897,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,677.705,681.344,"You mean the attorney is going to get paid, too, for not doing anything but sitting still?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,681.344,689.591,"No, Mr. Churchill's attorney has filed a brief in support of our petition for certiorari and a brief as a respondent in this Court."
1982.81-897,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,692.263,695.008,Have we ever had any other cases like this?
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,695.008,696.135,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-897,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,696.135,700.133,Where a party that is not an actual party to the litigation is going to collect?
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,700.133,713.487,"The Court has indeed granted, for example, in the Walter Tanson case, cited in our reply brief, we filed a petition for certiorari without the claimant, and the Court granted our petition and reversed."
1982.81-897,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,713.487,715.328,"It is strange, isn't it?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,715.328,722.577,"Well, I don't think it is strange when you consider that we have very important enforcement responsibilities that go beyond perhaps the individual interests."
1982.81-897,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,722.577,723.7,"Well, you can litigate those, can't you?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,723.7,724.418,Excuse me?
1982.81-897,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,724.418,730.54,Can't you litigate those other important positions that you take?
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,732.65,734.494,"We certainly can, when they arise."
1982.81-897,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,734.494,737.087,But the... to this Court is to decide some other case?
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,737.087,738.554,"No, Your Honor, this case--"
1982.81-897,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,738.554,738.85,Please don't.
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,740.943,743.131,--There is no question but that this is a live controversy.
1982.81-897,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,788.127,798.812,"Mr. Wilkins, in this very case, if this employee worked sometimes on the barge and sometimes on the partially completed structure, would he be walking in and out of coverage under your view of the Act?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,798.812,800.981,"Under our view of the Act, no."
1982.81-897,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,809.134,813.635,"Well, if he had been working on the partially completed structure, he would not have been engaged in maritime employment."
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,813.635,819.068,We contend that because of the substantial nature of his duties upon actual--
1982.81-897,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,819.068,821.332,"Well, take another employee with slightly different duties."
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,831.408,837.141,"--In that circumstance, no, because he still performs substantial duties of a maritime nature."
1982.81-897,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.141,840.186,"Well, the pizza delivery person, though, would walk in and out of coverage?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,840.186,846.449,That is a question... you may have a problem with walking in and out of coverage in that case.
1982.81-897,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,857.692,862.691,"I understand, but what percentage of their time has to be on navigable waters to avoid the walking in and out of coverage?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,862.691,863.927,--I can't give you an exact percentage.
1982.81-897,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.822,896.539,"But your argument... I want to be sure I understand it, because a big part of your argument is, we are talking about people who were clearly covered before the '72 amendment."
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,906.237,906.736,--No.
1982.81-897,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,906.736,909.656,"Prior to 1972, he would have walked in and out of coverage."
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,912.156,918.808,Because Congress intended to extend coverage for clearly... for amphibious workers ashore.
1982.81-897,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,921.683,924.401,But amphibious workers who build sewage treatment plants?
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,924.401,926.23,"--Amphibious workers, period."
1982.81-897,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,968.883,972.037,"Well, you don't need to win on this to win this case."
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,972.037,972.77,No.
1982.81-897,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,974.319,978.549,You don't have to decide that the worker on the sewage plant would be covered.
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,978.549,979.614,--Exactly.
1982.81-897,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,985.611,988.921,"No, but your third argument is not valid unless you win that other case."
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,993.558,997.247,We alleviate to some extent the walking in and out of coverage problem.
1982.81-897,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,997.247,997.934,"Oh, okay."
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1003.65,1011.414,"It does not, Your Honor, and I hope to address those opinions very shortly, because they are crucial to our position in this case."
1982.81-897,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1145.826,1150.182,"But you are going to get into some of those anomalies wherever you draw the line, aren't you?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1155.524,1164.427,"There may be some anomalies, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but those anomalies will be greatly alleviated as the experience of this Court has shown."
1982.81-897,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1170.943,1175.798,How does the experience of this Court show that the anomalies would be alleviated?
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1175.798,1183.719,"Well, I can answer that, but to do that I need to go into a little bit of history, and I would like to do that right now."
1982.81-897,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1377.844,1380.515,"Mr. Wilkins, may I ask you one other question on this point?"
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1380.515,1380.905,Yes.
1982.81-897,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1380.905,1387.946,Does sustaining the government's position in this case mean that there would be no recovery under a state workmen's compensation statute for this--
1982.81-897,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1387.946,1389.18,"No, certainly not."
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,1598.251,1601.14,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-897,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1674.939,1677.092,But isn't Mr. Churchill here as a party?
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,1677.092,1679.794,Mr. Churchill is here as a Respondent.
1982.81-897,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1711.376,1716.766,So you would eliminate Mr. Churchill by reason of the fact he didn't petition for cert?
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,1716.766,1718.248,That is correct.
1982.81-897,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1773.259,1781.084,"Well, as a matter... I take it your argument is resting on Article III, not on a particular statutory provision."
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,1781.084,1782.176,That is correct.
1982.81-897,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1782.176,1796.733,Hasn't our general practice been when a federal agency loses a case in which its actions are being reviewed in a Court of Appeals that there's no question from an Article III standpoint that the agency can seek review of the Court of Appeals' judgment here?
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,1796.733,1805.215,"In this particular case, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I don't believe that the federal agency has in fact lost the case."
1982.81-897,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.048,1986.155,Do you think that the Court has either impliedly or expressly decided this point before?
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,1986.155,1994.012,I think that the Court has certainly appeared to take jurisdiction in three cases: The Director against--
1982.81-897,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1994.012,1997.792,In cases where the issue was called to its attention?
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,1997.792,2011.21,"--So far as we know according to the Director's reply brief, in a footnote of the Director, in the Matter of Rasmussen the question of the Director's standing may have been addressed."
1982.81-897,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2018.361,2026.14,"Well, how about... didn't we vacate and remand a case--"
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,2026.14,2029.357,Director v. Walter Tanzen.
1982.81-897,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.463,2044.773,--And the Respondent claimed there was no jurisdiction for him to bring the case here at all.
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,2044.773,2051.957,"--As I understand it, the decision of this Court vacated and remanded based upon a petition for certiorari."
1982.81-897,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.957,2056.519,Which wasn't a holding that there was no jurisdiction or there was no standing.
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,2056.519,2063.576,I do clearly concede that it appears that the Court has taken jurisdiction of those matters.
1982.81-897,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.576,2069.998,"Well, after it having been claimed that the Director had no standing."
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,2069.998,2071.215,That is correct.
1982.81-897,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2078.788,2081.288,Tanzen was just a summary disposition.
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,2081.288,2082.633,That is my--
1982.81-897,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2082.633,2085.523,Without any written treatment from this Court of the jurisdictional issue.
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,2085.523,2086.771,--That is my understanding.
1982.81-897,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2422.012,2436.924,"Mr. Krutzel, how do you explain the language in the Senate report to the effect that the 1972 amendments were not intended to exclude other employees traditionally covered?"
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,2448.591,2457.825,"The Congressional language with respect to ""traditional covered"" has to be analyzed in context of the history of the Act."
1982.81-897,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2495.853,2505.149,"Well, Congress explicitly deleted the requirement that coverage was contingent on a state not being able to provide a valid remedy, isn't that so?"
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,2505.149,2506.101,That is correct.
1982.81-897,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2506.101,2516.802,And isn't that the very language that Calbeck found was responsible for the emphasis on the troublesome maritime but local inquiry?
1982.81-897,1,36142,martin_krutzel,,2516.802,2517.863,That is correct.
1982.81-897,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3028.998,3033.167,"Mr. Wilkins, do you have any further?"
1982.81-897,2,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3033.167,3036.122,"Just a few points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-897,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3111.074,3112.696,"Thank you, gentlemen."
