1977.76-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.84,"We will hear arguments next in number 1427, McDaniel v. Paty."
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,31.559,36.262,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.477,218.4,"Is it still on session, the constitutional --?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,218.4,220.514,The constitutional convention is still on session.
1977.76-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,220.514,225.454,Any anticipation or anything you tell from the record about when they expected it end?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,225.454,229.678,It is very difficult to predict when legislative groups in Tennessee will end.
1977.76-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,229.678,234.809,Or anywhere else?
1977.76-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,234.809,257.635,"This will happen counsel, if upon the election or upon filing as a candidate under the Tennessee law, the ordained minister renounced his ordination and resigned, would that clear him with the disability or do we not know?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,257.899,261.757,"Clearly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.76-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,261.757,263.738,He might be tainted for life?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,263.738,284.127,"You know, that issue that, we face that issue in the brief, on the waiving of this question and this was a very much question in the England, can one renounce his ministry, can one be defrocked and then run for office."
1977.76-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,346.267,352.604,In what cases have we vindicated what you describe the right to be a candidate?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,352.604,364.739,"Its my opinion Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that this was done in Bullock and in Lubin v. Panish and in American Party of Texas v. White."
1977.76-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.924,428.816,His voting rights being his right to vote for himself?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,428.816,439.903,"Yes, yes or for any other minister since this has been certified as a class action by the chancellor of the Hamilton County Court."
1977.76-1427,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,439.903,446.526,"One may be -- both may be fundamental, but only one is a constitutionally protected right, is that not correct?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,455.957,456.43,"Well, we look --"
1977.76-1427,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,456.43,463.324,"Because that case, it may necessary the amendment of our constitution to allow woman to vote, that was an equal protection case."
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,468.743,469.995,We look upon the --
1977.76-1427,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,469.995,476.799,Whereas the First Amendment protects and creates freedoms and rights to that?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,476.799,493.362,"Yes, but we think the voting rights cases of this Court are sufficient to -- as well to give -- to seek a vote."
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,493.362,496.947,Who was in this class?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,496.947,512.903,All ministers who shall be candidates for office of delegate to the constitutional -- to there is a future constitutional conventions and all candidates for legislative office.
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,512.903,515.423,"Well, how can that be a class?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,519.509,523.369,"Well, we think there may be a number of other ministers who --"
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,523.369,524.708,Then one?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,524.708,534.194,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, it is my understanding that there are several other ministers who are serving at this time as delegates to the Tennessee constitutional convention."
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,534.194,537.321,Is that in this case?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,540.592,544.796,We did not know at the time that this class was certified that --
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,544.796,550.877,But I thought the class had been numbers that there was too many to name.
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,558.225,563.629,The state class action requirement is patterned upon Rule 23.
1977.76-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,563.629,574.789,"Why does in the class include every ordained minister in the State of Tennessee, whether or not he has a present intention of running for anything?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,574.789,577.247,"Well, that is point well taken Your Honor."
1977.76-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,577.247,579.057,It is an inhibition that whole --
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,579.057,579.439,That has an inhibition --
1977.76-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,579.439,587.092,"Supreme Court is in inhibition now trusting on every ordained minister in the state, is it right?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,587.092,604.678,"I think that the -- it -- that really would not matter very much; however, because if the class for relief or afforded as appellants are, any minister who ever wanted to seek legislative office in Tennessee would be allowed to do so."
1977.76-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,604.678,614.236,But it is very important to us now for our purposes whether it is hyper class action or whether it is only one man?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,614.236,617.902,I think it is important for this reason.
1977.76-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,659.463,673.83,"Well, this Court always if it -- suppose if we disagree with the judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee our mandate as always vacated and reversed for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion."
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,686.341,718.924,"Well, the only problem that I could see coming from that is that the Supreme Court of Tennessee limited the cross appeal taken by appellant from the chancellorâ€™s ruling to this particular case and this particular statute and they relied on I believe the Storey (ph) case in Tennessee which in our brief counsel has alleged is an Epperson."
1977.76-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,730.625,732.398,You have a precedent in any event.
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,735.874,786.098,"That is quite true sir, but it is also true that chancellors and circuit judges at the local level in Tennessee may view precedents in very different lights and if this Court granted relief only as to the call for the 1976 -- 1977 convention, it is possible that some local judge may try to distinguish that away, and deny relief to some ministerial candidate for a legislative office then the election would be held and ultimately even though the state appellate court may choose to grant relief it would be faced with a very disruptive possibility of having to invalidate an election, call an election again."
1977.76-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,786.098,790.689,"Well, you would have all the same remedies that were available to you in this case, would you not?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,790.689,796.097,"You know, we are very lucky that we had a good chancellor at the local level who afforded relief and allowed our candidate to run."
1977.76-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,796.097,798.766,I am stating of the state processes -
1977.76-1427,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,798.766,800.719,Got a good circuit justice?[Laughter]
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,800.719,802.287,Very fine.
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,802.287,805.129,"But if the chancellor is still there, so the justice is still here?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,805.129,809.068,"Yeah, but we do not have him in every county in Tennessee Mr. Justice Marshall."
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,809.068,819.618,"Well, if you want us to draw a decree that stop every judicial officer in the State of Tennessee from doing wrong, forget about it ?[Laughter]"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,819.618,835.028,"We do not expect that, but we would like -- we do think that we are entitled to a decree that would prevent the state of Tennessee from ever disqualifying for candidacy for a public office."
1977.76-1427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.085,846.141,Mr. LeClercq could I ask you a question about your theory on the merits.
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,865.982,867.727,In my opinion it certainly would.
1977.76-1427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,867.727,874.828,But why would they not be forced to make the same kind of absence of choice between serving in the legislature or serving in the constitutional convention?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,874.828,901.65,"Because that is -- that is a matter of choosing between two secular offices and the state can decide that a man ought to spend all of his time on one secular office and not split his responsibilities, but the state under the First Amendment, under the Establishment Clause and under the Free Exercise Clause, state has no business interfering in what a person does one way or the other."
1977.76-1427,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,901.65,918.328,"What if their theory is that well, these people now in public office are unduly influential on the deliberations of the new body and they might think ministers are unduly persuasive, they can use certain kinds of arguments that some of the rest of us cannot use and so we better keep them out of these debates?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,918.328,948.257,"Well, as to the influence of ministers, I do not think that it would be permissible to exclude presidents of cooperations and many of them exert substantial influence, presidents of universities, many of them exert substantial influence and I would say that it would certainly deny ministers as a clientâ€™s equal protection to treat them differently from other persons who have equal or greater amounts of influence."
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,948.257,954.692,"Okay, exclude all college presidents were valid what is the Section of a constitution?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,954.692,964.135,I think it would violate Equal Protection Clause because it would be treating people who are similarly situated differently.
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,964.135,967.177,Suppose it excluded all lawyers?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,967.177,977.119,"Well, we have a reference to that in the brief, and in that column it was called the black learning Parliament."
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,986.605,991.669,But why?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,991.669,1004.994,Because it would be singling out an occupational class for invidious treatment without any reference to the capacity of that group to serve.
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1025.512,1029.326,Do you know if anybody who could be excluded?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,1029.326,1032.411,"Well, I answered Mr. Justice Stevenâ€™s question."
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1046.836,1049.102,"Well, what about all ministers?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,1049.102,1050.551,"Well, I think that was --"
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1050.551,1055.717,"Well, they are -- they are chaplains in every penitentiary in North Carolina, are they not?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,1055.717,1059.581,"Well, but whereas a minister --"
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1059.581,1060.668,Are they?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,1060.668,1062.324,I do not know.
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1062.873,1069.528,"Assuming that they are chaplains in the state penitentiaries on the payroll of the state, they exclude?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,1069.528,1074.655,I think the state might exclude any state officer because --
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1074.655,1076.486,Even if he happens to be a minister?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,1076.486,1079.439,How it say even if he happens to be a minister.
1977.76-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1079.439,1082.649,"On your theory he would not be singled out as a a minister, but as a state employee?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,1082.649,1084.105,As a state employee.
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1098.631,1101.507,"What do you think the First Amendment, your --?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,1101.507,1102.847,I think it is both sir.
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1102.847,1104.388,It is both.
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,1104.388,1118.077,And I -- that we submit this as a -- this that the -- of course the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses have been incorporated or absorbed by the Fourteenth and in that sense it is both the First and the Fourteenth Amendment case.
1977.76-1427,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1118.077,1119.671,And equal protection?
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,1119.671,1140.63,"Yes, it is an equal protection case in that we are contending that the state has denied the voting rights and rights of political candidacy to ministers and I cited earlier the cases on which we rely on voting."
1977.76-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1152.268,1156.97,"Well, ultimately I suppose your state Supreme Court would -- might be called upon to do it?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,1156.97,1169.055,"It is a very difficult task and it invites the very type of entanglement problems that this Court has tried to avoid, determining who is a minister --"
1977.76-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1169.055,1176.749,"How many -- how many denominations make all of them members, adherence ministers of that church."
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,1178.426,1179.824,"Yes, there are --"
1977.76-1427,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1179.824,1183.103,"I recall in your brief you numbered all of them or not, undertook to?"
1977.76-1427,0,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,1183.103,1201.968,"No, we -- I am sure that our list was not, was not exhaustive, but it was suggestive of the -- of a number of denominations which the Mormons for example require that each member of the faith engage in a ministry of several years, when they perform religious functions."
1977.76-1427,1,33862,kenneth_r_herrell,,1547.559,1551.674,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1606.085,1609.189,They are all expressed provisions which is --
1977.76-1427,1,33862,kenneth_r_herrell,,1609.189,1609.31,Right.
1977.76-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1609.31,1610.402,Of a transition or they not?
1977.76-1427,1,33862,kenneth_r_herrell,,1610.402,1636.868,"Yes sir, but this -- my purpose here that I want to attempt to distinguish this case as it has been decided by this Court citing certain applications of a personâ€™s right and they first categorically have cases where they are absolute that is the right pertaining to a belief."
1977.76-1427,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1781.015,1783.768,What is the valid secular objective here?
1977.76-1427,1,33862,kenneth_r_herrell,,1783.768,1788.599,"That is the separation of church and state, that I want to get into."
1977.76-1427,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1788.599,1789.824,And that is the only?
1977.76-1427,1,33862,kenneth_r_herrell,,1789.824,1791.633,Yes sir.
1977.76-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1791.633,1798.93,"But then this brings us to attention a potential conflict between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause, does it not?"
1977.76-1427,1,33862,kenneth_r_herrell,,1798.93,1808.351,That is correct and that is the point that I want to explore now on test that this Court has used in interpreting this kind of -- kinds of -- cases of this kind.
1977.76-1427,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1808.351,1814.048,Mr. Attorney General when was this provision first enacted?
1977.76-1427,1,33862,kenneth_r_herrell,,1814.048,1823.527,"It was enacted in original constitution of Tennessee in 1796, but it was carried over basically from the constitution of North Carolina."
1977.76-1427,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1823.527,1825.311,Has it been reconsidered?
1977.76-1427,1,33862,kenneth_r_herrell,,1825.311,1826.202,"No, sir."
1977.76-1427,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1826.202,1827.805,Has it ever been litigated?
1977.76-1427,1,33862,kenneth_r_herrell,,1827.805,1828.386,"No, sir."
1977.76-1427,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1828.386,1830.146,Do you think it is time?
1977.76-1427,1,33862,kenneth_r_herrell,,1830.146,1835.943,"Well, it is before the Court now."
1977.76-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1919.221,1926.022,Do you happen to know whether we have had any Presidents except one who was an ordained minister?
1977.76-1427,1,33862,kenneth_r_herrell,,1926.022,1927.325,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1977.76-1427,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1927.325,1932.636,"President Wilson was a Presbyterian minister of course, no other --"
1977.76-1427,1,33862,kenneth_r_herrell,,1932.636,1943.528,"Recall that to our attention (Inaudible), I am not aware of any other though."
1977.76-1427,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1980.369,1993.828,I thought your opponent was complained not so much about the distinctions between priests and ministers as distinctions -- as the distinction between the clergy and the rest of the population?

1977.76-1427,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2580.717,2584.874,The federal question is raised by that?
1977.76-1427,2,24238,frederic_s_leclercq,,2584.874,2598.041,It is a question of whether or not this issue must be addressed again in some other litigation after this case has been decided.
1977.76-1427,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2598.041,2603.196,What federal right were you denied by the Supreme Court of Tennessee's ruling on that aspect of the case?
