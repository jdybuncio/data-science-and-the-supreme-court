2000.00-596,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.658,"We'll hear argument now in Number 00-596, Lorillard Tobacco Company v. Thomas Reilly, and Number 00-597, Altadis, Inc. v. Thomas Reilly."
2000.00-596,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,14.926,18.728,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-596,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,79.1,87.789,"Well, what is it on the face of the statutory scheme, of the Massachusetts scheme that tells us that it is based on health?"
2000.00-596,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,87.789,99.847,"--Well, we know, Your Honor, as a matter of motivation, it's based on, the phrase is based on, so it has a subjective component to it and, as the Attorney General acknowledged when he announced the regulations... look at J.A. page 251."
2000.00-596,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,99.847,100.449,"Well, but I--"
2000.00-596,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,100.449,101.116,The reason--
2000.00-596,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,101.116,109.304,"--Before we get into the... on the... if I look at this on its face, what tells me that it's based on health?"
2000.00-596,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,109.304,118.41,"--Well, the very fact, Your Honor, that the word based on, if you look at 5(b), they use the word based on, and I think what they're trying to do is read that out of the statute."
2000.00-596,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,122.712,124.647,"Well, you want me to go to motivation again."
2000.00-596,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,127.933,129.083,"--Well, if you look at the--"
2000.00-596,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,129.083,131.235,"Just from an objective standpoint, why is this based on health?"
2000.00-596,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,131.235,141.693,"--Well, the fact is, under the ban you're not allowed to have advertisements specifically with the warning label that is required under Federal law, so in that way, operationally, it's precluded."
2000.00-596,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,151.981,164.856,So the fact that the Surgeon General's warning cannot be advertised in conjunction with a proposal for a commercial transaction means that health is adversely affected?
2000.00-596,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,164.856,167.039,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and here's the reason."
2000.00-596,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.695,218.991,"Other than the elimination and the unavailability of the Surgeon General's warning, are there any other objective and not subjective or motivational features that I... that show that this is based on health that I can determine from the... by looking at the regulatory scheme itself?"
2000.00-596,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,218.991,229.798,"Everything, Your Honor... you're saying specifically regulations themselves, and you're saying we're not going to look at why Massachusetts did that, and so just for a second we'll suspend that and assume you don't look at intent."
2000.00-596,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,242.639,251.228,"Well, of course, the very fact that they applied this to tobacco advertising and no other kind of advertising suggests something peculiar about tobacco that they didn't like."
2000.00-596,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,251.228,255.347,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, and I mean, that alone on the face of the statute proves the very fact."
2000.00-596,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,255.347,278.445,"Mr. Sutton what are... the response to that was... or one response to that was in the Massachusetts brief, and it said, look, in the real world, any... as the Chief Justice suggested, any advertising ban or lmitation directed to tobacco is going to be based on smoke... on the relationship between tobacco and health."
2000.00-596,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,304.097,306.632,"Well, Your Honor, that's an important point."
2000.00-596,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,319.606,320.489,"Well, I suppose--"
2000.00-596,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,320.489,320.956,The very point--
2000.00-596,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,320.956,330.164,"--I suppose if it were directed solely to tobacco, it wouldn't be confused with a... it wouldn't be thought to raise a conflict with the general zoning law, would it?"
2000.00-596,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,330.164,331.08,"--No, but that's my point."
2000.00-596,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,351.577,365.151,"Well, that would assume... it would assume that the State laws would be interpreted to mean that they were intended to modify zoning laws rather than intended to regulate tobacco, and I don't know that that would have been a realistic interpretation, would it?"
2000.00-596,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,365.151,367.337,"--Maybe I'm not understanding your question, but--"
2000.00-596,1,45895,william_w_porter,,1764.976,1770.361,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-596,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2977.26,2998.692,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.00-596,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3614.488,3615.821,A few brief points.
2000.00-596,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3669.889,3670.205,"Thank you, Mr. Sutton."
