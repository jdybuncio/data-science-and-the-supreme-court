1971.70-5014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.102,We will hear argument next in number 5014 Stanley against Illinois.
1971.70-5014,0,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,40.821,43.635,Mr. Chief justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,58.912,64.504,Is there a finding here of a valid common-law marriage?
1971.70-5014,0,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,64.504,69.282,Common-law-marriage was outlawed in Illinois I believe at the turn of the century in 1905.
1971.70-5014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,69.282,72.645,"Well, then how -- how can you have a common-law marriage here?"
1971.70-5014,0,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,72.645,74.441,I am using it in the generic sense of the word.
1971.70-5014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,79.672,86.267,"Of course we are dealing with legal issues here so that colloquialism really is not very relevant, is it?"
1971.70-5014,0,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,86.267,89.45,"I assume not, Your Honor."
1971.70-5014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,150.925,160.752,Was there in any occasion in that procedure that you have just described to determine paternity of the children?
1971.70-5014,0,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,160.752,168.117,"No, it was assumed by the state’s attorney and by the Trial Court and by all parties that he was the father."
1971.70-5014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,364.937,377.444,Was there any impediment that you can think of that would have prevented the petitioner here from carrying out an adoption of these children or legal adoption?
1971.70-5014,0,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,377.444,381.279,"If Peter Stanley could have adopted his children, we would not be here today."
1971.70-5014,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,388.265,390.633,Where do we find that out?
1971.70-5014,0,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,390.633,395.497,"He left his children with his long time and trusted friend, the Nesses and he said, “Would you take care of them?”"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,1547.831,1552.119,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1638.322,1639.012,Would --
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,1639.012,1640.356,And upon marriage.
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1640.356,1646.159,"Tell me under the Illinois Law, what responsibility does the unwed have for his child?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,1646.159,1648.789,Only monetary sir.
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.789,1651.717,"Well, for medical -- for medicine?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,1651.717,1652.333,Yes sir.
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.333,1654.062,For education?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,1654.062,1654.867,Yes.
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1654.867,1656.261,For food and shelter?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,1656.261,1656.713,That is correct.
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.713,1658.498,Clothes?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,1664.246,1673.739,"The married father cannot take his children, cannot abandon his children, cannot walk away from them on the street."
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1695.358,1703.549,So the unmarried father under Illinois Law is not subject the criminal penalty associated with neglect?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,1703.549,1704.499,That is correct sir.
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1725.543,1738.528,"Well, this maybe so but you still have to reach the question of why does Illinois treat the man different from the woman in this respect?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,1750.286,1761.891,"Because of the fact sir that through a combination both of history, cultural patterns and real physical differences between the sexes they are different sir."
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.823,1794.007,You do not think the woman would have an equal protection claim who said that she should not be criminally penalized for certain acts when the father of the child is not subjected to same (Inaudible) --
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,1794.007,1806.367,"No sir, she would have no such claim unlike the case, the invidious discriminations of race or religion in which the classification is unrelated to a permissible state objective."
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.687,1832.359,"Why should it impose in terms the welfare of the child, why should it impose the same obligation on the male?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,1832.359,1851.255,"Because unlike the case of married male and female in which the parties have signified their willingness to work together to the rearing of the children, the male and female in this case may or may not be willing to work together towards the common end of child rearing."
1971.70-5014,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2063.639,2082.145,Are you suggesting that in the present state of the record we should view this case as one in which there had been a paternity proceeding and it had been judicially determined that this man was the father of the child or children?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2082.145,2095.407,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, the contrary I am suggesting that the only fact that this Court can take cognizance of is that Peter Stanley, the petitioner was not married to the mother of the children."
1971.70-5014,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2098.752,2100.689,"Well, let me put it in a different way."
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2110.679,2112.817,"No sir, not at all."
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.174,2143.95,"Well that was irrelevant too under the Illinois Law because he is a father, he is not a parent."
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2143.95,2164.046,"That is correct sir, which I suggest that by noting that there has to be a judicial proceeding to determine the rights of one who claims to be a legal father over the children and who would seek to gain legal control over them."
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2196.078,2204.05,"You are saying until he has proved to be the parent the equal protection point is not right for any parent, does he not?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2204.05,2205.687,That is correct sir.
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.979,2210.24,This of course (Inaudible)
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2210.24,2226.168,The Illinois Supreme Court did not pass directly on the matter noting that petitioner had not challenged it in the Lower Court and left him to his remedy of applying for adoption or guardianship.
1971.70-5014,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2226.168,2232.248,He has to take it that not denial of equal protection that treats the unwed father different from the unwed mother?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2232.248,2232.902,Correct sir.
1971.70-5014,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2232.902,2244.141,"So the point was raised, passed on (Inaudible) and it was with your with your case is the case here on that premise?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2244.141,2245.46,Yes sir.
1971.70-5014,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2245.46,2249.368,Do we not have to reach it?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2258.568,2264.511,Only if this Court does not accept the determination of the Supreme Court of Illinois that since the petitioner Stanley --
1971.70-5014,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2264.511,2266.448,"No, you do not understand question."
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2266.448,2266.684,I beg your pardon?
1971.70-5014,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2266.684,2272.729,"My question is the premise in which the case here is that he is the father of the children, is it not?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2272.729,2273.313,Yes sir.
1971.70-5014,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2273.313,2278.748,Alright and the equal protection argument is made on that premise?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2278.748,2279.648,That is correct.
1971.70-5014,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2279.648,2280.347,Alright.
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2280.347,2291.854,But this Court need not to accept as a fact that the petitioner Stanley as a matter of fact is the father of the children.
1971.70-5014,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2439.571,2463.934,"You have -- I am not sure on if I understand you when you talk to, rely upon which you call our culture, rely upon history and upon physical differences but that I understand and I understand the interest in adoption and the interest of legitimizing the children."
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2468.882,2482.25,Only that through a combination of historical circumstances brought about sir at least in part by virtue of physical differences between the sexes.
1971.70-5014,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2504.642,2516.381,So our culture as you put is really -- that is not an additional -- that is not an additional support for the state classification that is additional to history or the physical?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2516.381,2516.883,No sir.
1971.70-5014,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2516.883,2518.733,Distinguishing characteristics?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2518.733,2521.998,"No sir, (Voice Overlap) it is merely a product of those --"
1971.70-5014,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2521.998,2523.333,Product of those?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2523.333,2524.31,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-5014,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2524.31,2540.856,"Well, I guess you –- Is this what you summed up at page 25 while a temperament toward child rearing may be largely a product of societal condition, these temperamental patterns have been so deeply ingrained within rest of the civilization, that they cannot be ignored?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2540.856,2546.509,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan and it is the holding of White versus Florida."
1971.70-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2589.575,2602.27,"Mr. Friedman suppose Stanley had married this woman he had been living with two days before she died, what would his position be?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2602.27,2612.518,"Mr. Justice Marshall, he would then be classified as a legal parent and entitled automatically the custody and control of them."
1971.70-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2612.518,2613.722,The same man?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2613.722,2615.638,Yes sir.
1971.70-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2615.812,2620.894,"But he changed, when he married he changed?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2620.894,2623.134,"No, he did not change one bit."
1971.70-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2636.286,2639.005,I do not see any change of anything.
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2639.005,2653.905,"He change not at all but by the act the marrying the woman he became liable under law for more responsibilities than he had before. He became liable for the schooling, for sending the child to school."
1971.70-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2653.905,2656.019,That makes him more fit parent?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2664.363,2666.183,That is correct sir.
1971.70-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2666.183,2668.864,"Well as to the child, what difference?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2668.864,2685.016,"That Peter Stanley be now after marriage is legally responsible for his welfare and as to the child, that the child has legal duties towards Peter Stanley."
1971.70-5014,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2695.664,2709.253,"Is it not true that the fact Mr. Stanley just caught by all of this custom and practice and everything that has been going on for all these years, that in fact, is not all, does he?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2709.253,2710.905,Not at all Justice Marshall.
1971.70-5014,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2710.905,2720.521,"Or have they change his status it certainly among other things made him ineligible to legally marry anybody else, has not it?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2720.521,2721.394,I am --
1971.70-5014,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2721.394,2738.614,"Well, once you marry, at least again in our culture and under our laws, if a man marries a woman it changes his status at least to the extent that he his legally ineligible to marry anybody else until he divorces that wife or she died?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2738.614,2746.908,"Yes, Mr. Justice and in addition he is responsible too not desert and tend for the children."
1971.70-5014,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2746.908,2747.535,Right.
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2747.535,2763.315,By the adoption formality which is exactly comparable in this case to the formality of the marriage ceremony he is merely undertaking the same rights as a male does by the act of marriage.
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2869.453,2884.373,Yes but here the unwed father cannot adopt just like going in and saying but I want to adopt and I want to -- I will file a piece of paper that I accept all the responsibilities that you are saying I do not have.
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2897.253,2914.743,That is correct Mr. Justice White but to give the father the children for the asking of him to make their legal custody and control dependent only on the will of the father is to make the children chattels and to deny to the children any opportunity and with that in person --
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2914.743,2932.683,"Well that is -- but we are still talking about the position of the father with respect to the unwed mother, the position of the father with respect to say they divorced, the divorced father and several other categories?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2932.683,2945.805,But those -- but the unwed father while he does have a biological relationship or he may have with the children that is not the determining factor.
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2956.667,2971.708,"Well, but the state must concede that there is a quite a category of unwed fathers that are going to abandon their children or who refuse to act with respect to them like a parent and you must concede that there is quite a category of unwed mothers who abandon their children?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2971.708,2972.694,That is correct sir.
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2972.694,2981.155,And yet we treat all unwed mothers in one way and all unwed fathers in quite a different way?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2981.155,2982.845,Initially I would observe.
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.845,2987.514,"And it would not do him any good in this dependency hearing to say, look I am fit."
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,2999.329,3002.17,In answer to your last question Mr. Justice White.
1971.70-5014,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3017.143,3029.105,"But at the same you concede that they are handed over to take your term to the natural mother without any inquiry of that kind, is that right?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,3029.105,3030.029,That is correct.
1971.70-5014,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3030.029,3036.617,And you justify that on the grounds of these cultural and biological and historical practice?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,3036.617,3044.125,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice and the fact that the woman is necessarily present when the child is born, she is there and identifiable."
1971.70-5014,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3044.125,3055.291,But does that not go only to the question of whether he is in fact the father which I had understood you to have conceded?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,3075.19,3078.022,In fact the paternity is not relevant to that.
1971.70-5014,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3085.493,3093.179,Then why does it not help your case any that the mother is present at the birth of necessity?
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,3093.179,3093.712,Because in that case --
1971.70-5014,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3093.712,3095.826,You can emphasize that.
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,3095.826,3106.116,"Because in the case of the case of the married couple, the father will generally participate not in the act of birth but from that time on in caring with the child."
1971.70-5014,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3106.116,3110.76,"Well, this man is trying to participate, but Illinois will not let him?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,3110.76,3111.937,No Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-5014,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3132.418,3132.433,You mean --
1971.70-5014,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3132.433,3141.704,"Yes, but did he do all things that you say that a married father would do from the birth of these children until the time that Joan Stanley died?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,3152.676,3153.469,No sir.
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3165.492,3181.509,"Well, you say that the state should consider him as the children -- apparently the interest in the children were irrelevant in this proceeding in the sense that they taken from what is conceived to be the father and given to some guardian?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,3181.509,3182.47,"No sir, they were not --"
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.47,3189.637,"Well, they were declared dependent and guardians were appointed for them?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,3189.637,3195.99,"That is correct, but it is the petitioner Stanley who placed the children with the Nesses."
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3195.99,3196.802,"I understand that, the state --"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,3196.802,3199.482,"The Nesses, whether that was done --"
1971.70-5014,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3199.482,3214.522,"And the state, as the result of this proceeding automatically without considering the interest of the children specifically in this proceeding legally forbade his custody in the immediate future?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,3214.522,3215.336,No sir.
1971.70-5014,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3286.762,3295.823,"Let me call your attention to one, two comments from the Supreme Court of Illinois opinion which I am not too clear about."
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,3339.546,3342.092,I would submit that to be a mere inadvertence sir.
1971.70-5014,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3350.658,3362.403,"Mr. Friedman do you know, do other States have situations similar to this one here, statutes like this?"
1971.70-5014,1,35803,morton_e_friedman,,3362.403,3364.196,"Yes sir, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1971.70-5014,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3383.685,3385.989,"Thank you, Mr. Friedman."
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3407.085,3408.567,"I would find difficulty, Your Honor."
1971.70-5014,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3415.432,3416.627,But we are only concerned with what --
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3416.627,3417.004,The adopt --
1971.70-5014,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3417.004,3418.433,-- is said in this case.
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3418.433,3429.117,I would assume that the Illinois Supreme Court realized that he may have had the theoretical possibility to adopt the children as he did at that time.
1971.70-5014,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3429.117,3441.687,"So the question of that -- at least now that the law has been clarified in Illinois, it is clear, is it not, that he is an eligible applicant."
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3445.901,3449.39,I think the law is clear that he has a theoretical possibility to adopt.
1971.70-5014,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3456.865,3468.605,We should not -- is there not some possibility that your client ought to be exhausting his state remedies before he asks this Court to get into this difficult --?
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3468.605,3470.043,We did exhaust our state remedy.
1971.70-5014,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3470.043,3470.435,Beg your pardon?
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3470.435,3471.371,We did exhaust our state remedy.
1971.70-5014,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3471.371,3473.824,Including adoption?
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3473.824,3474.651,(Inaudible)
1971.70-5014,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3474.651,3476.809,"It is not a constitutional claim at all, is it?"
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3484.833,3485.15,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-5014,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3485.15,3486.397,He just be the child's mother?
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3486.397,3487.819,"Yes that is correct, their claim is that --"
1971.70-5014,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3487.819,3491.642,Let us stay on my question if you will and address your self to that point.
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3491.642,3492.595,Fine.
1971.70-5014,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3559.075,3564.89,"It would have been apparently eligible suitor in history, would he not?[Laughter]"
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3564.89,3565.842,They term a bachelor.
1971.70-5014,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3573.319,3580.675,Mr. Murphy what could she possibly gain by not marrying him under the circumstances?
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3580.675,3587.967,"Your Honor, as I say I do not -- why what makes a woman do what she does is beyond my comprehension very well."
1971.70-5014,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3594.014,3612.584,A little while ago you said that Levine against Vincent was of no consequence here and yet there also the opportunity was afforded the father to have legitimatized these children for inheritance purposes in any event and he failed to do so.
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3612.584,3613.005,But the --
1971.70-5014,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3613.005,3617.478,Now I take it it you distinguish this because you say marriage is a two-way street?
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3617.478,3619.324,"Well, the difference is there, so different in here."
1971.70-5014,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3635.861,3639.02,"Well, the father was not interested in gaining the estate of the son."
1971.70-5014,2,38117,patrick_t_murphy,,3639.893,3642.494,"Excuse me, it was the other way around, it was the son."
1971.70-5014,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3651.009,3653.407,"Thank you, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Friedman."
