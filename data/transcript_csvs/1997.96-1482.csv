1997.96-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.891,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 96-1482, Lexicon, Inc. v. Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes & Lerach."
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,14.341,16.676,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,79.868,86.772,"Well, there is a line you omitted, is there... it doesn't say by the... from the district to which it was transferred, or--"
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,86.772,95.728,"That is section 1404(a), which is the general transfer statute, pursuant to which the District of Arizona transferred this case to itself."
1997.96-1482,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,108.536,116.807,"--Now, Mr. Kellogg, under your theory when should this... your suit have been remanded?"
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,116.807,125.58,"It should have been remanded at the time specified in the statute, which is at or before the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings."
1997.96-1482,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,125.58,137.055,"Well, was that when the Lincoln Savings litigation ended, when the consolidated proceedings ended, after summary judgment was entered, when?"
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,138.471,139.521,The appropriate time--
1997.96-1482,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,139.521,140.34,--when under your theory--
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,140.34,147.511,"--The appropriate time in this case is at the time that Lexicon made its motion to remand, because the various factors cited--"
1997.96-1482,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.511,150.713,--And what had happened at that time?
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,154.081,160.401,"--Well, the multidistrict panel cited three factors as reasons for sending this case to Arizona."
1997.96-1482,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.1,189.671,But no determination had been made on summary judgment in your case.
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,189.671,190.773,--That is correct.
1997.96-1482,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.056,192.723,"Now, maybe--"
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,192.723,194.058,--no determination had been made.
1997.96-1482,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,194.058,200.895,"--Maybe the district court, pursuant to that original transfer, could go ahead and decide that, could it not?"
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,200.895,202.83,"Not pursuant to the statute, Your Honor."
1997.96-1482,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.353,215.721,So when the consolidated proceedings had ended you say it had to go back.
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,215.721,217.023,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1482,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.023,225.261,"And, in fact, it did not, and a jury trial was held, and it was... the jury determined that against your client."
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,225.261,226.129,That's correct.
1997.96-1482,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,226.129,229.915,"And at that point, what's the remedy?"
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,238.27,250.411,"Well, because venue is like subject matter jurisdiction in the sense that if it is not waived the case must be reversed afterwards."
1997.96-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,251.094,252.263,What is your authority for that?
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,252.263,255.215,--That was the holding of this Court in the Olberding case.
1997.96-1482,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,257.982,262.119,"But those were cases of wrong venue, Mr. Kellogg, were they not?"
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,279.513,293.071,"This is a case of wrong venue, Justice Ginsburg, even though respondents argued that we could have filed the case in the District of Arizona, but the fact remains, we did not file the case in the District of Arizona."
1997.96-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,299.741,300.676,Illinois.
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,300.676,317.036,"At the time it was transferred to the Northern District... to Arizona, it was transferred only for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings pursuant to 1407(a), and the statute specifies that at the conclusion of those proceedings the case must be remanded."
1997.96-1482,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,321.69,327.244,May I go back over your initial answer to Justice O'Connor about summary judgment.
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,352.875,353.727,That's correct.
1997.96-1482,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,353.727,357.363,"So summary judgment sometimes, 1404(a) never."
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,357.363,362.75,Summary judgment in appropriate circumstances could be granted by the transferee court.
1997.96-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,363.533,364.583,And what are those circumstances?
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,364.583,365.202,--Pardon?
1997.96-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,365.202,366.869,And what are the appropriate circumstances?
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,366.869,371.273,"In the appropriate circumstances where it's part of coordinated, consolidated pretrial--"
1997.96-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,371.273,379.961,You mean if every single case involves the same summary judgment motion?
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,379.961,380.911,--Right.
1997.96-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,394.804,408.796,"So you're saying consolidated means that which is common to all, rather than referring to simply a collection of cases which are consolidated for whatever pretrial proceedings there might be involving common issues?"
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,408.796,414.433,"The statute says consolidated and coordinated, so the cases are brought together."
1997.96-1482,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,424.907,432.411,"But I'm sure there are many multidistrict litigation instances where the trial court said, now, there's three different kinds of cases."
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,447.587,455.593,The key point for our case is that there is a durational limitation built into 1407(a).
1997.96-1482,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,492.802,500.806,"Mr. Kellogg, do you agree that under the rule, 14(b), what the district court did here was proper?"
1997.96-1482,0,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,500.806,503.54,I agree that the JPML rule--
1997.96-1482,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1645.066,1649.501,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1482,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1703.57,1705.588,I don't know that they said he couldn't get a fair trial.
1997.96-1482,1,32967,jerold_s_solovy,,1714.894,1716.496,"--I do contest that, but that's--"
1997.96-1482,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3439.495,3443.613,"Are you going to respond to Mr. Solovy's last point, that you never went back to the panel?"
1997.96-1482,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3481.155,3499.799,"Can I ask you this, on that particular point: what's worrying me about... venue and jurisdiction are proper in both places, not proper, but they lie in both places, so we're really asking the question of whether a 1404 error, a 1404(a) error is reviewable despite the fact that there was a trial."
1997.96-1482,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3528.136,3531.42,"Yes, exactly, but we're not dealing here with an abuse of discretion action."
1997.96-1482,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3531.42,3541.026,"No, but if you win, don't we also have to say that the trial doesn't cure an abuse of discretion in a transfer in respect to convenience of witnesses?"
1997.96-1482,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3541.026,3541.893,I don't think you do.
1997.96-1482,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3578.485,3582.703,May I ask if you would take the same position if the transfer had been to a different district?
1997.96-1482,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3582.703,3588.007,"--Well, then we would not rely on 1404, but our position would be exactly the same under 1407."
1997.96-1482,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3598.13,3605.053,"So your basic position, and it's consistent with the question presented in the cert petition, doesn't really rely on 1404."
1997.96-1482,2,36128,michael_k_kellogg,,3607.755,3617.626,"In the first instance, but we also in our cert position said can he transfer it to himself, and that's an independent violation which we were allowed to, and did, raise."
1997.96-1482,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3663.072,3663.988,"Thank you, Mr. Kellogg."
