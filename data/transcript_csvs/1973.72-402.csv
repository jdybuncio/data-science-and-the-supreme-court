1973.72-402,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,48.66,We’ll hear arguments next in United States against General Dynamics Corporation.
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,51.799,55.025,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,164.725,165.987,That was in 1959?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,165.987,167.123,That was in 1959.
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,167.123,169.208,I just -- I’m not -- you went a little fast for me.
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,169.208,169.854,I am sorry.
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,169.854,174.528,Material was the dominant stockholder in Freeman?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,174.528,177.421,Material owned all of Freeman’s since 1942.
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,177.421,178.961,Was the sole stockholder of Freeman?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,178.961,179.952,Sole stockholder.
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,179.952,182.762,And Freeman began acquiring Electric’s stock?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,182.762,185.097,United -- Material Service.
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,185.097,186.226,Material not Freeman?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,186.226,188.231,"That’s right, begun acquiring United Electric stock in 1954."
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,188.231,193.878,And did so beyond the -- during the period between 54 and 59 in which time it had acquired something over 30%?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,193.878,195.243,That’s with 34%.
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,195.243,198.551,"And at that time, the -- now you’re just starting to tell that the Operations Director --"
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,198.551,207.525,"At that time, the President of Freeman became the Chief -- the Head of the Executive Committee of the United Electric and there was a shift in the board of directors."
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,218.864,226.109,And the other 66% of the stock of Electric in 1959 was broadly held or held out?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,226.109,227.355,Medium broadly held.
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,273.523,276.494,Through -- directly or through Freeman?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,276.494,277.796,I believe directly.
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,278.243,284.391,"So then, Freeman owned 34% of the stock and General Dynamics began from zero."
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,284.391,284.725,"From zero, but General Dynamics --"
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,284.725,286.374,The number of shares and began building up its ownership?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,286.374,290.938,But General Dynamics of course indirectly owned all of Freeman through Material Service.
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,290.938,292.517,But Freeman owned the 34%?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,292.517,297.736,"Freeman owned the 34%, but of course at that point on, General Dynamics had complete control of Freeman."
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,297.736,298.217,"Well, I know, but there was --"
1973.72-402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,298.217,299.671,Is that Material or Freeman [Inaudible]
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,299.671,302.966,"I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Material, I’m sorry Mr. Justice."
1973.72-402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,302.966,304.09,But not Freeman?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,304.09,318.627,"Freeman did not own any of the stock of the -- and it’s my understanding that the stock after General Dynamics was acquired control of Material Service, it was then General Dynamics that in turn proceeded to acquire more United Electric stock."
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,346.993,350.898,"Well, what had -- when in the Government’s view was the acquisition then in this case?"
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,350.898,368.251,"We say the acquisition was for -- in 1959, but we say moreover the acquisition continued to be solidified up until 1967, but we think 1960 -- 1959 was the acquisition and that as I will develop is an important factor in connection with the clients --"
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,368.251,373.713,"Well, I know it it is and therefore, you can’t say well, it was in 1959, it was also in 1967?"
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,373.713,375.491,"No, we think it was in 1959."
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,376.951,378.46,"The date is quite important, isn’t it?"
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,378.46,388.451,"It is, yes Mr. Justice and we think in 1959, there was an acquisition cause there's a practical matter, has shown what happened, they got control of the company."
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,388.451,390.624,"Who, not -- the General Dynamics wasn’t there at all?"
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,390.624,391.291,No.
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,408.753,419.86,"Now, is there any dispute between the parties to this case, (a) as to whether or not there was an acquisition within the meaning of Section 7 and (b) as to when that acquisition took place?"
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,419.86,423.741,I think -- I don’t believe Mr. Justice that they’d challenged that there was an acquisition.
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,431.245,439.376,"As I read your brief, you kept getting an alternative, 59 (r) of 1966, and it seemed to me that the dates can be rather critical."
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,439.376,446.453,"Yes -- I think Mr. Justice of -- after further study of the case, we would say the acquisition did take place in 1959."
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,446.453,449.481,But you think there may not be agreement between you and your brothers on that.
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,449.481,450.435,I think there may not.
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.638,452.993,Alright.
1973.72-402,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,452.993,455.094,When did the Government file its complaint in this case?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,455.094,462.598,"In 1969 -- I am sorry, 1967, in September 1967."
1973.72-402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,691.03,692.798,All in this area?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,692.798,697.172,"All in the State of Illinois Mr. Justice, all in the State of Illinois."
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,998.083,999.846,These customers being electric utilities primarily?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,999.846,1001.385,Mainly primarily electric utilities.
1973.72-402,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1005.597,1009.804,May I interrupt -- is metallurgical coal use for fuel?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1009.804,1012.279,"No, it is not Mr. Justice."
1973.72-402,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1018.086,1019.061,What about Freeman?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1019.061,1024.102,Freeman produces approximately 8% of its product is metallurgical coal.
1973.72-402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1264.83,1267.249,"Well, it’s a -- part of -- it is a kind of coal they sell?"
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1267.249,1268.831,It is the kind of -- it is a kind of --
1973.72-402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1268.831,1270.63,And what kind of customers they have?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1270.63,1273.562,Some of that -- but it doesn’t -- the Court doesn’t say that exactly.
1973.72-402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.179,1333.323,"What about this -- excluding Commonwealth that is none of the sales by United Electric in the two year -- in the critical years chosen by you would have or could’ve been competitive with Freeman, had the two companies been independent?"
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1334.727,1335.795,We disagree with that.
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1335.795,1336.26,On page 62-9.
1973.72-402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1336.26,1338.794,"That is a flat finding though, isn't it?"
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1338.794,1341.821,"That is a flat finding, but our basic answer --"
1973.72-402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1341.821,1348.483,And how are we going to -- use it -- must we turn that over for you to win?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1348.483,1350.716,I don’t think -- I don’t think so Mr. Justice.
1973.72-402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1351.267,1358.068,"Let’s assume you took that -- let’s assume you agreed with the District Court on his competitive, no competition findings."
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1370.093,1371.18,"No, we don’t think so."
1973.72-402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1387.8,1392.11,"I understand that, but some of the things he says that sort -- primarily on competition."
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1394.666,1395.743,"Well I think, I think Mr. Justice --"
1973.72-402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.743,1409.326,Even if you looked at coal as the market like you suggest that you would still arrive at his conclusion and even if you use your geographical markets to derive the same thing?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1409.326,1420.708,"I think Mr. Justice, he is using -- when he says these sales are not competitive, he uses it in a very, very narrow sense, not as we define competition within the meaning of Section 7."
1973.72-402,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1475.182,1479.883,"Well, that’s -- lets assume we agreed with you that the Court erred in the product market."
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1494.301,1512.872,"Well, if the Court could reverse on the market definitions and remand for the District Court to consider the case further in the light of those, we would think, however, since there is a full record before this Court and since the basic facts on which we base our case are really not disputed."
1973.72-402,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1598.295,1618.209,"As I read this record, I haven’t gone to look entirely of course, but I get the impression that we have here in totality whether large monopoly -- a fuel monopoly, oil companies, gas companies, owning coal companies and owning uranium companies, is that right?"
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1618.209,1619.044,"Well, there’s no --"
1973.72-402,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1619.044,1621.905,Does that bear from this problem before us?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1621.905,1624.05,I don’t think so Mr. Justice.
1973.72-402,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1666.919,1676.303,"That’s not affected by the fact that if this, if I read the record correctly, there is a monopoly of oil and gas over coal?"
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1676.303,1677.931,"Well, not -- no."
1973.72-402,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1687.534,1690.951,I understand 25 of them have.
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1690.951,1694.345,"I don’t know how many, but we know there’s a substantial number."
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1731.442,1751.036,"As I understand your argument, it runs exactly counter to the suggestions contained in the question of my Brother Douglas, because the District Court thought that the relevant market was the energy market, and you said that he was quite wrong and that he should have confined himself with -- to coal alone."
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1751.036,1751.86,Yes.
1973.72-402,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1755.562,1759.413,That’s why the District Court got off on the -- on that trail of the (Voice Overlap) --
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1759.413,1760.032,"Not, no."
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1776.724,1781.109,And you say -- you say that was quite erroneous that he should -- that the relevant market is coal.
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1781.109,1781.716,That’s right.
1973.72-402,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1811.201,1815.801,"You don’t deny the existence of an energy market area as such, do you?"
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1815.801,1825.88,"No, and Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, for example, if we had a merger between an oil company, a natural gas company and a coal company, the energy market might be the relevant market."
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1840.924,1846.079,And specifically and within the geographic market of the Eastern Interior Coal products?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1846.079,1848.962,"Coal and sales area, and the State of --"
1973.72-402,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1848.962,1851.72,"Which is what, one of five or four provinces?"
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1851.72,1863.614,"Well, there are four -- there are basically four provinces, and we have gone beyond the province to include a slightly broader area which is where the vast majority of coal produced in the province is sold."
1973.72-402,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2160.194,2170.368,"Mr. Free -- Friedman, what if free -- what did Freeman do between 1959 and the date of trial with respect to the acquisition of additional reserves?"
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2170.368,2171.857,Of strip reserves or deep reserves?
1973.72-402,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2171.857,2173.207,Any kind of reserves?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2173.207,2183.4,"I don’t -- I’m not certain Mr. Justice, but Freeman of course had a very large; much greater reserves than United Electric at the time of this -- the acquisition."
1973.72-402,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2245.096,2255.654,Did the total reserves of General Dynamic that is controlled by Dynamic through these two subsidiaries increased substantially between 59 and date of trial?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2255.654,2256.871,I understand so.
1973.72-402,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2258.861,2259.98,"That would be in the record, I suppose."
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2259.98,2260.724,I think so.
1973.72-402,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2261.968,2263.132,I know.
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2263.132,2267.824,"Well, I have looked through the 3,500 pages, frankly, I haven’t been able to check every exhibit."
1973.72-402,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2276.598,2294.43,The thought underlying my questions is that General Dynamics with its vast resources was perhaps in a better position to acquire additional reserves than either one of these companies independently would've been and I wonder whether it exercised that economic power that it had?
1973.72-402,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2294.43,2302.729,"Well, I -- let me say Mr. Justice, there’s an exhibit in the record that shows that United Electric was a very prosperous company."
1973.72-402,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2440.605,2447.11,Thank you Mr. Friedman.
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,2452.715,2456.597,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.922,2518.807,You think a finding of that -- the -- that the -- this merger would not have an adverse effect on competition or it’s subject to that -- clearly erroneous?
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,2518.807,2524.403,I think that the facts which support that legal conclusion are --
1973.72-402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2524.403,2525.551,"So, your answer is no?"
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,2525.551,2529.001,My answer to that is no.
1973.72-402,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2699.299,2708.237,"One of the findings that you have just reviewed was the acquisition took place in 1959 and you accept that argument, I would think so?"
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,2708.237,2709.112,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1973.72-402,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2713.276,2714.695,But now the Government agrees with you.
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,2714.695,2716.172,Now the Government agrees with us.
1973.72-402,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2716.172,2719.472,"So, my earlier questions were a red herring type."
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,2721.092,2723.764,"I think they’ve been answered, Mr. Justice."
1973.72-402,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2723.764,2733.126,"Is there any indication why if this had the adverse effect on competition the Government claim, the Government waited eight years after the acquisition to bring the action?"
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,2733.126,2738.75,"There is no explanation of that in the record at all, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1973.72-402,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3143.325,3146.067,It’s an incredible plea for judicial notice?
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,3146.067,3146.813,Yes.
1973.72-402,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3146.813,3148.219,And what are -- what --
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,3148.219,3149.128,The judicial notice that they request --
1973.72-402,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3149.128,3152.874,What -- why do they hesitate to judicial -- to judicially know?
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,3152.874,3158.774,"That United Electric will acquire additional reserves in the future, that is what the plea for judicial notice is Your Honor."
1973.72-402,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3158.774,3162.58,I see.
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,3162.58,3166.779,"Finally, on United Electric’s inability to regain its lost competitive position in the future --"
1973.72-402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3166.779,3183.389,"Excuse me, Mr. Hedlund, on this record isn’t it there some indication that estimates of future reserves were quite far over the mark when they were made just relatively in recent years?"
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,3183.389,3189.528,"To the contrary Mr. Chief Justice, I think the record is the other way."
1973.72-402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3214.551,3221.5,"Well, and the point I was driving at, I thought this record indicated that earlier estimates proved to be too optimistic."
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,3221.5,3221.701,Oh!
1973.72-402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3221.79,3224.287,And their reserves ran out much sooner than the --
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,3224.287,3224.793,That’s correct.
1973.72-402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3333.463,3355.209,"Well, I gather your -- one of your arguments must be that as a -- in terms of United’s condition in 1959, anybody, no matter who the acquirer was could have acquired United without any damaging effect on competition because of its position in the market."
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,3365.147,3381.014,"And that would be my position Mr. Justice White, but I don’t believe I need to go back far because in the context of this case, you have the lack of competition between Freeman and United Electric."
1973.72-402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3381.014,3390.761,"Well, would you say that Free -- did Freeman get any customers through United?"
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,3390.761,3392.87,No.
1973.72-402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3392.87,3394.346,Did they make some joint bids?
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,3394.346,3395.689,No.
1973.72-402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3395.689,3400.779,Did they -- did Freeman help United to carry out some of its contracts?
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,3400.779,3413.645,There were four instances and I believe these are mentioned in our brief where United Electric was able to enter into long-term contracts.
1973.72-402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3428.098,3432.957,What did that did do the other two competitors?
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,3432.957,3439.495,The two competitors of Freeman it did not to -- it has to be looked at it seems to me from the utility stand point.
1973.72-402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3439.495,3447.171,"Well, whatever the competition, the two other competitors if one or the other who might wanted to to get that utility customer?"
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,3447.171,3454.416,If permitted United Electric to provide more vigorous competition against the coal companies with whom they were competing.
1973.72-402,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3454.416,3456.718,Because of the union with Freeman?
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,3456.718,3461.797,That’s correct.
1973.72-402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4174.24,4177.198,Did you have the page in the transcript for that?
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,4177.198,4178.453,I'm sorry Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-402,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4181.511,4183.923,"Well, its page 45 of your brief."
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,4183.923,4186.754,That’s correct.
1973.72-402,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4589.831,4591.137,That was the question.
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,4591.137,4593.415,A question sir.
1973.72-402,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4661.701,4672.966,"Mr. Hedlund, would you comment on the nature of the competition or however you describe it between these two companies with respect to Commonwealth Edison?"
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,4672.966,4677.038,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1973.72-402,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4757.974,4763.821,Does the record show how many suppliers of coal are used by a Commonwealth Edison?
1973.72-402,1,39553,reuben_l_hedlund,,4763.821,4764.87,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-402,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4820.187,4821.066,Thank you Mr. Hedlund.
1973.72-402,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4825.316,4828.41,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1973.72-402,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5011.055,5011.88,Thank you Mr. Friedman.
