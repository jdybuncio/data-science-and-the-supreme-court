1982.81-1494,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.904,We will hear arguments first this morning in Block against Neal.
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,8.387,35.387,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a suit arising under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and specifically the issue is whether a suit against the United States alleging that a federal employee negligently inspected a home purchased from a private developer but with federal moneys is a claim arising out of a misrepresentation and therefore barred under the Federal Tort Claims Act, specifically, Section 2680(h) of the Act."
1982.81-1494,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,119.743,122.045,"It really wasn't much of an inspection, was it?"
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,122.045,126.497,"No, sir, it was not the best inspection that one could have hoped for."
1982.81-1494,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,255.58,264.436,"Mr. Phillips, you referred two or three times to the claim as one claiming a negligent inspection."
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,270.875,277.529,"Well, the problem with that is that there is nothing specific in the complaint with regard to exactly what they meant by supervision."
1982.81-1494,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,283.183,295.407,"Well, but the complaint never went to trial, and under the federal rules you presumably are entitled to adduce any number of facts in support of even a generally pled allegation."
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,303.847,309.148,But that is only if there is something in the statute that would provide for supervision in addition to the inspection--
1982.81-1494,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,309.148,310.15,I realize--
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,310.15,318.522,"--and there is nothing in the statute to that effect, so that at issue... the only thing that could potentially be alleged and be consistent with the statute is the negligent inspection."
1982.81-1494,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.522,330.128,"--Well, you say that even the 1949 Act doesn't authorize or require the government to supervise as opposed to inspect."
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,330.128,330.996,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,350.724,353.743,"Mr. Phillips, doesn't it... Excuse me."
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,372.221,374.657,"Well, I mean, as required by the Secretary."
1982.81-1494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,397.57,403.64,And it is your position that the Secretary has never authorized any supervision of construction?
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,403.64,412.163,Not in the way that would be anything other than by... that would be covered... not in any way that is not covered under the misrepresentation exception to the Tort Claims Act.
1982.81-1494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,412.163,417.281,"And Section 1822.7, which says,"
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,427.006,430.708,"Sure, because that doesn't... that still is supervision of the borrowers."
1982.81-1494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,460.727,475.737,"Are you arguing that the government has under the laws established here no duty to the owner of the home, that the law creates no duty in this area?"
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,475.737,478.353,"Well, I mean, that is what the district court held, and the court of--"
1982.81-1494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,478.353,479.439,Was that your position?
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,479.439,486.758,"--We did not argue that in this... It would be my position, that we owe no specific duty to this... to the Respondent in this case."
1982.81-1494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,487.46,487.977,Under the law.
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,487.977,488.544,Under the law.
1982.81-1494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,502.054,502.52,"Well, how about the federal law?"
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,509.474,509.958,"--Well, no--"
1982.81-1494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,509.958,511.076,--by these services?
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,511.076,513.71,"--No, I... no, that is not our submission."
1982.81-1494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,546.131,548.333,And there is no secondary duty?
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,548.333,552.701,No secondary duty that would give rise to any kind of tort liability.
1982.81-1494,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,552.701,570.496,"If the government is responsible or assumes responsibility for anything like architectural supervision, that certainly is... the thrust of that sort of a liability, if they fail to perform it, isn't misrepresentation at all."
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,583.32,588.541,We recognize that there is a difference between misrepresentation and various forms of malpractice.
1982.81-1494,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,604.502,611.239,I thought you identified the question in the case as whether the United States has waived sovereign immunity for this kind of a tort action.
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,611.239,612.006,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1494,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,612.006,620.095,So whether you owed a duty or not or whether you broke it is irrelevant to that question.
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,620.095,639.907,"Well, that is correct, except that under this Court's decision in United States versus Neustadt, the way the analysis should run is, first, whether the basic activities of the government are within the misrepresentation exception which we submit means an inspection which may be negligently performed followed by certification of some facts followed by injury."
1982.81-1494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,704.313,721.759,"Mr. Phillips, let's assume for a minute that the complaint did allege something beyond misrepresentation, alleged that there was a duty on the part of the agency to force the builder to fix the home by some means, and the complaint alleges that."
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,730.531,732.416,"You mean, within the meaning of Section 2680(a)?"
1982.81-1494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,732.416,733.099,The government has discretion?
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,733.566,738.534,"Well, I would guess... I mean, it seems fairly clear... it depends on how the regulation would be stated, I guess."
1982.81-1494,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,771.156,774.358,"Well, then, what is it... what do they require?"
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,775.726,779.261,"Well, I think it is clear... it would clearly be discretionary."
1982.81-1494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,836.413,841.633,"Well, but Mr. Phillips, Mr. Phillips, you are not suggesting there is discretion to make a negligent inspection, are you?"
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,841.633,843.419,Well--
1982.81-1494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.419,846.621,Assuming there were a duty to inspect.
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,854.642,870.152,"--If there were... if this were a private person who undertook... we don't... although there is no development factually of what went on here, we don't deny that it is certainly possible that a private inspector could be held to a duty to exercise due care under the good Samaritan doctrine."
1982.81-1494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,870.152,876.806,"All right, and if we accept the allegations... if we accept the allegation in the complaint, must we not assume... maybe it's not true... that the inspection was conducted negligently?"
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,876.806,878.506,"Well, that's right, and we don't dispute that."
1982.81-1494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,878.506,884.126,"And had the inspection been conducted properly, they would have discovered the defect and they wouldn't have paid for the heat pump."
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,884.126,886.995,"Well, but I mean, that is just as true under United States versus Neustadt."
1982.81-1494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,888.38,891.149,"Well, but that goes to the issue of misrepresentation."
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,891.982,893.466,--You just want to ignore the misrepresentation--
1982.81-1494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,893.466,895.184,--For this very narrow purpose.
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,895.184,897.469,--I would be prepared to concede for purposes of this argument that that is right.
1982.81-1494,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,911.443,918.632,"Prior to 1946, would there have been any action sustainable against the government, prior to the Tort Claims Act?"
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,918.632,919.582,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1494,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,919.582,926.655,"The Tort Claims Act, did it waive all sovereign immunity, or did it have some exceptions?"
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,926.655,929.857,It has a very lengthy set of exceptions.
1982.81-1494,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,929.857,933.392,"For governmental functions, primarily discretionary governmental functions."
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,933.392,934.909,"That's correct, Section 2680(h)."
1982.81-1494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,934.909,940.062,"But again, you are not relying on that in this case."
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,940.062,941.747,"No, we don't rely on the discretionary functions."
1982.81-1494,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.747,942.53,You are just relying on the misrepresentation exception.
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,942.53,943.28,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1494,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1000.665,1004.283,"You find no difference in the two Acts, the one involved--"
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1004.283,1011.473,--No difference that would make any kind of a difference to take the case out of the misrepresentation exception.
1982.81-1494,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1044.694,1054.65,"--Isn't there a difference that in Neustadt the misrepresentation was made before the purchase, and here it was made after the purchase?"
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1054.65,1056.418,"Well, there is some dispute about that."
1982.81-1494,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1077.331,1078.015,That is not in the record.
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1078.015,1078.781,--I am sorry?
1982.81-1494,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1078.781,1080.45,That is not in the record.
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1080.45,1081.633,"No, Your Honor, that is not in the record."
1982.81-1494,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1089.889,1093.258,I didn't say... I didn't say I was interested in facts outside the record.
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1093.258,1093.791,"--Okay, Your Honor."
1982.81-1494,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1114.504,1118.575,Suppose the inspection had not been made at all.
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1121.86,1131.132,"Well, the regulations don't actually require us... I don't... my recollection is that the regulations suggest that we make inspections at various times."
1982.81-1494,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1153.129,1154.414,"That is essentially this case, isn't it?"
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1154.414,1154.897,--I'm sorry?
1982.81-1494,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1154.897,1156.647,That is essentially this case.
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1171.174,1172.876,"Well, she looked through the house."
1982.81-1494,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1189.568,1192.337,"Well, someone else went out later and discovered all kinds of things."
1982.81-1494,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1192.337,1199.693,"But, see, there is an inherent advantage, if somebody has been living in the house for two months, and has started to use the house and the dwelling."
1982.81-1494,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1287.918,1288.434,Very well.
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1294.155,1319.436,"Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, despite the government's attempt to torture the allegations in the complaint in this case to fit the misrepresentation exception to the Tort Claims Act, this case was not, is not, and cannot be a case that arises out of misrepresentation."
1982.81-1494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1353.157,1357.192,"Mr. Croce, are you reading from the complaint now, or summarizing it?"
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1357.192,1358.227,I am not reading from the complaint.
1982.81-1494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.417,1372.619,And then you are about to go into a list of the omissions.
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1372.619,1373.435,Yes.
1982.81-1494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1373.435,1374.685,Are those contained in the complaint?
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1374.685,1381.391,"Those are contained in the factual allegations of the complaint, which preceded the cause of action, the statement of a cause of action."
1982.81-1494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1613.821,1615.404,What time of year did she move in?
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1616.604,1618.189,What time did she move?
1982.81-1494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1618.189,1619.573,What time of year did she move in?
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1619.573,1623.01,"She moved in some time in October, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1623.01,1625.879,"Well, couldn't she figure out the minute she moved in that she didn't have any heat?"
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1625.879,1629.331,"Your Honor, that was not in the record, and I can answer your question."
1982.81-1494,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1725.126,1750.693,"Mr. Croce, under your theory, do you suppose that when the federal government through its agencies inspects a toy or a drug, for example, to determine whether the product is safe, and then declares it safe, that someone later injured because in fact it is unsafe has a cause of action under your theory against the government?"
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1750.693,1754.562,"First, I want to make one thing clear, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-1494,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1813.017,1822.455,Is it your position that Ms. Neal had no responsibility at all?
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1822.455,1835.346,"No, Your Honor, but the actions by the Farmers Home Administration and the extensiveness of it barred her or precluded her from seeking outside help."
1982.81-1494,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1838.465,1840.417,You said barred her from seeking--
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1840.417,1841.634,I think it prevented her.
1982.81-1494,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1842.786,1843.386,--How?
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1843.386,1846.488,"--Because they gave her, by their conduct--"
1982.81-1494,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1846.488,1847.304,But she could have gone--
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1847.304,1848.038,"--and activities, that she was--"
1982.81-1494,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1848.038,1853.808,"--She could have gotten a good inspection made and paid for it, couldn't she?"
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1856.093,1856.643,--Yes.
1982.81-1494,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1858.545,1863.449,"Well, then, you do say that the whole basis is, she had no responsibility."
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1863.449,1867.734,--I don't say that.
1982.81-1494,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1873.138,1873.971,And?
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1873.971,1878.542,"In that they undertook what they did, she necessarily relied upon them to exercise due care."
1982.81-1494,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1878.542,1880.292,And she had no responsibility.
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,1880.292,1881.244,That's correct.
1982.81-1494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1990.096,2008.593,"Mr. Croce, do you think either the Sixth Circuit or the district court in this case passed on the question of whether her allegations apart from the inspection theory stated a claim against the government?"
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,2008.593,2014.914,"--Yes, I think the court of appeals clearly saw that we were talking more than just merely an inspection report."
1982.81-1494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2018.281,2036.66,"Well, I don't read in the Sixth Circuit's opinion any specific pronouncement one way or the other about whether if you prove these facts, the government under either the '34 Act or the '49 Act did have an obligation imposed by statute to perform these services."
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,2036.66,2050.67,"It is our contention that the statute, 506, and the regulations under that statute clearly impose upon Farmers Home an obligation to supervise and inspect."
1982.81-1494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2050.67,2051.503,I realize that.
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,2051.503,2066.345,"I don't think that is really material, because whether or not Farmers Home performed those services under its statutory obligation or regulatory obligation or voluntarily undertook them, the fact is that they did."
1982.81-1494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2067.262,2082.522,"So part of your complaint is not only that there was a duty to supervise that was breached, but that the duty of supervision was undertaken whether required by law or not, and that on the good Samaritan theory it was negligently performed."
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,2082.522,2083.255,--That's correct.
1982.81-1494,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2184.922,2188.541,"Neustadt began swallowing the Act, didn't it?"
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,2188.541,2201.765,"We believe it did to a certain extent, insofar as courts have had difficulty drawing a line in the continuum between negligence and negligent misrepresentation."
1982.81-1494,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2395.759,2399.294,Let me ask you just one additional question.
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,2411.434,2412.72,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-1494,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2412.72,2413.203,"Oh, thank you."
1982.81-1494,1,34208,lenny_l_croce,,2413.203,2414.838,It wasn't raised in any of the courts below.
1982.81-1494,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2414.838,2421.492,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Phillips?"
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2421.492,2423.778,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, just briefly."
1982.81-1494,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2459.867,2469.89,"Mr. Phillips, as I understand from Mr. Croce, the allegation... one of the allegations in the complaint is that the government undertook to supervise, and did so negligently."
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2469.89,2474.794,--All that the complaint says is that the government negligently supervised.
1982.81-1494,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2480.781,2483.65,But you don't indicate that in a complaint under the federal rules.
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2491.819,2511.133,"I appreciate that, Justice Rehnquist, but if the only supervision provided for in the regulations and provided for in any of the factual statements is the inspection of that house, then to say that there has been negligent supervision is to say no more than that there was a negligent inspection of the house, and that is all the complaint states."
1982.81-1494,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2515.752,2526.81,"Well, but if they say... the allegations they could introduce in support of an allegation of negligent supervision go much further, I would think, than just negligent inspection."
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2526.81,2535.498,"Well, they couldn't... I mean, unless you are going to assume that there is something outside of the regulations, and there is no indication that anyone acted in addition to what the regulations provide."
1982.81-1494,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2535.498,2536.648,"Well, but the case has never gone to trial."
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2536.648,2540.236,"I understand that, but there has never been any claim anywhere that--"
1982.81-1494,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2540.236,2544.271,There is an allegation of negligent supervision in the complaint.
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2552.727,2553.727,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1494,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2558.762,2566.416,Yes Mr. Phillips but is it not true that there is a distinction between an obligation to supervise and the authority to supervise?
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2601.748,2602.331,Thats correct but--
1982.81-1494,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.331,2606.616,"Then if it is performed, then doesn't the Good Samaritan Doctrine come in to play?"
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2606.616,2611.437,--Only to the extent that the only way the supervision is performed is through the inspection process.
1982.81-1494,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2613.303,2614.555,"Well, but the statute says--"
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2614.555,2616.289,--we don't serve as the foreman for the construction company.
1982.81-1494,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2616.289,2622.543,"--The statute says, authorized to provide construction supervision and inspection."
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2622.543,2624.994,"Yes, I appreciate what the statute says."
1982.81-1494,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2626.362,2627.596,So you do have authority to supervise.
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2627.596,2632.95,"--Our regulations say that we will inspect, and that is done as our burden of supervision."
1982.81-1494,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2632.95,2633.683,Your regulations say you will supervise.
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2633.683,2634.3,I am sorry?
1982.81-1494,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2634.3,2636.152,Your regulations say you will supervise.
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2636.152,2642.372,"To the extent necessary to help the borrower, which in this case means to undertake an inspection."
1982.81-1494,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2698.976,2710.366,"Mr. Phillips, what is the specific provision in the agreement on which the claimant relied for the duty undertaken by the government?"
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2718.789,2720.872,You mean in her cause of action for--
1982.81-1494,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2720.872,2723.157,"Yes, is that the section?"
1982.81-1494,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2723.157,2723.591,"--Yes, ma'am."
1982.81-1494,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2724.359,2724.926,All right.
1982.81-1494,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2724.926,2727.061,"Thank you, gentlemen."
