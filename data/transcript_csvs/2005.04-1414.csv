2005.04-1414,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.708,"We'll hear argument first today in No. 04-1414, United States v. Grubbs."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,8.173,11.563,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1414,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,101.632,116.909,"I think, Mr. Dreeben, at the end of the day, I agree with you on the particularity argument, but do you take the... does the Government take the position that the... that the... that a valid warrant need not contain an indication of the time within which it may be served, executed?"
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,116.909,118.974,"That's right, Justice Souter."
2005.04-1414,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,125.334,126.648,As far as--
2005.04-1414,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,126.648,129.226,What would prevent the issuance of just a blanket warrant?
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,134.059,147.852,What would prevent the valid execution of a warrant that had no time limits whatsoever would be the requirement that a warrant must be supported by probable cause.
2005.04-1414,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.36,175.736,I suppose that a warrant like a... like a contract has a... a reasonable life.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,186.876,211.109,"I think it absolutely just lasts a reasonable time, Justice Scalia, and the reason why there is very little law and very little litigation on this is that since the 1917 statute that Congress originally wrote to provide for the issuance of Federal search warrants, it's provided for a 10-day execution period, and that 10-day limit has been contained and continued in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure."
2005.04-1414,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,212.163,220.307,"Mr. Dreeben, I understood you to say a short while ago that if it were executed before the triggering event, it would be invalid because there was no probable cause."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,220.307,224.359,"--Well, I... I don't want to say that there's no probable cause for the warrant."
2005.04-1414,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,224.359,226.967,"No, you don't because then the warrant shouldn't have issued."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,226.967,227.427,No.
2005.04-1414,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,260.656,270.918,Even... even if the warrant did not specifically say that it was an anticipatory warrant and that... and that you can only execute it after the delivery?
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,270.918,279.905,"That's right, Justice Scalia, because there is an independent requirement that probable cause must exist at the time of the execution of the warrant."
2005.04-1414,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.19,284.881,But I thought that's supposed to be a... a magistrate's determination.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,284.881,286.786,--There are two separate things that are going on.
2005.04-1414,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,328.549,336.16,"If they become aware, but the... it's a big leap from that to say that they must make their own determination of probable cause."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,336.16,341.696,"--Well, I... I think, Justice Kennedy, the easiest example to... to see why this--"
2005.04-1414,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,341.696,347.194,"You... you indicated a warrant can't be served unless they determine there's probable cause, but that's for the magistrate to do, as Justice Scalia--"
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,347.194,359.952,"--I... what I... I'm making a separate point here, which is that officers have a continuing obligation to act reasonably in the execution of a warrant, and of course, they fulfill that in a variety of ways."
2005.04-1414,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,396.983,400.835,"Well, does that mean that the executing officer must be the same officer who got the warrant?"
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,400.835,403.082,"No, it certainly doesn't, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-1414,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,403.082,408.788,I don't know why he's going to give a warrant to his... some just call in a police officer and say I want you to execute this warrant.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,413.675,424.024,"Well, I... I think in the ordinary instance, it would be reasonable for the team of executing officers to be responsible for the inquiry that I'm talking about and any individual officer--"
2005.04-1414,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,424.024,426.031,"--Well, there's no... there's no authority for that."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,437.777,440.395,"--Well, the warrant is obtained based on an affidavit by--"
2005.04-1414,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,440.395,447.043,"I mean, if you want us to write the opinion with this qualification in it, it seems to me that you're making a big change in the way search warrants are used."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,447.043,455.277,"--Oh, I don't think it's a big change at all, Justice Kennedy, and I... I think what I'm trying to make clear here is that there's an ongoing obligation of reasonableness."
2005.04-1414,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,459.548,467.994,"--But... but, Mr. Dreeben, there's an ongoing obligation of reasonableness in the manner of which the... in... in the manner in which the search is carried out."
2005.04-1414,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,535.998,541.044,The affidavit... wasn't the affidavit available to the executing officer?
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,541.044,544.474,"--Well, in this case, Justice Ginsburg, the... the affidavit was on the scene."
2005.04-1414,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,579.658,584.681,"It... it was... I take it it was, in fact, not attached but it was somewhere on the premises."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,584.681,586.646,--It was not... it was not physically attached.
2005.04-1414,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,587.609,591.551,So an officer who picked up the warrant would not be able to tell necessarily.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,601.019,616.948,"--Well, in the abstract, I suppose that that's right, but in... in the concrete circumstances of this case... and I think it's consistent with what I was trying to explain is reasonable search warrant execution... all of the search team was fully familiar with the process that was going on."
2005.04-1414,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,635.222,643.427,"Well, but the facts of the triggering event are not always going to be so clean, and in many cases they're going to require an exercise of judgment by the officer."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,662.011,664.569,"--Well, I don't think that is the point of the Fourth Amendment."
2005.04-1414,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,725.953,738.591,"Yes, but doesn't that simply... isn't the analogy there that when a... when a search warrant says you may... you may pick up implements of drug traffic, all it covers is drug traffic."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,747.969,754.156,"Well, the point, Justice Souter, is that they have to make a judgment that criminal conversations are what is going to be intercepted."
2005.04-1414,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,754.156,757.267,But those... those are judgments about facts that they are finding.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,762.272,766.414,"Well, they're... they're not judgments here about probable cause either because the magistrate has--"
2005.04-1414,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,766.414,767.649,"Well, it is."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,776.334,780.867,"--Well, that's a separate question, and I think the magistrate's question is, is there probable cause?"
2005.04-1414,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,784.136,788.87,"And his judgment, though, is there will be probable cause when the triggering event occurs."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,788.87,789.762,That's right.
2005.04-1414,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,789.762,790.533,And so the triggering--
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,790.533,790.794,No.
2005.04-1414,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,791.286,798.257,"--the triggering event has a probable cause implication, which the selection of objects to be seized does not have."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,798.257,806.12,--I... I have to say that I disagree fundamentally with the suggestion that he's saying there will be probable cause when the triggering event occurs.
2005.04-1414,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,816.181,817.613,"Well, he's saying two things."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,836.983,854.002,"Well, I... I don't think that there's any reason linguistically to prefer your formulation, Justice Souter, to the formulation that says there's probable cause to believe now that when the warrant is executed, in accordance with the triggering condition's occurrence, the property will be found."
2005.04-1414,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,854.002,857.193,"Of course, that's not what the... what the warrant says."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,865.968,873.161,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I think the warrant should be read as a whole and not, as this Court has indicated in many cases, a technical sense."
2005.04-1414,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,901.928,905.728,The affidavit itself says there is now concealed a certain person or property.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,907.012,908.959,"--Well, I think the... that is correct, too, because this--"
2005.04-1414,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,908.959,911.677,"--If you read the whole affidavit, you know it doesn't mean what it says there."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,911.677,922.089,"--I think that not only do you know that the... this was clearly intended to be an anticipatory warrant as to the videotape, but it also authorized the search for other items that were related to--"
2005.04-1414,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,922.089,924.777,May I ask you this question?
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,940.905,953.312,"--Wiretaps, Justice Stevens, are regulated extensively by Federal statute, and under Federal statute, a wiretap order contains a myriad of details that are not specified by the Fourth Amendment."
2005.04-1414,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.726,976.95,"No, but I mean in describing the authority of the investigating officer to execute the warrant, does it describe it just in terms of a physical number that can be listened, or one or more numbers, plus a time period, or does... does it say you may listen only when he's talking about foreign affairs or--"
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,976.95,983.179,--It specifies the crimes that are being investigated and it contains a minimization requirement which--
2005.04-1414,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,983.179,986.799,"--It's a minimization as to what they will transcribe, isn't it?"
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,986.799,997.883,--It's a minimization as to what conversations they will intercept if they listen to a conversation and determine that it falls outside the scope of what they're authorized to intercept.
2005.04-1414,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1023.108,1034.141,"Mr. Dreeben, could... could I ask you if the Government would... would defend a... an anticipatory warrant in these circumstances?"
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1075.815,1082.917,"Justice Scalia, I... I would certainly with respect to search of common areas."
2005.04-1414,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1085.454,1091.111,"Well, then... then... well, I'm sorry to hear you say that because then you are really not saying that there has to be probable cause."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1091.111,1091.432,--No.
2005.04-1414,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1091.983,1099.695,Because at the outset there's no probable cause to believe that any one of those 17... unless you think one seventeenth is enough for probable cause.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1099.695,1102.393,"--Well, I think one seventeenth is pushing it for probable cause--"
2005.04-1414,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1102.393,1102.563,Yes.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1102.563,1105.552,--which is why my answer was as to the common area.
2005.04-1414,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1115.913,1117.559,"Yes, but I'm not talking about a particular location."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1122.732,1123.185,Yes.
2005.04-1414,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.185,1127.097,We want a warrant that will let us go in immediately when we see it delivered.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1128.0,1133.937,With... if what you're talking about is invading the individual expectations of privacy of... of 50--
2005.04-1414,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1133.937,1134.308,Yes.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1135.843,1142.633,"--No, I... I wouldn't because I don't think that... that one fiftieth in those circumstances would... would be probable cause without more."
2005.04-1414,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1143.384,1146.735,"No, but there's no... there's no probable cause until the triggering event."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1156.05,1171.9,"--This case is different because there... you... you can subtract out all of the variables except will the postal officials, in fact, deliver it to the place where they're saying they will deliver it and they say that they're delivering it to a household that has actually placed the order."
2005.04-1414,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1171.9,1172.081,"Well, that's not true."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1175.4,1180.013,Then the... then the warrant should not be executed because this affidavit said that--
2005.04-1414,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1180.013,1182.1,So there are a lot more things than just the delivery.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1183.665,1200.436,"--I think that that... it's fair to say that it's not 100 percent controlled by the Postal Service, but I wouldn't say that there are a lot of things that are left up in the air or that there's any more that's left up in the air than in the kind of experience that goes on in installing a wiretap."
2005.04-1414,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1200.897,1203.213,"Well, what... what... take this variable."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1234.344,1245.066,--Not under this warrant because it was secured by an affidavit that represented that it... the warrant will not be executed unless and until the item is taken inside the house.
2005.04-1414,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.939,1297.595,"Yes, but you don't want us to decide the case on that ground."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1297.897,1300.605,"--Well, I don't think this was such a warrant, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1414,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1315.41,1323.254,Could you elaborate just a little bit for me on why you think this case is different from Justice Scalia's hypothetical with the 17 people?
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1335.408,1338.178,It's... it's fundamentally different.
2005.04-1414,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1376.211,1383.604,--It is probable that this package will be delivered to this individual.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1386.945,1387.276,That's right.
2005.04-1414,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1387.276,1389.663,And that's the probable cause you're relying on.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1389.663,1389.964,That's right.
2005.04-1414,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1389.964,1393.132,It is probable that this package will be delivered to this individual.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1393.132,1393.513,That's right.
2005.04-1414,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.626,1403.471,But that probability does not support the truth of the statement that the person or property so described is now concealed at the place for the issuance of the warrant.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1403.471,1422.506,"--Well, I... I think this takes me back to the fact that this warrant, number one, should be construed as a whole and not... not by virtue of which box was checked and, number two, that there were many items that were specified in the warrant that... and the warrant application that the agent had reason to believe were then concealed at the time."
2005.04-1414,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.963,1438.134,"Of course, if the... if the stuff was already there that supports the warrant and the search, we don't even reach the question of a... of the anticipatory warrant."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1438.134,1439.197,"Well, I think you do in--"
2005.04-1414,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1439.197,1446.428,I should say I... I've approached the case on the assumption that the only thing we're worried about is whether... whether the anticipatory part is okay.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1446.428,1446.82,--And that is--
2005.04-1414,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.82,1450.63,"But it doesn't seem to me to be a fair response to say, well, we had other grounds for--"
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1450.63,1451.281,--No.
2005.04-1414,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1476.345,1481.429,--But... but you would defend the warrant even if the only thing they were looking for was the stuff delivered at the... at the time.
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1481.429,1483.466,"--Yes, and that's the only thing that's before the Court."
2005.04-1414,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1483.466,1486.274,"And as to that aspect of it, the warrant is incorrect."
2005.04-1414,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1486.274,1487.726,Yes.
2005.04-1414,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1487.726,1488.136,The warrant itself.

2005.04-1414,1,36577,mark__j_reichel,,1753.106,1763.378,"Yes, because the magistrate has determined that there's probable cause to believe that at the time of the search, the contraband, the purpose of the search, will be present in that particularly described location."
2005.04-1414,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1763.378,1766.067,"Right, and... and likewise, it... it would work the other way."

2005.04-1414,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1781.85,1789.381,"So the magistrate is always looking to the condition when... when the warrant is executed, and that's all that's happening here."

2005.04-1414,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3353.881,3360.039,So why was there a need for a second call when exactly that happened?
2005.04-1414,1,36577,mark__j_reichel,,3360.039,3365.887,"Well, specifically what was highlighted in this case is that the individual receiving the package was his wife, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-1414,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3394.06,3395.454,Didn't... was... he was on the premises?
2005.04-1414,1,36577,mark__j_reichel,,3395.454,3396.457,--He was inside the--
2005.04-1414,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3396.457,3398.482,"And he said, I know why they're here."
2005.04-1414,1,36577,mark__j_reichel,,3398.482,3401.821,"--Justice Ginsburg, he was inside the house, and he walked outside thereafter."
2005.04-1414,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3401.821,3408.121,"Well, and they... and they found other... other videotapes besides the one that had just been delivered, didn't they, in the course of the search?"
2005.04-1414,1,36577,mark__j_reichel,,3408.121,3410.426,"They did, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1414,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3429.083,3437.026,And exactly the same thing would be true if they had stated the triggering event clearly somewhere in... in the warrant.
2005.04-1414,1,36577,mark__j_reichel,,3442.022,3455.083,"But this does... Justice Souter, this highlights why the triggering event must be clearly, specifically drawn by a magistrate with studied caution about the exact factors for probable cause which would allow this search."
2005.04-1414,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3469.173,3470.387,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-1414,1,36577,mark__j_reichel,,3470.387,3471.981,Thank you.
2005.04-1414,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3471.981,3475.323,"Mr. Dreeben, you have 3 minutes remaining."
2005.04-1414,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3475.323,3477.267,"Mr. Dreeben, a quick yes or no."
2005.04-1414,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3486.205,3496.255,"Yes, Justice Scalia, because the representations that are made to the magistrate to secure the warrant include the fact that the warrant will not be executed and the agents should--"
2005.04-1414,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3496.255,3497.478,But that... that puzzles me a little.
2005.04-1414,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3509.645,3515.905,--That's true because I think that the magistrate is making the common sense judgment that this will be... we don't know exactly when--
2005.04-1414,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3515.905,3524.259,"I mean, not even... it is not only the warrant, but the affidavit itself doesn't say we merely request permission to search after the... after the event."
2005.04-1414,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3526.276,3539.907,"--It makes the representation, and I think what draws the link between the conditions that are represented to occur before the warrant will be executed and the warrant itself are paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the items that are to be seized because those pertain--"
2005.04-1414,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3539.907,3540.187,No.
2005.04-1414,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3543.676,3545.281,"--I understand that, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-1414,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3551.733,3555.002,"Yes, but the authority is broader than the authority to search for those items."
2005.04-1414,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3555.002,3555.653,That's true.
2005.04-1414,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3575.772,3581.282,But it takes a step of reasoning beyond merely saying we incorporate the... the affidavit into the warrant.
2005.04-1414,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3581.282,3591.191,"--I think it takes a very small step of logical inference, but I agree with you, Justice Stevens, that it doesn't say everything that is logically implied in the magistrate's probable cause finding."
2005.04-1414,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3633.897,3636.537,"So you just want us to say, look, the Ninth Circuit is wrong."
2005.04-1414,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3648.112,3654.098,"No, I don't want the Court to send it back to the Ninth Circuit to impose yet new requirements on the execution of warrants."
2005.04-1414,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3676.647,3677.3,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
