1964.232,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,55.694,"Number 232, United States versus Boston & Maine Railroad et al."
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,59.968,62.927,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1964.232,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,249.049,253.982,Where there is one bribe.
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,253.982,259.839,"Well, the bribe case, we think, presents a slightly different question."
1964.232,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,278.868,281.445,What about cash payments?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,281.445,287.674,"Cash payment would raise, perhaps to attenuated a -- an -- an interest."
1964.232,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,311.539,316.114,Am I wrong in my recollection here that this involved a cash payment?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,316.114,332.432,"Well, these involved payments of $71,500, all except a payment of, I believe it was, $1,500 being subsequent to the transaction."
1964.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,362.657,366.268,Why isn't that just a bribe?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,366.268,375.904,"Well, I -- I suppose you could describe any type of grant -- an interest in the company as a bribe."
1964.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,376.625,395.457,"Well I understand -- I understand your point that if the bribe were in the form of shares of common stock of the bribing corporation, that would be a substantial interest because that meets the common ordinary sense of that term “substantial interest,” a proprietary interest, an ownership interest."
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,402.608,403.569,"Well let me suggest, first of all --"
1964.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,403.569,403.908,What made it different?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,403.908,408.741,-- that calling it a bribe may not mean that they didn't have a substantial interest in the company.
1964.232,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,494.522,497.241,"The defendant was silent partly, is that your theory?"
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,497.241,500.882,I think that's quite true.
1964.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,736.589,744.736,"In a situation presented by this case or at least the allegations of indictment of this case, what's the -- what's the importance of this question?"
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,765.321,773.548,"I suppose there's no importance than that the appellees have violated two counts, two -- I'm sorry, two separate statutes."
1964.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,793.288,794.218,And that there was no defense.
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,794.218,795.73,"And, this is a misdemeanor."
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1037.755,1041.698,What about the antitrust aspect of the statute?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1043.54,1044.011,"Yes, sir."
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1044.011,1046.762,Not just a conflict of interest statute.
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1049.98,1051.045,The antitrust sta --
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1051.045,1056.251,"Which, I would assume, would be directed towards the accumulation of power."
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1056.251,1062.299,"Let me say, first of all, that Section 660 which is the embezzlement and conversion statute is also one of the antitrust laws."
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1077.852,1079.604,The only thought right here --
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1079.604,1080.431,The mere fact that deals --
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1080.431,1084.192,"And, right here, that the carrier can be fined along with the embezzling officer."
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1084.192,1092.441,"Well, sir, I'll come to that but let me finish about the antitrust aspect of it."
1964.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1265.416,1276.227,The real wrong here was the failure of the Boston & Maine to go with these things on a competitive bidding basis the way the statute is read.
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1276.227,1279.669,That's correct.
1964.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1279.669,1289.68,"And the criminal, the way the statute is written, is the Boston & Maine Railroad which could be fined up to $25,000 or not --"
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1289.68,1290.442,That's correct.
1964.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1291.35,1293.57,-- selling these cars on competitive bidding.
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1293.57,1294.54,That is correct.
1964.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1295.103,1305.278,"Now, what kind of a law is it that makes the -- a person who was robbed a criminal because of that robbery and there -- and has to pay $25,000 more?"
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1305.278,1312.545,"Well, I think this derives, in large part, from the concept of the fictional being of the corporation."
1964.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1342.196,1347.824,"But, under the statute, must -- much less punishable by -- much lower."
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1347.824,1352.107,The statute recognizes that the corporation is a corporation.
1964.232,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1360.914,1362.096,"Now, I can see it."
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1362.096,1369.526,"And -- now, the question arises as to why I put the burden on the corporation, why hold the corporation guilty."
1964.232,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1508.746,1519.173,(Inaudible)
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1519.173,1520.002,"Sorry, I don't --"
1964.232,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1520.002,1526.359,What part of the policy they took the violation at that time.
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1526.359,1542.782,The portion which requires the carrier to have competitive bidding when its officers or other employees have certain positions in a corporation with whom the corporation is doing business-- with whom the carrier was doing business to an amount --
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1542.782,1546.887,Is there -- an interlocking director here or president?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1546.887,1547.991,There is not.
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1549.538,1550.722,What do you depend upon?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1550.722,1555.218,The words “any substantial interest” in the other corporation.
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1555.218,1556.823,In the other corporation?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1556.823,1557.836,That's right.
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1557.836,1561.406,"The interest here is in the contract, isn't it?"
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1561.406,1570.02,"Well, sir, this -- I think the answer to that is, yes, there is an interest in the contract but there is also an interest in the corporation, and --"
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1570.02,1571.536,Did they all adopt that?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1571.536,1573.505,They did not.
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1573.505,1579.071,"No -- there's no interest in it then physically, except this contract?"
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1579.071,1583.82,"Well, what there is -- is an arrangement there with the -- the indictment does not allege a contract."
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1597.796,1599.167,He had to take that.
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1599.167,1602.751,"That's right, with one whole scheme involving -- excuse me."
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1623.318,1627.049,I think that arrangement comes within those words of the company and --
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1627.049,1629.531,"It does and, in our view --"
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1629.531,1630.863,-- the interest in.
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1630.863,1633.448,That's correct and what they have is a --
1964.232,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1633.448,1634.224,That's what I want to know.
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1634.224,1641.951,"-- an arrangement, whereby, the corporation is being run, in substantial part, for their benefit."
1964.232,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1667.338,1670.576,Was International organizing this whole thing?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1670.576,1673.37,"Well, the record doesn't show."
1964.232,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1709.49,1718.715,"Well, doesn't the section then precisely cover the funds without any stretching of language?"
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1718.715,1728.188,"Well, if we prove an embezzlement and a conversion, then Section 660 does cover it."
1964.232,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1735.564,1738.397,Anything about fraud?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1738.397,1738.452,The statute --
1964.232,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1738.452,1741.774,Do you have anything in the statute that would cover it under fraud?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1741.774,1751.178,"The sta -- the particu-- Section 660 covers embezzlement, stealing, conversion, misapplication."
1964.232,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1759.473,1760.816,That's all they can see.
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1760.816,1762.249,That's correct.
1964.232,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1762.249,1764.517,"If you've used it, that's not here."
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1764.517,1767.434,That is correct.
1964.232,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1767.434,1770.109,"Well, I was asking because --"
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1770.109,1770.837,I'm aware of no other.
1964.232,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1770.837,1783.339,-- it does require the following -- excluding a criminal statute that deals with our custom to be very careful without stretching it beyond what the man would expect it to leave.
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1783.339,1822.113,"I recognize that and our -- it is for this reason that I developed -- we developed in our brief the notion that conflicts of interest give a color to the word interest that is quite clear and I might quote from this Court's opinion in Pepper versus Litton, 308 U.S. 295, at page 307 where this Court said, for that standard of fiduciary obligation is designed for the protection of the entire community of interests in the corporation-creditors as well as stockholders."
1964.232,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1858.616,1860.236,What was that case?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1860.236,1862.228,"Pepper versus Litton, Your Honor."
1964.232,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1862.228,1865.108,"It's a civil case, is it not?"
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1865.108,1867.001,That's correct.
1964.232,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1867.001,1868.347,Is it cited in the brief?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1868.347,1871.338,It's cited in the Boston & Maine brief at page 9.
1964.232,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1871.338,1880.039,But why wasn't -- why wasn't this carrier officer an agent of the other corporation?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1880.039,1882.01,"Well, sir, if he was --"
1964.232,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1882.01,1885.57,Was he or not?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1890.103,1893.171,I think you could argue that he was an agent.
1964.232,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.921,1904.214,Is the agent covered in this statute?
1964.232,0,39534,robert_b_hummel,,1904.214,1904.93,"Yes, sir."
1964.232,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1959.235,1960.61,Mr. Proctor.
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,1960.61,1967.075,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1964.232,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2065.73,2082.28,"(Inaudible) and if I have a contract with a corporation, after 20 years, I would receive 50% of the profits of that corporation."
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2086.96,2087.726,"No, Your Honor."
1964.232,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2087.726,2088.447,It would not?
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2088.447,2089.594,"It would not, although --"
1964.232,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2089.594,2090.402,What do we have to have?
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2090.402,2092.226,-- although I don't have to go so far as --
1964.232,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2092.226,2092.826,I understand.
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2092.826,2092.969,-- to substantiate my argument.
1964.232,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2092.969,2095.715,I understand (Voice Overlap) because you were mentioning definitions.
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2095.715,2096.722,"Yes, that's right."
1964.232,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2096.722,2100.917,Your theory is that I would have to have a stock interest.
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2100.917,2105.897,A stock interest or a beneficial stock interest.
1964.232,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2135.681,2139.898,It has to involve some control.
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2139.898,2144.024,I think it -- I think it involves an element of control or partial control.
1964.232,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2144.603,2154.486,"Because Mr. Justice Goldberg's hypothetical case gave you the nicest part of being a stockholder, that is, 50% of the profits is equivalent of 50% of the stock."
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2154.486,2155.753,That might be that it might --
1964.232,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2155.753,2158.915,The only thing it's lacking is control.
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2158.915,2161.25,I think that is true.
1964.232,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2335.638,2340.012,"Mr. Proctor, are you representing both the railroad and the individuals?"
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2340.012,2358.321,"Your Honor, when a case is put on the list of where we have only a half-hour to argue, I understand that only one counsel may argue, unless their interests are, in effect, different so as to permit two would argue."
1964.232,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2365.654,2368.626,But I was wondering if --
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2368.626,2369.559,"So, I do speak in my --"
1964.232,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2369.559,2375.223,Do I understand that the government is arguing that the railroad has substantial interest in this contract?
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2382.923,2384.018,"No, they don't argue that."
1964.232,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2453.458,2456.58,(Inaudible) with the other corporation?
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2456.58,2457.354,"No, Your Honor."
1964.232,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.354,2459.661,He'd have to be a purchasing or selling officer.
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2459.661,2460.107,That's right.
1964.232,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.391,2466.57,If it's just an agent of the other corporation is not sufficient.
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2466.57,2469.523,Only an agent who is a purchasing or selling officer or director.
1964.232,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.523,2471.297,-- which makes quite a difference.
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2471.297,2472.68,"Yes, a difference in degree, certainly."
1964.232,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.68,2483.423,Because you -- you wouldn't -- I suppose you could -- it wouldn't be too hard to find that these -- the officers of the carrier here were agents of the other company.
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2483.423,2485.0,"Well, it's not alleged."
1964.232,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2486.787,2489.526,"Even if you found that, you wouldn't have satisfied the statute."
1964.232,1,22961,edward_o_proctor_sr,,2489.526,2489.85,No.
