1995.95-865,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.217,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-865, The United States v. Winstar Corporation."
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,9.136,12.309,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-865,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,136.27,150.719,"And I gather before FIRREA was even passed, the executive branch was concerned about this problem and induced some solvent banks to take on their backs some insolvent banks in order to prevent them from failing."
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,152.802,156.424,It's not clear who induced whom in these transactions.
1995.95-865,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,156.424,157.103,"Oh, I see."
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,165.22,166.68,They did it for a number of reasons.
1995.95-865,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,198.24,205.856,"In any case, whoever induced whom by doing what these banks did, the claims on the insurance fund were drastically reduced."
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,210.258,212.551,"That's true, for a while they were reduced--"
1995.95-865,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,212.551,212.89,Yes.
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,212.89,216.693,"--but the danger was created, and it happened within that decade."
1995.95-865,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,216.693,221.445,They were reduced until... the problem in effect was deferred until FIRREA was passed.
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,221.445,237.186,"Well, the problem reappeared before FIRREA was passed, because if one bank, if one S&L absorbs another, which has happened in one of these three cases, and the other two people came into the industry who hadn't been in it before, and took over a failing thrift, they then often take great risks."
1995.95-865,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,245.351,245.972,But one of--
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,245.972,250.626,Don't assume that just because one bank is absorbed by another that deals with the problem.
1995.95-865,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,253.137,256.971,--One of those risks was the object of the contracts in these three cases.
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,256.971,271.269,"I want to talk about the contracts in these three cases, but I think the right context to talk about it in is the context of what Congress did and why they did it in FIRREA and whether that amounted to a breach of any promise that had been made."
1995.95-865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,342.985,346.298,"Well, that was the policy that the Government regulators permitted--"
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,346.298,347.079,--Right.
1995.95-865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,347.079,348.457,--to occur.
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,354.821,372.135,"They were, and the question in this case is, when Congress changed the policy in 1989 to require real capital so that banks would not be operating on zero or negative capital, so that the owners of the banks would have something at stake... several reasons for requiring real capital."
1995.95-865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,395.758,396.62,"--Well, Mr. Bender--"
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,409.93,410.859,Exactly.
1995.95-865,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,415.183,432.433,"Doesn't that fact defeat the Government's attempt to bring this case essentially under the impossibility doctrine, because the impossibility doctrine, if I understand it, assumes that the parties assume that the event that did happen was not something that was going to happen."
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,441.98,445.553,You mean... by the impossibility doctrine you're referring to the sovereign acts doctrine?
1995.95-865,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,445.553,448.425,"Well, I think sovereign acts is an element of it, yes--"
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,448.425,449.154,But where the Government--
1995.95-865,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,449.154,473.71,"--but the one... I mean, I think sovereign acts makes sense within the concept of an impossibility defense, and I think the impossibility defense, I understand it, rests upon the assumption that the act or event that makes it impossible to perform, and hence excuses performance, is an act or event which each party assumed would not happen, whereas in this case, each party assumed that it might very well--"
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,473.71,474.221,--It might very well happen.
1995.95-865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,474.721,478.673,"--Mr. Bender, are you relying on impossibility or unmistakability?"
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,478.673,482.856,--We're relying on the fact that there was no promise here--
1995.95-865,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,482.856,484.466,The unmistakability doctrine?
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,484.466,491.031,"--The unmistakability doctrine is a doctrine of construction of a contract, and that doctrine... we don't think that doctrine needs to be used here at all."
1995.95-865,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,499.637,510.436,"Well, may I... just before you leave the... my question is... I take it your answer is yes, we... each side was assuming that this might very well happen, and this was part of the object of contracting."
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,510.436,521.611,"--Right, and because of that, these contracts should be read and are only sensibly read as not making the promise that the plaintiffs say they make, namely a promise that that wouldn't change."
1995.95-865,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,521.611,524.463,"Well, no, it wasn't necessarily a promise that that wouldn't change."
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,527.686,542.487,"The promise that they allege is either that Congress would not toughen capital requirements to increase the required solvency, or that if it did, these banks would be exempted from that, and the issue in this case is whether there is a promise like that."
1995.95-865,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.487,567.701,"And you want to convince us that these bankers and lawyers who signed this agreement put themselves in a visibly insolvent state at a time when there was clearly a crisis in the S&L industry and Congress was clearly going to take some action, visibly put themselves in an insolvent condition without any commitment on the part of the Government to not count that against them for purpose of shutting them down."
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,567.701,569.863,Without any--
1995.95-865,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.863,571.014,"I mean, it is so utterly implausible--"
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,571.014,571.645,"--No, it's not."
1995.95-865,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,612.792,614.621,--At a time when not only they but--
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,621.047,625.14,"--Right, but they... the assets are the loans, not the deposits."
1995.95-865,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,626.731,646.043,"I find it very difficult to believe that if these documents had contained a clause that said that the Government, or FSLIC, reserves the right to change capital requirements and not to count this goodwill, that these parties would have executed the agreement."
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,647.634,649.875,If the contract said the Government--
1995.95-865,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,649.875,658.781,"If the contract had had a clause specifically allowing the Government to do what it's done in this case, it is impossible for me to believe that the parties would have entered into the transaction."
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,658.781,660.022,--I would look at that a different way.
1995.95-865,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,681.216,694.364,"Well, isn't that where the unmistakability doctrine comes in, that people are not entitled to deal with the Government on assumptions of their own, or what reasonable people might say, it has to be unmistakable, not just what a reasonable person would--"
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,694.364,696.207,Right... I think that's... that is--
1995.95-865,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,696.207,698.888,"--Tell me why this is not unmistakable, Mr. Bender."
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,698.888,699.188,--Right.
1995.95-865,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,699.188,705.473,The provision in the Winstar agreement... I think it's the Winstar one.
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,757.545,757.896,"No, it--"
1995.95-865,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.896,758.507,--shall govern.
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,758.507,759.126,--For the future?
1995.95-865,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.127,761.028,That sentence doesn't--
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,761.028,761.887,--No.
1995.95-865,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,767.593,767.972,"--Oh, I see."
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,771.965,774.446,"--I think, Justice Scalia, that you were right to start with Winstar."
1995.95-865,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,799.924,812.261,"And could you tell me, is this a different document than the document set forth in Winstar's briefs at page 23, or... are you just reading other parts of the same document, or are you referring us to a different document?"
1995.95-865,0,37685,paul_bender,,812.261,814.732,"No, I think I'm referring to the same document."
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1704.265,1710.139,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.632,1749.07,"Well, doesn't the unmistakability doctrine, Mr. Hollingsworth, require a little bit different focus on that?"
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1762.808,1781.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, the unmistakability doctrine requires a clear promise, and clear authority, and interpreting the clear promise, this Court's precedents have held that the Court can look to the plain meaning and can interpret the plain meaning of what the parties intended from the language of the contract and from the circumstances under which the contract was made."
1995.95-865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.66,1786.373,"Then what does the unmistakability doctrine add to the ordinary law of contracts, then?"
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1786.373,1798.241,"It requires a clear promise, a clear promise in a contract where you're dealing with the Government where there is a regulatory promise at issue, and of course--"
1995.95-865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.241,1801.154,Does that rule any promise by implication?
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1801.154,1815.152,"--No, it does not, Your Honor, and if the Court refers to page 32 of our brief, the Court will see the references to cases in which the course of dealing with the parties is also used to construe the plain meaning of the contract."
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1815.152,1815.653,Well--
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1815.653,1817.912,"Now, that may not be the same as implication."
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1835.825,1837.727,--What's the clearest language you have?
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1837.727,1843.752,"--The clearest language we have, Your Honor, is that the integration clause makes the--"
1995.95-865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1843.752,1847.283,"Can you tell us where it's found in the brief, or in the--"
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1847.283,1848.084,"--Yes, I can, Your Honor."
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1883.567,1885.868,"--Walk me through that, would you?"
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1887.821,1888.629,"--Yes, I will, sir."
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.629,1889.18,Okay.
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1889.18,1890.192,At page 599--
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.192,1890.502,Right.
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1890.502,1893.054,--is the integration clause and the supervisory action agreement.
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.054,1893.595,Okay.
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1895.956,1902.81,That clause says that the agreement of the parties is... is final.
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1905.524,1906.634,Excepting only--
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1906.634,1921.964,"--Except for, Justice Scalia, letters and resolutions entered contemporaneously with the agreement by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and that resolution appears at page 607 of the Joint Appendix, Justice Scalia, and--"
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1921.964,1923.657,"--Okay, and then we go to 607, and what do we see there?"
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1923.657,1951.994,"--And we see at 607, in paragraph 3, a requirement that Glendale shall submit a letter from its independent accountant that shall justify the use of purchase method accounting which allows Glendale to use goodwill as an asset, which shall set forth the amount of goodwill in accordance with the accountant's opinion, and which shall set forth the duration or amortization period under which goodwill shall operate."
1995.95-865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1971.497,1979.633,"Well, the letter from... a letter from Glendale's accountant doesn't really sound like what would be a binding, explicit promise on the Government."
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1979.633,1987.237,"Well, the Government requires that Glendale's accountant, Glendale's agent memorialize, in effect, Mr. Chief Justice, what the parties agreed to."
1995.95-865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1987.667,1988.118,Well--
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1988.118,1988.679,--what is goodwill--
1995.95-865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1988.679,1999.355,"--that's a very strange provision in agreement, that it's not contained in the agreement itself, but it's... one of the parties' accountants furnishes a memorial of it."
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,1999.355,2012.644,"--Well, Your Honor, it would be as if you were entering a contract to build a house, and you agreed with the contractor that an architect's certificate would be provided, and the parties would be bound by that, notwithstanding that it's a third party, and in Government contract law, Your Honor--"
1995.95-865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2012.644,2016.936,But an architect is generally a neutral party as between the parties.
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2019.797,2041.983,"--Well, it is a certified public accountant the opinion of which both parties agreed would finally memorialize what the final determination of the amount of goodwill was, that is, the number of liabilities of Broward which exceeded the assets of Broward, and the justification for the 40-year term under purchase method accounting, which is authorized by the regulation, which is adopted by reference."
1995.95-865,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2041.983,2043.083,"Mr. Hollingsworth, may--"
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2050.788,2071.263,"No, Your Honor, it is the goodwill that is referred to both in paragraph 3 and resulting amortization periods, which means goodwill for the future, and in paragraph 4, in which the stipulation, which means a term of agreement of the parties, shall say that goodwill is amortized pursuant to the Government's regulation, which is memorandum R31b."
1995.95-865,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2071.263,2073.342,May I ask you a question similar to the Chief Justice's?
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2088.813,2090.754,"Your Honor, this is a promise."
1995.95-865,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.806,2099.8,"No, what... the promise, though, that you referred to describes an obligation of Glendale, paragraphs 3 and 4 on page 607."
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2099.8,2103.703,--Paragraph 4 is an obligation that becomes an obligation of both parties.
1995.95-865,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2105.854,2106.775,How does that happen?
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2106.775,2112.67,"--When that regulation is read into the contract as adopted by reference, as our... as the case is cited in--"
1995.95-865,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2112.67,2114.219,As describing what Glendale must do?
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2114.219,2116.653,--As describing what the parties have agreed--
1995.95-865,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2116.653,2118.694,Glendale must do.
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2118.694,2123.846,--As what Glendale must do and what the parties have agreed is a requirement--
1995.95-865,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2123.846,2129.853,Where is the provision on which you rely describing what the obligation of the Government is when Glendale does that?
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2129.853,2133.633,--The obligation of the Government is to treat that goodwill--
1995.95-865,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2133.633,2134.094,Where?
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2137.076,2154.346,"--That obligation appears in memorandum R31b, which permits the use of purchase method accounting and amortization over a period of years, and it appears, sir, in the accountant's letter, Mr. Justice Stevens, at page 623 in which the accountant--"
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2154.346,2154.857,That's a commitment of the accountant.
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2181.253,2186.947,--That letter covered the discount of assets other than the goodwill.
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.947,2187.868,Other than the goodwill.
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2187.868,2189.291,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1995.95-865,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2189.291,2200.568,"Getting back to paragraph 4 on page 607... because I'm still, as the Chief Justice and Justice Stevens were inquiring, interested as to the Government's obligation... Glendale shall submit a stipulation."
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2204.021,2207.293,That is a stipulation which was--
1995.95-865,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2207.293,2208.282,What is a stipulation?
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2208.282,2217.077,"--A stipulation, according to Black's dictionary, is an agreement of the parties, a stipulation that goodwill will be treated at that point in accordance with the regulation."
1995.95-865,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2217.518,2219.878,Was a stipulation submitted that required the Government's signature?
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2219.878,2226.334,"--That stipulation was made by virtue of this agreement, to which the parties both agreed by virtue of the integration clause--"
1995.95-865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.334,2228.106,Answer Justice Kennedy's question.
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2230.788,2235.76,"--Your Honor, the supervisory action agreement is signed by the parties."
1995.95-865,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2245.638,2251.152,"And stipulation is not some term of art in savings and loans, it's just the Black's Law Dictionary definition--"
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2251.152,2251.98,Not that I know of.
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.034,2256.855,"--Well, I--"
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2256.855,2258.294,--and this stipulation was--
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2258.294,2259.516,--It doesn't always mean an agreement.
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2262.348,2263.997,--Well--
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2263.997,2265.229,"--You often say, he stipulated that."
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2267.2,2271.124,"--A stipulation is a bilateral connotation, I think that's certain."
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2274.526,2277.959,"Well, how can Glendale submit a bilateral document?"
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2278.828,2281.181,"--Because... well, because... well, this document--"
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2281.181,2286.674,"--I mean, if it said Glendale shall submit and the board shall accept, and the board shall sign, then you would have something."
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2286.674,2290.686,"--The board had the right to reject the accountant's letter, and it didn't."
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2320.765,2330.503,Would you have been in violation of the then-applicable regs of the board if that stipulation did not also constitute a commitment by the board?
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2330.503,2350.224,"--The then... I don't think we would have been in violation of the then-applicable regs of the board, Justice Scalia, but we would not have had a contract had we not had a stipulation adopting this regulation and fixing it in time and agreement as to the amount of goodwill, as to the duration in which goodwill could be amortized."
1995.95-865,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.224,2361.302,"Well, that clearly obligated Glendale to comply with those regulations, but I find... I'm trying to find... I'm sure there's... it's in here somewhere, but I'm trying to find what it is that obligated the Government not to change the regulations."
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2361.302,2365.796,"What obligated the Government not to change the regulations is two things, Justice Stevens."
1995.95-865,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2373.901,2375.253,And where is that?
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2375.253,2377.163,--That is at page 607.
1995.95-865,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2383.567,2385.357,But there is no stipulation.
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2390.681,2392.243,--This document--
1995.95-865,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2392.243,2393.404,--to which this refers?
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2393.404,2403.039,"--This document, resolution 81-710, refers to a stipulation on the bank board regulation which appears at Joint Appendix 571."
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2405.36,2405.961,I don't under--
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2412.025,2414.847,The stipulation that was submitted is the one Your Honor is looking at.
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.563,2423.511,I'm... maybe you don't understand my question.
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2428.547,2431.877,That stipulation was submitted as part of the accountant's letter.
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2434.829,2435.711,Where is it?
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2436.191,2436.912,"--That letter, Your Honor--"
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2436.912,2437.821,Is it in here?
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2437.821,2442.195,--That letter appears at the Joint Appendix page 623 and 624.
1995.95-865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2442.195,2442.906,623--
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2442.906,2464.669,"Actually, that is an attachment to the accountant's letter, and if Your Honor will look at page 623, 623 states that this determination of the amount of goodwill and the duration of goodwill is made pursuant to the supervisory action agreement, and I'm looking in the middle of the page, Justice Scalia, at page 623."
1995.95-865,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2470.733,2488.224,"--Mr. Hollingsworth, with respect to 31b, which you point out is set out starting on 571, is that otherwise expressly incorporated into the contract, or is it refer... or is its only reference through the stipulation paragraph that we've been talking about?"
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2488.224,2495.17,"Your Honor, that is expressly incorporated into the contract by virtue of the stipulation we've been referring to."
1995.95-865,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2495.17,2499.193,"But it has... in any case, its incorporation has to come through paragraph 4 here."
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2499.193,2499.874,Absolutely--
1995.95-865,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2499.874,2500.112,Okay.
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2500.112,2501.654,--and it is expressly incorporated thereby.
1995.95-865,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2509.659,2515.082,"If it is unmistakable, if it isn't unmistakable, what is that to do with us?"
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2528.251,2529.303,I think that the--
1995.95-865,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2529.303,2531.094,"--and if we think it isn't applicable, then I guess you'd win."
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2534.366,2543.502,"--I think Your Honor is referring to a provision in the lower court's opinion which dealt with what I refer to as a second promise theory, which I don't think any decision of this Court or any other court has recognized."
1995.95-865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2565.815,2567.678,"Mr. Hollingsworth, your time has expired."
1995.95-865,1,30929,joe_g_hollingsworth,,2570.31,2571.219,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1995.95-865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2571.96,2573.452,"Mr. Cooper, we'll hear from you."
1995.95-865,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2573.452,2587.27,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-865,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.054,2610.417,Are you now reading from page 23 of your brief?
1995.95-865,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2610.417,2616.832,"Of my brief, yes, Your Honor, and you'll note in the block quote there that the last two sentences of that block quote are italicized."
1995.95-865,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2670.768,2675.509,"Mr. Cooper, there's one thing that I'd like you to distinguish for me."
1995.95-865,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2725.622,2734.521,"Your Honor, I do, because we are not seeking to hold the Government to continue to count our goodwill, to continue to count our capital credit."
1995.95-865,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2753.281,2760.247,"In other words, in those consent decrees, at least as the Government's argument went, there would be no responsibility on the Government's part."
1995.95-865,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2776.016,2780.76,"--The Government can't break this agreement without any cost, exactly."
1995.95-865,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2784.631,2793.088,"Well, that's what... where you're saying there's a difference between at least the argument that was made that the Government could walk away from a consent decree without any cost."
1995.95-865,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2793.088,2803.864,"--Well, Your Honor, I'm... I suspect that those consent decrees are not involved in the world of commerce, which is what these contracts were involved in."
1995.95-865,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2843.709,2845.141,What about your other client?
1995.95-865,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2853.707,2854.078,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-865,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2854.478,2855.457,"This was the Statesman contract, right?"
1995.95-865,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2855.457,2856.769,--That's the Statesman contract.
1995.95-865,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2856.769,2857.37,What about Winstar?
1995.95-865,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2857.37,2863.615,"With respect to this particular provision, Winstar had a virtually identical provision."
1995.95-865,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2870.498,2873.75,And what about the bank board's resolution to which this refers?
1995.95-865,2,18687,charles_j_cooper,,2876.17,2876.831,"--Yes, Your Honor."
