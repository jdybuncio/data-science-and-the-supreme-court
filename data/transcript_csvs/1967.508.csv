1967.508,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,23.717,"Number 508, Norman Dorsen versus William A. Porteous, III."
1967.508,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,26.505,30.74,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1967.508,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,192.24,197.437,The Court -- did the Court make any distinction at all between the dependence action or the survivorship action?
1967.508,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,197.437,199.036,It did not Mr. Justice Stewart.
1967.508,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,199.036,207.994,"The first action, I suppose the damages could be plainly awarded only in the event of dependency, couldn't they?"
1967.508,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,207.994,208.706,Right.
1967.508,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,211.335,215.658,The second one is on behalf of the mother herself for her own pain and suffering.
1967.508,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,215.658,217.411,That's quite correct.
1967.508,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,486.555,493.806,"Well, even if you assume that the mother found all those things and it's hardly renounced to her benefit, she is dead."
1967.508,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,493.806,495.762,"Quite true, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1967.508,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,539.331,543.234,This doesn't go to the rest of the other part of the claim in Pennsylvania.
1967.508,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,543.234,544.261,Pardon me.
1967.508,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,544.261,550.775,This doesn't go to the recovery for the mother's own suffering.
1967.508,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,550.775,554.189,It goes -- that's the inheritance part.
1967.508,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.549,568.455,But how about -- how about the -- this is the two pronged action here?
1967.508,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,568.455,571.709,It's under one statute but there are two elements of the statute and two elements of damages.
1967.508,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,571.709,576.821,In your statement that there is only one state in United States wouldn't refuse this claim that goes to both elements.
1967.508,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,576.821,578.248,"Yes, it does."
1967.508,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,595.822,597.407,Do you have that (Voice Overlap) in reference to it?
1967.508,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,597.407,599.343,"Yes, I do."
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,992.913,996.882,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.508,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1043.998,1048.454,Are you suggesting that it's applicable only to former slaves of the Fourteenth Amendment?
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1048.454,1049.283,I do not mean this.
1967.508,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1081.382,1098.08,"Well, I don't think -- I hadn't feel it anyway that the fact that the petitioner, Mrs.-- that the fact that Mrs.-- the appellant here Mrs. Levy was a Negro, I didn't think that was the case, does it?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1098.08,1100.9,"I don't believe it does, if Your Honor please."
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1188.325,1192.811,"Well Mr. Porteous, let's get to the other point about classification."
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1192.811,1193.589,Yes sir.
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1193.589,1205.852,"I assume you have no objection to the federal court intervening in cases involving corporations and insurance companies against invidious classifications, that's alright, isn't it?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1205.852,1207.119,Yes indeed.
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1207.119,1211.627,"Well, what basis is therefore this classification?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1211.627,1214.886,Are you talking about a rational basis for this classification?
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1214.886,1218.389,"No, I'm talking about anything."
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1218.389,1224.407,"If Your Honor please, legislation by its very nature must be classified."
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1240.364,1248.423,Why do you classify illegitimate children as illegitimate children and not as children?
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1248.423,1260.265,"If Your Honor please, I submit that the law has a very definite reason for this and they are well-grounded in the public policy of the State of Louisiana and of all the other states of this nation."
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1260.265,1262.821,Including those that have abolished this distinction.
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1262.821,1270.634,"If Your Honor please, I submit that quite to the contrary, the distinction has not been entirely obliterated."
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1280.56,1281.809,"Well, we have 50."
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1281.809,1282.979,We have 50?
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1296.744,1313.563,"But Louisiana, now why does Louisiana say that a child who do no fault of his own happens to be illegitimate is denied the right to recover?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1329.906,1334.88,"If Your Honor, please may I start with the last question and work back to first."
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1334.88,1337.11,As you wish.
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1337.11,1343.285,"Mr. Justice Marshall, first of all, in this case, there was a legitimate relative with the right of action."
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1435.829,1441.989,I think we have to relate that to the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1441.989,1452.918,"Yes, if Your Honor please, we certainly do and we would submit that there is definitely a rational basis, a rational public policy on the part of Louisiana."
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1452.918,1457.675,Of discriminating between legitimate and illegitimate children.
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1457.675,1472.019,"If Your Honor please, this you classified as discrimination has been part of our law in this United States, these 50 states since -- well, I'm sure they came in to existence."
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1477.447,1483.223,"That's been changed in the enlightened state, am I correct?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1483.223,1484.614,"Some, yes."
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1487.115,1502.113,"Why do you say that solely because a child is illegitimate, a child is denied rights that he would have if his parents had married before he was born?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1502.113,1507.87,"Or after he was born, or had bothered to appear before a notary and acknowledge him."
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1507.87,1509.267,The child --
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1509.267,1509.713,"No, the parents."
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1509.713,1513.313,But what among those items could a child do?
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1513.313,1515.06,A child could do nothing.
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1515.06,1520.724,"And solely because of what the parents did, the child lose his rights."
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1520.724,1528.512,"If Your Honor please, we are first of all, I should also say dealing with the privilege here, the privilege of bringing this action."
1967.508,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1569.992,1580.731,"Mr. Porteous, I'm not sure I understood your reference to the -- what you called a peculiar or the unique system and policy of Louisiana of forced heirship?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1580.731,1581.007,Yes sir.
1967.508,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1581.007,1581.905,I didn't understand that.
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1582.203,1585.328,Forced Heirship is this.
1967.508,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1643.591,1646.522,How do the other states get along with that problem?
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1646.522,1646.965,Sir?
1967.508,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1646.965,1650.908,How do the other states survive the (Voice Overlap) of that problem?
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1650.908,1651.527,Excuse me.
1967.508,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1654.68,1659.893,"Well, what difference does that make the same problem of examining title?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1659.893,1665.679,"If Your Honor please, it's slightly different in examining a title."
1967.508,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1667.165,1678.979,"A man dies and testate and the property is inherited by X, Y and Z and that appears in the chain of title and no matter what the state is, we've got a problem."
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1678.979,1682.435,That would be -- that I would agree with you if Your Honor please.
1967.508,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1692.218,1697.349,"A peculiar thing about Louisiana is that you can't, by will, disinherit to even your children."
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1697.349,1705.861,"You couldn't disinherit your legitimate children anywhere you want, except if they, I believe made an attempt on your life or something such as that."
1967.508,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1734.711,1753.086,"If Louisiana feels that this sort of a rule is a deterrent to certain kinds of conduct, I would suppose that it might not legitimatize so easily but I gather it's not difficult at all, is it?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1753.086,1754.786,"Indeed, it is not sir."
1967.508,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1766.025,1780.893,But if the reason -- if the reason is you don't recognize the illegitimates right in this case is because of some possible impact on the conduct of other parents.
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1790.564,1802.17,"Mr. Justice White, I, my personal feelings would be that idea that illegitimacy is a deterrent certainly is not a very effective force."
1967.508,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.08,1820.351,"And what is the state -- what is the rational basis for the statute other than, I don't understand what you're saying that this is in the family law area and that this is just not the kind of an area that the Equal Protection Clause even know how to apply to."
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1820.351,1821.581,"That is correct, if Your Honor please."
1967.508,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.581,1839.8,That's what you're suggesting and I would suppose that you would suggest that if Louisiana passes the statute and said all the illegitimate children over 20 may inherit and all the illegitimate children under 20 may not that the Equal Protection Clause just wouldn't reach that.
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1839.8,1841.609,I submit that is correct.
1967.508,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1841.609,1856.82,"And unless you hold, unless you go that far and rule on that basis, they're just -- there isn't much room for upholding or finding any rational basis for the statute."
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1856.82,1866.002,"Well, if Your Honor please, if we submit that the rational basis as such lies in this whole public policy respecting that."
1967.508,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1866.002,1869.228,But that's -- that's your -- that's what you stand on.
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1869.228,1870.101,That's what I stand on.
1967.508,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1870.101,1872.169,"Well, did I misunderstand you then Mr. Porteous?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1884.04,1886.116,"It's part of the overall policy, yes sir."
1967.508,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1886.116,1887.232,"Well now, which is it?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1895.672,1898.625,I was thinking further along the questions that Mr. Justice White asked.
1967.508,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1898.625,1900.028,"Well, which is it?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1908.452,1912.605,"It's in the interest, if Your Honor please, we submit at the state policy or forced heirship."
1967.508,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1912.605,1913.78,"Now, what is forced heirship?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1918.703,1919.138,Yes sir.
1967.508,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1934.422,1944.763,"Incidentally, I gather that and I don't think it goes quite that far but certainly in my own state, one can't for example disinherit his wife."
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1944.763,1945.548,I see.
1967.508,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1945.548,1954.19,The state laws require that it will be a minimal portion that she must to see -- most states have that.
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1954.19,1956.951,I imagine that certainly and probably they wouldn't --
1967.508,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1956.951,1963.834,Do you think that would be sufficient to justify similar rule in these other states which don't go as far as you do in other court.
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1963.834,1964.962,I think so.
1967.508,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1964.962,1971.236,How -- what arrangements in Louisiana do you have this according to birth.
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1971.236,1983.496,"Upon the birth of any child sir, the physician or midwife, we do have some midwives left is by statute, bound to certify --"
1967.508,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.496,1986.045,Do you think normally is done?
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1986.045,1987.149,"Yes sir, it normally is --"
1967.508,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1987.149,1989.098,With legitimate or illegitimate children?
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1989.098,1990.346,With both.
1967.508,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1991.205,1998.884,So is there any real problem in Louisiana knowing whose mother a child is?
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,1998.884,1999.99,Generally not.
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2011.041,2014.884,When was this -- when was this statute passed?
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,2014.884,2022.221,The present form of the statute was I believe its last amendment was probably 1966.
1967.508,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2022.221,2024.045,When was the original?
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,2024.045,2035.3,It probably goes back to before the Code of 1870 sometime I believe within --
1967.508,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2035.3,2042.425,"Is Louisiana one of those states, southern states that prohibited Negroes from marrying (Voice Overlap)?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,2042.425,2043.825,"Yes sir, it was."
1967.508,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2050.617,2065.297,"I understood you to say though that from the very beginning of statehood, Louisiana had always had as a public policy reserving family life and encouraging it."
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,2065.297,2066.406,That is correct sir.
1967.508,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2066.406,2068.375,Did they know in that situation?
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,2068.375,2069.587,With regard to slaves?
1967.508,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2070.097,2072.621,I submit the answer is in the negative.
1967.508,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2072.621,2087.542,"Now, the opinion of the court below faces for the statute on the morals and general welfare because it discourages bringing children into the world out of wedlock."
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,2091.409,2093.17,Indeed it doesn't if Your Honor --
1967.508,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2093.17,2097.722,Any other decisions or what's the basis for your statement?
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,2100.913,2102.417,It's the logic of the situation.
1967.508,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2102.417,2110.322,"You don't have the Louisiana and neither the legislature nor the court has said that, is that right?"
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,2110.322,2111.232,That is correct sir.
1967.508,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2115.128,2120.638,"Is there anything I suppose there were debates before the statute was amended in ""66"""
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,2120.638,2123.722,"None of this is recorded unfortunately in our state, Your Honor."
1967.508,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2123.722,2127.839,So this is just your deduction.
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,2127.839,2148.516,"This, we submit is the logic of the situation and we believe that under the rules of Morey versus Doud and the other cases that the statute should be presumed to be constitutional in this situation and a rational basis if one can be found presumed likewise."
1967.508,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2277.209,2279.98,"Mr. Porteous, may I ask you this."
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,2289.069,2294.024,"The legitimate child sir, would take precedents."
1967.508,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2294.024,2298.841,Would take everything including those to children?
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,2298.841,2299.045,Yes sir.
1967.508,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2299.045,2301.339,And the illegitimate child would take nothing?
1967.508,1,45928,william_a_porteous_iii,,2301.339,2304.61,"That is correct, sir."
1967.508,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2333.669,2331.26,Mr. Dorsen.
1967.508,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2335.545,2337.792,Professor Dorsen may I ask you.
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2353.423,2354.74,I'd be happy to do that.
1967.508,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2468.187,2469.249,What case was that?
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2469.249,2478.359,That was Dupre v. Carruthers (ph) 6 Louisiana Annotation 156.
1967.508,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2478.359,2479.753,Is that in your brief Mr. Dorsen?
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2479.753,2487.055,It is not because it isn't -- it's in the Article in 28 Louisiana Law Review.
1967.508,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.055,2492.076,"Mr. Dorsen, what about state regulations that aliens can't vote?"
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2492.076,2498.888,We think that there are perfectly reasonable grounds for distinguishing that situation from this situation.
1967.508,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2498.888,2515.856,"Well, it can't really help -- if Louisiana permitted, that's to say that Louisiana permitted people 18 years old to vote and -- but said only citizens can vote."
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2520.068,2521.202,"No, it could not."
1967.508,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2521.202,2522.973,"It could be helpless, absolutely helpless."
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2522.973,2524.385,That's quite true.
1967.508,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.002,2526.784,"You wouldn't apply this rule, your --"
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2526.784,2532.71,I would not apply this rule because the ground of the distinction would not be on the basis of illegitimacy which --
1967.508,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2532.71,2534.939,But it wouldn't be to alienate your status.
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2534.939,2536.049,That's quite true.
1967.508,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2536.049,2537.669,About which nobody can do anything.
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2537.669,2542.926,"Well, the person can become a citizen in most situations."
1967.508,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.926,2545.521,"Well, I don't know."
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2549.735,2551.647,"Well, it might be."
1967.508,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2551.647,2555.687,Not unless his parents became citizens.
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2555.687,2563.187,The difference between an alien and illegitimate among other things is that the illegitimate can never change a status.
1967.508,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2586.699,2589.928,What do you have to say to Mr. Porteous argument?
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2594.998,2601.49,"Well, I have seen no substantial authority in the Louisiana courts to that effect."
1967.508,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2605.157,2608.27,"Anyway, that's not the ground on which --"
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2608.27,2614.537,"The next thing I was going to say was that the lower court did not attempt to justify on that ground and in any event, that is not this case."
1967.508,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2620.768,2623.427,You also have the heirship purpose here.
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2623.427,2642.001,That is quite true but the purpose of this particular survivorship statute does have the element of deterring toward feasorship I think the only argument that Mr. Porteous made that seemed to me the solidly base in terms of possibly persuading this Court was that the Fourteenth Amendment was not applicable to the case.
1967.508,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2660.431,2661.25,(Voice Overlap).
1967.508,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,2661.25,2663.568,I am not conceding that point.
1967.508,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2666.701,2668.728,Very well.
