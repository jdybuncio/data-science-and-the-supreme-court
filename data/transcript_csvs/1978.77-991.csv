1978.77-991,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.025,We'll hear argument first this morning in 991 Califano and the consolidated case.
1978.77-991,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,18.008,21.169,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-991,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,353.973,359.803,"In your hypothetical case, he would loose benefits for one month only, is that it?"
1978.77-991,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,359.803,360.999,"In my hypothetical, yes."
1978.77-991,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,363.348,367.065,Right.
1978.77-991,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,367.065,367.863,Now -- I'm sorry.
1978.77-991,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,374.681,375.464,That's right.
1978.77-991,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,375.464,375.546,"So, I would agree --"
1978.77-991,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,375.546,378.045,He was outside the country for 20 days --
1978.77-991,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,378.045,378.297,Right.
1978.77-991,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,378.297,387.746,"-- and then the remaining 10 days of the month, to the remaining 11 days of the month, he is treated as being outside the country under the second sentence of Section 1611 (f)."
1978.77-991,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,387.746,390.469,I see.
1978.77-991,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,390.469,404.16,"Now, it's the Secretary's position that Section 1611 (f) is rationally related to the legitimate Government purpose of limiting welfare payments to persons who actually need them to live in the United States."
1978.77-991,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,853.837,857.276,Very well.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,861.293,865.55,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-991,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,908.312,916.461,"Well, does it make any difference what the factual situation is in that respect for the basic question before the Court?"
1978.77-991,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,959.752,962.646,"Now, that's because of a statutory provision?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,962.646,964.314,That is correct.
1978.77-991,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,964.314,973.728,"But your submission if Congress decided otherwise in these other programs, your submission would be that -- that would be invalid too?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,973.728,974.645,That is correct.
1978.77-991,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,974.645,974.879,Yes.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,974.879,980.915,"I -- I think that same arguments would apply, should the same restrictions apply to Title II."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1003.179,1005.556,Is it equal protection you're arguing now?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1005.556,1011.508,We believe that the case could be analyzed under either an equal protection or due process approach.
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1016.189,1020.465,I have great difficult when you say that they both apply.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1022.785,1030.183,But we believe that the primary analysis and the primary analysis presented in our brief is a due process analysis.
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1030.183,1031.464,That's what I thought.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1034.088,1043.374,"I was just mentioning her status, vis-à-vis the employment to highlight what we feel is the discriminatory impact --"
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1043.374,1047.273,"But we can't deal with highlights, we deal with statutes."
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1047.273,1048.185,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1064.384,1077.293,"You talk about the right to travel, so that's established as a matter of constitutional law that there is a right of international travel, that's one of the contested issues in this case, isn't it?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1077.833,1078.759,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1078.759,1098.774,"As one who many years ago was influenced in his legal education by somebody who nobody's heard of anymore, Professor Hofeld, I've often been concerned about this throwing around loosely of the word “right” or if somebody has a right, somebody on the other side must have a duty."
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1110.878,1111.909,"Your Honor, the --"
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1111.909,1117.159,As contrasted with interstate travel which has been established as a constitutional right?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1117.159,1128.177,"Your Honor, we believe contrary to the Secretary that the cases of Kent, Aptheker, and Zemel clearly established."
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1171.772,1174.464,"Well, it doesn't talk about rights, it talks about liberties and liberty is --"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1174.464,1175.345,That is --
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1175.345,1176.524,-- is a synonym for freedom.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1176.524,1177.471,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1177.471,1179.782,And that -- that's directly from Shelton against Tucker that (Voice Overlap) --
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1179.782,1180.692,That is correct.
1978.77-991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1207.187,1208.114,Mr. Schey.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1208.114,1208.862,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1208.862,1242.396,"Your reference to the Kent, and Aptheker, and Zemel cases which are obviously in controversy here between you and your opponents brings to my mind this question which is highlighted by the language on page 16 of 381 U. S. from Zemel against Rusk were the Court says that the claim is different from that which is raised in Kent and from Aptheker for the refusal to validated appellant's passport does not result from many expression or association on his part."
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1249.304,1252.515,"Well, Your Honor I do agree."
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1256.464,1257.388,And in times and --
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1257.388,1257.681,But --
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1257.681,1258.159,-- and claims in right here.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1258.159,1276.633,"-- however, the Court in Zemel very clearly stated at page 16, “We cannot accept the contention of appellant that it is a First Amendment right which is here involved to the extend that the Secretary's refusal to validate passports as in inhibition”."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1309.583,1314.07,"But wouldn't Aptheker involve prohibition, complete prohibition that you have?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1314.07,1315.353,"No, it did not Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1344.054,1345.186,"No, I'm talking about Aptheker."
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1345.186,1349.696,"-- and it also recognized in Aptheker, and in Kent, and in Zemel."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1349.696,1351.883,Aptheker did not involve complete --
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1351.883,1353.239,An absolute prohibition.
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1354.406,1356.08,"Well, what did it -- right."
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1356.08,1366.527,"-- was the fact that he couldn't get a passport.In fact, in Zemel which was the only case that this Court has ever decided in which it found that the Government interest (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1366.527,1368.572,You can travel without a passport?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1368.572,1370.484,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1370.9,1372.849,Don't you -- so you'll go to jail if you do?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1372.849,1373.59,"No, you don't."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1401.598,1406.127,"Well, how many people do you think had committed robberies and never been arrested?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1406.127,1411.463,"Well, Your Honor, the issue in Laub was not whether not the people had been in courts or not."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1411.864,1413.11,I'm talking about Aptheker?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1413.11,1419.005,"The issue -- Your Honor, in Aptheker, the person was not precluded from traveling."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1467.88,1472.005,Just what international travel was involved in that case?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1472.005,1473.275,"In which case, Your Honor?"
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1473.275,1475.149,Maricopa County case?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1475.149,1477.512,"Your Honor, that was not an international case."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1477.512,1478.664,Thank you.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1478.664,1497.163,"However, I believe that the importance of that case as the importance in Aptheker, Kent, and Zemel is that this Court does not require a total flat prohibition on the exercise of a right before it finds an infringement of that right."
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1497.163,1499.191,"First of all, you have to find a right --"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1499.191,1499.371,That is correct.
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1499.371,1500.659,-- accepted by the Constitution.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1500.754,1501.174,That is correct.
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1501.174,1511.726,-- are you suggesting that the freedom of that -- to leave our country and travel internationally is precise equivalent of the right to travel from state to state?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1511.726,1512.04,No.
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1513.138,1514.082,"They're quite different, aren't they?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1514.082,1515.092,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1516.337,1520.169,It's unthinkable that a passport could be required if travel from New York to Ohio --
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1520.169,1520.856,That is absolutely correct.
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1520.856,1525.644,"-- and yet, it's accepted that a passport is required to travel from New York to France, isn't it?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1525.644,1527.214,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1568.071,1575.576,"Just to what -- from much you've just -- the way you've just answered my question, you would -- can say that that was mistaken or to loose from the part of those Courts."
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1575.576,1576.467,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1667.346,1674.893,There you're equating again interstate travel with foreign travel when you speak of Shapiro?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1674.893,1678.895,"Your Honor, we are not arguing."
1978.77-991,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.304,1816.936,"Are you -- is this a provision or isn't that equivalent to a provision that would say, these benefits are payable but only for the purpose of spending in the United States?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1816.936,1818.61,"Well, Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1823.408,1826.592,"Well, then -- well, would it be equivalent to that or not?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1828.903,1829.275,No.
1978.77-991,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1839.467,1841.482,But what would you be talking about you?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1846.9,1848.816,"Well, Your Honor, I think under those circumstances."
1978.77-991,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1861.137,1864.92,So would you be here if the statutes said that?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1864.92,1871.395,"Yes, I think we would because we would still have to analyze whether or not the statute effectuated those purposes."
1978.77-991,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.312,1883.395,That's an equal protection argument?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1883.395,1897.447,"Well, in the hypothetical that you are placing as to whether or not a -- that the statute -- would the statute read restricting money to be expended within the United States, would we still be here?"
1978.77-991,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1901.41,1911.52,"Well, do you think -- do you think we are -- this Court is down by the purposes or the goals that the Government professes to --"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1911.52,1911.568,No.
1978.77-991,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.568,1912.972,-- to give for this statute?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1912.972,1913.573,"No, I do not."
1978.77-991,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.282,1924.517,"Because the statute on its face doesn't particularly say, does it?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1924.991,1925.205,No.
1978.77-991,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1958.775,1962.241,"Well, and but what would be the purpose of that?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1962.241,1970.506,"Well, certainly one purpose maybe as you are suggesting to limit expenditures of SSI money within the United States."
1978.77-991,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.694,1978.194,"-- that residence outside and you could have a residence requirement, it's a lot of -- you save a lot of money?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,1978.194,1978.987,That is correct.
1978.77-991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2014.661,2022.434,"Well, they also rather specifically limited the person's right to receive funds when they are outside the country, didn't they?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2037.317,2038.707,That is absolutely correct.
1978.77-991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2038.85,2042.264,"So, certainly that fulfills Congress' purpose, does it not?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2042.264,2043.249,That is correct.
1978.77-991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2061.17,2070.065,But why do we need to worry about what it appears to be when we have it (Inaudible) -- spelled out in so many words in this statute that you're challenging.
1978.77-991,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2075.204,2075.757,Sometimes.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2075.757,2076.165,No.
1978.77-991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.607,2128.045,But that argument isn't based on failure of this particular statute you're challenging to conform to the overall congressional purpose.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2134.605,2135.489,That is correct.
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2135.489,2137.039,"Let me see it, get back a moment."
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2137.039,2137.509,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2137.509,2140.393,This right to travel.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2151.352,2152.316,I beg your pardon?
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2152.316,2157.281,People who travel light and remain.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2160.202,2161.908,I'm not sure I understand what you mean Your Honor.
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2161.908,2164.048,A person who moves to Guadalajara --
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2164.048,2164.622,"Oh, I see."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2164.622,2166.542,-- marries and lives there --
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2166.542,2166.627,Yes.
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2166.627,2169.939,-- for the rest of his life and becomes a citizen.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2169.939,2171.621,"Yes, I see what you mean Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2171.621,2173.653,So I didn't -- that isn't protected right?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2173.653,2174.188,No.
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2174.85,2184.649,"Well, if somebody leaves and travels to Mexico and stays there for five years, is that protected by the right to travel?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2184.649,2192.323,"Your Honor, we feel that it is necessary to examine the extent of the infringement."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2196.354,2199.814,But then you agree that the Secretary can look into that?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2199.814,2201.452,Absolutely and he already does.
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2202.246,2202.655,Alright.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2202.655,2207.417,-- already has a whole series of objective criteria --
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2207.417,2210.915,Would you try to limit your answers to the length of my question.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2210.915,2213.312,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2213.312,2223.137,How far can the Secretary go in order to inquire into whether or not you are coming back?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2223.137,2227.815,"Your Honor, the Secretary already has a set of criteria which he uses."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2237.757,2239.852,But doesn't interfere with his right to travel?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2239.852,2241.166,"No, because we do not feel --"
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2241.166,2242.85,"But then his right isn't absolutely, is it?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2242.85,2244.423,"That is absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2244.693,2247.41,What are you arguing if it's not absolute --
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2247.41,2259.385,What we're arguing Your Honor is that in -- given the purposes for which we assume and Government statistics appear to support that most persons travel.
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.282,2284.621,"Well, I thought you said there was no legislative history on this Section?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2284.621,2285.42,There is not Your Honor.
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2285.42,2289.807,"Well, if there is, then why do you argue in this point, If you don't have anything?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2289.807,2290.609,"Well, Your Honor --"
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2290.609,2293.834,It seems to me this is something -- should've been presented to Congress?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2293.834,2295.152,"Well, Your Honor, I would agree."
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2295.984,2296.266,Well you --
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2296.266,2296.307,-- that these matters should have been considered --
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2296.307,2299.853,"Well, you -- so rather than you present to Congress, you're going to present it does?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2299.853,2299.911,Well --
1978.77-991,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2299.911,2301.718,"Okay, that's to rewrite the Act?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2301.718,2301.923,No.
1978.77-991,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2384.757,2393.155,"Under this Section counsel, under this particular Section, is there a limit on the earnings that the recipient may make?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2393.155,2402.774,There is a limit on the earnings and I believe that to be an amount substantially less than the current grant level which is a $189.00.
1978.77-991,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2402.774,2415.592,"Well, now how is it as convenient for the Government to check on those earnings if the recipient is in Yugoslavia?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2415.592,2423.372,"Your Honor, the recipient has a statutory duty to report to the Secretary changes in circumstances --"
1978.77-991,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2423.372,2423.645,Yes.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2426.202,2426.941,That is correct.
1978.77-991,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2438.37,2441.302,"They're not limited to that reply, are they?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2441.982,2443.341,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2446.522,2447.138,Or it could become --
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2447.138,2452.539,-- they could inquire a personal interview or they could require affidavits from other persons to substantiate --
1978.77-991,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2452.539,2460.627,"He's on the payroll of some other company receiving several thousand dollars, something in excessive of the permissible limit."
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2465.627,2465.746,Well --
1978.77-991,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2465.746,2467.026,-- or in the Soviet Union?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2467.026,2476.395,I think it's important to recognize Your Honor that we believe that clearly at some point travel becomes residents abroad.
1978.77-991,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.486,2526.212,Who is this?
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2526.212,2528.378,"Mrs. Aznavorian, the plaintiff in the case."
1978.77-991,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2549.404,2557.397,"Does it make any difference on the principles you're arguing whether its 38 days, 68 or 128 days?"
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2557.397,2573.364,"Well, we believe Your Honor that at a certain point it should become clear to the Secretary, utilizing the objective criteria that he already has to utilize that a person has abandoned their residence within the United States."
1978.77-991,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2688.784,2690.611,Your time expire now counsel.
1978.77-991,1,38322,peter_a_schey,,2690.611,2691.571,"Thank you very much, Your Honor."
1978.77-991,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2691.571,2698.265,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Buscemi?"
1978.77-991,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,2698.265,2704.364,I'd be happy to answer any questions that the Court has but I have nothing further to add at this time.
1978.77-991,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2704.364,2705.077,"Thank you, gentlemen."
