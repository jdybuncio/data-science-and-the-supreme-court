1975.74-1646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,51.292,"We will hear arguments next in 1646, Andresen against Maryland."
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,56.412,66.624,Good morning Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,500.443,502.583,Are you referring page 36 of your brief?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,502.583,506.054,"Yes sir, Your Honor."
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,506.054,509.431,"Mr. Andresen, where is the affidavit reproduced in these papers?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,510.261,512.154,"That would be in the appendix, yes sir."
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,512.154,512.958,Appendix to the petition?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,512.958,517.299,"The second, right, the second appendix which should be --"
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,517.299,523.988,The appendix to the -- the petition of for certiorari or to the --
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,523.988,524.694,Yes sir.
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,536.567,537.47,Page 897?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,537.47,538.078,Alright sir.
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,538.078,538.839,I have it.
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,542.271,582.261,"A very lengthy application going on for several pages, but the important thing that I intend to point out at this part of the argument is that the information was not fully set out to the issuing Judge as he was only presented with the disputed information on the side of the dispute that the officers choice to side and that this information was unreliable."
1975.74-1646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,582.261,592.776,Are you suggesting that an application for a warrant must contain a balanced presentation of the facts?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,592.776,603.818,"I think you must present all the facts Your Honor, instead of withholding facts which are pertinent to the issues such as these officers did as they admitted under cross examination."
1975.74-1646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,603.818,610.148,"I was not directing it to withholding facts, but it is your view that it must present both sides of the question?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,610.148,617.963,"If it is important to the issue, yes sir."
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,757.085,758.537,The word time is supposed to be in there.
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,764.497,780.218,"Yes sir, the word time should appear, that is a typographical error."
1975.74-1646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,832.006,837.691,"In Stanford, you had some First Amendment implications, did you not, whether or not a bookstore search?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,837.691,838.287,"Yes sir, Your Honor."
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,933.542,937.6,Who two -- different lawyers offices or two offices in this suite of offices?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,937.6,938.029,No sir.
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,945.879,947.497,Also belonging to this petitioner?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,947.497,951.704,Right sir.
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,951.704,953.644,In the community?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,953.644,955.106,Just a couple of blocks away.
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,955.106,958.147,"Blocks away, thank you."
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,958.147,966.96,"In Stanford, the officers carried away approximately 2,000 books and pamphlets."
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1232.354,1242.535,"That -- that is the rule of Maryland Law is it that whenever anything that has been seized under a warrant is introduced in evidence, the warrant itself also has to be introduced with evidence?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1242.535,1247.183,Yes sir or an explanation to be made as to why the warrant is not available.
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1247.183,1250.089,And that is true even if there is no objection to the introduction of it?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1250.089,1260.181,"Yes sir, Your Honor and I believe, in Bumper this Court referred to a very similar case in North Carolina where --"
1975.74-1646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.181,1267.378,What is the reason do you know for that requirement of Maryland Law is that the jury would not pass on the sufficiency of the warrant?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1267.378,1290.765,"It is just I believe is basic, is back to basic best evidence rule that if you intend to prove that a certain document exists and that it was used in the auspice of it were heart of the proceeding that that it is necessary to introduce that article into evidence or explain why it cannot be produced."
1975.74-1646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1290.765,1296.498,Does the State quarrel with the language of the warrant that you have set out in your own appendix?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1297.357,1301.221,"State does not quarrel with the theory of law there just to expounded to you, Your Honor."
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.156,1571.489,I think the basic defect that you claimed was not cured by the extent to which the Trial Court suppressed evidence?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1571.489,1571.682,No sir.
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.439,1577.414,Handful of papers that were left over --
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1577.414,1577.935,That is right sir.
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.935,1583.15,"-- that was left over that you talked about, you say was tainted evidence?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1583.15,1584.89,Yes sir.
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.89,1586.71,Because?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1586.71,1588.613,Because -- I am not referring to each and --
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1588.613,1590.41,Because it should have been obtained by (Voice Overlap)
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1590.41,1592.239,It had been obtained under the search and --
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1592.239,1593.395,-- under a general warrant?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1593.395,1601.23,"-- and used to -- not only a general warrant which is part of the argument, but the papers were used to obtain indictments."
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1685.146,1689.629,"Yes, but the trial was on the original counts, was not it?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1689.629,1697.45,"Plus a consolidated indictment which contained 17 of the later obtained counts, in other words, it was at 21 counts."
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1697.45,1705.239,"But do you think that indictment can -- that was consolidated with, contained 17 counts?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1705.239,1705.871,Yes sir.
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.871,1712.417,"Now you -- were any of those counts obtained, do you claim based on the evidence that was seized?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1712.417,1717.301,"All of them, all 17 in additional counts."
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1717.301,1723.761,"Or was a -- how about the evidence, that handful of papers?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1723.761,1725.543,There still would have been healthy handful hands.
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1725.543,1735.661,"Alright healthy handful of papers, but to which counts did the Trial Court say they were relevant?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1735.661,1740.771,They said they were relevant to the criminal scheme of intent.
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1740.771,1746.821,"So that would have been true whether the case was, whether there had been a consolidation with another indictment or not."
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1746.821,1749.432,They never would have been able to have been introduced.
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1749.432,1749.763,Why not?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1749.763,1750.844,They are not because the trial --
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.844,1753.222,"So, they just tried on the original four?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1753.222,1773.068,"The prosecutor attempted over and over to have them introduced, but under an evidentiary rule in Maryland, McKean v. State, you cannot introduce evidence of other crimes or criminal intent until you have first established a prima-facie case on the major part of your case."
1975.74-1646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1843.042,1864.92,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1864.92,1900.758,"It was objected at the time of the suppression hearing that under the Hill v. Philpott case that petitioner’s privileges under the Fifth Amendment applied to his business and personal papers which were seized, and therefore, has set forth in argument Section 1, the papers, even if the warrant were held to be reasonable, could not be introduced over petitioner’s objection because they will violate his Fifth Amendment rights against self incrimination."
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1922.659,1932.428,What was the compulsion involved in this evidence with respect to your argument about the Fifth Amendment?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1932.428,1938.273,"Well, this comes down to the distinction between the cases as to how you define compulsion."
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1940.757,1946.857,You concede of course that there must be some -- that the defendant must be compelled to incriminate himself?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1946.857,1947.454,Definitely.
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1947.454,1953.035,Now what we want was -- what was the compulsion exerted in this case?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1953.035,1956.939,"Well, the compulsion was the taking of the papers from him."
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1957.448,1961.174,"Well, somebody else did that."
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1965.225,1979.258,"That is the ruling of the O'Brien case that the one, if the searchers do all the work, then the defendant does not have to hand over the papers, that he is not compelled to do anything and that is -- we say that is wrong."
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1979.689,1983.341,"Well, what cases have you got for that, that indicates it is wrong?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1983.341,1984.175,We got --
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1984.175,1985.571,That of course of the Hills case.
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1985.571,1986.331,Yes sir.
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1986.331,1986.662,What else?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1988.136,1993.604,"Well, there are no cases at least upon my examination of all the cases."
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1993.604,1996.216,"Well, tell me what compulsion there is then?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,1996.216,1997.586,I would -- we feel that the --
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1997.586,2005.942,"They were not writing on a clean slate, tell me what compulsion was the -- what was the defendant compelled to do himself?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2005.942,2017.334,That is a question as to what would the framers of the constitution meant when they said that he shall not be compelled to give evidence which will tend to incriminate him.
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2017.334,2022.618,"Well, that kind of an argument with me would go for any kind of evidence, would it not?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2023.076,2028.248,"Well, it is obvious if somebody is tortured and compelled to testify that this less obvious --"
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2028.248,2044.752,"Let us assume -- let us assume the searches in this case had not only seized papers, but it seized, let us just assume that a gun was relevant to the case, just assume that, they seized papers and a gun."
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2054.664,2057.109,No not the gun because --
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2057.109,2060.831,"You would be compelled to furnish it, would you not?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2060.831,2064.806,"However, he is not testifying by the gun in my impression."
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2064.806,2066.958,How is he testifying with the papers?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2066.958,2081.927,"We feel that Boyd and other cases, Bellis and other cases, Couch have set forth that one’s personal papers are protected and taking evidence form one’s papers is the same as from his own mail."
1975.74-1646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2081.927,2098.203,"What if instead of a gun, Mr. Andresen, the things taken were papers, namely, obviously and admittedly forged promissory notes and mortgage papers."
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2117.633,2127.294,"Well, I have to contend that mainly that we need examination of papers first to decide whether or not it is compelled testimony."
1975.74-1646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2132.199,2139.116,"Let us change (Voice Overlap), he forged promissory notes or mortgages, counterfeit money?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2139.116,2142.661,"On counterfeit money, I do not think it is a --"
1975.74-1646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2142.661,2143.235,(Voice Overlap) money.
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2143.235,2151.353,"Could be a thought, I mean I think that that is more of an object such as a gun or something in that nature."
1975.74-1646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2151.575,2154.239,Is Promissory note an object?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2154.239,2154.798,But it --
1975.74-1646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2154.798,2160.204,"It was written in the hand, forged by the hand of the person from whom it was seized?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2160.204,2163.005,"Well, the question is, if it contains his thoughts and ideas."
1975.74-1646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2163.005,2163.929,Maybe.
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2163.929,2182.658,"If we look at the paper, and all I am asking is that the Trial Court look at the paper, when the objection is interposed you say that this paper is not a private thought, it is not communicative with testimonial nature, and therefore, your Fifth Amendment privilege is not protected."
1975.74-1646,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2182.658,2209.011,"You are suggesting, I suppose, that if what was seized was a diary written in the handwriting of the petitioner which was self incriminating that that would constitute -- the introduction of that would constitute a violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and at least it was incumbent upon the trial judge to look and see if these material was (Voice Overlap)"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2209.011,2221.751,"That is our only request that they look at it, instead of what the Trial Court did and the Appellate Court did and say, we do not care what the paper was, the search was reasonable, and therefore, there is no compulsion attached."
1975.74-1646,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2230.607,2236.652,(Inaudible) concerned about what it is until it is offered and received in evidence?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2236.652,2237.354,No sir.
1975.74-1646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2245.249,2252.346,"What standard does the Trial Court apply when it looks at it, if it were to require to do that the way you suggest?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2252.346,2257.723,"Well, it must be a factual standard and that would have to be set out by cases dealing with the papers."
1975.74-1646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2258.562,2259.613,What would you focus on?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2271.437,2274.501,I think this is much -- I know and I did not mean to say that.
1975.74-1646,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2284.308,2288.688,"Well, but the compulsion is not on the defendant?"
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2288.688,2297.064,"He is not performing, but my explanation of compulsion is there is the force and that is what Black and Valentine say it is."
1975.74-1646,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2305.003,2311.228,"This -- this warrant, this seizure did no make you -- make the defendant do anything."

1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2346.965,2348.039,I do not know it.
1975.74-1646,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2348.039,2353.848,You would feel the compulsion were equal or less or nonexistent?
1975.74-1646,0,37654,peter_c_andresen,,2353.848,2359.158,"Well, that is a question that has been forwarded by the Federal Government."

1975.74-1646,3,37654,peter_c_andresen,,5068.154,5079.472,"The principles of Boyd, I do not agree, have been rejected by Schmerber and Gilbert, as a matter of fact both cases were cited and maintained the Boyd rule."
1975.74-1646,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5136.004,5139.35,Was there any search warrant in the Boyd case?
1975.74-1646,3,37654,peter_c_andresen,,5139.35,5142.042,"Boyd case was a subpoena, Your Honor."
1975.74-1646,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5218.793,5237.283,"(Inaudible) fundamentally is that even if you comply with the Fourth Amendment, you have a perfect search warrant and even though the search is a reasonable one, it nevertheless violates the Fifth Amendment if the search warrant has named the papers?"
1975.74-1646,3,37654,peter_c_andresen,,5237.283,5241.849,"If the papers are of the type which is protected by the Fifth Amendment, yes sir."
1975.74-1646,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5241.849,5243.4,What type of is that?

1975.74-1646,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5246.408,5250.008,How can a draft of a settlement statement come within that definition?
1975.74-1646,3,37654,peter_c_andresen,,5250.008,5257.545,"Oh! Very importantly, a matter of fact, this was the sole amount of the evidence, the fact that the draft and the finished copy were different."
1975.74-1646,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5257.545,5263.464,"Well, fact that is incriminating though, is that the test, if it is incriminating, it is covered?"
1975.74-1646,3,37654,peter_c_andresen,,5263.464,5271.9,The test were that these thoughts expressed on this paper were never expressed to anybody else that these were kept by the petitioner.
1975.74-1646,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5307.019,5313.921,"Well, but then that simply makes your definition of documents coextensive with the notion of incrimination?"
1975.74-1646,3,37654,peter_c_andresen,,5318.31,5327.698,You need to show that it is your own self creation being put down on the paper or something that you are maintaining for your own personal ideas.

1975.74-1646,3,37654,peter_c_andresen,,5331.996,5337.071,Yes sir.
1975.74-1646,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5390.448,5407.521,"Mr. Andresen, do you agree with your colleague saying that the conviction on some of these counts did not rest at all on any of the evidence that was introduced and which you challenge?"
1975.74-1646,3,37654,peter_c_andresen,,5407.521,5409.743,Not at all sir.
1975.74-1646,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5413.191,5413.902,Thank you.
