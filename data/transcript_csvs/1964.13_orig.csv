1964.13_orig,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,45.654,"Number 13 Original, State of Texas, plaintiff, versus the State of the New Jersey et al."
1964.13_orig,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,53.929,59.211,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1964.13_orig,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,109.803,111.062,To what?
1964.13_orig,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,111.062,113.665,District or division offices.
1964.13_orig,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,895.863,913.267,"Shouldn't our Solicitor generally be before the true owner of this property, the creditor, and not the debtor state or debtor company in the state?"
1964.13_orig,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,913.267,918.235,I think that the interest of the creditor should always be primary and I think --
1964.13_orig,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,918.235,943.77,I'm just wondering if it wouldn't be more likely to be served then if we did follow the Master in saying that the last known address of the creditor is one who should determine the state in which this escheat could be had because in each one of the states there must be a procedure.
1964.13_orig,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,964.022,968.782,To another state which may have had more contact with the transaction out of which it arose.
1964.13_orig,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,968.782,975.658,"Well, again, when you talk about contacts, it's your Solicitor for the state, rather than with the creditor."
1964.13_orig,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,975.658,990.898,"Well, as between -- this is a controversy between the states and, as between the states, I think the Solicitor should be to the state with the most significant context with the transaction out of which it arose."
1964.13_orig,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,990.898,994.904,"But wouldn't -- well, I'm just inquiring."
1964.13_orig,0,46121,w_o_shultz_ii,,1018.97,1045.613,"Well, I think that is that the fact of his last known address is one of the factors to be considered and weighed with all others, but I don't think it should outweigh all of it because in the mobility of our population today, and it's becoming more mobile every day, persons are within one state for today and they're across the continent the next day and they have moved there because of a better job opportunity."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2134.848,2139.449,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1964.13_orig,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2477.72,2497.229,"(Inaudible) in Pennsylvania, isn't that right?"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2497.229,2500.563,"Well, the Chief Executive Office presently exists in Pennsylvania."
1964.13_orig,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2500.563,2513.944,(Inaudible)
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2513.944,2514.536,It is true.
1964.13_orig,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2528.351,2533.076,"So, this is not available to realty?"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2533.076,2533.8,They're not available.
1964.13_orig,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2541.867,2564.88,(Inaudible)
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2564.88,2565.45,"Now, that --"
1964.13_orig,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2565.45,2566.65,(Inaudible)
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2566.65,2571.106,"Well, that was the -- what the Master reported."
1964.13_orig,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2690.007,2697.977,(Inaudible)
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2697.977,2698.343,That's right.
1964.13_orig,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2698.343,2699.093,To the state.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2699.093,2704.245,"Right, except of course, there, we know he's not in that state anymore."
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2706.746,2709.138,We know -- we just know he's out of the state.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2709.138,2709.545,That's right.
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2710.485,2711.231,We don't know he's not in the state.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2711.231,2712.304,We don't know he's not at that state.
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.713,2733.962,(Inaudible)
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2733.962,2736.003,"Well, there is a last known address but we don't know where he is now."
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2736.003,2736.797,But he isn't there.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2736.797,2738.972,"That's right, but we talk about --"
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2738.972,2741.479,Do you know his actual address?
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2741.479,2744.006,"We don't know his actual address, but we do know his last --"
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.006,2753.712,(Inaudible)
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2753.712,2754.246,That's right.
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.246,2759.49,"And, we don't have his address â€“"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2759.49,2760.113,That's right.
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2761.666,2769.346,(Inaudible)
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2769.346,2773.305,"Well, you don't have an address because he's not there, right?"
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2801.523,2807.527,"Could you tell me, under the statute of his last known address, how do you determine the owner's address?"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2807.527,2808.799,From the records of the corporation.
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2808.799,2809.67,From the records.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2809.67,2810.358,That's right.
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2810.358,2820.566,(Inaudible)?
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2820.566,2820.958,"Well, I --"
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.958,2837.403,"Like in certain things, (Inaudible)"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2837.403,2839.64,That's right.
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2839.64,2840.523,"So, where do you think we could go?"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2840.523,2843.186,We -- the only way we could go by it is the reports of the corporation.
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2852.307,2869.227,"The address of the creditor is at a certain address on some street in some city and the letter goes there and then it's returned because he isn't there, although the landlady at that rooming house knows exactly where he is."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2872.694,2873.019,That's right.
1964.13_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2873.97,2901.411,"But, Mr. Kehoe, moving on with my memory of the New Jersey statute is that, even under that statute, a good deal of hunting is done -- before there is finally an escheat, and that hunting does indeed turn up people at other addresses than on the books of the company and that we come down to a residue as a practical matter in those cases."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2901.411,2901.67,"That's correct, sir."
1964.13_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2901.67,2903.334,Where the hunting has been unsuccessful.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2903.334,2904.173,That's correct.
1964.13_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2904.173,2918.674,"And, I suppose, when you said earlier that you thought that the amounts are decreasing, I expect that must deflect procedures that these companies are adopting to do a better job of hunting up owners before you get around to them."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2918.674,2919.876,No question about it.
1964.13_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2920.559,2920.698,Yes.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2929.74,2930.658,It depends on the statute.
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2961.694,2966.46,But sheer notice to the creditor is no more than credit corporation did.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2966.46,2966.822,"Well, we --"
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2966.822,2968.887,The Corporation probably sends the check at the same address.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2968.887,2969.164,We don't know.
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2969.164,2970.051,It came back.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2970.051,2970.997,We don't know what the facts on --
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2970.997,2973.677,You don't go -- you don't write a letter to the -- to anybody.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2979.715,2983.58,We send a letter or we do pay out about 15 to 20% --
1964.13_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2983.58,2985.564,"Somehow the company sends that, doesn't it?"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2985.564,2988.679,15 to 20% we pay just when we send our letter out.
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.67,2993.319,The letter doesn't -- if the letter returns --
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2993.319,2993.995,If the letter returns to us --
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2993.995,2995.941,If it's unknown -- if the state mark is unknown.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2995.941,2997.386,"We can't do anything, Mr. Justice Clark."
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2997.386,2999.051,You don't try to -- you don't try to send it to the District Attorney?
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,2999.051,3001.304,"No, we don't."
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3043.851,3049.935,But maybe every other state is -- maybe the state of the last known address might go through the equal procedure or even a better one.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3049.935,3058.986,"They might very well, but we say the state of last known address, it's got no substance like the state of incorporation."
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3092.931,3104.663,"Well, you -- that the least of the last known address got enough substance to it, that's the Attorney General of that state or (Inaudible)"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3104.663,3105.214,That's right.
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3105.214,3107.523,"Well, he did that but he had the terms of the creditors."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3107.523,3108.576,That's right.
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.224,3121.956,"I get -- I agree, but if there's some relevance to the statement of that state of the last known address, I think, might have substance."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3121.956,3123.875,"Well, it's got some substance."
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3170.085,3180.431,I would assume though that if -- I would assume that if the Court decided to say that the last known address is to have it -- then the State of New Jersey would take the right.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3180.431,3181.822,I don't even question on that.
1964.13_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3181.822,3183.314,"And if -- well, now, I just --"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3183.314,3188.561,"I mean, would it be that if you -- that you -- if you, gentlemen, decide the last known address, it's the last known address."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3200.181,3205.195,I thought you were saying that the corporation might not accept withholding the money?
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3205.195,3211.089,"The last known a -- well, they probably wouldn't pay to the State of Texas, I would imagine."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3211.089,3212.55,Even Texas wouldn't pay.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3212.55,3222.692,"That's right, but I think maybe we might take event from the state of corporation because this problem only comes because -- before this Court because there's a conflict."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3246.266,3250.81,You tell me in 11 years.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3269.495,3280.09,"Well, when you get into why it's fairer, it's a very broad, broad question but we think it's fairer because it's easier for the corporation."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3321.726,3329.506,Why is that the same argument -- fairer way for New Jersey to do or the others?
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3334.632,3335.295,Well --
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3335.295,3337.174,It's not -- not preceded at all.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3337.174,3341.251,"Well, the company has, we feel, no moral or legal right to it and we think that's --"
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3341.251,3344.578,It has no legal or moral right to it.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3346.992,3348.131,It sure does.
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3348.131,3350.186,To it than the corporation --
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3350.186,3350.628,"No, question about it."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3350.628,3354.421,Is it fair to keep there as against other states --
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3354.421,3354.659,Sure.
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3354.659,3357.345,Than the corporations there have?
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3357.345,3367.274,"As between the corporation and a state, any state, we think, has a paramount of right because, while it's holding it, it's using it for the benefit of the citizens."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3388.726,3390.112,That's for who?
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3391.605,3393.691,The citizens of the sovereign that takes.
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3393.691,3396.826,"The city of the -- well, the corporation didn't own it and never did."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3400.921,3401.384,"Well, I wouldn't say --"
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3401.384,3404.715,Who does have a moral or legal claim to it?
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3407.307,3408.287,Forgetting the sovereign?
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3408.287,3410.647,"Yes, who does have a moral or legal claim to it?"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3410.647,3413.785,"Well, under our theory that it's ownerless property, nobody."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3413.785,3416.257,"Well, but if it's an owner, the owner would have it."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3416.257,3418.077,"If there's an owner, no question about that."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3418.077,3425.715,"So, if you are going to trace it, you're going to trace it as a moral and legal right of somebody, couldn't you necessarily try to trace it to the -- where the owner lives?"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3425.715,3430.762,"That's right and if you have a simple plan for tracing the owner, then you've got the answer but there is no simple plan."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3430.762,3445.316,"But can you suggest any better plan than to say his last known address that it'd come more nearly, in all instances, taking a moral position to come more nearly for that letting the state get the benefit of it where the owner lives."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3445.316,3449.469,"Yes, but I think we're confusing two things, paying him back and the --"
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3449.469,3452.511,I'm not talking about paying him back. That's where he lives.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3452.511,3453.704,"He live -- well, we don't know where he lives."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3453.704,3466.93,Is there any other -- you would attribute the right of this -- you would say that the state had the most moral and equitable right to it by the -- by its owner who left it on there.

1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3469.615,3474.059,"Alright, now, you don't know it and you never can find him at that address but you do know that?"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3479.127,3479.85,That's right.
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3482.087,3483.417,"Well, they didn't and they were --"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3483.417,3484.716,"Well, I think it would be safe to assume that."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3484.716,3486.18,They never lived in the place.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3486.18,3488.255,"That's right, but they might have moved to New Jersey."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3488.255,3500.966,"And, frequently, with reference to insurance claims for instance, they may be policy on the -- would -- California with a policy in New Jersey or Connecticut or those other places."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3500.966,3503.089,"Well, of course, insurance claims we don't have involved in this."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3503.089,3506.426,"I know you don't have it, but then that's a part of our big problem."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3506.426,3509.914,"Well, it is, but not particularly in this case, at least that's our position."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3509.914,3512.862,It's not that particular point.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3517.334,3517.878,Well --
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3517.878,3520.114,That he left owning it.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3529.086,3532.099,"Well, that, of course --"
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3532.099,3537.889,I was just â€“ there are so many arguments to be maybe played out but I'm staying that's the best argument.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3537.889,3543.893,"That's right, but that's what eggs to the pot that we've got boiling."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3559.163,3564.721,"And we have no legal -- we have no statute covering it, do we?"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3564.721,3565.825,You mean federal statute?
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3565.825,3566.279,Yes.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3566.279,3567.478,"No, there is no federal."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3567.478,3572.643,"So, whatever we say is not based on a federal statute, is it?"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3575.371,3575.983,That's right.
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3575.983,3580.491,"And, it falls to us because you can't have him going anywhere else out of the federal."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3580.491,3586.581,That's right and the question is what -- you're going to protect the constitutional rights of the holder.
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3589.461,3590.621,The rights of -- that's one of them.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3590.621,3591.411,The holder.
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3591.411,3592.887,That's one of them.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3592.887,3593.108,"Well, I --"
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3593.108,3594.801,Constitutional rights of the holder.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3594.801,3595.155,That's right.
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3595.155,3597.907,"Of course that could be done, couldn't it, by saying â€œyou never shall own it."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3601.817,3605.899,"Well, I suppose you could do it that way but I certainly wouldn't."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3608.976,3610.296,"Yes, but they're going to keep it."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3610.296,3611.212,That's right.
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3611.212,3618.491,"When you get down basically to it, it's the question of who keeps this money and gets the benefit of that money by the owner's law."
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3618.491,3620.466,That's correct.
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3620.466,3636.947,"If we may along the same line, I wonder the affinities of a practical stand point where most of the escheat is in the hands of just a few states like Delaware, New Jersey, New York?"
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3636.947,3650.191,"Well, that might be, but not in the -- the number of corporations, of course, are expanding and, simply, Delaware is the highest and I think New York is the second, New Jersey third, Illinois, California, Florida, Nevada, they're all coming along."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3650.191,3651.699,Does Maine come in there somewhere?
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3653.15,3653.744,Maine?
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3653.744,3654.611,Isn't it?
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3654.611,3657.34,"I don't think Maine was on the list, not with the big ones anyway."
1964.13_orig,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3657.34,3659.18,It's pretty high then if it's not in that.
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3659.18,3662.341,That's right.
1964.13_orig,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3735.939,3741.446,(Inaudible)
1964.13_orig,1,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,3741.446,3749.185,The copy of the report -- when this case was brought before the -- we also offered some judgments of the State of New Jersey.
1964.13_orig,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3763.829,3767.584,Mr. Burns.
1964.13_orig,2,23644,fred_m_burns,,3767.584,3777.315,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1964.13_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3838.431,3840.637,Is that the extent of your claim?
1964.13_orig,2,23644,fred_m_burns,,3840.637,3841.829,That's the extent of our claim.
1964.13_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3843.695,3849.53,People known who lives in Florida you find in the record.
1964.13_orig,2,23644,fred_m_burns,,3849.53,3853.371,People whose last known address was in Florida.
1964.13_orig,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3853.371,3854.492,On the books of the company?
1964.13_orig,2,23644,fred_m_burns,,3854.492,3856.321,On the books of the company.
1964.13_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3865.043,3871.922,What is the view of Florida as to people who didn't have any last known address?
1964.13_orig,2,23644,fred_m_burns,,3871.922,3872.283,Well --
1964.13_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3872.283,3873.021,Just unknown.
1964.13_orig,2,23644,fred_m_burns,,3873.021,3892.4,I am kindly inclined to the view that the better rule there might be to follow the presumption that the people who had no address on the books lived at the place where the obligation accrued.
1964.13_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3892.4,3894.923,That is the domicile of the debtor?
1964.13_orig,2,23644,fred_m_burns,,3894.923,3907.195,"Domicile of the debtor or, if the record shows, that the contract was entered into in a particular state than in that state."
1964.13_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3953.344,3962.827,"Of course some of these claims, going back great many years, it may not -- there may not -- nobody may know where the claim accrued."
1964.13_orig,2,23644,fred_m_burns,,3962.827,3974.783,"Well, I don't know if anybody would probably know at the present time, but I believe we have a rule of law that a person's address is at one place, it's presumed to be there until some evidence is shown that it's been moved."
1964.13_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3974.783,3982.584,"Well, I'm still talking though not about cases where you have no address and where you don't know where the claim accrued because of the antiquity of the claim."
1964.13_orig,2,23644,fred_m_burns,,3982.584,3990.007,"Well, then I guess you're going to have to go back to New Jersey's claim of the --"
1964.13_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3990.007,3990.502,Domicile of the debtor.
1964.13_orig,2,23644,fred_m_burns,,3990.502,3992.288,Domicile of the owner.
1964.13_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3992.288,3992.978,Yes.
1964.13_orig,2,23644,fred_m_burns,,3992.978,4002.495,"Because I think it would be presumed that if you had no other evidence of a place where the claim accrued, it would be at the domicile of the person who --"
1964.13_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4002.495,4003.24,Owed the money.
1964.13_orig,2,23644,fred_m_burns,,4003.24,4004.329,Yes.
1964.13_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4004.329,4016.995,"The Court, as I read the briefs, some of these claims are to interest that, under Texas law, are real estate."
1964.13_orig,2,23644,fred_m_burns,,4016.995,4018.602,That --
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,4758.659,4760.142,Mr. Chief Justice and --
1964.13_orig,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4760.142,4760.957,Mr. Oman.
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,4760.957,4763.602,May it please the Court.
1964.13_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4925.621,4927.733,Do I understand you have an amicus brief?
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,4927.733,4929.671,"Yes, sir."
1964.13_orig,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4929.671,4938.025,Did you -- did that practice of yours be challenged in any Court?
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,4938.025,4940.433,"That, I cannot tell you, Your Honor."
1964.13_orig,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4947.392,4953.76,"As I understand, the companies do indeed make efforts to locate."
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,4953.76,4954.234,They do.
1964.13_orig,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4954.234,4960.73,"And, it's only after these things fail, these efforts fail, that they get into these boxes or what?"
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,4960.73,4964.927,They make an effort to locate even after they had made reports to the state.
1964.13_orig,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4968.875,4972.194,Is this largely by advertisements and such?
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,4972.194,4977.167,"Yes, and starting at the most natural starting point in the world which is the last known address."
1964.13_orig,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5086.848,5087.636,Well --
1964.13_orig,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5087.636,5092.435,Does it involve this debt in this because debt is a likely problem?
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5092.435,5093.259,It has.
1964.13_orig,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5093.259,5099.035,"Then it's probably that he would likely have been to place, that is the last known address?"
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5099.035,5101.81,"That is correct, Your Honor, and I'd like to say at this point --"
1964.13_orig,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5101.81,5106.259,"Well, the last known address is clear and simple contact isn't it?"
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5106.259,5111.05,"I -- well, it's not the -- I don't quite understand Your Honor's question."
1964.13_orig,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5111.05,5116.735,"The last known address is the place where the man, the claimant, stayed --"
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5116.735,5119.5,"If used in that sense, it is the finest type of contact."
1964.13_orig,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5119.5,5120.38,Yes.
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5120.38,5128.783,"But, the contacts theory, principle contacts with the transaction, which New Jersey claims under, principle --"
1964.13_orig,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5128.783,5135.021,Does any state have a test other than -- on my concerns other than the last known address?
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5135.021,5137.397,"I cannot give you an answer on that, Your Honor."
1964.13_orig,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5139.577,5141.274,"I understand, you have that in your brief."
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5141.274,5145.702,"And there has been one added, the State of New York, since this law suit was commenced."
1964.13_orig,3,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,5148.524,5151.988,I thought perhaps there might be some state that has another statute.
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5151.988,5155.252,"I'm sorry, but I do not know and I cannot give you that answer."
1964.13_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5155.252,5164.711,"There's another clause there that presents that if she remanded by some brief, that is, according to the books of the company."
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5164.711,5168.502,"According to the records and books of the company, I think that's the way the statute reads."
1964.13_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5168.502,5170.719,"Well, is that what you're arguing upon?"
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5170.719,5171.219,"Yes, sir."
1964.13_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5171.219,5173.465,"What was it -- certainly, the company just didn't put it down."
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5184.129,5185.322,I think that would provide a starting --
1964.13_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5185.322,5189.068,Is flagrantly -- flagrant or long?
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5189.068,5192.218,I think that would provide a starting point.
1964.13_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5192.218,5197.533,"But, what -- is that the final point?"
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5197.533,5198.951,I don't understand Your Honor's question.
1964.13_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5198.951,5217.473,"Well, what was the insurance company in Connecticut and, even then, does the -- somewhere, it was hold over United States and they never did change my address, never did have a last known address at all."
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5217.473,5219.973,"Well, it's the last one that the company knew about."
1964.13_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5222.584,5227.147,"The merits of the matter wouldn't have been on the last known address the company knew about, would it?"
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5227.147,5227.75,It would be the last --
1964.13_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5227.75,5241.421,"If there'd be merit to giving it to the state where he last lived, the fact that they didn't put the interest in that shouldn't -- couldn't derive they don't have merit."
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5241.421,5243.47,No.
1964.13_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5243.47,5245.412,Maybe that's the only test we could use.
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5245.412,5246.29,I think we'll have to --
1964.13_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5246.29,5251.789,What I was pointing out is that that holds up to the problem itself.
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5251.789,5255.139,"I don't think we need to let any more in, if Your Honors please."
1964.13_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5255.139,5256.165,"But, it's there."
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5256.165,5257.302,"Yes, I know --"
1964.13_orig,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5257.302,5259.142,It's according to the books of the company.
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5259.142,5262.583,"And, I don't know the answer, frankly."
1964.13_orig,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5293.226,5293.699,"I take it, that --"
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5293.699,5294.957,He said it was just fact.
1964.13_orig,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5294.957,5299.723,"That test, in any event, would emphasize the contacts of the debtor wouldn't it?"
1964.13_orig,3,40118,ralph_m_oman,,5299.723,5300.895,Right.

1964.13_orig,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6363.95,6368.048,But why shouldn't that follow no matter what escheat rule you call?
1964.13_orig,6,19361,charles_j_kehoe,,6368.048,6368.91,Because we know --
