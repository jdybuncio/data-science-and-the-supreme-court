1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"We will hear arguments next in Number 87-6, Guy Rufus Huddleston versus United States."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,24.031,24.581,"""Fairis""."
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,24.581,25.465,"""Fairis""."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,28.15,37.523,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on Mr. Huddleston's petition for certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit."
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,223.061,228.298,"Well, there is certainly a great deal of support for it in the traditional common law of evidence."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,242.058,253.18,"--I believe... I would agree with that but there stands as a sentinel to deciding this Rule 104(a) or (b), whichever one applies."
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,253.18,256.366,"Now, where do we find the text of 104(a) in your brief?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,262.888,264.538,I cite it--
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,264.538,268.023,"I mean, you set it out... you set out only 104(b)."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,268.023,275.862,"--That's correct, and in my brief I cite 104(a) many times."
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,275.862,277.814,And is the text in your brief?
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,277.814,284.051,"Yes, I believe it is."
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,284.051,290.805,"Again in your brief at the beginning you say the rule of evidence involved, and you set forth only 104(b)."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,290.805,293.241,I actually set 404(b).
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,293.241,294.324,404(b).
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,294.324,296.526,404(b).
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.632,309.416,Are these the same... is 104(a) and 104(b) the same thing as 404(a) and 404(b)?
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,309.416,315.404,"--No, 104(a) provides that preliminary questions on the admissibility of evidence must be decided by the Court."
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,315.404,321.058,Why aren't these set forth in your brief if you are going to rely on them?
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,321.058,328.597,I believe... 104(b) is specifically stated in the brief.
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,328.597,332.882,Whereabouts?
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,344.857,348.743,They are set out in Footnote 17 on Page 24 of the brief.
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,348.743,354.231,Thank you.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,357.183,358.699,104(a) and 104(b).
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.482,393.856,"Well, isn't that the traditional trial judge's saying the proponent offers in evidence and says, I will connect it up later?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,402.978,403.412,No--
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,403.412,405.747,That doesn't deal with a standard of proof.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,405.747,409.549,--That... Six Circuit Courts of Appeal have held that it does.
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.549,411.401,You tell me why you think it does.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,411.401,424.959,"I think that it does because similar acts evidence is so fraught with possible prejudice to the defendant that that should be decided by the courts outside of the presence of the jury, and it has no probative value--"
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,424.959,430.045,But we don't get that surely out of Rule 101(b) or 104(b).
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,430.045,441.753,"--104(b), I believe that introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the fulfillment of a condition equals a preponderance of the evidence."
1987.87-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.753,442.789,I don't think so at all.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,471.456,504.578,"It is our position that it must be... that the court must decide that out of the presence of the jury by at least a preponderance of the evidence or it has no probative value, that the jury should not hear about it, that if you then say to the jury, well, just ignore this later, ignore that we have said that this man is a bad man, that that is not effective, that this should be held outside of the presence of the jury, as this Court recognized in deciding the conspiracy issue in Bourjaily under 104(a)."
1987.87-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,504.578,506.213,I understand that that is your position.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,539.084,542.119,But that is on the substantive offense.
1987.87-6,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,558.414,573.757,"Well, you could certainly... I suppose the defendant is perfectly entitled to put on other evidence that he didn't commit these acts and let the jury decide it."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,573.757,591.218,"He could do that, but it is our position that it doesn't have sufficient probative value to go to the jury unless you prove by at least 51 percent of the evidence that the defendant committed the act, that it is too fraught with prejudice otherwise to be admitted."
1987.87-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,591.218,593.92,But you are saying the judge has to decide that.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,598.889,601.757,Then that should be held outside of the presence of the jury.
1987.87-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,604.607,611.029,"Suppose there is an offer of proof that the prior bad act did occur, and the defense counsel says, we are going to argue that it didn't."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,613.565,625.873,"If the court finds... it is our position that if the court finds that that had been proven by a preponderance of the evidence, by 51 percent of the evidence, so that it is probative, then yes, then it goes to the jury."
1987.87-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,632.027,635.311,You say it is the same rule as with a voluntary confession.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,635.311,635.694,--Yes.
1987.87-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,635.694,638.43,"The court first decides whether it is a voluntary confession, and then the jury decides it again."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,638.43,642.382,"Yes, and our position is that it comes out of Rule 104(a)."
1987.87-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,642.382,643.25,Can you get that out of the evidence?
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,643.25,644.367,Pardon?
1987.87-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,644.367,655.058,"But this isn't... is that just because of the highly dangerous nature of this evidence in your view, because 104(a) doesn't make that distinction."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,655.058,683.809,"It is... questions concerning the admissibility of evidence, and I would agree with Professor Wright, who indicates that if you are talking about whether a prior bad act is a bad act, that that is a preliminary question that should be decided by the judge, that that isn't a preliminary question of fact, that the government is introducing it for the purpose of showing that the bad act occurred."
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.809,687.177,And what provision of the rules did Professor Wright rely on to reach his opinion?
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,687.177,688.229,104(a).
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,688.229,689.229,104(a)?
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,689.229,689.613,Right.
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,689.613,695.433,"Which simply doesn't address the point at all, so far as I can tell."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,695.433,714.931,"He reads 104(a) and 104(b) as a whole, and because of the possible prejudice and because it is fraught with danger, that he argues and I argue that as do the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits, and as do every circuit court in this country--"
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,714.931,720.584,"Well, did they have some reasoning that hasn't so far been apparent from your argument?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,725.821,727.521,"--Yes, they equate that with preponderance of the evidence."
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,764.61,768.662,I thought you argued for a clear and convincing standard.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,768.662,769.548,I did argue for a--
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,769.548,775.002,Your argument is so different than that which I thought we were hearing from the brief.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,775.002,776.468,--It is.
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,811.525,817.745,"Well, you no longer are asking us to require a clear and convincing standard then?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,817.745,820.047,I am no longer asking that.
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,820.047,820.481,All right.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,820.481,821.983,"I am no longer asking that, because I don't think that--"
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,821.983,827.618,And so I thought the Sixth Circuit applied some preponderance of the evidence there.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,827.618,833.005,--They did on their second... on rehearing they did apply the preponderance of evidence.
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,833.005,837.076,"So you are saying the judgment should be affirmed, I suppose."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,837.076,844.662,"No, I'm saying that the Sixth Circuit also was incorrect in their application of the preponderance of evidence standard."
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,845.012,850.05,That there was not enough evidence that they could have found a preponderance standard?
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,850.05,850.516,--Yes.
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,850.516,853.918,And that's what your argument boils down to now?
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,853.918,881.954,"Well, it is also... I'm taking the position for a preponderance of the evidence, because I believe that the government's position of any basis would be disastrous to criminal defendants, that the government could come in with flimsy similar acts evidence and say this evidence should come in, and then only using the 403... the government argues for a 403 balancing test."
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,881.954,885.056,"Well, let's talk about Rule 403."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,898.131,898.816,The probative value.
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,898.816,900.616,--the probative value.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,900.616,914.843,"403 specifically states that the evidence comes in unless the prejudicial effects substantially outweighs the probative value, which I find very different than a straight probative prejudice balancing."
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,914.843,923.848,"Right, but was there any objection raised below to the Court's treatment of Rule 403 and that balancing?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,923.848,929.918,"There was... yes, the defense counsel on Joint Appendix 6 did object."
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,932.02,938.041,"Well, but that is not a question presented on certiorari to us, is it, the 403 balancing?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,938.041,946.647,"--The 403 only is from a standpoint is if... the government is arguing that that is what the standard should be, is no standard, just 403."
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,946.647,953.618,"All right, but you did not raise some improper application of 403 in the petition for certiorari, did you?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,953.618,954.218,That's correct.
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,954.218,954.903,Okay.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,954.903,956.003,That's correct.
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,961.973,970.079,"Well, do you think the strength of the evidence must be considered in the 403 balancing or not?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,970.079,983.803,"I think that the first... I think that it does, but I think that the first step that must be done is that you don't reach the 403 balancing until you decide that there has... that the similar act has been proven by a preponderance of the evidence."
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,983.803,992.426,So you think the trial judge has to make a separate determination of whether the similar acts are established by a preponderance--
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,992.426,992.926,"Yes, I do."
1987.87-6,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,992.926,1000.449,--before letting it go to the jury and then make another assessment of the strength of the evidence under 403.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1000.449,1018.226,"Yes, the steps that I have argued for, and I argue this in my reply brief specifically, is that first the evidence has to be shown to be admitted for a proper purpose, not for propensity, but for one of the proper purposes under Rule 404(b)."
1987.87-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1051.964,1062.505,Suppose the judge finds that a reasonable trier of fact could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the bad act occurred but he doesn't think it did.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1064.874,1069.009,"I think that your standard is the correct one, reasonable."
1987.87-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1071.528,1075.58,"My question is what... then does it still go to the trier of fact, to the jury?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1075.58,1077.332,"--Yes, it goes to the trier of fact."
1987.87-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1077.332,1079.051,So that he doesn't have to make a finding.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1083.502,1088.572,And that is 51 percent of the evidence.
1987.87-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1088.572,1089.006,May I ask--
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1091.358,1104.416,"He has to determine that a trier of fact could make that finding, yes, that a reasonable person could make a finding of 51 percent of the evidence."
1987.87-6,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1104.416,1109.82,"May I ask you a question about the bad act in this case, the sale of the television sets?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1128.631,1136.887,"My position is, they have to prove, yes, that the televisions were stolen and that the defendant knew that they were stolen."
1987.87-6,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1136.887,1137.453,Knew that they were stolen.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1137.453,1138.089,By a preponderance.
1987.87-6,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.089,1139.755,"And here all they really proved was the first three, isn't it?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1140.605,1141.241,I think that's all they proved.
1987.87-6,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1159.353,1161.319,"--Well, three years after the trial doesn't help very much."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1161.319,1165.222,"No, it doesn't, but certainly their evidence was from Mr. Toney."
1987.87-6,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.118,1188.188,Did the government argue that it had proved that the TVs were stolen and that he knew they were stolen?
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1188.188,1192.057,"No, they just argued that it was relevant to show his knowledge."
1987.87-6,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.357,1196.978,"Knowledge of what, knowledge of the tape sale or the TV sale?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1196.978,1203.448,--They argued... the transcript is not very... the hearing was not very long.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1229.349,1231.049,So you have each changed.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1231.049,1232.384,We have each changed.
1987.87-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1250.012,1263.57,"Mr. Ferris, I assume that your argument would apply to everything covered by 404(b), and therefore I am a little concerned about using the shorthand ""bad evidence""."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1263.57,1264.286,Right.
1987.87-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1264.286,1266.138,It isn't all bad.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1319.24,1323.375,"In most cases... I don't believe in most cases that that is the sort of evidence that comes in, but it is not--"
1987.87-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1323.375,1327.262,"But that... 404(b) is what would let that in, isn't it?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1327.262,1330.13,"--No question, and in fact the government points that out."
1987.87-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1351.544,1354.08,"Why is it... I mean, why?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1354.08,1354.613,--Because--
1987.87-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1354.613,1363.352,"For the other one you could at least justify it by saying it is very inflammatory, and the common law doesn't like people to be, you know, prior criminal acts to be brought in without proving that they actually occurred."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1369.005,1379.445,"--My position is under 104(b), and this is supported by every Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States that that is what that language means, preponderance of the evidence."
1987.87-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.394,1403.513,It seems very strange to me.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1417.27,1424.342,"--No, it... no, I believe that... no, because that... well, if you pigeonhole it under identity."
1987.87-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.211,1432.08,"Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts that is not admissible to prove the character."
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1438.067,1481.346,"--Right, if it is pigeonholed under the identity, but at some point you are talking about... you go into part of the res gestae, which is... the government argued in their brief as a fallback position that this shouldn't even be analyzed under a similar act evidence, that these TVs should come in because it showed that Mr. Huddleston was... if these TVs were not stolen, if this Court adopts a standard of the preponderance of the evidence, that if these TVs were not shown to be stolen by a preponderance of the evidence, that they should have come in anyway, because it shows that Mr. Huddleston had a habit, not a habit, but had been selling things throughout the State of Michigan that were of questionable character."
1987.87-6,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.253,1626.203,"--That was the panel opinion, wasn't it?"
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1626.203,1630.573,"That was the panel opinion, two-one, that they indicated that there was plain error."
1987.87-6,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.573,1633.608,What about the... on rehearing?
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1633.608,1636.226,On rehearing they indicated that there was not?
1987.87-6,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1636.226,1636.726,Not what?
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1636.726,1639.695,"Two of them... yes, two of them switched their votes."
1987.87-6,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1643.73,1644.332,Not necessary.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1644.332,1645.816,"Yes, because--"
1987.87-6,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.816,1646.682,But they did.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1646.682,1647.534,--They did.
1987.87-6,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.534,1649.234,And what did they say?
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1649.234,1652.57,They said that it was harmless error under the Kotteakos standard.
1987.87-6,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.57,1653.438,Yes.
1987.87-6,0,20829,don_ferris,,1653.438,1667.58,"And this Court can review that under United States versus Hastings, because again that was not cited at the trial court level, that this Court can rule on harmless error, and I would like to point out to the Court that this was a close case."
1987.87-6,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1721.082,1722.149,"Thank you, Mr. Ferris."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1727.836,1733.14,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, our position in this case is very simple."
1987.87-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1798.916,1806.253,"Does the strength of the evidence have to be considered in making the 403 balance, Mr. Bryson?"
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1806.253,1807.438,"I think it does come in, Your Honor."
1987.87-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1808.222,1811.34,"I mean, if it is very slender evidence--"
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1811.34,1812.507,"--If it is extremely slender and it is very, very--"
1987.87-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1812.507,1813.59,--and highly prejudicial--
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1813.59,1814.024,--Absolutely.
1987.87-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1814.024,1816.359,--that might be something the Court would consider.
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1816.359,1817.328,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1987.87-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1844.328,1855.786,"I mean, the court might have had a little on the balancing in this case, I would think, in light of the fact that there isn't much to show knowledge that the televisions were stolen, is there?"
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1855.786,1863.457,"--Well, Your Honor, I think there is enough to justify a jury in concluding that they are stolen, and we make the point in the brief."
1987.87-6,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1863.457,1864.073,How so?
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1865.742,1866.359,"Well, sure."
1987.87-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1990.306,1994.526,"But the jury, the jury is going to have to find that they were stolen."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1994.526,2001.197,"I don't think it would have to make that finding, Your Honor, because suppose the jury concluded, we just don't think they were stolen."
1987.87-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2015.023,2028.015,So you don't think in the Court of Appeals then it should even have been open to argue that there was not enough evidence for any reasonable jury to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the televisions were stolen?
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2028.015,2040.555,"Well, we think that would be open to argue that if the Court concluded that the other theory of relevance, our backup theory of relevance was inapplicable, but... in other words, the Court could--"
1987.87-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2040.555,2047.744,"Well, yes, but you say it is admissible without any prior decision by a judge if it is relevant."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2047.744,2048.561,--That's right.
1987.87-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.561,2058.833,"Now, if you are right in that regard you have no business argument the sufficiency of the evidence as to whether the goods were stolen on appeal, right?"
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2058.833,2064.404,"Well, Your Honor, there are two different issues, I think, if I can sort them out, because I think they get resolved in a slightly different way."
1987.87-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2064.404,2067.773,"Well, eventually answer my question."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2067.773,2068.606,"Well, the--"
1987.87-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2068.606,2071.824,"Well, go ahead, but sooner or later answer it."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2071.824,2075.378,"--Well, I am not sure I understand the--"
1987.87-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.378,2077.293,I have forgotten it already.
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2077.293,2078.163,--I'm sorry.
1987.87-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2082.282,2091.404,"Well, assume we take your position on relevance, that if the evidence is relevant, it comes in, without the judge doing anything else but saying it is relevant."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2091.404,2094.09,"Well, and perhaps this is the answer to the question."
1987.87-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.09,2106.248,And then does it make any difference on appeal whether or not there is sufficient evidence for a jury to find that the televisions were stolen?
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2106.248,2114.603,"Well, it may, Your Honor, under this circumstance, and that is why this case presents both parts of the analysis as we see it."
1987.87-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2147.141,2151.093,"I don't think that's what the rule means at all, Mr. Bryson."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2179.446,2180.246,"--Yes, sir."
1987.87-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2180.246,2186.85,"--and another witness is going to come along and tie it in, and so that is what it seems to me that conditional admission is talking about."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2191.086,2192.754,"Under 104(b), Your Honor--"
1987.87-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2192.754,2193.621,104(b).
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2193.621,2200.025,"--of course the judge can admit evidence subject to its being connected up, but this is a basic... there is nothing special about Rule 104(b)."
1987.87-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2225.458,2229.379,"You handle that on voir dire ordinarily, don't you?"
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2229.379,2229.962,--Of course.
1987.87-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2229.962,2236.865,The defense attorney is entitled to examine this witness to see if he has a sufficient basis for concluding--
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2236.865,2237.567,Precisely.
1987.87-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.567,2244.721,"--But your submission to Justice White, I thought, was that at this point you asked the judge to make a finding of fact."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2246.071,2250.208,"No, Your Honor, not... and this is where we differ from petitioner."
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2286.631,2294.504,"Mr. Bryson, before you go into this alternative theory of relevance, let me just be sure I understand your position on the conditional relevance."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2322.804,2323.673,That is correct.
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.673,2326.792,So it is conditional at least to that extent--
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2326.792,2327.225,That's correct.
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.225,2328.608,--even if it is just a balancing process.
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2328.608,2329.327,"That's correct, and--"
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2329.327,2339.35,"So you agree... I want to be perfectly clear about it... you agree that on the theory that they were trying to prove the television sets were stolen, that that 104(b) does apply."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2339.35,2342.902,"--Oh, yes, on that theory, and we say so in the last footnote in our brief."
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2342.902,2343.435,All right.
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2347.639,2370.921,"Because the testimony... the way the testimony came in in this case, we had first the witness who testified about the actual sales of the tapes, and she testified that Mr. Huddleston said he had not only these tapes but also had some movies that he was trying to sell in the meantime."
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.96,2432.978,"In other words, you are claiming it is impeachment?"
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2435.162,2435.913,"Your honor, that is not--"
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2435.913,2437.496,"You put it in before he testified, didn't you?"
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2437.496,2449.654,"--You bet, and that is not just impeachment because his whole defense was lack of knowledge on the basis of having so little contact with this material that he had no--"
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2449.654,2451.606,So little contact with the tapes.
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2451.606,2462.164,"--Well, that's right, but our point is that if has contact with the same people, the same operation over an extended period of time, he is much more integrally involved in that operation, and therefore much--"
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2462.164,2467.199,"Yes, but if three out of the four products, there is no evidence they are stolen, how does that tend to prove that he knew the fourth product was stolen?"
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2467.199,2472.853,--Because he knows... he is much more integrally involved with the operation and therefore he is much more--
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2472.853,2479.792,"Well, Sears Roebuck sells 400 items and then because it is a big operation and they happen to have one stolen item that makes them know that one stolen item?"
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2480.408,2493.866,"--Because he is running operation or playing a very major role in the operation, the jury could infer that his defense, which is that he had so little contact he had no reason to inquire, he was just doing a favor for a friend just doesn't wash."
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2566.748,2576.437,Would you make the same argument if there were evidence that was really very powerful that none of the other items were stolen?
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2576.437,2577.622,You mean in other words--
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.622,2583.793,Your second theory of relevance would be the same even if he came in later and gave evidence that you would accept as clear and convincing--
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2583.793,2585.793,"--Yes, the second theory, yes."
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2585.793,2587.078,--You would still say it is the same.
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2587.078,2597.117,"I would think it would be relevant, Your Honor, and it is so minimally prejudicial that I think the balance could probably be drawn in favor of admitting the evidence."
1987.87-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2597.117,2601.838,"Mr. Bryson, I gather from what you said earlier concerning your first theory--"
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2601.838,2602.488,Yes.
1987.87-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.488,2622.251,"--that you don't think that each similar act has to be evaluated on its own, that the criterion is whether a reasonable jury could find on the basis of all of the similar acts that the goods were stolen."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2622.251,2622.768,I think that's right.
1987.87-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.768,2624.084,By which I mean this.
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2627.636,2628.072,"Yes, the counterfeit."
1987.87-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2628.472,2639.628,"--and you show that the individual went into ten different stores, and each one of those ten stores had a $50 bill in the cash register that was counterfeit afterwards."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2649.818,2671.665,"I think petitioner would want to do them one by one, but we would not, and I think that you're correct, that when you put them all together it makes a compelling showing with regard to each, and there is no reason that a judge in looking at the question of whether this is something that a jury could conclude established the question which was the basis for the conditional relevance finding."
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2678.338,2686.424,"Of course, the difference between that case and this one is that everybody agrees on your hypothetical they were counterfeit, but here you don't have any agreement on whether these other items were all stolen."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2686.424,2688.11,"Well, suppose we were--"
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.11,2694.097,"If you have 50 $10 bills and 49 of them are genuine and one of them is counterfeit and he passed all 50, what does that prove?"
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2694.097,2703.203,"--Well, suppose in my counterfeit example we were unable for some reason to prove that several of the bills were counterfeit, which would be analogous to this case."
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2725.732,2728.418,"But then you prove they're good fifties, the whole thing seems kind of silly."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2728.418,2731.453,"--Well, if in fact it is proved they are good fifties, then we have a problem, but--"
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2731.453,2733.655,"In fact, this is one of the problems with hypothetical cases."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2741.911,2753.219,"--Well, we don't know they're stolen but certainly the evidence is probative because of the nature of what it describes about the process the defendant is engaged in."
1987.87-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2753.219,2773.697,"Mr. Bryson, on your first theory of relevance, if we accept that, do we have to reach the argument that there was not sufficient evidence for any reasonable jury to find that these televisions were stolen?"
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2773.697,2780.953,"The first theory being the theory that it was admissible without regard to whether they were stolen, you don't have to reach the question."
1987.87-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.953,2782.003,How about your second?
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2782.003,2792.261,"On the second you would, and the question would be one not of whether either there was clear or convincing evidence or even that the judge believes--"
1987.87-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2792.261,2794.713,"No, no, whether a reasonable jury could find."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2794.713,2796.546,"--that there is a preponderance, but rather whether a reasonable jury could draw this inference."
1987.87-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2796.546,2799.997,So we do have to reach on--
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2799.997,2801.799,On the stolen property theory.
1987.87-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2813.174,2821.78,"--It seems to me that on your first theory, that that wasn't... that wasn't the basis on which this evidence was offered."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2821.78,2823.73,"Well, the evidence, Your Honor, was--"
1987.87-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.73,2825.548,--and we don't know what a trial judge would have thought about it.
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2828.017,2829.969,"--Your Honor, the evidence was offered on a--"
1987.87-6,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2829.969,2832.921,Because you have changed your position from the Court of Appeals.
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2832.921,2837.89,"--Well, Your Honor, the evidence was offered on the basis that it was relevant to knowledge."
1987.87-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3106.764,3113.401,You don't really mind that antagonism really but you say they should vent it through the other provision that requires balancing.
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3113.401,3114.853,--That is exactly what we say.
1987.87-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3114.853,3122.424,In some cases you would even allow that that balancing would lead a court to say I won't let it in unless I believe by a preponderance that it was stolen.
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3122.424,3131.362,"Well, I think a judge should not draw a conclusion like that which would simply be a way of getting around Rule 104(b), but I would think there would be cases--"
1987.87-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3131.362,3134.314,Conceivably a judge might think it was so prejudicial that that's the standard he'd impose.
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3134.314,3134.731,--Exactly.
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3277.043,3279.043,May I ask you a question about your theory?
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3279.043,3279.409,Yes.
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3279.409,3288.933,"Do you agree that in the first time the Court of Appeals decided the case, although they weighed the factors different from the way you would, that they followed the procedure that you say was correct?"
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3297.956,3302.158,"Your Honor, they invoked the clear and convincing test, which it seems to me is the error."
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3302.158,3302.758,In the first--
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3302.758,3306.126,"I believe so, in the panel opinion."
1987.87-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3317.418,3319.62,"--Well, I guess I misread it."
1987.87-6,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3319.62,3322.821,"If the Court has no further questions, thank you."
1987.87-6,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3322.821,3323.837,"Thank you, Mr. Bryson."
1987.87-6,2,20829,don_ferris,,3333.277,3349.305,"Your Honor, the government does admit 104(b) comes into play in these cases, and they should because the advisory committee notes to 401 recognize the distinction between logical relevancy under 401 and conditional relevancy under 104."
1987.87-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3372.087,3379.508,"May I just ask there, when you say preponderance of evidence, do you mean the judge must find by a preponderance, or there must be sufficient evidence that a jury could find?"
1987.87-6,2,20829,don_ferris,,3379.508,3381.943,"Yes, I misspoke to Justice White."
1987.87-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3386.514,3389.014,So you and your opponent disagree on the meaning of the preponderance standard.
1987.87-6,2,20829,don_ferris,,3389.014,3389.466,Yes.
1987.87-6,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3420.651,3423.603,I had thought that the government's in agreement on that.
1987.87-6,2,20829,don_ferris,,3424.972,3430.959,"No, the governments argues that it is a straight 403 balancing, which... and we disagree."
1987.87-6,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3448.754,3450.087,"Thank you, Mr. Ferris."
