2010.09-1088,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.939,"We will hear argument next in Case 09-1088, Cullen v. Pinholster."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,10.956,14.574,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,70.06,75.464,"Could we just clarify what you mean by ""factual basis""?"
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,97.747,98.38,Yes.
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,98.38,103.65,"With the exception of the fact that the defense attorneys only worked 6 hours, the billing records."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,109.637,111.62,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,114.172,119.326,So we are only talking about the expert opinion facts being new?
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,119.326,123.195,There are a number of facts that were new in the Federal--
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,123.195,125.961,"What -- besides the opinion, what were they?"
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,125.961,131.515,"--Well, as the Court averted, there was also the notion that there was somehow a limited amount of time."
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,131.515,135.253,"Well, he did allege that in his petition before the State court?"
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,135.253,137.569,"He did not allege 6-1/2 hours, Your Honor."
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,137.569,141.673,"Not specifically, but he said that his counsel didn't prepare."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,141.673,143.74,"That's precisely correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,143.74,153.964,"And he pointed to the fact that counsel basically said at the trial, I didn't think we were to have a mitigation hearing, as proof of that, correct."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,153.964,155.497,"He did point to that, Your Honor."
2010.09-1088,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,221.323,233.563,"Mr. Bilderback, I know that that's the principal fact that you rely upon that there's a difference, but could you give us a full catalogue of the facts that are different in the Federal court record from the facts that are different in the State court record?"
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,238.2,261.531,"Those are -- those are the significant facts that we think are -- are relevant to the discussion of whether or not the State court determination should be or could properly be found to have been unreasonable, was -- was the difference in the specificity of the -- of the nature of the claim of deficient performance in terms of the time sheets and--"
2010.09-1088,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,261.531,266.618,What about Dr. Stahlberg's new deposition?
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,280.377,281.294,"--Oh, certainly, Your Honor."
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,330.794,332.327,Can we just be clear?
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,332.327,333.129,--Yes.
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,333.129,340.066,I thought that Dr. Stahlberg's affidavit in the State court said that he had brain damage of some sort.
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,340.066,342.435,"That's not accurate, Your Honor."
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,342.435,352.623,I thought it said that he -- the school records show evidence of mental disturbances and some degree of brain damage.
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,352.623,353.909,I believe that--
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,353.909,359.479,What he did say -- I think there is a difference between -- because he pointed to epilepsy.
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,380.977,392.134,"--Well, he -- he never said that if he had had the additional information, that he would have diagnosed Mr. Pinholster as suffering from organic brain damage."
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,392.134,392.734,"No, no, no."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,398.271,399.488,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,417.233,423.47,Your adversary points to the difference in language between (d)(1) and (d)(2).
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,423.47,424.339,Yes.
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,424.339,437.813,"(D)(2) refers to unreasonable in light of the facts, unreasonable determination of facts in light of the record before the Court, and subdivision (1) doesn't."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,462.012,463.964,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,463.964,468.951,But there are exceptions in (e)(2) for hearings.
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,468.951,469.601,Yes.
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,469.601,479.49,So why shouldn't the first subdivision be read to mean unreasonable legal determination in light of the record before the court?
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,479.49,486.494,Because subdivisions (d)(1) and (d)(2) serve very different purposes.
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,530.423,570.731,"Are you suggesting that if a State court gets a proffer of evidence from a State petitioner who says: I have a billing record that shows that my attorney worked only 6 hours, and the State says: We are not admitting that billing record because it hasn't been authenticated, so we're not looking at that fact, and the Federal habeas looks at what was proffered and says: This is authentication under any rule, State or Federal."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,605.821,616.277,"Well, what I'm suggesting is that the language of (d)(2) was designed to limit the bases upon which a Federal court could overturn a State court factual finding."
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,619.545,620.664,But I'm going back to (d)(1).
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,620.664,625.616,"--Yes, and the symmetrical language in (d)(1) is the language--"
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,625.616,626.901,It's not symmetrical.
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,626.901,641.994,"--I would disagree, because I believe the symmetrical language in (d)(1) is the limitation on the Federal court's reliance on lower Federal court authority to overturn State court factual determinations."
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,823.894,828.315,There is a paragraph right after what you cite that basically says unless there is a hearing.
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,839.486,842.638,"--And if a hearing is appropriately held, that's a very different question."
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,870.289,879.295,"So why don't we start the way that you are proposing, which is to start with (e)(2), was the hearing appropriately held, first?"
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,891.186,892.302,I am.
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,892.302,903.66,"--and only if the Petitioner wins under (d)(1), on proving that the decision on the facts before that -- the State court were reasonable, that you ever get to (e)(2)."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,903.66,904.294,And that's why--
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,904.294,905.612,Why is that logical?
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,921.304,958.978,"--Well, setting aside for the moment a point I hope to get to, which is I believe that they did fail under (e)(2); but assuming the premise of the question, which is that (e)(2) has been satisfied and that the Federal evidentiary hearing might be appropriate, it makes no more sense to conduct a Federal evidentiary hearing before you conduct a (d)(1) analysis than it would to conduct a Federal evidentiary hearing before you do the 2254(a) analysis of whether there is a Federal question, the 2254(b) and (c) analysis of whether the claim is properly exhausted, or the 2254(d) analysis of whether the State court resolution of the claim was reasonable."
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,969.785,972.737,"Counsel, I can tell you the one thing you've said that makes no sense."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,987.247,1007.743,"--Well, I would submit that we could bring some much-needed clarity to some of the confusion on these issues if the -- I think the plain language of 2254(d)(1), which is retrospective and contextual, is -- was -- is given its full force and effect."
2010.09-1088,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1007.743,1008.726,How does that work--
2010.09-1088,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1008.726,1010.112,Although that--
2010.09-1088,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1010.112,1014.397,"--How does that work, counsel, if you have new evidence?"
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1034.061,1043.349,"Well, the question -- and I think the question the Court's asked seems to implicate the ACLU's hypothetical in their amicus brief."
2010.09-1088,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1104.574,1109.042,"So -- so you think, and I have trouble understanding the parties' position on this."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1129.522,1138.045,"--Oh, it's our position that the introduction of the organic brain damage evidence fundamentally changes the nature of this claim."
2010.09-1088,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1151.638,1159.809,"So then, and the reason that doesn't undermine your position is because you think it's evidence that could have been discovered and presented earlier?"
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1159.809,1166.478,"--Well, indeed the very nature of their claim compels the conclusion that it could have been presented earlier."
2010.09-1088,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1166.478,1167.062,I understand that.
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1176.601,1179.87,Depending upon the nature of the new evidence--
2010.09-1088,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1179.87,1180.886,If it's really a new claim?
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1180.886,1200.948,"--And again, I think we have a pretty well-settled body of jurisprudence that is instructive on that, and that is the 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii) analyses of when a claim that was previously adjudicated on the merits by a Federal court can be revisited in a subsequent petition that is filed in the Federal court."
2010.09-1088,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1220.91,1224.563,I suppose -- I suppose the Federal court can send it back to the State court for exhaustion.
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1224.563,1227.931,--If -- if that's -- if that's an appropriate remedy.
2010.09-1088,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1264.854,1276.496,"What happens -- I will think it through, but it seems to me that it is not consistent with what I thought the theory of your brief was for you to tell the Chief Justice that this is -- the hypothetical was a new claim."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1285.185,1288.137,I don't think that the ACLU hypothetical states a new claim.
2010.09-1088,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1289.337,1290.022,Okay.
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1290.022,1291.822,--with the addition of the organic brain damage evidence.
2010.09-1088,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1296.243,1301.897,"But if it's a new claim, then if -- we don't look to (d) because it wasn't adjudicated on the merits."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1301.897,1302.463,--Correct.
2010.09-1088,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1302.463,1303.43,--and so you go to (e).
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1303.43,1307.467,"Well, if it was -- yes, that's -- that's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-1088,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1319.358,1327.362,So then now it seems to me that you're saying that this is an (e) claim and that you will just fight the battle on whether or not it could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1338.153,1341.855,"--If we assume that the claim is a new claim, if we assume--"
2010.09-1088,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1341.855,1343.906,"Well, I thought you said you agreed that it was."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1343.906,1359.25,"--In my case I agree that the facts presented to the Federal court were never presented to the State court, and those facts fundamentally transformed the claim such that the claim upon which the Ninth Circuit granted relief was never presented to California."
2010.09-1088,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1359.25,1359.783,Okay.
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1360.768,1373.843,"No, Your Honor, because you only can leap to (e)(2) if the State court never had the opportunity to examine the facts of the claim and if the Petitioner can show that he could not have previously presented the claim to--"
2010.09-1088,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1373.843,1374.376,--No.
2010.09-1088,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1374.376,1375.695,Then it's a procedural bar?
2010.09-1088,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1375.695,1376.612,Just a second.
2010.09-1088,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1376.612,1378.897,Then it's a procedural bar case?
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1378.897,1383.967,"--Well, depending on how the State court reacts to the new evidence."
2010.09-1088,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1426.46,1430.429,"--Well, Mr. Bilderback, going back to your question of what's a claim."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1470.989,1482.214,"Well, of course, a claim is made up of two components, and one of them is the legal theory of the claim and the other is the factual landscape that we are asking that legal theory to be applied to."
2010.09-1088,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1521.422,1521.956,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-1088,0,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,1521.956,1522.522,Thank you.
2010.09-1088,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1522.522,1529.112,Mr. Kennedy.
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,1529.112,1535.766,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1606.028,1616.384,"Yes, but you say that, even on the basis of the facts before the California court, your client deserved relief."
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,1660.413,1664.651,We do have to live with the basis that the Ninth Circuit wrote.
2010.09-1088,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1699.488,1704.459,A finding under the standards that we have applied under AEDPA?
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,1704.459,1708.578,"Yes, an objectively unreasonable application of Strickland."
2010.09-1088,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1708.578,1712.529,Then this case presents no issue.
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,1741.982,1744.017,Yes--
2010.09-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.203,1747.803,"That's your very point, isn't it?"
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,1747.803,1757.593,"In our opposition for cert we said this, that we thought it should not be granted because of the presentation in State court--"
2010.09-1088,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1757.593,1759.593,I mention it not because it wouldn't.
2010.09-1088,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1759.593,1777.155,"We have to determine under AEDPA that it was objectively unreasonable for this lawyer to get a psychiatrist, or whatever his status was; to get a report, which he did, and which he looked at, in which the psychiatrist or psychologist said, look, there is nothing here."
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,1811.745,1817.149,"--Yes, and it is in the facts of this case, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.09-1088,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1829.505,1839.545,What about the argument that a good deal of mitigation evidence came out during the trial on the guilt?
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,1839.545,1843.997,"It did not come out, Justice Ginsberg."
2010.09-1088,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1882.172,1882.872,All right.
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,1941.76,1964.292,"Well, Justice Kennedy, the Ninth Circuit did make alternative rulings, but turning to the question of the new evidence, we believe the new evidence was properly considered, although the court made it clear that it would affirm based only on what was on State court, because that showing was so substantial in and of itself."
2010.09-1088,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2003.0,2006.285,Just to pause for a moment: You said there was no hearing in the State court.
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2019.109,2024.929,"Mr. Chief Justice, the California Supreme Court didn't tell us what I -- what they did."
2010.09-1088,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2094.241,2105.965,Isn't it the California rule that a hearing had to have been conducted unless they concluded that the Petitioner was not entitled to relief based on the facts alleged in the petition?
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2105.965,2131.549,"I think that's the rule, Justice Alito, but if that is what was done here, because it is the most commonly invoked rule, it was objectively unreasonable, because in light of the presentation that was made in State court -- and I've given the Court some of it -- that was definitely a showing of an unreasonable application of Strickland, because--"
2010.09-1088,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2131.549,2141.888,"Well, to get back to the question the Chief Justice asked before, trial counsel did consult a psychiatrist, Dr. Stalberg, and his report was very unfavorable."
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2157.266,2160.218,"--I'm sorry, Justice Alito, that's not my argument."

2010.09-1088,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2321.872,2325.907,"Well, there you are, and I should have asked Justice Scalia beforehand."
2010.09-1088,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2325.907,2334.596,"So you are putting your eggs in the basket that under AEDPA, what happened here was objectively unreasonable?"
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2334.596,2335.346,Well--
2010.09-1088,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2335.346,2343.286,Or do you want to go on and look at the question on which we granted cert and argue that we should look at the new evidence or that the State court should look at the new evidence?
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2343.286,2349.19,"--Well, we think what happened here was perfectly appropriate for the court to hold a hearing."
2010.09-1088,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2368.584,2387.165,"Well, this -- again, as your friend pointed out, and I have to say it's a logical conundrum for me, too -- you have to show under (e)(2) that the factual predicate could not have been previously discovered, and your claim is that his lawyer should have discovered this."
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2394.901,2401.657,"Well, I guess it depends on how one interprets the term ""factual predicate""."
2010.09-1088,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2444.667,2451.571,Could you go back to Justice Kagan's earlier question of how we draw the line?
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2460.696,2468.267,"--I think we draw the line by focusing on what is legally relevant, not a DSM opinion."
2010.09-1088,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2525.603,2560.026,"Suppose a petitioner in the State post-conviction proceeding proffers an affidavit from one mental health expert alleging one type of mental disorder, and then after relief is denied in the State court, the petitioner files in Federal court and asks for an evidentiary hearing at which the petitioner is going to call a dozen highly distinguished mental health experts who will testify to a very different mental disorder."
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2567.013,2572.35,I think it's going to depend on the facts of the case but he's going to have a very difficult time.
2010.09-1088,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2575.869,2576.552,But why?
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2582.456,2585.992,--Because the opinion is based on facts.
2010.09-1088,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2620.713,2630.085,"Well, that's very complicated, just as your opponent's idea of what constitutes a claim is very complicated and fact-dependent."
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2651.784,2653.017,I--
2010.09-1088,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2653.017,2663.342,"The factual predicate of the claim is the new evidence that is brought forward in -- in the Federal proceeding, and unless there is a good reason why that wasn't brought forward in the State proceeding, it shouldn't be considered."
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2663.342,2675.983,"--Justice Alito, I think that can and should be a part of analyzing diligence, and in the particular hypothetical that Your Honor has posed, it seems like it's going to be tough to show diligence."

2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2729.665,2730.867,Well--
2010.09-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2730.867,2736.002,"So at least, you know, that really doesn't cover the waterfront of -- of all new evidence."
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2736.002,2748.662,"--Well, the State also says in its reply brief that it's not just the affidavits, it's the affidavits looked -- looked at against the backdrop of the whole State court record."
2010.09-1088,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2748.662,2757.268,"But, Mr. Kennedy, do you agree with the State that there are two thing at issue here, there is the new medical testimony and there is also the billing sheets?"
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2757.268,2770.825,"Well, I -- I respectfully don't, because the billing sheets in our State, there is a procedure where counsel have to submit the billing sheets to the court, and where the information comes from is the clerk's transcript in this case from the State court record."
2010.09-1088,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2770.825,2776.063,"Oh, but that's not -- that was not presented as evidence in the State court, the billing sheets?"
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2776.063,2779.181,"No, we said he didn't prepare at all in State court."
2010.09-1088,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2794.458,2795.977,Could you just clarify again for me?
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2803.131,2836.435,"In our State the -- the appointed counsel submits a 987 form under penalty of perjury saying these are the hours I worked; I want to be paid; and it happens in real time and it was done throughout the trial and it is part of the clerk's transcript and the reason the district court admitted them in this case, they were -- they were exhibits 67 through 72, and it's -- they were admitted because they were the records from the State court record, from the clerk's transcript."
2010.09-1088,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2836.435,2836.97,But what about--
2010.09-1088,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2836.97,2847.992,"I think what's important is that they are not -- I mean, tell me if I am wrong, but they were not part of the State court record on which the State court made the 2254(d)(1) determination, is that right?"
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2847.992,2858.098,"Well, the -- they were not, but the allegation was that they did nothing so it was even a stronger allegation in State court than was ultimately pursued at the (e)(2) hearings."
2010.09-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2858.098,2863.602,"To say that they were on record in the State court is not to say that they were part of the record, of the trial record."
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2866.287,2869.239,"Well, the clerk's transcript is part of the trial record."
2010.09-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2876.51,2879.678,All -- all that goes -- goes to the fact-finder?
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2879.678,2880.245,--Well--
2010.09-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2880.245,2882.214,All that goes to a jury in criminal cases?

2010.09-1088,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2892.271,2900.091,"When you say the State court -- you just told us that this was better off because it is only 6 hours, and you said in the State court they did nothing, is that right?"
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2900.091,2900.658,Yes.
2010.09-1088,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2901.21,2909.881,"When you say they did nothing, surely that was rhetorical hyperbole, and you took the 6 hours to say this proves what we said, they did nothing; they did next to nothing."
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2913.935,2931.278,--I think what we did is we confirmed the allegation that we had made in State court which is just another example of why it was important based on these allegations for Pinholster to get a hearing to develop the record--
2010.09-1088,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2931.278,2941.05,"That gets back to the point that Justice Scalia was making, is that this is new evidence that the Ninth Circuit considered with respect to the original."
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2958.345,2990.733,"--Well, I think you can, because the Ninth Circuit -- I mean, if you look at -- if the Court looks at the allegations in State court, there were -- the allegations regarding counsel's performance was that they did not believe that they were going to a penalty phase; that because they did not look at the prosecutor's open file, they did not know that their theory that they really did not have a penalty phase was wrong; and that they had no strategic reason--"
2010.09-1088,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2990.733,2997.403,"You are going back to arguing that, you win under the original proceeding and the question on which we granted cert--"

2010.09-1088,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2998.386,2998.953,--should be addressed.
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,2998.953,2999.338,Yes.
2010.09-1088,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2999.338,2999.888,Okay.
2010.09-1088,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2999.888,3002.54,--Is -- I just want to be as clear as possible.
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,3034.643,3035.178,Yes.
2010.09-1088,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3035.178,3035.711,Okay.
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,3059.258,3061.61,"Well, the--"
2010.09-1088,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3061.61,3064.979,I can ask you is that conceded on both sides?
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,3064.979,3093.331,"--Well, what the Ninth Circuit majority was saying is that if there was some bar that (e)(2) had to holding a hearing where new evidence could be properly presented, that it wouldn't matter, because based on the record before it in State court, it proved a Strickland violation under Williams, Wiggins and Rompilla; and it was objectively unreasonable."
2010.09-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3093.331,3100.901,"Yes, but that -- that was on the assumption that the only new evidence would have been the evidence of, how did they put it?"
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,3110.59,3113.709,"Well, but I'm -- I'm sorry."
2010.09-1088,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3113.709,3116.244,"--Counsel, could I just ask one clarifying question."
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,3142.894,3152.083,"Yes, because it's the same -- we have an automatic appeals and the habeas is done in front of the Supreme Court."
2010.09-1088,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3188.089,3189.939,"How do you believe that, you have nothing to support it."
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,3197.445,3216.906,"Your Honor, the lawyers made this revelation in court at trial in front of the famously aggressive prosecutor and the trial judge who knew these lawyers and had sat through the hearing, and no one had any suggestion that it was puffery or it was false."
2010.09-1088,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3240.022,3252.245,"How long does it take to read Dr. Stahlberg's report that says I've looked at this, I've examined this, this and this and there is nothing here that is going to support a mental impairment theory?"
2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,3252.245,3260.518,"It's very short, but the report, when they read that quick report on its face they had to know that he wasn't prepared enough to render an opinion."

2010.09-1088,1,41598,sean_k_kennedy,,3305.98,3326.144,"The factual predicate that could not be discovered was the evolution of the mental health testimonies as it moved from affidavit to live testimony, and the state gave for the first time specific notice of how it was going to attack the presentation in state court."
2010.09-1088,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3337.935,3339.137,"Thank you, counsel."

2010.09-1088,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3342.255,3357.182,Could you clarify the procedure question I asked earlier: Were the billing records made part of the record that went up to the California reviewing courts?
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3357.182,3358.799,"Some, but not all of them were."
2010.09-1088,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3358.799,3362.134,Are you claiming the 6-hour one didn't go up?
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3362.134,3374.025,"Well, of course, part of the problem is that the 6 and a half-hour figure is arrived at by purportedly adding up all of the hours spent in preparation--"
2010.09-1088,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3374.025,3375.743,I'm just asking a simple question.
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3382.047,3382.497,--Yes.
2010.09-1088,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3382.497,3384.832,--were they before the California reviewing courts?
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3384.832,3385.399,Yes.
2010.09-1088,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3427.143,3430.897,Is that where the 6 and a half hours came from?
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3430.897,3431.38,--No.
2010.09-1088,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3436.132,3437.884,Which the California court had.
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3437.884,3438.401,--Yes.
2010.09-1088,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3440.786,3441.853,"So it's not new evidence, then."
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3444.455,3454.845,"--Well, the -- again, the allegation that there were only 6 and a half hours spent in preparation, that allegation was never made through the California Supreme Court."
2010.09-1088,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3454.845,3459.13,"But if I'm on the reviewing court, and the lawyer spent no time preparing--"
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3459.13,3459.963,I beg your pardon.
2010.09-1088,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3459.963,3469.169,"--When I was reviewing judge on the Court of Appeals, someone said he didn't spend any time doing X, Y, and Z, and the first thing I went to was the billing records."
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3473.407,3473.907,Yes.
2010.09-1088,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3474.473,3482.079,"So I have to assume -- I don't have to assume, but it's not new evidence."
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3483.363,3493.219,"--The billing records -- again, the billing records upon which the Ninth Circuit arrived at its conclusion that there were only 6 and a half hours was before the State court."
2010.09-1088,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3505.459,3509.93,"If you are relying on allegations rather than the evidence, the allegation was even worse."
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3511.996,3512.965,Exactly.
2010.09-1088,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3513.565,3514.865,But that doesn't help you.
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3514.865,3520.219,"--No, it doesn't, Your Honor, because that allegation was plainly false, based upon the State court record."
2010.09-1088,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3562.094,3564.112,"Is this right, then?"
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3580.573,3581.34,Yes.
2010.09-1088,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3581.34,3603.087,"Then to get home, we then have to look at the new evidence, and there it's some combination of: A, there was nothing to have a hearing about, because there is nothing here that lets you have a hearing; or B, there was something to have a hearing about because this was so new that it was a new claim, and you should have gone to the State court first on that one, but there is no room to do it."
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3614.112,3624.9,The only point with which I would -- I would take issue with the Court's characterization is -- I assume the Court was not speaking hypothetically.
2010.09-1088,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3626.585,3627.302,"Yes, yes."
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3627.302,3630.871,"In my case, the State court's doors are not closed."
2010.09-1088,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3630.871,3633.489,"Well, why isn't that a part of thing -- you have a new claim here."
2010.09-1088,2,29247,james_w_bilderback_ii,,3634.775,3651.885,"Because the exhaustion difficulty in this case, the exhaustion problem in this case, is a consequence of the errors that the Federal court made in doing the (d)(1) -- in failing to do the (d)(1) determination at all and in taking evidence in clear derogation of (e)(2)."
