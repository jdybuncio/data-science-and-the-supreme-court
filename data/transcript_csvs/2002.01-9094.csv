2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.91,"We'll hear argument next in Number 01-9094, Abu-Ali Abdur' Rahman versus Ricky Bell."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,91.022,91.765,Okay.
2002.01-9094,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.836,170.859,That's the district court judge?
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,170.859,171.231,--Right.
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,186.12,191.321,Couldn't he have moved to... in the Sixth Circuit... to remand the case if he disagreed with that?
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,191.321,192.397,--He did.
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,193.528,197.598,"Well, but that means that the district court's decision was not final."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,197.598,209.941,"Well, it was final for purposes of the 60(b), because the... for purposes of the district court's view there could be, would be, never could be any 60(b) relief."
2002.01-9094,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,209.941,217.537,"But it wasn't a final judgment in the sense that an appeal could be sought from that, because it was transferred."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,233.058,237.145,"Well, Your Honor, all of that's right, and if the belts don't work, let's go to the suspenders."
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,257.745,258.86,Page 1a of the blue brief?
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,258.86,279.915,"--1a of the blue brief, it's very clear under (b)(3)(A) that it has to be a second or successive application before the court of appeals has any jurisdiction to do anything with it, so its jurisdiction turns on the question whether it was a successive petition or not."
2002.01-9094,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,289.946,294.115,"Well, what... what does the statute, the AEDPA statute contemplate?"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,307.24,307.9,Yes.
2002.01-9094,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,307.9,309.841,That was not done?
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,309.841,317.931,"It was not done here because he was saying all along this was not a successive petition, if it was, he would not satisfy it."
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.469,319.789,Go ahead.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,319.789,327.014,"--He was saying that he did satisfy the requirements of 60(b), that the statute recognizes a difference between certain--"
2002.01-9094,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,327.014,343.982,"Well, then, to get an appeal on that... it sounds so complicated, because the law has gotten so complicated with AEDPA, but maybe he should have sought transfer back to the district court so the district court could dismiss it and give something from which an appeal could be taken."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,343.982,357.512,"--Oh but, Your Honor, in Martinez-Villareal, I think it's very clear this case is exactly the same as Martinez-Villareal, which this Court ruled expressly on the... the first question it took up was the jurisdictional question."
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,415.436,418.574,"Well, let's go back to (3)(A) for a minute, Mr. Liebman."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,444.292,445.406,Absolutely.
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,455.437,465.347,"Well, but... so then the first, the... the first clause of (3)(A) is not really, strictly speaking, entirely jurisdictional."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,465.347,468.152,"--Oh, well I... I'm not actually sure it's the first clause."
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,487.599,490.405,"Well, that's, of course, part of the issue in the case."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,490.405,499.654,"--Right, but that... his position was it was not, and therefore the court needed to dismiss that case, and it had two options at that point."
2002.01-9094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,509.064,517.859,"Mr. Liebman, initially in this case, when the district judge transferred... I think it got one on the State's recommendation that that's how you handle these cases."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,529.664,546.382,"That did not happen, Your Honor, although petitioner understood the court's decision, if you look on pages 41 and 42, to say this... it expressly says, you cannot file 60(b) here in this court because it's automatically successive."
2002.01-9094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,548.695,550.924,But he could have asked to test that.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,553.319,560.007,"He could have, but in... Your Honor, in the Martinez-Villareal case, there was no such question, no... no--"
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,560.007,561.865,--see what Martinez-Real has to do with it.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,590.805,591.055,"--Oh, yes--"
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,591.055,602.322,"That was a question about whether or not there was a premature decision, or whatever it was, and they sent... the court of appeals sent it back for adjudication on this issue."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,602.322,602.944,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,602.944,603.808,"No, it's... I'm not right?"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,603.808,614.582,"The provision (e) here says that the grant or denial of an authorization cannot come up to the Court on cert, so the fact that the court there in--"
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,614.582,620.981,"You mean, Martinez-Real was a grant of a petition for second or successive?"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,620.981,621.352,--No.
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,621.724,623.665,"Well, then, what has that statute to do with it?"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,623.665,628.328,--What it said was... and this is what the Court said in Martinez-Villareal quite clearly.
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,634.727,635.842,In Martinez-Real?
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,635.842,636.379,Yes.
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,641.664,644.059,And what did the court of appeals say was the answer?
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,644.059,645.878,"--It said, the answer is, this is not a second or successive petition."
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,645.878,648.19,"Fine, so then the statute doesn't apply, I guess--"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,648.19,656.075,"Oh... but here the court said... if I can be clear about this... the court said two things, and it said them actually in different orders."
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,671.474,681.627,--I... I just don't see how you get around the statute that says that you can't come here after a court of appeals either grants or denies the second or successive.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,681.627,682.165,"Well, that's what I'm--"
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,682.165,685.342,"Which wasn't at issue, I take it, in the other case."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,685.342,686.168,--That's what I'm trying to say.
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,696.366,701.567,"Yes, but you... one doesn't really ask for cert from... from a question."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,709.741,711.803,"This order had multiple parts, Your Honor."
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.081,743.056,"But I think the question is whether you can ask for cert for any... from any... part of it in view of the provision of the statute that it's not... I just don't... I'm not sure you can bifurcate the order and say, we're not challenging the denial, we're challenging, in effect, the reason for the denial."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,743.056,745.74,"Well, this was not a denial."
2002.01-9094,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,774.885,775.833,That's not a judgment.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,790.821,794.553,"--Well, Your Honor, then let me go to the garter if the belts and suspenders haven't worked here."
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,841.764,841.847,"All right, but--"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,841.847,843.416,"--which is, that was a mistake--"
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,843.416,847.215,"--on that... now, this will get to the merits, which I'm sure you'd like to get to--"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,847.215,847.603,--Yes.
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,847.603,889.113,"--but I thought that the argument that what the court of appeals did was right is roughly the following, that what your client should have done, or the way it should have worked is that the district court initially dismissed... dismissed on the ground that there was a procedural default... his initial parts of the initial petition, because, said the district court, he didn't exhaust those, and he can't do it now because the time is up, and your client never appealed that ruling in... the first time."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,932.87,945.501,"Your Honor, you're absolutely right, the premise, which is that Rule 60(b) or related motions in the court of appeals cannot be used to fill the office of an appeal, but there's a very established doctrine there."
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1059.329,1083.439,"Mr. Liebman, we've decided a couple of cases, one about 30 years ago, Harris against Nelson, and then another case called Pitchess, in maybe... that indicate that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and particularly 60(b), do not apply if they conflict at all with the habeas regulations."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1086.328,1086.821,"--Yes, we do."
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1087.276,1087.526,I'm sorry.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1087.864,1089.588,--We cite both of them on--
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1089.588,1091.817,--I didn't see them in the index.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1091.817,1098.299,"--Well, I believe that they are cited in our... well, I guess you're right."
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1115.489,1117.618,You didn't cite them in your opening brief.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1117.618,1118.732,We didn't.
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1169.093,1173.345,"Well, I thought the Second Circuit was the only case that really supported you--"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1173.345,1174.005,"Oh, no."
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1174.005,1179.745,--in this area as to whether a 60(b) rule can be used as a substitute.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1179.745,1180.283,"No, Your Honor."
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1209.428,1220.119,"How... how long after the district court ruled that your claims were not... not exhausted, how much time elapsed between then and the time you filed your Rule 60 motion?"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1220.119,1220.591,--We filed the Rule--
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1220.591,1222.143,"3-1/2 years, wasn't it?"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1222.143,1223.879,--But it was the key point--
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1223.879,1224.955,Just answer my question.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1224.955,1225.327,--Yes.
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1225.949,1226.199,It was 3-1/2 years?
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1226.199,1236.48,--I think 3-1/2 years is the right... but the reason is that the trigger for the 60(b) motion did not come down until June 2001.
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1236.48,1244.775,"That's true, but the... now I'm thinking, when I read the Sixth Circuit's opinion again, they're not really saying anything different."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1280.691,1281.267,Well--
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1281.267,1282.26,And you didn't appeal it.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1287.916,1289.652,"--Well, Your Honor, two points."
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1289.652,1292.085,So is there... is there really a minority rule at all?
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1292.085,1292.085,Well--
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1292.085,1297.741,"Is there some court that really meant it, that no matter what, 60(b) is always second or successive?"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1297.741,1304.428,"--That is the argument that the State made here, and it's what the district court said, and I can tell you the district court believed it, but it doesn't matter here."
2002.01-9094,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1332.458,1333.944,"Well, the law's new."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1334.854,1335.969,"--Well, but it isn't new, Your Honor."
2002.01-9094,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1340.965,1341.875,"Well, all right, I'll--"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1341.875,1357.767,"But it's like the Fiore case, Your Honor, where the Pennsylvania supreme court said yes, we came down with this interpretation of the State statute, and it's true the lower courts had all seen it differently up to that point, but we were telling you what the statute meant all the way back, and this Court treated it as, quote, old law."
2002.01-9094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1357.767,1379.687,"--But then you said you didn't need to put it in your... make a cross-appeal of it because you didn't think it was a tenable argument, so you can't... I don't... I don't see how you could have it both ways, to say it was the law all along, but we didn't have to say that that was the law because O'Sullivan--"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1379.687,1380.634,"Well, because--"
2002.01-9094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1380.634,1384.267,"--hadn't come down, or had just come down."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1384.267,1413.783,"--Well, Your Honor, what O'Sullivan says is, if there is a clear statement of law by State law, by rule or decision that says... as the South Carolina-Arizona provisions cited in this paragraph say... that this particular discretionary review procedure, quote, is not available, then the Supreme Court and the Federal courts will respect it, but otherwise, if we don't know what the law is, or it's not clear, then we don't need to respect it, so that was--"
2002.01-9094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1413.783,1431.904,"But the appellate... the appellate brief in this case, the brief in the Sixth Circuit, when the... when the prosecutor was appealing on the ineffective assistance of counsel, that was filed before O'Sullivan came down, wasn't it?"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1431.904,1436.158,"--The State's brief was filed before, petitioner's brief filed after."
2002.01-9094,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1436.158,1439.213,But the point at which you could have filed a cross-appeal was before.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1439.213,1441.525,"Oh, Your Honor, that's a very important point."
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1471.634,1473.066,I thought you didn't appeal.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1479.214,1479.836,"'99, actually."
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1479.836,1480.579,'99?
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1480.579,1480.579,Yes.
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1480.579,1480.951,All right.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1491.603,1492.225,"Well, all I would say--"
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1492.225,1493.255,Am I right about that?
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1493.255,1501.018,"--You're right, but they were in the certificate of probable cause, which is... you have to get that first, but of course the court of appeals doesn't reach your certificate of probable cause."
2002.01-9094,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1501.018,1503.164,"No, no, so I don't see how that helps you."

2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1545.518,1554.972,"Hasn't the Sixth Circuit had an opinion on that subject as to whether the rule promulgated by the Tennessee supreme court was a change, or was it not?"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1554.972,1556.292,"--No, it has not."
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1561.948,1561.948,But isn't the--
2002.01-9094,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1561.948,1569.916,"--The Sixth Circuit did... the Sixth Circuit had held before in a case arising out of Kentucky that if you don't go to the top court, you have not exhausted."
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1569.916,1574.663,They said that in Kentucky based upon a Kentucky supreme court decision in 1985.
2002.01-9094,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.663,1574.829,Right.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1574.829,1582.548,"After that point, there are five or six decisions of the Sixth Circuit saying that failure to exhaust that remedy is failure to exhaust."

2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1613.673,1615.697,The law did not change.

2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1651.984,1652.606,Absolutely.
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1665.692,1675.806,"But doesn't that foreclose you, because when you're... if it's not second and successive as defined by AEDPA, that means those are the only kind you can bring?"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1675.806,1676.549,"--No, Your Honor--"
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1676.549,1679.111,Not that you can pull something else in under Rule 60.
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1679.111,1679.687,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.01-9094,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1679.687,1680.143,No--

2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1687.406,1687.695,--Well--
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1687.695,1688.604,--it's got to be--
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.604,1690.75,--are you suggesting there was fraud here?
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1690.75,1711.078,"--No, no, no, I'm saying, Your Honor, that there are certain circumstances where something that is literally second in time does not qualify as a second or successive petition that triggers 2244, and so we need to know what that is, and the two standards are when it is within the four corners of the first petition and it completely undermines--"
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1711.078,1714.489,"Now, what's... what's the authority for that statement?"
2002.01-9094,0,31626,james_s_liebman,,1714.489,1736.425,"--The authority is Martinez-Villareal, Slack, and Calderon, and a huge body of lower court law that establishes those very, very narrow circumstances where it's so tied into the first petition because it's the same facts, and it so undermines that first judgment that there's no judgment left, that you need something to substitute for it, but you don't have a successive petition."
2002.01-9094,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.425,1739.109,"Thank you, Mr. Liebman."

2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.772,1805.139,Doesn't the jurisdictional issue really turn on whether it was a second or successive?
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,1805.139,1807.285,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
2002.01-9094,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1824.292,1837.09,But is it strictly in the province of the Sixth Circuit to determine that what it has before it is a request for something that should be called a second or successive petition within the meaning of the statute?
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,1841.837,1847.038,"Your Honor, our position is that you can't separate these two functions."
2002.01-9094,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1865.781,1868.753,"Well, it didn't do so in so many words."
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,1891.416,1892.614,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2002.01-9094,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1892.614,1894.1,"Well, it's one or the other."
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,1894.1,1894.471,Well--
2002.01-9094,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1894.943,1896.762,Is it text or policy?
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,1896.762,1897.96,"It's the first one, Your Honor."
2002.01-9094,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1897.96,1898.414,Okay.
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,1898.414,1910.387,"If you were to split those two decisions that the court of appeal has jurisdiction over, then there would be a proliferation of appeal of that first predicate decision."
2002.01-9094,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1911.668,1916.414,"Well, is it going to be... I mean, is it going to be a difficult question in most cases?"
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,1927.848,1935.65,"--Your Honor, I don't... I would not... I don't think this is, frankly, an extraordinary case to determine whether or not it was a second or successive."
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1944.649,1951.504,"Yes, you say that, but the relief sought in the 60(b) motion was not relief from the State court judgment."
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,1975.486,1976.6,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1980.687,1983.825,"Not of a claim, a first litigation of a claim."
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,1983.825,1993.651,"--They... they asked for... they asked for the relitigation of a prior final determination, which we... we submit and we... our position is that this was, in fact, a second--"
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1993.651,2000.627,Did they ask in the 60(b) motion for relief from the State court judgment which would be the relief requested in the habeas proceeding?
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2000.627,2002.196,--They asked... I'm sorry.
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2002.196,2009.216,"Did they ask for relief from the State court judgment in the 60(b) motion, or just from the habeas court judgment?"
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2009.216,2011.9,They asked for relief from the... from the habeas judgment in the... in the district court--
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2011.9,2021.271,"So then it was a 60(b) motion, because that's what 60(b) is directed at, where the second or successive petition would have asked for relief from the State court judgment."
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2021.271,2031.757,"--Well, they alleged that it was a 60(b) motion, but when the district court received the motion, the district court put substance over form and saw clearly that it was a second or successive--"
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2031.757,2052.562,"Well, you call it that, but supposing instead of the... the Tennessee rule, they had been able to demonstrate it... very improbable, just to give the hypothesis out... that a waiver of the claim for the prosecutorial misconduct had been executed and the waiver was false, that there was a fraud on the court in... in having that issue precluded from review."
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2055.245,2063.873,--It would be the inherent authority of the... of the district court to take care of a situation of fraud on the court.
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2063.873,2066.018,By granting a 60(b) motion?
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2066.018,2068.598,"Well, we don't think it would even have to be a 60(b) motion."
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2068.598,2072.213,"Well, wouldn't that be the office of a 60(b) motion, to correct that very fraud?"
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2072.213,2079.893,"Fraud on the court that would impugn the very integrity of the prior final adjudication would, in fact, be... be--"
2002.01-9094,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2079.893,2083.031,"Well, you go on a different section of Rule 60, wouldn't you--"
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2083.031,2083.32,--That's correct.
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2083.32,2083.94,--Yes.
2002.01-9094,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.94,2086.708,--the section of Rule 60 that specially deals with fraud.
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2086.708,2087.246,That's right.
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2087.246,2091.454,But in that situation a 60(b) motion would be permissible under that section?
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2091.454,2093.329,If there was a fraud on the court.
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2093.329,2093.684,Right.
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2093.684,2102.783,"But that... but the fraud on the court would undermine the complete efficacies of the proceedings, and that the final judgment wouldn't even be final, because it would be a sham."
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2102.783,2109.288,"Well, but you have to file a motion and have those facts developed in order to do it, and 60(b) is the avenue for doing that."
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2109.288,2115.232,"That... I mean, that could be a possible avenue, but that... but that would only go as to the fraud on the integrity--"
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2115.232,2126.378,"And here, the relief requested is precisely the same, namely that one claim was not heard which was in the case, for a reason that was... turned out to be a gross mistake of the law."
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2144.582,2144.954,--Well--
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2144.954,2151.064,Directed at the final judgment in the habeas proceeding as opposed to the final judgment in the State proceeding.
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2151.064,2162.787,"--Of... of course, Your Honor, that argument would fly in the face of the finality requirements of AEDPA, which only... which only gives us... which only gives us limited circumstances to relitigate--"
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2162.787,2164.273,"But that's true of my fraud case, too."
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2164.273,2173.644,"--Well, but in the fraud case, Your Honor, the fraud on the court means that the original judgment is a complete sham, is a complete sham, and there was no--"
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2173.644,2175.685,"And here it isn't a sham, it was just a mistake."
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2176.783,2180.581,"--Well, they want it both ways, if it please the Court."
2002.01-9094,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2192.841,2193.296,But that--
2002.01-9094,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2193.296,2196.889,--What is the right way to do it?
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2256.537,2257.613,When the--
2002.01-9094,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2257.613,2272.967,"In your opinion is there just... is there no way a person could say, judge, please read the supreme court and the Tennessee court, and you'll see that your ruling was wrong, and believe me, that's right, so what is he supposed to do?"
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2272.967,2283.098,--A prior final determination... a prior final determination by the district court as to the procedural default should be conclusive.
2002.01-9094,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.098,2285.144,"So you're saying he's just out of luck, nothing?"
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2285.144,2287.623,"Yes, sir, because... because--"
2002.01-9094,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2287.623,2289.564,It seems terribly unfair--
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2289.564,2302.4,"--Well, but we... yes, Your Honor, but under the provisions of AEDPA there are two circumstances where he could file a second or successive, which we say is what he has, in fact, done here."
2002.01-9094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2324.541,2324.541,--General Summers--
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2324.541,2326.027,--through the normal appellate process.
2002.01-9094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2326.027,2326.482,--General Summers--
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2326.482,2327.596,He did not in this case.
2002.01-9094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2327.596,2332.343,--You... are you... you're making the general point that's not peculiar to AEDPA?
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2340.766,2341.509,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-9094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2341.509,2362.109,"So if a district court rules incorrectly, and you didn't appeal that, and then there's a clarifying decision by some other court that really shows the district court was incorrect on the procedural default, you can't then say, ah, give me the relief under 60(b) that I could have gotten if I had taken a timely appeal."
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2362.109,2362.935,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.01-9094,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2363.118,2364.96,And that's wholly apart from AEDPA.
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2364.96,2366.446,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2440.09,2447.603,Is it conceivable that a district judge might erroneously in some case call something second or successive and it really wasn't?
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2450.121,2452.062,"--Well, human beings, it's certainly possible."
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2452.062,2455.117,"And if he does make a mistake, what's the remedy for it?"
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2455.117,2458.36,There could be a motion to transfer in the court of appeals.
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2465.603,2469.44,But what if instead... I gave you a fraud example... instead of that it was a mistake.
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2494.043,2495.341,"No, Your Honor."
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2503.886,2514.167,"Well, it... it undermines it in the sense that it denied the litigant a hearing on a claim asserted in the habeas proceeding, namely, the prosecutorial misconduct."
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2515.858,2525.024,"If he were... if it were something of the nature of... of denying him the opportunity to have a hearing, or if, in fact--"
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.024,2527.253,"That's exactly what it was here, too."
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2527.253,2528.162,"--Well, no, sir."
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.964,2537.04,He failed to exhaust.
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2537.04,2540.55,"--Failed to exhaust... improperly, that he--"
2002.01-9094,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2540.55,2541.005,And that ruling was wrong.
2002.01-9094,1,38376,paul_g_summers,,2541.005,2556.859,"--failed to show cause of prejudice, that there was no miscarriage of justice, and that he was conclusively entitled to no habeas relief in the district court, and that was a conclusive final determination, and if he had felt like the court was wrong, he should have filed an appeal in the Sixth Circuit."
