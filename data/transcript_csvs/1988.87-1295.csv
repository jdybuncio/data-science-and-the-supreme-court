1988.87-1295,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.418,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 87-1295, United States against Andrew Sokolow."
1988.87-1295,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,10.699,13.921,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,84.787,86.317,I didn't understand that.
1988.87-1295,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,88.558,89.749,--Yes.
1988.87-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,94.713,96.836,And when they stopped him in Los Angeles you mean?
1988.87-1295,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,96.836,101.447,"Well, they stopped him in Los Angeles on the same day that they stopped him in Honolulu."
1988.87-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,101.447,107.411,How did they know... how did the police in Los Angeles know this man was coming back on this flight?
1988.87-1295,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,107.411,111.505,It's not clear from the record who first told them.
1988.87-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,122.532,122.862,The record doesn't--
1988.87-1295,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,122.862,125.877,--told them that Respondent may have been coming back on that day.
1988.87-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,141.335,151.342,"--Well, I suppose... how did they know... when did they find out that he was going to make the return flight... that he booked the flight on the 24th and came back on the 25th?"
1988.87-1295,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,151.342,152.764,Let me explain it this way.
1988.87-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,154.043,154.574,Right.
1988.87-1295,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,155.734,156.595,Open ticket.
1988.87-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,162.229,163.451,And how did they learn that?
1988.87-1295,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,163.451,164.85,That's not clear from the record.
1988.87-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,164.85,165.631,That's what I was trying to trace.
1988.87-1295,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,166.463,180.851,"At the time the Respondent was stopped, the agents also had reason to suspect that he was traveling under an alias because there was a discrepancy between the name that he gave to the airline and the name listed for the telephone number at which Respondent's voice was on an answering machine."
1988.87-1295,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,209.189,211.49,Can I ask you another question?
1988.87-1295,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,215.554,222.289,I think it certainly helps because it cuts down on the time necessary for someone to go through the process.
1988.87-1295,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,267.107,272.32,"Well, along the same lines, how many of these items do you need?"
1988.87-1295,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,272.32,276.862,Only three.
1988.87-1295,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,276.862,278.345,What three?
1988.87-1295,0,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,278.345,290.583,"The cash purchase of airline tickets, the 12,000 mile trip and the 20 hours in the air for only a two day stay at the destination, and the fact that the destination was Miami."
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1307.375,1315.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1295,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1394.023,1396.805,"Of course, that could conceivably be innocent."
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1398.115,1399.476,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1988.87-1295,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1399.476,1404.889,"So, it really isn't any big difference in kind between the Ninth Circuit's two factors."
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1407.32,1408.862,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1988.87-1295,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1496.609,1519.345,"Well, Mr. Goldberg, didn't the Court recognized in the Terry case that a collection of possibly innocent actions when viewed in their totality can, can amount to reasonable suspicion to justify a detention, I don't think the Court has ever said that any of the factors couldn't be innocent acts."
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1519.345,1521.217,I... I do not disagree with Your Honor.
1988.87-1295,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1644.78,1645.668,Excuse me.
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1654.184,1657.229,"It was in the name of Mr. Herman, Karl Herman."
1988.87-1295,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1657.229,1660.068,Didn't it appear to them at that time that he was using an alias?
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1660.068,1665.303,"When they called the telephone number, they recognized the voice--"
1988.87-1295,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1665.303,1666.292,That's right.
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1666.292,1666.742,--of the traveler.
1988.87-1295,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1666.742,1672.917,And that voice is coming from a phone number that is listed in the name... in a name different from the name that he gave to the travel agent.
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1672.917,1673.718,That is correct.
1988.87-1295,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.718,1680.962,"Now, they may have been wrong about whether he was using an alias, but it certainly seemed that he was using an alias, wouldn't you say?"
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1680.962,1685.116,"I would... knowing Hawaii and Honolulu, I would suggest no."
1988.87-1295,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1696.032,1698.616,"Sure, there are a lot of possibilities and for all of these things."
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1709.973,1720.689,"I understand that, but I would suggest that in this case, as Agent McCarthy testified, it's not unusual for a telephone to be in one of a number of roommates' names."
1988.87-1295,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1747.037,1754.021,"Because if... if they had done that, they would have only gotten the rest of the $4,000 that he had in his pocket which it's not illegal to carry."
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1764.158,1764.637,Well--
1988.87-1295,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.637,1773.893,"Why should... why should they arrest him before he's committed the crime that they suspect him of, of, of engaging in?"
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1773.893,1782.279,"--I, I believe if they... what remained of the $4,000 was approximately $1,900, which is not a very large amount of money to buy narcotics."
1988.87-1295,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1792.958,1793.897,He wasn't necessarily buying it.
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1797.47,1813.832,"In, in hindsight, it is possible to come up with... to verify the hunch or suspicion or whatever it was that made this... made these individuals choose to stop Mr. Sokolow."
1988.87-1295,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.589,1904.46,Fear of what?
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1921.702,1931.769,I think the fear or the paranoia that goes around... I don't think we have to... I don't think we should have to walk around thinking of the government intruding on our lives.
1988.87-1295,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.769,1936.8,"I don't mind a dog smelling my luggage at, at all if I'm not carrying drugs in it."
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,1939.973,1949.63,"I believe if... if Your Honor, I'm sure if Your Honor was stopped in an airport that it would upset you."
1988.87-1295,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2024.752,2027.854,Did you try this case?
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2027.854,2029.184,"Yes, I did, Your Honor."
1988.87-1295,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2031.077,2034.527,Didn't you make all of these arguments to the jury that you are now making?
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2034.527,2039.462,"--Your Honor, we made a conditional plea at the end of the suppression motion."
1988.87-1295,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2039.462,2041.042,"Oh, that's right."
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2044.495,2045.597,"Yes, I did, Your Honor."
1988.87-1295,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2082.872,2087.296,"Well, the case is here before us just on the curbside stop, is it not?"
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2087.296,2089.319,--It's here only in the case--
1988.87-1295,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2089.319,2097.865,"So, we, we, we really don't get to the subsequent questioning and, and, and search of the luggage in the customs area."
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2097.865,2113.374,"--That is correct, Your Honor, but similar to, I believe, the Royer case where... I think it was Royer... where they did... where this court chose to determine that when he was held in a small room... in this case Sokolow was also taken to a small room."
1988.87-1295,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2116.828,2117.906,But that's later.
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2121.069,2122.23,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1988.87-1295,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2122.23,2130.445,"And the facts for the... supporting the initial detention, which we are examining, are virtually identical to Royer, aren't they?"
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2130.445,2131.905,"Virtually identical, but even--"
1988.87-1295,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2131.905,2134.657,"So, why should... why should the Ninth Circuit reach a different result?"
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2134.657,2145.496,"--I believe the Ninth Circuit did reach the same result because in the... you see, in this case you had an absolute, definite seizure at curbside."
1988.87-1295,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2145.496,2152.479,I thought the court found in Royer that there was sufficient cause for the initial detention.
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2154.061,2156.632,"The court was divided, Your Honor, on that."
1988.87-1295,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2194.407,2194.828,That's right.
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2207.116,2207.797,--That is correct.
1988.87-1295,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2219.624,2227.248,"Well, they certainly had reason to believe he was using an alias at the time of the detention, as you just explored with Justice Scalla."
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2227.248,2231.452,--When he con... when they called and heard his name on the telephone machine.
1988.87-1295,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2246.302,2257.419,"But, you see, the Ninth Circuit had two categories, criminal characteristics that are apparently general characteristics, and indications of ongoing criminal activity."
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2281.587,2302.709,"I believe that's what in my viewing the Ninth Circuit's opinion, they did state that things such as going to a source city, which in this case was dated San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Miami, et cetera, was something that a large group of innocent travelers do on a daily basis."
1988.87-1295,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2375.771,2388.41,"Mr. Goldberg, do you know why we had two separate opinions in the Ninth Circuit by different justices, not concurring but successively different opinions?"
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2388.41,2392.571,This is... regarding to Judge--
1988.87-1295,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2392.571,2397.604,"Well, the first one was by Judge Norris, as I recall, and the second one was by Judge Ferguson."
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2397.604,2398.896,--I believe--
1988.87-1295,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2398.896,2405.251,"The second prompted by the rehearing petition en banc which was not granted, but--"
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2405.251,2426.144,"--If I... if I had to state yes, it was the initial opinion, Judge Norris was so upset at the fact that... and it was clear to him that the reason Mr. Sokolow drew attention was because he chose to dress in a certain manner."
1988.87-1295,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2478.449,2482.791,"--Well, maybe Justice Kennedy can help me out."
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2482.791,2483.732,Possibly.
1988.87-1295,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2552.037,2555.099,"I don't think that question is before the court, Mr. Goldberg."
1988.87-1295,1,39344,robert_p_goldberg,,2555.099,2558.212,"Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-1295,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2667.823,2672.866,"Mr. Larkin, you have seven minutes remaining."
1988.87-1295,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2672.866,2679.161,"Unless the members of the Court have any further questions, I have nothing further."
1988.87-1295,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.161,2681.372,I have just one that your opponent prompted.
1988.87-1295,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2693.66,2695.562,"It varies, Your Honor."
1988.87-1295,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2699.593,2704.245,"For example, I suppose you'd say the same thing about Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Key West and all of those?"
1988.87-1295,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2704.245,2714.593,"Well, no, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach are close to Miami, and the DEA has informed me, therefore, that people will fly into and out of the different airports there."
1988.87-1295,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.593,2716.916,"So, they're also source cities?"
1988.87-1295,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2716.916,2724.06,"They would be considered that simply because when we're talking about Miami, we're not saying that it's just the geographic confines of the city."
1988.87-1295,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.152,2761.546,"So, does that include San Diego, perhaps Houston, then, if they're coming in from Mexico, too."
1988.87-1295,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2765.407,2773.414,Any city is potentially eligible because factors of geography and tradition may make it an attractive port for smugglers.
1988.87-1295,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2788.153,2789.633,"Not Peoria, surely."
1988.87-1295,2,38091,paul_j_larkin_jr,,2789.633,2790.384,No.
1988.87-1295,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2800.001,2803.224,"Thank you, Mr. Larkin."
