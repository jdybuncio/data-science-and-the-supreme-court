2018.17-1307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.04,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1307, Obduskey versus McCarthy & Holthus. Mr. Geyser."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,8.04,19.76,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Non-judicial foreclosures are covered under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act as a direct or indirect attempt to collect a consumer's debt."
2018.17-1307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,87.48,105.48,"I think you have a -- you have a pretty good argument if we look just at 15 U.S.C. 1692a(6), which talks about regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due to another."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,180.92,184.8,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I think these provisions actually reinforce our reading of the Act."
2018.17-1307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,187.72,187.92,Right.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,187.92,191.16,And then it proceeded and it expanded that definition.
2018.17-1307,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,207.68,208.12,But it's --
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,208.12,209.04,-- collecting a debt.
2018.17-1307,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,209.04,215.48,-- it's only expanding it for purposes of 1692f(6).
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,215.48,218.2,"Well, exactly, Your Honor, but -- but our point is that it --"
2018.17-1307,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,218.2,223.72,"That's the -- that means that it's something less than that, other than 1692f(6)."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,227.24,243.12,"We -- we fully agree. Our point is that for someone who's enforcing a security interest but not also directly or indirectly collecting a debt, those people are only subject to that one subsection. And it's very clear what Congress had in mind, precisely because of 1692f(6)."
2018.17-1307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,260.76,274.24,"Yeah, but somebody who's engaging in a non-judicial foreclosure is enforcing a security interest, and if they didn't -- so they appear to fall within that provision."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,287.48,298.16,"I think if Congress wanted to exclude someone who's both enforcing a security interest and collecting a debt, it would have used one of the exclusions that follow the definition in 1692a(6)."
2018.17-1307,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,394.08,411.08,"Mr. Geyser, can -- I -- I may be missing something here, so I -- I'd appreciate your help. As I understand it, you -- you think that first sentence in a(6) is the main one and captures most debt collectors, but, for some reason, it doesn't capture the -- the repo man who in the dead of night goes and just grabs my car."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,414.52,415.12,That -- that's right.
2018.17-1307,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,415.12,415.24,All right.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,448.72,448.88,Sure.
2018.17-1307,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,492.8,497.32,"Many elegant words there, but what do we do about the word ""threatening""? That was my question."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,497.32,497.88,Yeah.
2018.17-1307,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,508.32,513.48,"Well, threaten to take a non-judicial action to -- with respect to a security interest."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,514.68,514.92,"Well, it --"
2018.17-1307,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,514.92,516.4,So -- so help me out with that language.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,519.12,519.28,Sure.
2018.17-1307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,550.24,552.4,"That's the point. That's the point, I think."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,584.52,592.72,"Well, again, Your Honor, it put in f(6) to reach the group of people who are not also full-fledged debt collectors, who are not also obtaining a transfer of debt."
2018.17-1307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,592.72,593.6,"Well, it doesn't say that."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,605.72,606.4,Absolutely.
2018.17-1307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,607.04,607.32,Right.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,616.8,618.24,"Well, absolutely not, Your Honor."
2018.17-1307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,618.24,618.36,No?
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,618.36,620.56,Because you can have someone who does both.
2018.17-1307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,627.84,628.16,Yeah.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,628.16,633.08,"-- they actually go to the consumer and they say: You know what, I'm going to give you three hours to pay the debt."
2018.17-1307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,633.08,635.88,And why isn't the repo man like that in part 1?
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,635.88,637.16,He is.
2018.17-1307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,639.12,641.04,Then who is in part 2 but not in part 1?
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,641.04,644.16,The people in part 2 are the -- it's sort of like a Venn diagram.
2018.17-1307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,651.12,653.04,Isn't the repo man doing that?
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,653.04,654.08,Exactly.
2018.17-1307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,674.44,674.6,Okay.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,692.2,693.84,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2018.17-1307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,693.84,694.84,No? Because?
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,694.84,694.96,Well --
2018.17-1307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,694.96,698.64,"I mean, the reason I thought it would be illegal is because it says you can't communicate with a third person."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,713.16,726.08,"Your Honor, out of -- out of all the eight amicus briefs, and incredibly able counsel for Respondent and the government, they could cobble together, at best, three or maybe four possible conflicts. And when you actually dig into the weeds of those conflicts, they're not conflicts at all."
2018.17-1307,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,733.32,735.48,You don't have to walk through them if you don't want to.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,737.24,737.52,Sure.
2018.17-1307,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,777.96,783.16,"Mr. Geyser, I -- I find this a difficult question."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,849.32,850.68,"Well, a few points, Your Honor."
2018.17-1307,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,899.72,907.0,"Your -- your point there, though, depends, right, on reading that language as referring to the repo guy, right?"
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,907.0,909.92,We have to -- we fully concede that we need to identify someone --
2018.17-1307,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,909.92,915.72,"But then, when you turn to f(6), is that really just limited to the repo situation?"
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,915.72,917.48,"Well, not necessarily, Your Honor."
2018.17-1307,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,922.0,936.76,"The point being the language of f(6) seems a lot broader than just the repo situation, so then, when you go back to a, it seems odd to think that that's just limited to the repo situation, if I understand the interaction of the two provisions correctly."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,936.76,943.84,"Well, again, the -- the additional definition will cover people in it who aren't just repossessing cars."
2018.17-1307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,962.44,988.4,"Well, let me ask you this about the repo situation: Suppose that the repo guy is out there getting into a car, and the owner of the car sees him out the window and runs out with a gun and says, what are you doing? And the repo guy says, well, you didn't pay, you're in default on your payments, so I'm taking your car. Is he a -- is he a debt collector because he's now told the -- the -- the car owner that -- about the debt?"
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,988.4,994.52,"In -- in that scenario, I don't think so because he's not leveraging the security interest."
2018.17-1307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1025.76,1040.56,So what is the difference between that situation and the non-judicial foreclosure situation where the -- the homeowner is simply notified that the -- the house that -- the mortgage is being foreclosed?
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1040.56,1043.12,"I -- I think -- I think there's a stark difference, Your Honor."
2018.17-1307,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1043.12,1043.92,What is the difference?
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1043.92,1053.4,"Well, the difference is that they're not just saying we're going to foreclose on your house no matter what you do. They're saying this is the amount you owe. This is the consequence if you don't pay it by this date."
2018.17-1307,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1095.64,1099.32,I have another question about your repo man example.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1115.92,1122.2,"Well, first, I don't think that's the most natural reading of it because you're focusing specifically on what each person in the process is doing."
2018.17-1307,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1127.4,1131.92,"The principal purpose of his business, using interstate commerce to collect a debt."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1131.92,1132.56,"Well, it -- it's --"
2018.17-1307,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1132.56,1134.8,Whatever -- whatever the first sentence says.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1134.8,1145.84,"The -- the principal purpose is to enforce a security interest. When -- when the repo man is done and he delivers the car to the creditor's lot, he has not obtained payment on the debt. And that's even under Respondent's definition."
2018.17-1307,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1146.24,1151.0,Why -- why don't you lose then? Why isn't that just conceding away the case?
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1151.0,1151.36,Well --
2018.17-1307,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1151.36,1158.88,"If the repo man is not collecting a debt, he's just executing a security interest, why is that really problematic for you, Mr. Geyser?"
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1158.88,1168.16,"No, no, no, Your Honor. That -- that -- that proves that the additional definition that -- for the -- fits the repo man, the repo man does not fall within the main definition."
2018.17-1307,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1175.76,1177.32,I'm just talking about the repo man.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1188.36,1193.2,"Well, their -- their conduct is completely different, which is also why they don't fall within the first sentence of a."
2018.17-1307,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1198.96,1200.92,But the result of that is to liquidate the debt.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1216.8,1228.68,"The -- it eventually might, Justice Kagan, but it doesn't when the repo man's job is over. And this is a really critical point. When the repo man brings the car back to the creditor, they have not yet sold the car."
2018.17-1307,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1231.0,1253.72,"It seems as though, when you get to the repo man, you're indulging in all these sort of hypertechnical distinctions, the same kind that you criticize Mr. Shanmugam for indulging in when it comes to non-judicial foreclosures. I mean, if you're going to get non-technical about it, you should carry through the non-technical, and then the repo man is in the same position as the non-judicial foreclosure person."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1253.72,1255.48,"Well, I -- I don't think so, Your Honor."
2018.17-1307,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1287.96,1291.28,f(6) also describes non-judicial foreclosures.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1291.28,1294.44,"It -- well, it is enforcing a security interest."
2018.17-1307,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1295.6,1296.0,Right?
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1296.0,1297.92,But -- but it --
2018.17-1307,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1297.92,1302.16,"f(6) does describe, by its terms, non-judicial foreclosures?"
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1302.16,1312.56,"It -- as part of what a non-judicial foreclosure is, but it extends beyond that because, unlike the repo man, the foreclosure agent is -- is demanding payment. They're sending a notice."
2018.17-1307,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1318.16,1327.32,You're trying to explain why this third sentence is in there -- and I understand that -- and then drawing the distinction between repo and non-judicial foreclosures.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1344.68,1347.48,"Well, it is correct, but I -- I would draw a different inference from that."
2018.17-1307,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1347.48,1353.72,"And the something in between, though, it's hard to just read that in between language as repo and not non-judicial foreclosure."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1353.72,1357.04,"Not at all, Your Honor. I think that's exactly what Congress had in mind."
2018.17-1307,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1357.04,1358.32,That's the heart of it for me.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1358.32,1390.72,"Well, let -- let me try to convince you then, because I think what Congress did is -- the competing bill said either security enforcers weren't included at all or it said they're included for everything. So a repo man also has to -- even though they're not communicating with people normally, they have to state the correct amount of the debt and do everything else that the FDCPA requires. Now the compromise that Congress struck is they recognized some people will enforce security interests without also collecting debts, and so they subjected them to a single subsection that describes that activity. I think it's quite telling that f(6) does not talk about demanding payment."
2018.17-1307,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1431.88,1441.04,"Excuse me, I -- I've been having a huge problem with this entire case, not on your position, but I was going to ask this of your adversary."
2018.17-1307,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1494.12,1499.44,-- but I'm reading f and it seems clearly to support your position.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1510.16,1511.28,"Your Honor, I --"
2018.17-1307,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1511.28,1514.72,I don't even know what the repo argument was about in your brief.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1514.72,1517.4,"Well, the repo argument in our brief -- and, Your Honor, just to be --"
2018.17-1307,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1517.4,1523.96,"It's adding -- it's also including -- if there was ever any doubt, it's also including those people."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1523.96,1530.4,"It -- it is, Your Honor, but just to be candid, though, it is also including them only for the one subsection of 1692."
2018.17-1307,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1530.4,1536.0,But the one subsection seems to say any of these people can't do unfair practices.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1536.0,1536.8,Exactly.
2018.17-1307,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1544.68,1545.04,That -- that --
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1545.04,1546.68,-- or indirectly collecting debts.
2018.17-1307,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1546.68,1552.0,"-- that's fine, but what -- what's really -- what's really at issue is the unfair practices."
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1572.44,1575.92,"I -- I think that's correct, Your Honor. And if I could reserve the balance of my time."
2018.17-1307,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1575.92,1578.08,I -- I -- I -- so tell me the counter.
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1578.08,1578.48,Sure.
2018.17-1307,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1578.48,1588.32,Why -- why are they arguing that other unfair practices are not actionable when that sentence says it is to my mind?
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1588.32,1588.4,Yeah.
2018.17-1307,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1588.8,1589.96,What am I missing there?
2018.17-1307,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1589.96,1592.44,"Well, yeah, I -- I don't think you're -- you're missing anything."
2018.17-1307,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1611.4,1617.96,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shanmugam."
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1617.96,1635.28,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a law firm sends a notice to a state official initiating the state's non-judicial foreclosure process, and when the law firm is seeking only to enforce its client's security interests, it does not engage in debt collection within the meaning of --"
2018.17-1307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1635.28,1635.76,I'm sorry.
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1649.32,1651.6,"With respect, Justice Sotomayor, if you take a look --"
2018.17-1307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1651.6,1652.6,Or to the creditor -- to the --
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1652.6,1670.12,"-- if you take -- take a look at the complaint in this case -- and, after all, this case is before the court on a motion to dismiss, the sole document that could constitute the impermissible act of debt collection is the notice of election and demand, the notice that is found in the Joint Appendix at pages 39 to 41."
2018.17-1307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1724.04,1740.52,"Well, but in most cases -- well, maybe I'm wrong, I'm just assuming in most cases that if you start the foreclosure process, and the debtor comes in and says, okay, I see you're serious about this, and, you know, either rearranges the financing or pays the debt, that's the purpose, right?"
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1740.52,1740.84,Well --
2018.17-1307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1740.84,1743.12,Banks don't want to own houses.
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1748.56,1760.8,"From the perspective of a creditor, Mr. Chief Justice, it is certainly true, and it also happens to accord with common sense that the creditor would like to be made whole. There are, of course, two means by which a creditor can be made whole."
2018.17-1307,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1798.68,1800.16,"Well, I don't really understand that, Mr. Shanmugam."
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1815.68,1841.08,"Well, let me pick up on that formulation, Justice Kagan. I think it would be a different case if what was going on was that a creditor was using the threat of foreclosure to exact payment. In other words, if a creditor came in and said, if you don't pay your overdue payment by Friday, I'm going to initiate non-judicial foreclosure. And I -- I say that because I want to underscore that we're not looking for some sort of categorical exclusion."
2018.17-1307,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1842.68,1851.48,"Well, whether you say that or not explicitly, isn't that how everybody understands a foreclosure notice? They're going to foreclose on my house unless I come up with my -- some money."
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1851.48,1858.16,I think that everyone would certainly understand that that is the consequence of a foreclosure proceeding.
2018.17-1307,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1875.48,1887.8,"Well, that's true, but it's inherently communicating a message that you need to repay the debt or you're going to lose the house, as Justice Kagan says. You -- you referred earlier to common sense."
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1893.76,1897.2,"Well, I don't think that that's true, and let me offer a sort of slightly modified --"
2018.17-1307,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1897.2,1897.68,Why not? Why not?
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1897.68,1897.84,Well --
2018.17-1307,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1897.84,1909.48,"Even if the express words aren't there, everyone who gets something like that, who has the money, and wants to, will understand this is a -- this is a letter seeking to get you to repay."
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1909.48,1921.32,"I think the common sense is that anyone who receives that letter would certainly have the incentive to pay if they could, because, of course, no one wants to lose their house. Again, I think my submission is a more modest one."
2018.17-1307,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1954.72,1955.36,Exactly.
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1959.88,1963.84,The animating purpose is to initiate the non-judicial foreclosure process.
2018.17-1307,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1966.52,1969.92,"Is it an either/or really? I mean, it can't be a both/and?"
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1969.92,1976.44,"Well, I think that leads me to the point about the limited purpose definition, which you picked up on earlier in your colloquy with Mr. Geyser."
2018.17-1307,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1988.08,1988.48,But what do you --
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1988.48,2007.32,"And we know that not just because of the language of the limited purpose definition but because Congress really struggled with the question of whether to bring in entities whose principal purpose was the enforcement of security interests for all purposes, whether to exclude them entirely, or instead to bring them in only for purposes of a single provision --"
2018.17-1307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2007.32,2008.0,"Well, but you have --"
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2008.0,2009.76,-- which wouldn't have made sense.
2018.17-1307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2009.76,2012.36,"You do have the word ""indirectly"" in the first part."
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2021.76,2024.36,"Well, I think that that makes it somewhat harder for me."
2018.17-1307,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2083.76,2084.04,But you're --
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2084.04,2085.32,-- that body of law.
2018.17-1307,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2085.32,2092.2,"You are arguing, I think, that even if I disagree with you, we disagree with you on the first sentence, you win because of the third sentence, right?"
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2092.2,2094.2,"Yes, that is correct. I think all -- I think I need --"
2018.17-1307,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2094.2,2110.08,"And on the third sentence, I guess the -- the responsive argument is that's an odd way for Congress to have excluded those who enforce security interests from the broad definition of debt collectors and the repo example you heard."
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2111.16,2111.64,Sure.
2018.17-1307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2160.48,2163.84,"Well, but that's not the most natural reading."
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2203.2,2206.32,"Congress never asked me how to write statutes, Mr. Chief Justice. (Laughter.)"
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2206.32,2219.6,But I think what I would say in response to that is the fact that it's additive helps us because it reinforces the sense that Congress thought that the collection of debts was distinct from the enforcement of security interests.
2018.17-1307,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2219.6,2224.44,But -- but now you're -- you're counting on your argument about sentence one again.
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2244.04,2253.8,"So I think, first, I would say that -- I don't think that you could say that debt collection is unambiguously so expansive as to cover this situation."
2018.17-1307,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2253.8,2256.4,"Well, I guess I want to make you assume that."
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2256.4,2266.8,"But if you think -- but if you do presume that for purposes of this question, I think what I would say is that Congress still viewed enforcement of security interests as distinct."
2018.17-1307,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2379.2,2399.0,"On the third sentence, I think what you're saying, but tell me if I'm wrong, is that even if we disagree with you on the first sentence, a necessary premise of the third sentence is that Congress, notwithstanding the broad language of the first sentence, must have thought that enforcement of security interests should be distinct from debt collection?"
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2399.0,2466.68,"I think that's right. And let me point to one more textual cue that hopefully will be helpful to the Court in that regard. When the -- when Congress is talking about this issue in 1692a(6), it's talking about it in terms of the definition of ""debt collector."" And as we explain in our brief, in order to be liable under the provision at issue here and really most of the provisions in the Act, you have to both be a debt collector and engaged in debt collection. And I think, in this definition of ""debt collector,"" Congress sets up a contradistinction between, on the one hand, an entity whose principal purpose, and it has to be the principal purpose, is the collection of debts, and an entity whose principal purpose, again, the principal purpose, is the enforcement of security interests. And, again, that's another textual cue that suggests that this is an either/or proposition, that Congress thought -- again, whatever the meaning of ""debt collection"" in the abstract -- that these were distinct concepts. After all, if you take a look at the earlier bills, which we quote, I think, at page 25 of our brief, Congress uses that distinction throughout all of these bills."
2018.17-1307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2627.16,2646.72,It is a bit strange to think that Congress intended to cover judicial foreclosures where a judge is supervising the process but not when it's a non-judge supervised process.
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2649.36,2650.08,"Well, I think that --"
2018.17-1307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2650.08,2664.88,"-- more damage, I think, can be done in a non-judicial foreclosure because there is no judge there to protect or review what's occurring."
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2666.6,2667.4,"Well, I --"
2018.17-1307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2667.4,2676.0,You seem to argue that because Congress knew that non-judicial foreclosures were set forth in very particular ways.
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2678.52,2705.96,"I think, Justice Sotomayor, that what I would say about that is that it wasn't so much that Congress was seeking to cover judicial foreclosures as that it was seeking to cover situations in which you're seeking payment. And a judicial foreclosure, as you will be well aware, is more like a typical lawsuit where a party is effectively bringing an in personam action, as is ordinarily the case or at least often the case, against the debtor and, in the context of that, seeking payment."
2018.17-1307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2707.2,2710.6,"Well, that -- that's the problem with non-judicial foreclosure."
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2718.88,2721.6,And I certainly am not here to dispute that reality.
2018.17-1307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2732.36,2734.52,So do foreclosure actions.
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2734.52,2754.32,"Well, that is -- that is correct, but I -- I do think that non-judicial foreclosures -- and -- and Colorado's scheme is distinct in some ways but characteristic in others -- do require notice to be provided to debtors. They do often provide at least some judicial mechanism for, for instance, a determination of whether or not a party is in default or a review after a sale."
2018.17-1307,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2756.72,2760.68,It doesn't help you review after sales if you've lost your home.
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2760.68,2767.56,"Well, but there is the ability actually to unwind the sale where there is -- there is fraud or misrepresentations or other misconduct."
2018.17-1307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2833.76,2834.16,Thank you.
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2834.16,2834.92,And so --
2018.17-1307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2834.92,2835.8,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.17-1307,1,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,2835.8,2847.44,-- we would ask that the judgment be affirmed.
2018.17-1307,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2847.44,2848.76,Mr. Bond.
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2848.76,2884.28,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the FDCPA, Congress made a considered compromise judgment between security interest enforcers as debt collectors for a single subsection of the Act, and not for the remainder, including the provisions at issue here. Petitioner's contrary position would nullify that congressional judgment by extending all of the Act's provisions to all security interest enforcers, and his answer to that is this increasingly narrowed category that seems reverse-engineered to pick up only a subset of repossession agents, which he says saves the provision from superfluity."
2018.17-1307,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2936.32,2936.84,Not really.
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2939.36,2948.4,"So the language undoubtedly could be clearer, but what's -- I think what comes from the text is that Congress referred to enforcement of security interests as a distinct concept."
2018.17-1307,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2948.4,2958.2,"But just so I understand the nature of your argument, I mean, you could be saying, look, foreclosure proceedings don't fall within the general purpose definition."
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2970.48,2975.28,So I think the argument that we're making is that Congress chose to treat these two things separately.
2018.17-1307,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2975.28,2977.0,"No, but you're not answering my question."
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2986.6,2991.24,I think that's a -- it's a very difficult question because you wouldn't have text that speaks directly to it.
2018.17-1307,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3010.4,3019.84,"It -- it -- it didn't use that language, though, and it -- it seems significant language on the first step of Justice Kagan's question. It said indirectly."
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3032.08,3045.2,So I think fore -- indirect debt collection would encompass things like publishing notice that's not directed to the debtor but intended to shame the debtor into paying or trying to garnish his wages informally by going to the employer. There are other things in that category.
2018.17-1307,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3083.6,3090.08,"I'm sorry, he -- he doesn't, because he says the creditor doesn't care -- the repo man doesn't care about the debt."
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3106.84,3108.76,I think it --
2018.17-1307,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3108.76,3110.6,And so I'm not sure how you're right.
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3130.88,3132.6,So we agree on the last point.
2018.17-1307,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3192.44,3208.8,"Can I ask you one question on what you mean? Imagine we have a person just like this one, he's trying to enforce a securities interest and he doesn't ask for any deficiency payment. All right."
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3250.4,3252.16,So I think --
2018.17-1307,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3252.16,3256.68,So he -- there -- there is a state law for -- I guess here requiring you to go to newspapers.
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3270.64,3276.4,"So, in that circumstance, if you're going beyond the procedures set forth in state law to enforce a security interest --"
2018.17-1307,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3276.4,3276.64,Yes.
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3276.64,3279.12,-- then you're not within this part 2 definition.
2018.17-1307,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3280.08,3316.12,"Well, that's the part that puzzles me, because -- exactly what I thought you would say, and can I -- can you explain it a little, because, if you're outside of the main thing, part 1, and only covered by f(6), because you did certain things, I want the house, and I'm not saying anything about deficiency, just what happened here, if you're outside it for the instance where you get a conflict with state law, why wouldn't you be outside it for the instance where you don't get a conflict with state law?"
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3316.12,3318.84,So it's not about what state law requires for its own sake.
2018.17-1307,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3330.84,3342.24,"No, in other words, you're saying if the state were exactly the same, but it just didn't say anything about newspapers, then his client would win?"
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3342.24,3344.36,So I think that does present a trickier question where --
2018.17-1307,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3344.36,3344.64,Why?
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3344.64,3345.52,-- where the state law doesn't --
2018.17-1307,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3345.52,3346.28,"If they're out, they're out."
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3349.96,3375.88,"Because, if the state law prescribes the procedure that you're going through, it's relatively easy for courts to determine that what you are doing is enforcing a security interest. If you're doing something that state law doesn't require, then you have the more difficult question of, under the general definition, the first part 1 definition, does this conduct constitute debt collection? So, if you engage in repossession or any other enforcement of a security interest, but you also send a demand letter, that demand letter is --"
2018.17-1307,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3375.88,3377.16,What -- what -- what --
2018.17-1307,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3377.16,3379.96,Can I see if I under -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-1307,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3379.96,3380.56,Go ahead.
2018.17-1307,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3380.56,3382.64,I just want to make sure I understand the answer.
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3403.8,3405.68,So there are two separate things here.
2018.17-1307,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3409.48,3409.96,Right.
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3413.84,3414.0,Yes.
2018.17-1307,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3415.12,3423.52,Is your answer that we determine that by reference to state law and what is mandated in order to collect on a security interest or to enforce a security interest?
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3423.52,3433.96,"We -- we determine whether what you're doing is security interest enforcement by looking at state law, that's right, to determine whether your steps, the actions you've taken, are the things that are set forth in state law."
2018.17-1307,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3433.96,3434.2,All right.
2018.17-1307,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3436.4,3446.08,"No, so if state law, if a state's non-judicial foreclosure process also allows the creditor to get a deficiency judgment, what in your view follows from that?"
2018.17-1307,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3446.08,3447.92,So I think you look to what the creditor does.
2018.17-1307,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3462.24,3464.88,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Geyser."
2018.17-1307,3,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3464.88,3471.56,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to start with 1692i because we heard very little about it from the other side."
2018.17-1307,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3629.92,3644.92,"I'm assuming that to the extent judicial foreclosures have been viewed as debt collection, that whatever conflicts have worked out there have also been -- that have happened there have also been worked out?"
2018.17-1307,3,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3644.92,3649.32,"Oh, absolutely, which is why that it's -- it's very easy to accommodate these interests."
2018.17-1307,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3662.48,3663.44,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.17-1307,3,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3663.44,3663.72,Thank you.
2018.17-1307,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3663.72,0.0,The case is submitted.
