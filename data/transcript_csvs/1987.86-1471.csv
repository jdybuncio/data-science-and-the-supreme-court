1987.86-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.607,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 86-1471, Richard Lyng v. International Union."
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,11.216,14.59,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1471,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,69.256,73.034,"What is the purpose of that exception do you think, Mr. Robbins?"
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,73.034,85.591,"I think, Justice Blackmun, that Congress sought to strike what I would call a balance of competing interests."
1987.86-1471,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,112.644,127.746,"Mr. Robbins, is there any evidence in the legislative history that one of the purposes was to somehow effect or establish national labor policy in any way?"
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,138.945,155.908,"I think, Justice O'Connor, Congress sought to promote three objectives, and it articulated those objectives in the accompanying Senate report, I believe it's 97-35, that accompanied the legislation in 1931."
1987.86-1471,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,462.689,463.346,Excuse me.
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,469.514,487.008,"--I think what I certainly intended to say, Justice Marshall, is that Congress could rationally have decided that a person with a job to go back to when he chooses to is better off than someone who has no job prospects at all."
1987.86-1471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,496.347,497.956,What about the voluntary quitter?
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,497.956,513.544,"Well, Justice White, the voluntary quitter is treated differently under the Statute in certain respects but Congress could rationally have decided that that distinction was warranted."
1987.86-1471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,513.544,518.963,"He's off the food stamps what, for ninety days?"
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,518.963,520.431,That's correct.
1987.86-1471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.431,524.821,And the striker is off for as long as he's on strike?
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,524.821,527.368,"That is correct, Justice White."
1987.86-1471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,534.85,537.818,And isn't it also true of just the deadbeat who doesn't want to work at all?
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,537.818,541.051,"No, that is not equally true."
1987.86-1471,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,558.327,564.731,"How about the voluntary quitter, does he have to take a job, another job to stay on food stamps?"
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,564.731,566.481,"Well, yes he does."
1987.86-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.442,587.223,What about the quitter for cause?
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,597.953,600.201,"No, he's not, Justice Scalia."
1987.86-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.289,615.758,"Well, the strikers think they have cause."
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,615.758,623.631,"They do, and they also have a job to go back to and that we think makes all the difference in the world."
1987.86-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,623.631,629.895,"Well, so does the quitter for cause, or he had a job that he could have gone back."
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,633.126,635.048,"That's true, but he severed the relationship."
1987.86-1471,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,699.273,709.908,"Well, Mr. Robbins, I gather that when the household is disqualified, also the children in the household are disqualified, are they not?"
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,709.908,716.593,"When the household is ineligible, all members of that household by definition are ineligible."
1987.86-1471,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,716.593,716.921,Yes.
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,720.452,721.841,Of neutrality?
1987.86-1471,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,721.841,723.466,To disqualify the children?
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,723.466,748.549,"I think the answer to that, Justice Brennan, is that the Food Stamp Statute, like many other Federal statutes, is predicated on a household categorization, a household categorization that this Court recognized and accepted two terms ago in Lyng against Castillo."
1987.86-1471,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,778.444,781.802,That doesn't tell me how that serves the objective of neutrality.
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,781.802,784.925,"--I think, Justice Brennan--"
1987.86-1471,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,784.925,785.706,Under this Statute.
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,785.706,811.165,"--I think the answer is that Congress believed that by funding by replacing the household income given up by a striker which Congress thought to be given up voluntarily, it was withdrawing a subsidy that it thought impaired the free flow of labor negotiations."
1987.86-1471,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,851.899,857.599,Couldn't Congress have looked it square in the eye and made a proviso that this shall not apply to children?
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,857.599,860.895,"They could have, Justice Marshall."
1987.86-1471,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,864.894,866.676,"Well, they should have."
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,866.676,876.952,"Justice Marshall, I am unwilling as a policy matter to second guess a judgment that its quite clear Congress had before it."
1987.86-1471,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,880.623,883.466,Congress decided to deprive children of milk?
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,883.466,887.635,--I don't think that's what Congress meant to do at all.
1987.86-1471,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,899.303,900.678,Including children without milk.
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,900.678,902.692,Including children without milk.
1987.86-1471,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,931.462,936.789,So what you're saying is that it was a change in the political climate that brought about the '81 amendment?
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,936.789,944.583,"I would hesitate, Justice Blackmun, to assign any special factor to that decision."
1987.86-1471,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,949.814,952.0,But it never was passed over the years.
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,952.0,955.39,It was never passed by both Houses over the years.
1987.86-1471,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,979.661,984.909,"The practical consequence for the children is that the father has to leave home, isn't it?"
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,984.909,987.019,No.
1987.86-1471,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1015.117,1023.972,"Of course, the pro rata possibility could have been considered and was considered in other elements of the statute, wasn't it?"
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1023.972,1026.501,The possibility of?
1987.86-1471,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1026.501,1038.997,Of just reducing the food stamp allocation for the striker individually and preserving the food stamps for the children.
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1043.792,1044.48,That's correct.
1987.86-1471,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1117.686,1131.649,"Mr. Robbins, I think you argued earlier that one of the concerns is that the government would be subsidizing strikers, wasn't it, if they were not disqualified for food stamps."
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1131.649,1135.881,The concern was for additional governmental neutrality.
1987.86-1471,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1135.881,1136.272,Yes.
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1169.478,1184.973,"Well, I think, Justice Brennan, when the statute was finally passed, the empirical evidence was a little bit more equivocal than it was before the Congress when it refused to pass the statute many years earlier."
1987.86-1471,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1184.973,1188.596,"Well, it's not so many years."
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1193.782,1195.406,"That's correct, Justice Brennan."
1987.86-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.367,1257.694,Congress might also have thought that putting a pinky on the scale is no better than putting a thumb on the scale.
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1257.694,1259.364,That's correct.
1987.86-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1276.419,1285.386,"Mr. Robbins, you assert that the striker is in a different situation from others because he can go back to work."
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1300.055,1306.708,It depends on how it is and why it is that the struck employer does not operate.
1987.86-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.451,1327.356,"Including permanent replacement, because that's the other example that the appellees give."
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1327.356,1329.433,Including permanent replacements.
1987.86-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.656,1367.265,"What can he do then if he wants to get back on the rolls, what does he have to do, quit?"
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1367.265,1368.468,He can quit.
1987.86-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.468,1372.325,"Suppose he doesn't quit, he just presents himself for work?"
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1380.291,1387.977,"Well, under those circumstances obviously there isn't the option, under your hypothetical, of taking the job because it's not available right then."
1987.86-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.719,1406.062,And he continues to be disqualified even though he is no longer a striker?
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1406.062,1408.484,"Well, he's still a striker in a sense--"
1987.86-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1408.484,1409.03,"No, he doesn't."
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1412.092,1443.736,"--But by virtue of the decision he made earlier, the employer can no longer maintain the plant, and in that event, although he doesn't have the job available, certain other purposes that Congress was also seeking to promote are still applicable in that event, such as the decision not to become involved in an on-going labor dispute, the goal of neutrality and the goal of voluntary unemployment."
1987.86-1471,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1514.239,1519.955,"Mr. Robbins, they tried to get this amendment through in 1977, did they not?"
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1519.955,1520.908,"That's correct, Justice Brennan."
1987.86-1471,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1520.908,1522.345,"And they failed, didn't they?"
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1522.345,1523.11,They did fail.
1987.86-1471,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1523.11,1547.397,"And didn't the report then say the reason it failed was that the real purpose of the amendment was not to restore some government neutrality allegedly lost because strikers are eligible for food stamps, but on the contrary, to use a denial of food stamps as a pressure on the worker, or more accurately his family, to help break a strike."
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1557.221,1563.422,"Justice Brennan, Congress is not frozen in time."
1987.86-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1611.169,1614.481,Is it possible that the 1977 Committee Report was false?
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1614.481,1615.34,--Was false?
1987.86-1471,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1615.34,1616.121,Was false?
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1616.121,1636.113,"It could be that it was wrong, it could be that it was overstated, it could be that like some other Committee reports, it exaggerates the strength of its arguments, and it could be that what was true then is no longer true about what moved a subsequent Congress to do something that a prior Congress rejected."
1987.86-1471,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1741.539,1745.647,Do you think your position draws strength from Harris against McRae.
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1747.038,1752.022,"I think it draws considerable strength, and indeed, I think this is a stronger case, Justice Blackmun."
1987.86-1471,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1752.022,1755.442,Because there it was an extension of benefits that was sought.
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1759.909,1770.406,"Well, I think in that case, Congress decided not to include a certain kind of constitutionally protected conduct within the aegis of the Medicaid Statute."
1987.86-1471,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1784.243,1786.476,"Mr. Robbins, what about Moreno?"
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1786.476,1821.448,"I think, Justice Brennan, that the Moreno case which after all was also a rational based case, even though the Statute was triggered by an associational claim, is different in that this Court was able to find in the legislative history, statements by the proponents of the legislation that it was animated by anti-hippie animus, that in fact, this was an effort to penalize an historically disfavored and insular minority."
1987.86-1471,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1823.555,1825.773,Why do you say historically disfavored?
1987.86-1471,0,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1829.49,1847.342,"Well, I think this Court thought in Moreno that this was a group that had been certain kinds of... within the political process, had been given certain kinds of disadvantages and that this statute reflected that."
1987.86-1471,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.342,1849.858,"Thank you, Mr. Robbins."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,1852.121,1858.854,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.387,1893.23,Excuse me.
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,1912.488,1924.545,"I'm not aware of any other food stamp disqualification that would act to disqualify the family for the full duration of its need, basically for the length of the strike in this case."
1987.86-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1941.32,1944.662,Sixty days or until the head of the household complies?
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,1944.662,1945.865,"Complies, right, whichever's shorter."
1987.86-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1945.865,1947.958,Whichever is shorter.
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,1953.862,1955.877,"For sixty days, that's correct, Justice White."
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.877,1967.404,"Well, I know, but what about the person who just decides he doesn't want to work anymore, ever?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,1967.404,1979.18,"I am not sure what that situation is but I believe you would have a continuing requirement to register for work and to be available for work, and I suppose--"
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.18,1982.836,"Well, then, as long as he won't work, the household would be disqualified."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,1982.836,1984.04,--That would be a single act.
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1993.331,1996.674,"Well, that makes hash out of the work requirement."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,1996.674,2004.313,"--No, I think they would continue to assess sixty-day penalties, but it would be for separate refusals."
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2015.917,2021.712,But it's the whole family though that would be disqualified.
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2021.712,2024.788,If the work is suitable and if the person is the head of the household.
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.788,2032.941,"Well, that is a provision, then that disqualifies the whole family because of conduct of the head of the household."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2032.941,2033.753,That's correct.
1987.86-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.753,2038.923,"You could consider this to be a series of acts, as well."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2045.718,2056.652,"Well, if the plant is either operating and the person can go back, or if the person has not been permanently replaced."
1987.86-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2064.681,2064.869,That's different.
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2064.869,2079.816,The District Court made a specific finding that the length of the disqualification was indeterminate for the length of the strike and found that there were numerous instances in the record where people had been permanently replaced and remained disqualified.
1987.86-1471,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2121.815,2133.325,"Well, Mr. McHugh, do you think the Constitution prohibits Congress from disqualifying for food stamps, families of voluntary quitters?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2133.325,2137.559,I think that that's a very important consideration in this case.
1987.86-1471,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2139.559,2140.385,"Well, does it, or not?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2150.32,2164.031,--I think that the Constitution prohibits Congress from doing that when similarly situated families of voluntary quitters or refusers of work are not treated as punitively as the families of strikers.
1987.86-1471,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2197.895,2199.768,I guess I just don't understand your answer.
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2212.139,2215.465,I don't think so.
1987.86-1471,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2215.465,2219.511,"Well, then why can't strikers be treated the same?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2219.511,2223.992,Because voluntary quitters are not treated that way.
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.217,2256.513,"Yeah, but ninety days they're disqualified, they and their families?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2256.513,2257.013,--That's correct.
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2257.013,2258.916,Then they have to register?
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2258.916,2260.76,That's correct.
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2260.76,2268.553,"And if they don't register and take work, they are off food stamps again?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2268.553,2271.318,"That would be true, but I think in a typical case--"
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.318,2274.067,"Meanwhile for sixty days, they are back on food stamps."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2274.067,2275.192,--No.
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2281.237,2286.218,"And so that would be just like the striker, then?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2286.218,2291.062,"Well, it would be the same effect in terms of food stamps, yes."
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2291.062,2291.234,Yes.
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2297.201,2299.732,I think what you're asking me to do--
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2299.732,2300.652,"Is that right, or not?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2300.652,2301.324,--Yes.
1987.86-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2317.069,2324.315,"But traditionally under rational basis, people attacking a law on equal protection grounds have a heavy burden to carry."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2324.315,2336.794,"Well, that would be true, Your Honor, and I think that we can carry this burden in this case because it's not the same case as Gilliard or Castillo, which this Court decided in the last two terms."
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.794,2348.322,"But the voluntary quitter at the end of 90 days, he has to register, but if it's evident that he won't work, he stays off food stamps, doesn't he?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2348.322,2349.618,That's correct.
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2349.618,2351.556,Just like a striker?
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2351.556,2359.569,"Well, except that strikers are not always able to waltz back into their job, as my opponent said."
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.23,2394.743,But you would want to be treated better than the voluntary quitter?
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2394.743,2395.821,No.
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.132,2401.818,"Well, the voluntary quitter if he doesn't want to work is going to stay off food stamps."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2401.818,2405.77,"These people, even if they seek other types of work--"
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2405.77,2411.283,"And furthermore, your striker doesn't have to go and register for work elsewhere."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2411.283,2412.736,--Yes.
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.077,2421.702,What about now?
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2425.542,2426.87,"Well, now they're just simply not available."
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.87,2427.151,Exactly.
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2427.151,2428.494,"I mean, they're not eligible."
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.494,2434.055,"But under your thesis, the striker would have to do what?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2434.055,2441.942,"Under our comparison, what we would say is if they treated strikers exactly like voluntary quitters, that would be--"
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2441.942,2444.457,So strikers are off food stamps for 90 days?
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2444.457,2448.143,--If it's the primary wage earner?
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2448.143,2449.782,Ninety days.
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2449.782,2450.845,Right.
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.845,2454.359,And then he has to register for other work?
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2454.359,2457.874,"Right, and be available for all other work except the struck work."
1987.86-1471,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.874,2462.467,"But if he said I don't want to work because I'm on strike, he's off for good?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2462.467,2472.182,"Right, but that would be fine because I think he should be subject to the same comparable requirements of the food stamp program which requires that you be available for all work except work that's vacant due to a labor dispute."
1987.86-1471,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2486.8,2495.501,"Mr. McHugh, do you concede the Statute would be constitutional if it merely disqualified strikers for 90 days, and their families?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2495.501,2504.015,"Yes, I don't see how we could come before the Court and make a similarly situated argument."
1987.86-1471,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.015,2509.872,"Even though, during that 90 day period, it took the milk away from the children and the family."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2530.222,2544.639,I think that where the associational freedom must come in is if we compare the food stamp treatment of voluntary quitters and those who strike.
1987.86-1471,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.145,2613.143,"So really it seems to me in bottom, you're making an equal protection argument, rather than a First Amendment argument?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2615.985,2622.046,"Well, I think that the equal protection argument is a narrower grounds for the Court to affirm the District Court."
1987.86-1471,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2622.046,2637.197,"Well, it really seems to me that you've abandoned the First Amendment argument because you seem to agree that if it were limited to a 90-day disqualification that it would be okay to disqualify people, even though you're taking milk out of the mouths of the babies in the family."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2637.197,2649.364,"And I'm not sure I need to make that concession because it seems like if it is a right of association, then it seems like to me that the interest that the Government has put forward are not the substantial interests that are necessary under the First Amendment."
1987.86-1471,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2652.519,2669.404,"Well, it seems to me it makes a big difference in remedy, too, because if this is the correct theory, the District Court presumably should have just enjoined the enforcement of the Statute insofar as it disqualified strikers' families for the 90-day period, for a period beyond 90 days, I mean."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2669.404,2669.529,Right.
1987.86-1471,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2672.716,2687.57,"Mr. McHugh, it seems to me that a good many of the laws in the labor-relations area can be said to burden association rights."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2716.871,2730.304,I think that where the governments cases dealing with the pervasive regulation of the right to strike in labor relations context really fail is there you are regulating striking as an economic activity viz a viz employers.
1987.86-1471,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2730.304,2734.053,"Well, the government argues that that's one of the purposes of this."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2752.857,2760.277,"Well, in those areas, the Court was concerned about employers' property rights and the public interest involved in regulating strikers."
1987.86-1471,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2811.478,2818.99,"Well, it depends on whether we view it as a social welfare program or as a form of labor policy."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2818.99,2843.479,"Well certainly the explicit objects of the legislation are to promote the agricultural economy and to alleviate hunger by providing assistance to families whose need is so low that they can't afford to purchase an adequate diet, and it doesn't say that they're also accomplishing labor-relations type activity."
1987.86-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2843.479,2863.846,"Mr. McHugh, we haven't examined the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, and specifically the provisions that render unlawful or impose certain adverse consequences for particular types of strikes, we haven't reviewed those under a strict scrutiny standard, have we?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2863.846,2868.579,"No, I don't believe you have, Your Honor."
1987.86-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2868.579,2869.688,"Well, how, why wouldn't we if--"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2869.688,2871.173,I don't know of any cases--
1987.86-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2871.173,2873.142,"--Well, I don't know of any."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2873.142,2877.891,"--I'm not sure you've reviewed them at all in the First Amendment light, I guess."
1987.86-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2877.891,2878.251,Oh.
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2902.507,2920.563,"Well, the District Court, I think at that point was really trying to make the case more like Moreno and less like Castillo, and it seems like to me what the District Court was doing there was looking at the part of Moreno where the Court said that the bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group was not a legitimate government activity."
1987.86-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2932.872,2934.714,"--Well, irrational, I have no problem."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2940.447,2945.149,"No, we've never argued strict scrutiny before this Court or before the Court below."
1987.86-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2961.036,2963.847,So your argument is essentially the equal protection argument here?
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2963.847,2973.438,"Under the First Amendment, I think there are two discrete independent grounds that the District Court held the Statute unconstitutional."
1987.86-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2973.438,2974.406,"Yes, I realize that."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2981.653,2984.106,You think that I'm not making exactly?
1987.86-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2984.106,2984.932,Yes.
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,2988.369,2997.663,"If the District Court in the equal protection context applied more than a rational basis test, I don't think that we need to do that."
1987.86-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3003.661,3012.578,"But then, do I gather that separate from your equal protection argument which you've just made, you're also making a First Amendment attack on the statute?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,3012.578,3013.453,That's correct.
1987.86-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3013.453,3015.812,"And you just haven't gotten to that, yet?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,3015.812,3016.468,That's correct.
1987.86-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3016.468,3016.749,Okay.
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,3018.843,3026.122,"I'll accept your invitation, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1987.86-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3071.432,3077.96,"Well, this strikes me as more equal protection, but perhaps I'm wrong."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,3077.96,3088.674,"--Well, I think the case that best shows the associational nature that this Court has looked at is Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley."
1987.86-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3134.001,3156.758,"But in Citizens for Rent on the contributions, we had held in Buckley v. Moreno, as some people have said, that money is speech, and therefore there was probably an independent First Amendment ground in Citizens Against Rent Control to analyze the thing in First Amendment terms since it was regulating something that was the form of speech."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,3159.741,3167.487,I think that there are other areas where you've looked at associational rights where it's not as clear.
1987.86-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3230.275,3259.296,"Mr. McHugh, I still don't understand whether you're urging just ordinary scrutiny or strict scrutiny when you begin talking First Amendment and associational rights, that doesn't mean anything different to me than just talking equal protection, unless what you're implying by that is that we have to examine with strict scrutiny whether the justification for this particular provision is valid."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,3270.041,3277.897,I think I would like this Court to say that there's an associational element here and that the Government would have to show a substantial justification.
1987.86-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3277.897,3278.678,Strict scrutiny.
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,3278.678,3280.897,And they haven't even tried to do so.
1987.86-1471,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3280.897,3286.473,"So you are urging strict scrutiny, which brings us back to my prior question."
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,3289.909,3310.728,"Well, one reason would be there you are not discriminating among certain kinds of associates, you're not saying that we are disapproving of a type of associational activity, you're only setting up a framework that's basically neutral or helping at least in adjusting the relationships between employers and employees."
1987.86-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3390.338,3409.344,"Does that suggest that all labor relations type laws of the first category have to be put in the same statute, and that Congress can't in another statute perhaps, a bill sent in by another department, they couldn't have a regulation of labor relations?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,3409.344,3412.437,No.
1987.86-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3599.097,3606.797,I don't understand your second distinction.
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,3612.03,3638.847,"Well, the Court in the Harris case made the distinction basically saying that you have a range of medical services that are potentially available and the government simply withdraws funding from one of those but doesn't disqualify the woman from medicaid generally, that's different from the situation in Sherbert v. Verner where the person lost all their benefits."
1987.86-1471,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3646.579,3657.716,"In other words, this would be different if in addition to food stamps, you also had some other forms of subsidy like free hospital care and free bus ride and things like that, then that would be like Harris against McRae?"
1987.86-1471,1,39918,richard_walker_mchugh,,3657.716,3658.216,--Yes.
1987.86-1471,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3668.338,3670.868,"Thank you, Mr. McHugh."
