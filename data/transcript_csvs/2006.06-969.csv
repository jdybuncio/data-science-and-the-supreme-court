2006.06-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.916,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-969, Federal Election Commission versus Wisconsin Right to Life, and Case 06-970, Senator McCain versus Wisconsin Right to Life."
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,14.024,17.366,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,97.898,100.05,Maybe we were wrong last time.
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,100.05,115.64,"Well, Justice Scalia, I don't think you were wrong, and I suppose that obviously you thought the rest of the Court was wrong in McConnell, and if the Court wants to reconsider that decision... I mean, that's an option the Court can take in the appropriate case."
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,137.037,157.794,"Well, we didn't have a concrete case such as this one, in which the assertions of the other side are very appealing as far as the rights of citizens to band together for an issue ad, even an issue ad that names somebody who's up for election within, within 90 days."
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,167.757,169.586,"With respect, I don't think you were."
2006.06-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,179.534,187.952,"How are we supposed to decide whether this case... if you think it's important to our resolution, how are we supposed to decide whether this particular case is typical or not?"
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,187.952,193.123,"--Well, I guess it's hard for me to say how you would decide whether it's typical."
2006.06-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,194.262,195.201,I think it's very hard to determine.
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,206.787,226.561,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, let me try to come at it this way, which is to say I would have thought that if you're not going to overturn McConnell, you're just going to apply it and say, well, what kind of as-applied challenges are left, I would have thought that what you would have in mind is ads that had an identifiable characteristic that marked them as being outside of the mainstream and somehow different from most of the ads."
2006.06-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,226.982,230.936,That gets back to my same question: How do we know that this is or is not outside the mainstream.
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,243.883,262.956,"--One strong indicator that these are in the mainstream is how close they are to the Jane Doe hypothetical that this Court identified as the prototype of the kind of ads that, although they took the form of issue ads, they looked like issue ads, they really were indistinguishable from and the functional equivalent of express advocacy."
2006.06-969,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,262.956,267.358,"General Clement, that Jane Doe ad was in the record last time."
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,272.311,272.794,There were hundreds.
2006.06-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,296.535,301.113,"Counsel, the Court in McConnell used the term, as you've used it this morning, ""vast majority""."
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,312.261,320.54,"--No, no, Mr. Chief Justice, because the Court used 70 percent, it could mean 80 percent, it could mean 90 percent."
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.82,367.693,"Well, did that statement refer only to issue ads, or did it refer to all ads?"
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,367.693,372.333,It referred to all ads that would come within the statutory prohibition.
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.333,378.299,"Right, and here we are dealing with a subset of all ads and that is issue ads."
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,387.077,401.023,"But with respect, Justice Scalia, there were so many issue ads in the record in McConnell that if issue ads were an appropriate category for as-applied challenges, it would have been impossible for this Court to reject the overbreadth burden."
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,401.023,401.569,--I don't know if that's so.
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,415.235,420.999,"Well, Justice Scalia, the only other obvious candidate that we could carve out would be express advocacy."
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.023,443.835,Everything that is not express advocacy is an issue ad?
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,449.876,451.408,--That's one way to divide it.
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,453.268,454.828,I wouldn't divide it that way.
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,463.17,466.261,"Justice Scalia, you're use the term ""issue ad"" as if it's self-defining."
2006.06-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,502.808,507.541,You're suggesting the district court decision is not consistent with McConnell.
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,521.895,523.755,"Oh, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not saying that."
2006.06-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,527.081,538.921,"So tell me what one, an ad that would succeed in an as-applied challenge looks like, or what the standard would be that we would apply in a way that you think would not call into question the decision in McConnell about Section 203?"
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,538.921,544.98,"Well, let me give you a couple of as... I mean, look, my job is to defend the constitutionality of the statute on its face and as applied."
2006.06-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,552.959,559.662,"What you're saying, though, is if this as-applied challenge succeeds you're saying the only way we can do that is if we think that the statute is facially unconstitutional."
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,562.816,563.472,--Sure.
2006.06-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,563.472,568.705,--approaching this as-applied challenge in a way that doesn't require us to revisit that prior--
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,568.705,569.173,Absolutely.
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.173,577.0,"It doesn't your case, with me at least, for you to tell us that it is your job to say that no as-applied challenge will suffice."
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,577.0,578.248,"Well then, let me give you an--"
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.248,578.965,"I mean, that doesn't--"
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,581.168,587.618,--Let me give you some inspirational as-applied challenges that would be better as-applied challenges than this one.
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.703,609.236,No.
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,629.869,630.524,"With respect,--"
2006.06-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,674.116,682.578,"--Can I, can I understand you to suggest we ought to draw a distinction in as-applied challenges between a 501(c)(3) organization and a corporation?"
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,682.578,684.376,I think--
2006.06-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,684.376,685.733,That is not a 501(3)(3) corporation?
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,685.733,689.844,"--I think, I think a 501(c)(3) corporation has a much better as-applied challenge if they can bring it."
2006.06-969,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,725.313,736.81,"We all... we all know... maybe... I think, I think it's accepted, that the public only tunes in to the political dialogue shortly before the election."
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,749.506,756.844,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I don't see... you may be right that certainly people do tend to focus on issues in the context of an election."
2006.06-969,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,808.763,827.96,"Are, are there frequent issues... instances in the political process, do you think, in which the public runs an ad against a, a candidate knowing the candidate is probably going to win anyway, he or she is from a safe district, or it's very difficult."
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,837.548,839.658,--Justice Kennedy--
2006.06-969,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,839.658,841.64,It... it seems to me logically that's possible.
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,843.983,845.453,"--Justice Kennedy, it's certainly possible."
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.153,896.385,"Well now... but... yes, it may make the difference in a close election but it is also, it is also likely to be more effective with regard to the Senator that you... whose vote you want on the issue."
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,913.799,920.343,"Well, Justice Scalia, if your point is that there may be an interest in trying to leverage the upcoming election to get somebody's attention--"
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.343,920.748,Of course.
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,920.748,921.279,--I think--
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.279,922.858,To get the Senator's attention.
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,922.858,923.326,--Sure.
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.326,926.652,"The Senator who is, who is at risk is likely, is likely to listen."
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,929.635,930.997,No doubt that's true.
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.376,957.938,You can't tell which of the two they had in mind.
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,972.148,987.458,"Well... I don't know, the fact that by the time they ran these ads Senator Feingold voted 20 times out of 20 to filibuster suggests to me that they probably concluded that the best to get a Wisconsin Senator who wouldn't filibuster was to change senators not to change to change Senator Feingold's mind."
2006.06-969,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,987.458,995.892,The relevance of this same group having a poll strongly opposed Feingold every time he ran for election.
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,999.296,999.842,No.
2006.06-969,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1013.631,1014.415,But this is... this is the First Amendment.
2006.06-969,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1040.058,1041.637,"--Sure I am, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-969,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1072.53,1073.75,"Thank you, General Clement."
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1082.153,1084.633,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.06-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1164.931,1170.16,"Is that, is that your test, if it has any electioneering purpose?"
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1170.16,1179.188,"We think the test is whether or not it is as this Court indicated, I think, whether it's the functional equivalent of express advocacy."
2006.06-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1234.339,1249.114,"Do we, do we usually place the burden when we're applying strict scrutiny under the First Amendment on the challenger to prove that they're allowed to speak, as opposed to the Government to prove... to carry the burden that they can censor the speech?"
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1249.114,1252.566,"Well, you... I think the rule is quite clear that you never do that."
2006.06-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.665,1282.288,"That vast majority thing, is that a... was that the holding of the case?"
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1282.803,1283.442,It--
2006.06-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1283.442,1287.739,--Every... every... every word that we it uttered in that prior case is law?
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1298.654,1305.322,"--It's... well, we would have an awful lot of laws if everything you wrote constituted law and a holding."
2006.06-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.322,1305.872,Yeah.
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1305.872,1321.957,"But that statement and a statement that follows shortly after it on the following page were essential to this Court's decision that applying the strictest possible scrutiny, this law was very narrowly tailored."
2006.06-969,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1321.957,1328.973,But the test as to any ad is whether any reasonable person could view the ad as... as an electioneering ad?
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1328.973,1337.342,"I think... well, an electioneering ad, Justice Alito, I think puts too much of a burden on it."
2006.06-969,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1337.342,1338.686,Any reasonable person could view it as what?
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1338.686,1353.929,"I think that what a district court would say is could a reasonable voter in the targeted electorate have understood that this ad was in part promoting, attacking, supporting, or opposing?"
2006.06-969,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1355.758,1365.191,"The same group has long had ads on a particular issue, and let's say a particular candidate's position on the issue is very well known to people who pay attention to public affairs."
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1383.293,1383.854,"I, I would think so."
2006.06-969,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1384.572,1385.589,That would be prohibited?
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1385.589,1393.474,"--Well, it would depend, as your question suggests, on the context in which the ad is run."
2006.06-969,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1409.954,1415.655,What do you... what do you make... what do you make of the fact that there are so many advocacy groups that say this is really impractical?
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1415.655,1417.592,--I... I love it.
2006.06-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1514.426,1527.235,"I think it's an important part of their exercise of First Amendment rights to petition their senators and congressmen, and to urge others to... as in these ads... contact your senators, contact your congressmen."
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1532.106,1534.543,"Well, though, I mean, I think it does demonstrate a few things."
2006.06-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1571.685,1573.12,Is this true of the NRA also?
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1580.635,1584.554,I don't think anybody would claim that.
2006.06-969,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1585.131,1586.161,I don't think they would either.
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1587.819,1590.614,--I'm not... I wasn't... I don't mean to pick on the ACLU.
2006.06-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1687.684,1688.199,Please.
2006.06-969,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1688.199,1705.926,"The only thing that distinguishes that statement from Jane Doe is knowing that Senator Feingold was part of that group, and reasonable listeners in the context of the ad itself and the web site would certainly have known that."
2006.06-969,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1706.581,1707.865,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1713.83,1730.898,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the Government's problem here is that they are repudiating the very studies and expert witness testimony that this Court relied upon in recognizing a distinction between sham issue ads and genuine issue ads."
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1833.233,1835.592,How could you tell?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1836.981,1837.515,I'm sorry?
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1837.515,1850.836,"--I rather liked the one we had before about Senator Faircloth, and his ad was, Senator Faircloth is against the trial lawyers and their efforts to increase liability laws, so write him."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1899.77,1911.564,"There was no testimony in McConnell that that ad, it... for those that determined whether or not it was sham or genuine, that ad was sham or genuine, there was no testimony, no reference--"
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1911.564,1919.338,I thought people offered to bring in such facts as... there was a web site address here.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1960.463,1961.134,--I did indeed.
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1961.134,1961.761,Good.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,1970.586,1971.381,Yes.
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1971.381,1976.427,"Thousands and thousands of pages that as I read it, I drew one conclusion."
2006.06-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.63,2050.755,"You are asking for that among other things, aren't you?"
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2050.755,2052.864,"Well, if there's no workable test--"
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2052.864,2054.331,And you are asking for nothing else.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2054.331,2072.745,--If there is no workable test that is reasonably ascertainable by small grassroots organizations that separates genuine issue ads from sham issue ads... this Court in Ashcroft said you cannot throw out the protected speech in order to target unprotected speech.
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2093.315,2096.001,I agree with you it's exactly as Justice Scalia said.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2118.915,2129.471,Because facial upholdings can only be sustained constitutionally if as-applied challenges are adequate to protect the protected speech.
2006.06-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2157.198,2163.022,Why do you say that those issue ads are inconsistent with the Government's position here?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2163.022,2164.816,"Well, because they--"
2006.06-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.816,2166.489,You haven't explained that.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2167.393,2168.225,--Yes.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2177.704,2182.2,"You're taking this because, in effect on a four corners facial criterion."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2182.2,2182.813,Yes.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2182.813,2189.559,"But one of the issues in this case is whether that is an appropriate methodology, so will you address that?"
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2189.559,2201.226,"Well, this Court has consistently rejected the idea of looking to, you know, outside the message of the speaker such as subjective intent or--"
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2201.226,2204.474,We're not talking about subjective intent here.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2232.665,2245.957,"--Well, that test that has been articulated by the Government would invite ads to be prohibited based upon the varied understandings of the listener, and that--"
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2245.957,2251.596,But doesn't any communication depend upon the understanding of the listener?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2262.78,2268.31,"--You do that all the time based upon the... the test is, what do the words say?"
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2270.899,2271.355,No.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2272.353,2273.492,"Yes, what do they mean."
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2273.492,2278.523,And it is impossible to know what the words mean without knowing the context in which they are spoken.
2006.06-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.523,2285.331,"--When they put these exhibits, were those exhibits complete with context?"
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2285.331,2285.908,No.
2006.06-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.908,2286.894,I didn't think so.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2289.222,2298.546,"There were two huge big studies on... two in '98 and 2000, and there was absolutely no testimony about the--"
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2298.546,2300.858,"My question is, why should we ignore the context?"
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2304.387,2311.259,"--Well, there is relevant context, such as the person named, the incumbent is a candidate."
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2323.471,2330.268,"But that... those don't go to meaning in the sense of, for example, the Faircloth Edwards example does."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2337.592,2344.244,Because it simply... it would prohibit all speech because no one would know in advance whether or not there would be--
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2344.244,2353.978,"You mean the people in North Carolina were unaware of the Edwards position, they were unaware of the distinction between Faircloth and Edwards?"
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2353.978,2355.023,--I have no idea.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2355.023,2355.632,Of course they knew that.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2355.632,2356.727,I have no idea.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2356.727,2357.149,Of course they knew that.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2369.891,2371.389,Because of one or two press releases?
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2371.389,2372.984,Why should those things be ignored?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2372.984,2376.716,There's absolutely no evidence that anyone in Wisconsin knew his position on the filibuster.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2376.716,2377.874,You think they're dumb?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2377.874,2379.122,No.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2379.122,2381.886,You have a web site.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2389.603,2390.976,"But we can't run the ads, we can't--"
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2390.976,2392.899,Nobody's paying attention to what the Senator is doing?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2392.899,2395.758,"--If we can't run the ads, we can't draw peoples attention to the web site."
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2395.758,2399.474,You think the only source of information about Senator Feingold is your advertisement?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2399.474,2401.003,"No, but I don't--"
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2401.003,2408.61,"Then if your advertisement is not the sole source of information, then why do you assume that no one in Wisconsin knows what the senator has been doing when he votes."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2408.61,2413.422,"--Look, polls show that a majority of the people don't even know who the Vice President of the United States is."
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2417.839,2423.603,So your position is that we ignore context because no one... because the voters aren't smart enough to have a context?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2423.603,2427.854,"--No, that we be allowed to speak so we can give that information to the voters."
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2427.854,2431.664,"But that's, that's the point, because where I get into my chain."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2439.802,2441.004,"Yes, but you said--"
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2441.004,2459.51,"And what happened before... either you can distinguish this, which I don't see how frankly, or you're back into the chain, and if you want to say one more thing about the chain, I didn't draw it to the final ending there, if I take most of the ads... and that's what that Kollar-Kotelly opinion is about."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2521.346,2529.749,"--Well, because of your decision in Beaumont, which creates a distinction between contributions and independent speech, and this is independent speech."
2006.06-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2529.749,2533.341,"It's pretty easy to tell whether you're giving money to the money to the candidate or not, isn't it?"
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2533.341,2534.012,Very readily.
2006.06-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2534.012,2538.604,That's a fairly bright line that you don't have to worry about stepping over the wrong side of it.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2538.604,2539.369,That's right.
2006.06-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2539.369,2547.928,"Whereas this one, especially if you adopt a context determination that requires a 1,000-page district court opinion, who knows."
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2547.928,2549.41,Is that right?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2582.819,2592.375,The problem is you're not giving force to the other conclusion of all three district court judges that there were genuine issue ads.
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2592.375,2592.968,"Oh, yes."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2594.076,2600.246,"And that these ads, you know, fall under a different line of cases."
2006.06-969,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.585,2614.893,Are you trying to convince us the purpose of these ads was to convince Senator Feingold to change his position on filibusters?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2614.893,2615.942,--It was indeed.
2006.06-969,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.157,2618.64,Do you think they had much chance?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2620.703,2635.9,"Yes, as it turns out, because in 2006 we ran the same sort of anti-filibuster ads and Senator Kohl, now up for reelection, changed his position on the filibuster."
2006.06-969,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2647.77,2649.505,Is that called democracy?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2649.505,2653.705,"We are hopeful, Your Honor."
2006.06-969,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2665.919,2672.404,"Mr. Bopp, your argument that McConnell's facial holding should be overturned appears on page 62 of your brief."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2679.556,2680.071,Yes.
2006.06-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2709.496,2710.182,What's your test?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2716.243,2734.579,"Well, based on their evidence in McConnell and these grassroots, and these genuine issue ads, I think there are three key or essential features of those ads that we are satisfied would protect grassroots lobbying and genuine issue ads."
2006.06-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2750.215,2752.34,That says what's good.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2754.867,2766.02,"--Second, the ads do not mention an election, candidacy, political party, challenger, or the official character, qualifications, or fitness for office."
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2781.559,2785.169,That's... give us the third one.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2785.981,2806.536,"The third one is, as long as the ad meets this pattern, that the fact that the ad... ours does not... but the fact that the ad mentions the name, the position of a public official on an issue and praises or criticizes him or her for that does not affect its genuineness."
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2806.536,2806.988,--Okay.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2848.065,2854.531,"Well, in a much more expansive and comprehensive test which looks to three features of the ad."
2006.06-969,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2862.419,2865.98,We look at fighting words in a context.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2865.98,2867.746,And I think we have a relatively--
2006.06-969,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2867.746,2871.743,It's one thing to say something in a bikers bar and another thing in the--
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2871.743,2874.18,--And I think we have a relevant context.
2006.06-969,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2874.18,2881.567,--Are there many cases where we look just at the words?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2881.567,2882.537,"Well, you certainly have in--"
2006.06-969,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2882.537,2885.127,"You can't shout ""Fire"" in a crowded theater; it has to be a crowded theater."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2885.127,2890.547,"--Well, relevant context, that there is an election upcoming, so it's within 60 days."
2006.06-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2903.306,2920.565,"Mr. Bopp, you do not have to establish, do you, that the test you propose will get at every bad ad, that it will be sure to get at every ad that is not a genuine issue ad?"
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2923.33,2924.286,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2006.06-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2924.286,2944.305,"I thought when we're dealing with the first amendment we give wide scope to the principle that it is, it is better to allow, you know, some bad speech than it is, in the effort to get rid of that bad speech, to eliminate any good speech that is justified."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2965.597,2967.157,I think that's the standard.
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2967.157,2971.344,In fact this isn't the First Amendment totally on one side.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,2983.854,2987.804,And so giving meaning to one side was upholding it facially.
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2994.207,3002.127,I'm just suggesting why a pure First Amendment test doesn't necessarily answer the question and why we've upheld McCain-Feingold.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3002.127,3004.752,"But even if you use balancing, you've already used it."
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3027.037,3040.066,"But your test, as I understand it, is the test to determine whether you fall within this sort of heartland of the statute which we upheld on facial challenge."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3048.235,3049.109,I did--
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3049.109,3060.588,"What you're saying: I have three criteria and if I satisfy those criteria, then the, then the facial validity of the statute is not an answer to my claim."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3062.086,3063.056,--Yes.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3063.056,3069.289,"And of course, if you success in that you're saying, okay, the Government then has the burden of satisfying strict scrutiny."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3076.581,3080.437,We're not trying to get out of the holding in McConnell.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3080.437,3080.738,Sure.
2006.06-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3092.154,3093.589,"You could say yes to that, I think."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3093.589,3095.293,Thank you.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3099.587,3101.666,"You want to go further than that, I know."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3103.288,3104.352,"--No, our first--"
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3104.352,3105.272,That's what you were getting at.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3105.272,3112.736,--Our first step is we want to give meaning to the promise of McConnell that there were genuine issue ads that could be protected by as-applied challenge.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3112.736,3121.514,"The way to do that is say, there's something different about my case from the case which was taken as typical in upholding statute against facial challenge."
2006.06-969,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3121.514,3125.592,He fears the Greeks even when they bear gifts.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3127.152,3127.963,"Yes, we have."
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3170.355,3190.192,"But your, your principle concern at this point is getting yourself out from the holding of McConnell, in other words, by saying we have a case which was not the typical case in McConnell, that's why it's an as-applied challenge and that's why this is a new ball game."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3221.911,3223.568,I just think that misrepresents--
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3223.568,3224.925,You're saying you shouldn't look at the context.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3224.925,3227.628,--I think that simply misstates the effect of this ad.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3234.268,3235.984,Then why did you refer them to the web site?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3240.391,3243.105,And that has been also misstated in the briefing here.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3253.415,3254.834,Anything about Senator Feingold?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3254.834,3255.899,"Well, of course."
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3260.021,3266.268,Did the web site indicate the... the Wisconsin Right to Life's position on Senator Feingold?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3266.268,3269.688,"--Only on the filibuster, yes."
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3285.072,3287.493,"That's part of the context, isn't it?"
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3289.665,3290.101,--No.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3290.101,3291.006,--context for the ad.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3295.663,3296.365,No.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3298.037,3298.723,You don't believe that's what you are doing.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3298.723,3301.754,"But see, the FEC doesn't even regulate what's on the Internet."
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3304.331,3309.361,The FEC doesn't regulate anything else in the broader political context except what the statute allows.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3317.902,3319.371,--We have not referred to context.
2006.06-969,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3319.371,3321.368,Okay.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3321.368,3325.275,We are not importing in our analysis--
2006.06-969,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3325.275,3327.381,May I ask a rather basic question?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3336.05,3337.863,--Yes.
2006.06-969,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3337.863,3346.063,Would it also prohibit you from using... urging everyone to look to a web site that used the same magic words?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3346.063,3346.984,Would it?
2006.06-969,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3346.984,3347.654,Yes.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3347.654,3352.997,"Perhaps, yes."
2006.06-969,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3352.997,3359.306,"So that if your web site used the magic words, then your ads would be... could be regulated."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3359.306,3365.99,You're talking about the constitutionality of the Federal statute that incorporates the cited to website.
2006.06-969,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3374.799,3382.328,"No, but you would agree the statute could be validly applied to an ad that says look at this website, and the web site then uses the magic words?"
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3382.328,3387.339,Perhaps.
2006.06-969,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3421.016,3427.169,"Well, do you believe that the First Amendment would not be violated by an ad that was the functional equivalent of one that contained magic words?"
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3427.169,3429.231,"--Well, I disagree with that holding of--"
2006.06-969,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3429.231,3433.806,There might be an upholdable constitutional difference between two ads that convey the same message.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3433.806,3436.29,"--Well, I don't believe they have the same functional--"
2006.06-969,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3436.29,3440.397,"If they're the functional equivalent, by hypothesis, they convey the same message."
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3440.397,3443.399,"--Well, Your Honor, I lost that argument in this Court."
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3465.84,3470.138,"The theory is that the ad itself on the web site, in your opinion, would have been okay?"
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3493.079,3496.986,--In the... as a broadcast ad?
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3496.986,3497.797,Yes.
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3501.903,3502.34,Yes.
2006.06-969,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3502.34,3505.105,You think that is protected?
2006.06-969,2,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3505.105,3505.791,Yes.
2006.06-969,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3528.861,3529.937,"Thank you, Mr. Bopp."
2006.06-969,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3532.998,3534.717,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-969,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3566.346,3571.797,Does that go to their meaning or to the intent of... is that what governs?
2006.06-969,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3580.498,3589.272,"--Justice Scalia, if you're looking for an as-applied challenge that's going to identify a genuine issue ad, I would think that it would go somewhat to intent."
2006.06-969,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3590.851,3591.709,That's new to me.
2006.06-969,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3596.1,3596.771,--No.
2006.06-969,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3637.193,3642.439,How long will the blackout period be during the upcoming year for the presidential candidates?
2006.06-969,4,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3642.439,3650.201,"Well, I think that in various places it will be 30 days before the primary and then obviously 60 days before the general."
2006.06-969,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3650.201,3653.543,--It could be as long as 200 days; isn't that correct.
2006.06-969,4,29016,james_bopp_jr,,3653.543,3654.639,Not in any one place.
2006.06-969,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3669.821,3672.21,You have to speculate before you try to put the ad on.
2006.06-969,5,37772,paul_d_clement,,3672.21,3673.755,"No, you don't."
2006.06-969,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3673.755,3682.314,"You have to speculate whether the Court is going to say well, since you're in the zone of three different radio stations or television stations, a different rule applies."
2006.06-969,5,37772,paul_d_clement,,3686.108,3693.825,"No, they don't, Justice Scalia, and one of the arguments that's made to try to suggest that there should be a reconsideration of McConnell is, as-applied checks don't work."
2006.06-969,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3714.517,3715.89,"Thank you, General."
