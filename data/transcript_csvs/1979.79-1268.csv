1979.79-1268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.118,"The Court will hear arguments first this morning in 78-1268, Harris v. McRae."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,16.059,19.81,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.755,463.025,"That passage in the District Court's opinion was an aspect of its holding with respect to the equal protection component of the Firth Amendment, was it not?"
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,463.025,468.365,"This is my understanding, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1979.79-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,472.777,474.937,"Right, because of another federal statute."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,474.937,488.354,Because they are under the Adolescent Health Services and Pregnancy Prevention and Care Act and he found that their equal protection rights were offended by the statute.
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,593.163,600.549,"Mr. Solicitor General, there is another interest involved though on the woman's side, isn't there, that wasn't in Maher?"
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,600.549,604.461,"There is another, yes, if the Court please, there is another interest."
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.574,611.858,The life and health interest of the mother.
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,611.858,618.409,A life and health interest but not of the degree specified in the Hyde amendment.
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,618.409,621.83,"Right, exactly, but different from Maher?"
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,621.83,631.473,"Different from Maher in that respect, but we suggest that not different in the sense that it should require a different analysis."
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.034,646.606,Did the District Court agree with you?
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,646.606,649.001,The District Court agrees with us.
1979.79-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,658.587,693.611,"That is where Maher basically differed from Roe, wasn't it, is that Roe v. Wade was not discussing the funding by federal or state of abortions but simply the right of the woman to consult with her physician and make the decision as to whether to have the abortion without restricted state prohibitions on the physician's right to give advice or the mother's right to heed the advice; where Maher was dealing with funding."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,693.611,696.725,That is exactly my understanding of the difference.
1979.79-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,708.128,712.651,"More specifically, it was concerned with state law that made it a serious criminal offense."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,712.651,731.175,"A serious criminal offense, and we say that the difference in Maher is, looking at a benefit conferred in the nature of public funding, the Court found that a different analysis was appropriate and reached a different result."
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,731.175,752.888,"Mr. Solicitor General, would you make the same rational basis argument if the Hyde amendment did not contain the exception for endangering the life of the mother, if it was her death rather than adverse impact on her health that was involved?"
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,752.888,754.044,I think I would.
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,773.06,781.281,Don't we have to assume for purposes of analysis at least that some women will be denied abortions if they don't receive federal funding?
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,783.326,784.528,"Oh, I think we have to."
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,786.424,791.951,And then we therefore must also assume that some of those women will suffer serious medical harm.
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,791.951,799.568,I think that is a judgment that is -- we must assume that and I think that is a judgment that the Congress must make.
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.579,862.471,"But it must have a reason, I take it."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,862.471,864.626,It must have a reason and we think that --
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,864.626,871.183,"But if it has a reason, any rational basis, that ends the role of the Court."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,871.183,875.501,"I think if the Court finds that -- well, let's say a legitimate reason --"
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,875.501,888.379,"Regardless of what the interests on the other side are, under the rational relationship test, I take it you argue that there is no balance involved at all, it is just if there is a rational basis that is the end of it."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,888.379,894.904,That's the approach in Maher and that is the way we read Maher.
1979.79-1268,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,895.297,902.799,"Mr. Solicitor General, the Hyde amendment does not prevent a state choosing itself to fund abortions, does it?"
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,902.799,907.661,"It does not at all, nor does the medicaid got generally."
1979.79-1268,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,925.653,931.158,Do you know how many states do in fact fund abortions?
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,931.158,932.081,I can tell you with reference to the --
1979.79-1268,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,932.081,932.227,Independent of medicare.
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,932.227,934.181,-- I could tell you with reference to the briefs.
1979.79-1268,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,943.438,944.276,I think I read somewhere --
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,944.276,948.119,"Michigan does, several do."
1979.79-1268,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,948.119,950.867,I think I read somewhere that there are ten or twelve that do.
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,950.867,952.561,"That's my recollection, but --"
1979.79-1268,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,952.561,954.037,Any may choose to do so?
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,954.037,962.115,"Any may choose to do so, and New York has never ceased to fund abortions, according to my information."
1979.79-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,973.417,1003.161,"Judge McCree, one senses without being able to perhaps point to the exact language that the equal protection clause deprives the federal government of the right to or the authority to effect in any way the woman's decision whether to have a medically necessary or medically recommended abortion or whether to carry her pregnancy to term."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1041.069,1047.782,I would find no offense to the equal protection clause of such a program.
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.072,1064.74,So the government concedes this?
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1064.74,1076.542,"The government concedes this, and this is set forth in appellees' brief and I think we concede it in our brief, too, and I don't think there is any question --"
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.542,1081.178,"This hasn't always been conceded, you know, and I wanted to be sure."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1081.178,1085.157,I make a frank concession about that.
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.654,1104.397,"And that was the finding in the companion case, too, I take it?"
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1104.397,1107.218,"In the companion case, this is my understanding."
1979.79-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1107.898,1129.499,And the rationale of Maher was in effect that the government can prefer the producing of new lives to the financing of abortions as a legitimate interest without regard to cost?
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1129.499,1137.461,"Yes, it can and this is, of course, what we asserted as the essence of our argument on the equal protection --"
1979.79-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1137.461,1148.616,"General, in the Maher case, the Connecticut Attorney General, as I remember the argument, acknowledged that the case would be different if they did not fund medically necessary abortions."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1152.24,1154.689,I think it acknowledges that it might be different.
1979.79-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1154.689,1156.44,"It might be, I guess that is what he said."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1159.43,1162.789,And there is a difference.
1979.79-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1163.842,1165.394,You say the analysis should be the same?
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1165.394,1167.896,The analysis should be the same.
1979.79-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1198.304,1199.851,Do you mean the Hyde amendment or the --
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1199.851,1201.64,"I beg your pardon, the medicaid act."
1979.79-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1201.64,1202.528,The medicaid act.
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1202.528,1209.227,"The medicaid act, Title 19 of the Social Security Act does exclude those --"
1979.79-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1209.227,1210.693,Mental illness.
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1210.693,1224.111,"-- mental illness, institutionalized tuberculosis and so forth, and no one suggests that it can't do that consistent with the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment."
1979.79-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.519,1328.051,"Do you think the Court would have ruled the same way had the government simply placed a very high tariff on Manichiewitz, which is certainly part of a ritual of at least Orthodox and perhaps conservative Jewry?"
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1328.051,1329.772,I want to make certain I understand the question.
1979.79-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1337.901,1353.238,So as to substantially raise the price in the guise or protecting and perhaps in the legitimate guise of protecting the local manufacturers of Manischiewitz wine.
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1353.238,1361.055,"Oh, no, I think it would not be at all if the government had a sectarian purpose for doing that."
1979.79-1268,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1361.239,1363.608,My question was did you think the Court would rule the same way?
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1365.728,1371.79,"Of course, and I appreciate the Court's suggestion of that.(Laughter)"
1979.79-1268,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1371.79,1383.655,Don't you think the logic of the Court's ruling on the free exercise clause would have led it to the same result in that hypothetical?
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1383.655,1385.491,"Not quite, because --"
1979.79-1268,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1385.491,1390.616,"Mr. Solicitor General, why don't you recognize the difference between drinking wine and having a baby?"
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1390.616,1396.398,I think that is a profound utterance with which I will concur immediately.
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1397.421,1413.218,"Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask you, in Maher v. Roe, the state interest was described there as a policy choice to favor normal childbirth."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1428.761,1436.46,"If the Court please, we do not attach any special significance to the use of ""normal"" in the Maher case and that is --"
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1436.46,1438.455,Should we view it as normal?
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1438.455,1439.639,-- that explains --
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.639,1442.271,Are we to read yours as meaning normal?
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1444.646,1448.807,As reading normal without any special significance.
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.26,1456.674,And that is why you omit it?
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1456.674,1458.323,And that is why we omitted it.
1979.79-1268,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1462.09,1463.478,"It was, you say?"
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1463.478,1467.858,"It was a deliberate omission, because we felt it was not significant."
1979.79-1268,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1467.858,1480.14,"Mr. Solicitor General, is it not correct though that there are two kinds of medical problems that may make medical necessity the reason for -- if we didn't have the Hyde amendment, might justify funding the abortion?"
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1493.888,1495.992,"Well, I think there is no question about it."
1979.79-1268,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1495.992,1505.394,Then is there the same state interest in encouraging that kind of birth as in encouraging the kind of birth that was involved in Maher?
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1505.394,1511.961,"I think there might not be, and what you are doing is putting content into the word ""normal"" and I agree."
1979.79-1268,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.961,1513.597,The word the Court used in that case.
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1513.597,1519.002,"Yes, and I agree that there is that difference and I agree with the Court's suggestion."
1979.79-1268,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1519.002,1533.258,"Well, didn't the District Court indicate that there may be some medically necessary abortions because you couldn't have a normal childbirth?"
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1533.258,1535.185,"I believe that is correct, if the Court please."
1979.79-1268,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1535.185,1538.255,And yet you don't think it is significant?
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1538.255,1548.266,"Well, I believe that -- yes, I believe in that sense it is significant, I have to concede."
1979.79-1268,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1548.266,1556.844,"Well, I get back, I don't understand quite why you omitted ""normal"" from your statement of what the policy is."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1556.844,1563.683,"Well, we still think that the Congress has to make that judgment."
1979.79-1268,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1573.687,1574.752,"Even then, I see."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1575.363,1585.152,Because the Congress just doesn't have to solve all of the social problems in a single pattern or program of legislation.
1979.79-1268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1592.925,1601.643,"Isn't it possible, Mr. Solicitor General, that the adjective ""normal"" in that setting could have a range of different meanings?"
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1614.433,1619.548,"No, it certainly can, I certainly would have to concede that."
1979.79-1268,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1619.548,1629.167,"General McCree, would you summarize how the government describes the state interest that it relies on as supporting the Hyde amendment?"
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1629.167,1629.398,Yes.
1979.79-1268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1682.74,1683.889,"Very well, Mr. Solicitor General."
1979.79-1268,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1683.889,1689.998,Thank you.
1979.79-1268,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1689.998,1696.002,Miss Copelon.
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,1696.002,1699.295,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1788.8,1793.203,What do you say is the higher scheme of the Hyde amendment?
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,1804.097,1816.802,"Your Honor, we do but we have to consider whether the singling out of the one service of abortion in the context of an intent to provide medically necessary services is rational and --"
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1816.802,1825.268,But the intent of Congress was to provide medically necessary services with the exception of abortion except in certain circumstances.
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,1825.268,1826.861,"That's right, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1826.861,1828.739,That is the thrust of my brother's question.
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,1828.739,1845.739,And the constitutional question that is presented to this Court and the one we will discuss today is simply whether under the minimal standard of rationality in the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment the Congress can single out that one service.
1979.79-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1845.739,1864.218,"But then you must be arguing not that it doesn't serve a legitimate or rational state interest, because presumably virtually any act of Congress will do that if applied -- if rational scrutiny is applied."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,1875.332,1899.319,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, our argument is that in the context of this scheme and also, and more importantly, in the context of the equal protection the preference for fetal life at the expense of maternal health and maternal life is irrational and therefore that preference cannot be drawn by the Congress."
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1899.319,1913.058,"As I understand it, Miss Copelon, your argument would be no stronger and no weaker if the so-called Hyde amendment were part and parcel of the statute originally enacted by Congress, is that correct?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,1913.058,1917.383,"That's correct, Your Honor, because it would be an exclusion in the context of that program."
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1917.383,1917.705,Exactly.
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,1917.705,1927.718,And it emphasizes in a sense the difference and the very critical differences between this case and Maher v. Roe decided three years ago.
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1978.229,1985.067,"Miss Copelon, you say it is irrational to prefer the fetal life interest to the health of the mother."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,1996.753,2002.346,"Your Honor, I think that when one looks at the decisions of this Court, that --"
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2002.346,2004.957,"Well, isn't that answerable yes or no?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2004.957,2013.689,The answer is it is not a rational choice in the context of a medical program involving medically necessary service and --
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2013.689,2020.397,"Even though Congress thought it was quite rational, we should disagree with that value judgment?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2020.397,2022.835,"Your Honor, it is not a value judgment."
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2028.026,2032.25,"But anyway, you suggest we disagree with Congress in that judgment, whatever kind of a judgment it was?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2032.25,2035.02,However one characterizes the congressional judgment.
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2038.641,2040.538,And the Constitution disagrees?
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2040.538,2053.103,"That's right, and the reason that the Constitution disagrees I think is best illustrated if one looks at what the Court did in Roe v. Wade when it looked at the third trimester."
1979.79-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2067.348,2078.083,"When you say the word ""irrational,"" I take it you mean literally those who voted to adopt the Hyde amendment belong in the looney bin."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2078.083,2080.125,"No, Your Honor, I wouldn't say that at all."
1979.79-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2080.125,2087.931,"Well that to me is what the word ""irrational"" means, that they just went off the wall."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2087.931,2092.21,"As a legal matter I would not make that contention, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.79-1268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2116.35,2140.141,"What if we had a Jones amendment, let us say, that excluded, as the Hyde amendment does with respect to these abortions, excluded the treatment for drug addiction on the grounds perhaps that drug addiction is self-induced and just excluded it, would your position be the same?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2140.141,2145.483,"Your Honor, it would raise very different questions because there would be a question of whether to include --"
1979.79-1268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2145.483,2148.233,It would be irrational?
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2148.233,2155.331,I wouldn't want to say whether it was irrational unless I saw the context in which the exclusion came up.
1979.79-1268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2155.331,2166.552,"Well, the context would be exactly the legislation we now have and add in exactly the words of the Hyde amendment ""drug addiction."""
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2166.552,2168.886,"Your Honor, it might be irrational."
1979.79-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2241.807,2261.642,Do you think that the evidence taken by a single federal judge over a period of months under our constitutional scheme was intended to be allowed to invalidate a judgment of the elected representatives of the people under the equal protection clause?
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2261.642,2265.586,"Your Honor, I think that facts must always be relevant to the question --"
1979.79-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2265.586,2268.322,But who decides the facts?
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2268.322,2276.474,"Well, in this case the Court decides the facts and the Constitution decides whether or not the ultimate judgment is rational."
1979.79-1268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.797,2336.814,"Counsel, may I interrupt there for just a minute."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2350.579,2362.853,"Your Honor, there is a fairly extensive indication of mortality rates in the early findings of the District Court and they are cited in our brief."
1979.79-1268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.853,2366.835,"What number per 1,000 or per 10,000?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2366.835,2374.97,"The normal is 16 women per 100,000 ; among black women, for example, it is 32 per 100,000."
1979.79-1268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.97,2376.3,32 per --
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2376.3,2378.403,"100,000 among black women."
1979.79-1268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2378.403,2381.998,"32 per 100,000 pregnancies."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2381.998,2384.83,Right.
1979.79-1268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2556.394,2566.12,"Before you day, you put considerable emphasis on the Hyde amendment does not encourage normal childbirth --"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2566.12,2566.894,That's right.
1979.79-1268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.894,2569.14,-- and encourages abnormal childbirth.
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2570.875,2581.097,"Your Honor, I think that makes a difference because it changes the balance of concern that is involved in this case."
1979.79-1268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.476,2626.106,"Well, is this an argument that the fetus is not a person for purposes of the Constitution?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2626.106,2645.944,"Your Honor, that has been decided, it is not a person for the purposes of the Constitution, and I dare say that in our health care system, even if some whole person's life is at stake, we don't ask another person to involuntarily sacrifice their health and their life for their well-being."
1979.79-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2733.212,2795.828,"Miss Copelon, let me ask you in connection with the case that is non-funding, which you are not now talking about, Stanley v. Georgia, where the Court found that the government couldn't prohibit the possession of pornography even in one's own home as well as any number of other books in one's own home, based on an implied by the privacy, nevertheless two or three years after Stanley in United States v. Ridell, the Court held that the government could prohibit the purchase or sale of pornography even though the purchaser intends to use it in his home, doesn't that suggest that although the government must allow certain things if they are done entirely apart from government support, the government may proscribe access to avenues that would enable the person to enjoy that right?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2795.828,2805.609,"Your Honor, I think it is a very different case, the case of pornography and also the case of distribution and sale as opposed to use."
1979.79-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2842.649,2864.361,"The Court had held that the State of Georgia could not prohibit the reading of whatever book one wanted in his own home, and yet in Ridell the Court said that a federal statute making inaccessible in effect books which the person might want in his own home was perfectly constitutional."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2864.361,2879.977,"But, Your Honor, I think that the more apt analogy would be if there were some kind of funding program involved, and it would be hard to see how there could be a claim for the payment of pornography under some kind of funding program that involved --"
1979.79-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2879.977,2893.142,"I thought you were arguing that the funding distinction was irrelevant and that we ought to get back to the case where the government simply prohibits or allows, rather than as in Maher fund."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2893.142,2894.756,I am not saying that it is irrelevant.
1979.79-1268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.439,2958.75,Was there any consideration in the court below or any argument about whether the court should simply declare the amendment unconstitutional and leave it up to Congress as to whether to eliminate the funding for all abortions or just some or --
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2958.75,2961.099,"Your Honor, it wasn't exactly raised in that way."
1979.79-1268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2964.33,2970.948,"Because there was an order to -- in effect, there is an order now to fund all medically necessary abortions."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2970.948,2971.785,"That's correct, and --"
1979.79-1268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2971.785,2978.229,Rather than leaving the solution up to Congress?
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,2978.229,2987.328,"Right, and I think what you are referring to is what one might enhance by calling the separation of powers argument here."
1979.79-1268,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3008.462,3010.31,"Well, that may be true."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3017.502,3024.933,"Well, I think it should cure it in the same exact way, Your Honor, as the Court cures the problem in Califano v. Westcott."
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3040.475,3047.247,"Well, should that be left up to Congress after the Court has held that what Congress did do is unconstitutional?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3047.247,3055.456,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I think that the majority was correct in Califano and that that holding is even more correct here."
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3068.716,3074.26,"Well, that is just an informed guess on the part of the Court, but Congress knows what it wants to do."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3074.26,3074.461,Your Honor --
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3074.461,3078.373,It has been told that what it has done is unconstitutional.
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3078.373,3096.423,"I think that it would be unimaginable that Congress would eliminate a medicaid program that we have had for fifteen years, that millions of poor people around this country rely on every day of their lives for this --"
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3096.423,3101.945,"Maybe you are quite right, as a matter of political prediction, but isn't that for Congress to decide?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3101.945,3115.421,"Your Honor, I think the obligation of the Court in deciding what remedy is appropriate is to decide that question, and there is evidence -- for example, in 1975, Congress failed to pass a rider."
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3126.101,3131.61,"But it would be, Congress would be totally free under the Constitution to completely repeal Title 19, would it not?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3131.61,3135.151,"That's correct, after this Court's judgment, Congress could --"
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3135.151,3137.725,"Before or after, at any time."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3137.725,3158.987,"Yes, they would be free, but the question of what remedies should come from this Court is based on the kind of assessment the Court made in Califano v. Westcott, and we submit that the devastating impact and the importance and centrality of the medicaid program argue even more powerfully than in Califano v. Westcott that the injunction should remain intact."
1979.79-1268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3158.987,3170.195,"Well, are you saying that a court may direct and command the Congress how to exercise the taxing and spending power?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3174.453,3183.696,"Your Honor, I think every time the Court reviews a classification in a welfare program, like in Califano v. Westcott or Goldfarb v. Califano, it is doing effectively that."
1979.79-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3195.995,3216.726,"Well, let's say the Hyde amendment does say something different from what it did say, or let's not call it the Hyde amendment but the Smith amendment, had said Title 19 shall be applicable only to non-white people, shall not cover anybody who is Caucasion or who is white."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3220.168,3222.373,"Yes, it would."
1979.79-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3222.373,3231.755,But wouldn't that be the extent of a court's power to so state and then leave it up to Congress whether they wanted to include everybody or not anybody?
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3231.755,3235.053,"Your Honor, I think that is a different case and one would have to look at --"
1979.79-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3235.053,3237.426,"Constitutionally, why is it different?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3237.426,3254.862,"Constitutionally, basically I think the Court should order the expansion of the program but constitutionally it might be different if, for example, you had a program where there were so few people benefitted and so many not benefitted that it would not be clear --"
1979.79-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3254.862,3261.78,"Let's say that's great many people would be benefitted, it just wouldn't cover white people, that's all."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3261.78,3265.374,"The difference here, I think that is unconstitutional and I think that the Court would probably --"
1979.79-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3265.374,3267.582,"Well, clearly it is unconstitutional but the --"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3267.582,3267.759,Right.
1979.79-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3267.759,3269.14,-- but the point is what is the remedy.
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3269.14,3270.072,And the court--
1979.79-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3270.072,3273.055,"And what is the extent of the Court's power, appropriately exercised?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3273.055,3276.708,A court clearly has the power to remedy that--
1979.79-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3276.708,3278.715,What is the extent of the appropriate exercise of its power?
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3278.715,3280.874,By including it.
1979.79-1268,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3290.935,3291.895,Nor do I.
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3291.895,3305.417,-- but it would potentially have significance if the non-included class were so large that one really had to doubt whether or not Congress can continue the program if they had to include the--
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3305.417,3308.909,"Well, Miss Copelon, Westcott involved an extension of benefits, didn't it?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3308.909,3309.427,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3309.427,3314.317,And therefore an increase in the expenditure of public funds.
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3314.347,3315.297,That's correct.
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3315.297,3327.192,"And I gather that it may be that even in the situation of that light, you could argue on the basis of Westcott that the Court could extend, as it did --"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3327.192,3328.954,That's absolutely right and --
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3328.954,3333.987,"Of course, with the Hyde amendment, if you invalidate those restrictions that saves federal money --"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3333.987,3335.438,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3431.614,3450.938,"Now, if your argument is correct that would be -- what you say would invalidate almost every criminal law we have, because most of them coincide with at least if they don't stem from religion tenets, the laws against murder and theft and --"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3450.938,3452.09,"You Honor, we are not talking about --"
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3452.09,3454.288,-- all come from the Ten Commandments.
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3454.288,3466.603,"-- we are not talking about a law which merely coincides with religious belief and we are not talking about a law which, like the constraint on murder, is something which is part of the secular fabric of society and is accepted by everyone."
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3466.603,3469.676,"Well, it becomes so and its origins were religious aren't they?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3469.676,3483.319,"That's right, Your Honor, but today is the point at which one has to examine what the purpose and what the character is of the belief that human life, full actual human life begins at conception."
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3506.722,3510.294,And this is an establishment clause argument that you are making?
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3510.294,3514.835,"Yes, Your Honor, exactly like Epperson v. Arkansas in terms of the purpose of this law."
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3514.835,3525.214,"This would mean, I suppose, the result would be that religiously motivated people wouldn't be free effectively to lobby Congress to enact legislation."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3525.214,3529.522,"No, Your Honor, it is not a matter of their freedom to enact legislation."
1979.79-1268,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3532.873,3536.473,"But if they succeed, then the legislation that is enacted violates the exception clause."
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3536.473,3560.848,"Because as this Court has said many times, the establishment clause places a limit on the political entanglement of religion, and it is only if the legislation that is enacted is wholly lacking in a secular purpose which we think the documented record of the District Court, particularly with respect to the character of the anti-abortion movement."
1979.79-1268,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3582.21,3592.153,"Miss Copelon, don't you have to say that the Congressmen were biased, religiously biased?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3592.153,3593.079,"That's right, Your Honor, but --"
1979.79-1268,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3593.079,3594.01,Do you say that?
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3594.01,3596.069,"I do say that, because they --"
1979.79-1268,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3596.069,3598.545,"Well, do we have to say that?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3600.172,3608.526,"Your Honor, you do not have to say that, but the fact of the matter is that I think the issue will continue to be before the Court --"
1979.79-1268,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3608.526,3612.635,"And if Judge Dooling had ruled the other way, he would have been biased?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3612.635,3614.042,He --
1979.79-1268,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3614.042,3615.04,Yes or no?
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3615.04,3616.141,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear your question."
1979.79-1268,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3616.141,3622.245,"I say if Judge Dooling had ruled the other way, he too would have been biased, is that your position?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3622.245,3648.144,"Well, Your Honor, our position is that the problem here is that not only is the anti-abortion movement essentially religious, but it is taking a position on a religious question and therefore it is religiously biased legislation which impacts particularly on poor women in a medicaid program which has as a principle to accommodate religion."
1979.79-1268,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3648.144,3658.196,"Would you apply the First Amendment argument to non-therapeutic abortions, the Maher v. Roe type situation?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3658.196,3659.207,"Your Honor, I am not --"
1979.79-1268,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3659.207,3662.609,"If you had argued Maher, would you be making the First Amendment argument?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3662.609,3674.736,One would have to look at the record in Maher to see whether or not it was premised as wholly as this on that fundamental belief about when human life begins.
1979.79-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3693.928,3707.938,Before you sit down -- your red light is on -- would you say that the exception of the Volstead Act for wine used in religious rituals was therefore unconstitutional?
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3707.938,3713.255,"No, Your Honor, I think it was probably essential."
1979.79-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3713.255,3719.939,But it was certainly motivated in a desire to accommodate religious interests.
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3719.939,3734.557,"As this Court has held many times, the accommodation of religious interests is permissible so long as there is not a direct establishment of religion, the same principle as Sherbert, and I think that would --"
1979.79-1268,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3734.557,3737.334,"Well, do you think that the Hyde amendment was an establishment of religion?"
1979.79-1268,1,38887,rhonda_copelon,,3737.334,3739.877,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1979.79-1268,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3742.965,3744.846,"Your time is expired, counsel."
1979.79-1268,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3750.231,3754.118,"I have just two points to make, if I may."
1979.79-1268,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3779.071,3783.811,"Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask you a question."
1979.79-1268,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3825.149,3827.722,That's the point in our brief and that is --
1979.79-1268,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3827.722,3831.348,There isn't any national or state interest in having more people in the country.
1979.79-1268,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3831.348,3840.099,"Although we are not making that argument, although that would be a legitimate reason for the Congress to enact such legislation."
1979.79-1268,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3840.099,3844.679,There is no indication that that was in fact the reason that motivated anybody in this case.
1979.79-1268,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3844.679,3846.486,"That's correct, there is no such fact."
1979.79-1268,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3846.486,3857.081,"If you had a negative birth rate for a sustained period of time, I should think that would be quite a significant and important argument."
1979.79-1268,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3866.405,3868.07,"We would agree with that, Mr. Justice Powell."
1979.79-1268,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3868.07,3872.316,"Of course, the other side of the coin is that over-population is a greater threat, I suppose."
1979.79-1268,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3872.316,3875.743,We say these are considerations of the Congress.
1979.79-1268,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3875.743,3894.944,"General McCree, certainly a hundred years ago a large family was considered social security for the parents, because they realized that they would have to derive the work from the farm from the children who would in turn support them."
1979.79-1268,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3903.86,3905.65,We would agree with that proposition.
1979.79-1268,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3905.65,3916.574,"But I take it your point is, Mr. Solicitor General, that at any given time, whatever the population situation may be, this is a matter for Congress to decide and not for the Court?"
1979.79-1268,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3916.574,3920.467,Its wisdom is committee to the Congress and not to the Court.
1979.79-1268,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3921.104,3921.793,"Thank you, counsel."
