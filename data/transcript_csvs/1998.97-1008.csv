1998.97-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.789,"We will arguments first this morning in No. 97-1008, Carolyn Cleveland versus Policy Management Systems Corporation."
1998.97-1008,0,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,12.201,15.733,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1998.97-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,61.202,66.996,What is the bearing of the McKenna action on the question presented here?
1998.97-1008,0,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,66.996,73.58,"Mr. Chief Justice, the McKenna case, as this Court is well aware, involved the issue of after acquired evidence."
1998.97-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,73.58,77.824,It involves what?
1998.97-1008,0,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,77.824,79.266,After acquired evidence.
1998.97-1008,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,79.266,92.935,"It seems to me the difference is... I have the same concern as the Chief Justice apparently has... here you have an application, an official form."
1998.97-1008,0,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,101.299,102.851,"I agree, Your Honor."
1998.97-1008,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,122.684,142.655,"Well, Mr. Wall, do you think that statements made by your client in making an application for Social Security disability should be admissible as evidence in the event of a subsequent ADA request?"
1998.97-1008,0,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,142.655,144.837,"I certainly believe they should, Your Honor."
1998.97-1008,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.837,157.606,"And if somebody such as your client has said, I am totally disabled, that might be pretty strong evidence, I suppose, even if you don't give it presumptive effect?"
1998.97-1008,0,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,173.946,184.113,"It would be in the sense that at various points in time she did have to say, in response to various questions of the Social Security Administration, words of that caliber or character."
1998.97-1008,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,198.382,202.245,"Well, why shouldn't it be even more than just strong evidence?"
1998.97-1008,0,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,242.701,250.758,"Well, I would think that that would upset the normal summary judgment process here, being that this is an affirmative defense raised by the respondent."
1998.97-1008,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,253.67,258.803,"Well, but the doctrine of judicial estoppel does upset the normal process."
1998.97-1008,0,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,291.394,295.799,"I believe that she should be required to explain it, as we did."
1998.97-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,295.799,309.065,"But the question is is it just an admission against interest that can come in along with all the other evidence in the case or is it something more, something that should actually shift the burden of proof?"
1998.97-1008,0,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,309.065,311.637,"I think not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.97-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,311.637,311.847,Why not?
1998.97-1008,0,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,311.847,337.524,"The reason being is because people who apply for Social Security disability may be victims of Down's Syndrome, may be victims of dyslexia, may be victims of brain damage, may be victims of strokes, may have expressive and perceptive aphasia, as Mrs. Cleveland does, may have any number of other psychomotor abnormalities which may interfere with their normal language perception."
1998.97-1008,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.524,343.106,"Well, they have enough normal language perception to fill out the application, I take it?"
1998.97-1008,0,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,343.106,354.496,"Well, the process as I understand it, Mr. Chief Justice, is that this initial application that was completed by Mrs. Cleveland here was compiled after a telephone interview, and she signs it."
1998.97-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,362.33,366.244,"With respect to that, Mr. Wall, the facts are a little confusing."
1998.97-1008,0,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,392.199,393.99,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.97-1008,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,405.608,408.59,What was the medical opinion at that time?
1998.97-1008,0,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,415.475,417.456,At that point in time no one could tell.
1998.97-1008,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,955.091,965.106,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
1998.97-1008,2,41739,stephen_g_morrison,,1560.237,1564.912,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1998.97-1008,3,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,3308.321,3311.122,"Mr. Chief Justice, please the Court:"
1998.97-1008,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3337.721,3339.442,Must it be made?
1998.97-1008,3,33649,john_e_wall_jr,,3369.983,3371.393,Well--
