2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.498,"We will hear argument next in Case 10-114, Fox v. Vice."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,9.86,12.953,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,48.526,63.655,Did we take the case on the assumption -- your -- your predecessor and you may disagree -- but did we take the case on the assumption that this was a frivolous cause of action?
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,63.655,76.737,"Your Honor, the Court took the case on the assumption that the legal theory was frivolous, but that the underlying cause of action, which is to say the operative facts, were meritorious; and in fact they are meritorious."
2010.10-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,88.024,88.49,"Well, wait."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,121.924,129.238,"Your Honor, in this case the liability was far greater for the State court claims than for the 1983 claims."
2010.10-114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,131.164,133.043,"Well, that's not quite right."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,146.293,147.006,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,147.006,147.789,--under 1983.
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,147.789,148.289,That was--
2010.10-114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,148.289,149.802,So the city's liability would be greater.
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,149.802,151.828,--That was one incremental increase.
2010.10-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,173.041,177.68,"Mr. Rosenkranz, you knew that, though, from day one."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,239.335,243.095,"The answer is partial responsibility, yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,271.436,278.75,"What if Mr. Fox had filed two -- two actions, the Federal claim in Federal court, the State claims in State court?"
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,291.204,296.025,"And they're simultaneous, simultaneous, Your Honor?"
2010.10-114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,323.137,331.998,"You're proceeding on the assumption which I -- I think is certainly, based on what I know of the record, true here, that the State claims are far from frivolous."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,348.59,353.512,"--So, your Honor, we're still operating on the hypothetical that they're separate cases--"
2010.10-114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,353.512,353.745,Yes.
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,353.745,354.442,--not intertwined?
2010.10-114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,355.825,359.08,"Well, the facts are -- the facts are intertwined, but they're two separate cases."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,359.08,359.346,Yes.
2010.10-114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,359.346,364.682,You have claims of unknown merit in State court; you have a frivolous claim in Federal court.
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,364.682,384.966,"My answer to that hypothetical is the same as our point two, that if there is -- if there are fees to be awarded at all, they have to be fees that are tethered to the rationale for there being a right to attorney's fees in the first place, which is what was the incremental burden of the Federal, of the Federal lawsuit?"
2010.10-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.049,387.179,So how do you calculate that?
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,389.142,390.984,"--Well, Your Honor, it would be very easy in this case."
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,404.317,408.01,That's an incredible burden to impose on the district court.
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,429.757,430.22,--Your Honor--
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,430.22,443.007,"And that seems -- just -- sorry, I don't mean to drone on, but that seems to me to be an especially odd burden to impose when you're dealing with an area where there is a heavy dose of discretion to the district court in the first place."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,443.007,456.952,"--So, Your Honor, let me then start -- move back to our overarching point, which is that these are the sorts of incremental burdens that are trivial, if they exist at all, and that shouldn't be awarded attorney's fees at all."
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,456.952,471.998,"Well, maybe in your case, but there's no reason to suppose there won't be cases where the things are flipped, and the Federal claim, perhaps frivolous for a legal reason rather than a factual one, is the dominant driving force in the litigation and you've tagged on a few other State claims."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,471.998,474.507,"Your Honor, that's a key point in our presentation."
2010.10-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,484.247,512.892,"Mr. Rosenkranz, there -- there are distinct differences in the 1983 suit because, first, the plaintiff has to show defendant acted under cover of State law -- that's not going to be necessary in the suit for extortion or defamation -- has to show that Vice was an official policymaker for the city."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,525.458,529.134,"--Indeed, Your Honor, and so let me answer that question in two ways."
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,551.623,559.771,"But that's a pretty audacious claim, that you filed such a frivolous cause of action that they shouldn't have wasted so much time responding to it."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,559.771,560.484,"No, no, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,561.351,562.197,That's a lot of chutzpah.
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,562.197,563.994,"--You Honor, that's their point."
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,572.187,573.734,And you shouldn't have filed it.
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,574.947,592.039,"I understand the argument, Your Honor, but the Seventh Circuit has a very good opinion that's cited in the brief that explains that when the defendants are just racking up fees on a claim that they claim is frivolous, that they could have filed a motion to dismiss on, they shouldn't be racking up fees on that claim."
2010.10-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,592.039,601.362,"Counsel, can I understand what legal analysis you're proposing?"
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,618.037,619.667,Your Honor--
2010.10-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,619.667,624.473,"All of the other circuits, as far as I can tell, don't go to that extreme."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,671.367,673.18,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,674.21,675.177,--assume.
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,675.177,676.803,"--correcting the premise, if I may, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,715.421,720.143,"But there are difference -- are differences in how we read those other circuits, but I'll accept your proposition."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,720.143,731.596,"--And, Your Honor, I would encourage the Court to look at the -- at the Schwartz treatise, which says what I've just articulated is the clear majority rule, not just among the circuits, but in the district courts, where circuits haven't weighed in."
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,731.596,734.272,"Can I clarify what you mean by ""completely intertwined""?"
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,738.495,739.045,"No, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,743.133,753.874,So you -- you're looking for fees -- your first argument -- even though they can identify fees that were incurred solely on defending the frivolous cause of action?
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,753.874,771.011,"I'm looking to block fees even though they can, and the reason is Congress was concerned about burdensome litigation, not about minor, trivial increases in litigation to utter three sentences about a legal claim and then say--"
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,771.011,771.244,All right.
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,777.28,781.169,"--Your Honor, the premise here is that the Federal action is completely frivolous."
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,789.446,794.251,"What if it's not completely frivolous, but frivolous enough to satisfy a demand for fees?"
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,804.741,807.417,"Your Honor, I guess I'm having trouble accepting the premise."
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,815.316,817.044,"Well, you've got to find the 17 cases."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,817.044,820.917,"--Sure, but if it takes 40 hours to do it, then it's probably not frivolous."
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,822.23,824.276,You've got to look carefully at the facts.
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,840.018,840.731,"--I understand, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,885.035,902.173,"And I don't want to have you adopt this phrase, but just to clarify, are you saying that it's a but-for test, that you get only those fees for time that was -- that would not have been incurred but for the frivolous claim?"
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,902.173,907.394,"--So let me move now to the second argument, Your Honor, and the answer to that is yes."
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,950.531,951.666,"No, that's not how it works."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1000.604,1003.53,--Which is one of my reasons for our underlying--
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1003.53,1004.696,I understand you go back to the first point.
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1004.696,1008.085,"--But, Your Honor, let me -- let me just explain how I think this works."
2010.10-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1048.683,1085.006,"In other words, you're saying that the lawyer has to keep account of -- now, if I'm going to spend time on ""under color of State law"", I have to label that and figure the hours for that separately; similarly for whether Vice was an official policymaker, those hours that you are requiring that -- instead of saying X number of hours for deposition of witness A, you are requiring particularizing the issue?"
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1085.006,1087.136,"--Yes, Your Honor, and that's what Hensley says."
2010.10-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1123.958,1133.152,"And Mr. Rosenkranz, in this case what's your understanding of the approximate percentage of time that was spent on the Federal issues that Justice Ginsburg was talking about?"
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1133.152,1137.957,"Minuscule, Your Honor, and let me refer the Court to the supplemental appendix."
2010.10-114,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1169.474,1172.734,So there was no significant motions practice on these issues?
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1177.206,1181.011,"--There was, and there was -- and that was done mostly by the city."
2010.10-114,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1213.611,1240.36,"What if the potential liability on the frivolous claim is much greater than the potential liability on the factually interrelated nonfrivolous claims, and the defense argues that we spent a lot of time on -- a lot more time on these interrelated factual issues because of our fear of the greater liability on them than the frivolous claim?"
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1240.36,1240.86,All right.
2010.10-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1257.118,1268.459,"Counsel, did the -- the district court here said they're intertwined claims, they all relate to the frivolous claim, they're entitled to full fees."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1297.051,1299.247,"That is a correct quote, of course, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1299.247,1301.005,You think they misapplied that?
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1301.005,1303.848,"What I would say, Your Honor, is not that they misapplied it."
2010.10-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1306.328,1306.857,Two.
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1306.857,1307.391,--then--
2010.10-114,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1307.391,1313.543,And they joined the Ninth and the -- and the other circuits that have the but-for.
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1324.033,1324.329,"--Yes, correct."
2010.10-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.439,1338.578,"But that's not why we took the case, to correct the factual application."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1338.578,1339.875,"--Agreed, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1376.318,1378.76,So they messed up the application of the but-for test.
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1391.826,1394.752,"--Your Honor, I -- I understand your point."
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1419.705,1427.982,"Mr. Rosenkranz, I'm looking at the billing sheet, August 14, 2007, 32 hours, miscellaneous cost, online research."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1429.778,1444.824,"Your Honor, it's general research that I would say if the lawyers did not specify that this was for specifically incremental increase in the cost of the lawsuit on the Federal theory, then they've lost the opportunity to try to make that case."
2010.10-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1452.238,1465.85,"I don't -- you -- you -- you've done this several times in the course of your argument, sort of equating, you know, the attorney's fees for frivolous suits with the normal attorney's fees that the plaintiff gets when the plaintiff is victorious."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1493.98,1503.34,"--Your Honor, I actually believe that the Court should not be evenhandedly applying the same set of rules, but we reached the opposite conclusion about which side gets the benefit of the burden."
2010.10-114,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1532.681,1546.597,"Mr. Rosenkranz, one -- one piece of this you must know the answer, under the Louisiana law we have the extortion, defamation, and emotional distress going forward in Louisiana courts."
2010.10-114,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,1557.633,1568.291,"--My time is reserved for rebuttal, but I will answer the question, Louisiana follows the American rules, so no fees on the State court claims."
2010.10-114,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1569.337,1569.704,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1583.253,1586.429,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1616.4,1617.862,So why can't you prove that?
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1617.862,1618.909,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1618.909,1622.168,Why can't you prove that in a but-for situation?
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1644.612,1645.658,"No, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1651.909,1654.185,"Eligibility, it has to be a frivolous claim, that's--"
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1654.185,1660.871,"--Where eligible, the standard is, as under Hensley, what is the degree of overall success in proving that these claims are frivolous?"
2010.10-114,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1674.37,1691.675,"If the liability under the State law claims is $100,000 and the liability under the Federal claims is the same, and you win on the Federal claim and you lose on the State law claim, if I were the client, I would say your degree of success was zero."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1702.878,1709.412,"Well, that would be something that a district court would take into account as part of its discretion, and that's exactly the point of Hensley."
2010.10-114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1727.664,1730.756,I don't see how that -- one can say that looking at the complaint.
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1738.867,1741.959,"It's at pages 37 to 43 of the joint appendix, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1772.93,1774.227,Right to be free from extortion.
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1774.227,1774.843,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1775.44,1775.873,Is--
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1775.873,1777.986,"--Yes -- no, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1812.678,1817.151,"Well, I'm -- I'm not familiar with Louisiana standards of pleading."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1827.575,1828.854,"Well, Your Honor--"
2010.10-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1828.854,1832.28,It would seem to me reading the complaint would permit that.
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1832.28,1833.826,--I think that would be--
2010.10-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1833.826,1837.298,I -- I don't know what degree of specificity is required.
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1837.298,1845.029,"--Well, I think that would be more than generous under the -- in the context, and then you would do what the district court said and look how the parties acted from this point forward."
2010.10-114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1865.61,1898.49,"--I thought that the Louisiana pleading rule were -- was that you state the basis of your claim, and you do not have to plead legal theories; and if that's so, then if this -- defendant removed this case to Federal court; the plaintiff wanted to keep it in State court; and in Louisiana, under the Louisiana pleading rules, it would have been perfectly appropriate."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1927.202,1954.497,"--Yes, Your Honor, but it included a Federal cause of action that allowed removal to Federal court, and once it's in Federal court, it's subject to the Federal rules for pleading a claim adequately and in specificity, and here the district court found these State law claims, there was not a whiff of them until the very tail end, 18 months later, when it was actually in response to the town of Vinton saying, by the way, just to be clear, there are no State law claims here."
2010.10-114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1954.497,1971.719,"Isn't that implausible, Mr. Stancil, when we consider that of all the claims here, the one that would seem easiest to prove is extortion, because Vice was convicted of extortion in a criminal proceeding?"
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,1981.079,1985.135,"Well, Your Honor, again, look at how the plaintiff used the fact of extortion."
2010.10-114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2023.003,2026.846,The district court was prompted to do that by your motion for summary judgment.
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2026.846,2029.272,"--Correct, Your Honor, and that -- that's how--"
2010.10-114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2029.272,2032.281,And you could have brought that motion very early on.
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2039.862,2042.021,"--Well, that's a very important point, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2085.741,2089.267,"Mr. Stancil, can I get you to just think about a hypothetical with me?"
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2131.358,2131.774,Okay.
2010.10-114,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2131.774,2134.35,What are the fees in that case according to you?
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2134.35,2136.813,It would be within the district court's discretion.
2010.10-114,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2142.265,2142.565,Okay.
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2154.665,2156.628,--He gets -- yes.
2010.10-114,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2156.628,2157.923,All the work that is--
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2157.923,2158.969,At a -- at a minimum.
2010.10-114,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2158.969,2163.692,"--Even though the plaintiff has, from the plaintiff's view has completely won the lawsuit."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2163.692,2165.905,"Correct, he has -- yes."
2010.10-114,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2165.905,2166.784,Go--
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2166.784,2167.581,Is there a follow-up?
2010.10-114,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2168.581,2168.997,--No.
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2169.097,2169.347,Okay.
2010.10-114,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2177.524,2179.903,"And -- and -- okay, go ahead, I'm sorry."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2179.903,2185.421,The burden -- the question is what is -- what does section 1983 authorize?
2010.10-114,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2216.992,2228.013,"So but on that theory, the -- the plaintiff would be paying the defendant's fees for work done where the plaintiff won."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2228.013,2245.318,"Because the plaintiff levied a frivolous -- not just a faulty or unsuccessful, a frivolous cause of action under section 1983, and this is the point of -- of why 1988 is different from, say, rule 11 and other provisions that limit bad faith actions."
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2253.215,2266.731,"--But I thought what Congress said and what we've said in Hensley, that the only thing that the defendant is entitled to fees for is the burden of the frivolous Federal claim."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2288.325,2292.38,"To be clear, Your Honor, I'm not saying we would be automatically entitled to 80 percent."
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2298.748,2310.981,"But tell me why we would, given the differences that we've announced in Hensley between prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants -- because you can only prevail as to a frivolous fee."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2328.869,2332.395,"Well, I don't think it would matter to the outcome of this case, and I would like to come back to that."
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2340.739,2341.189,No.
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2356.998,2357.248,--Well--
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2357.248,2371.96,"So why do we start with your total fee and deduct down, rather than start where all the circuits are starting, which is to say, what can be attributed to that frivolous claim, which is the only thing you're entitled to fees from?"
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2371.96,2375.052,"--Well, section 1988 is the answer, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2457.391,2482.844,"Mr. Stancil, the first magistrate to get this case said explicitly that the discovery materials, the discovery in the Federal Court, would be usable in State court proceedings where those materials might aid in obtaining a judgment."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2499.399,2509.473,"--Well, Your Honor, there's a difference between saying these depositions may be used and saying they will be useful or finding that they would be significant to the disposition of the State law claims."
2010.10-114,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2554.526,2557.915,And I assume you agree that discretion can end up going either way?
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2582.238,2586.394,"--Correct, Your Honor, and this goes to the question of whether these standards are administrable."
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2607.987,2615.385,"Counsel, every other circuit except for the Sixth has dealt with the but-for test or some variant of it."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2646.106,2654.8,"Well, Your Honor, I think the -- I think the statement of the but-for test in application will become very -- will be very close to the test that we're espousing here, and here's why."
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2654.8,2668.466,"Espouse your test for me, because I still don't understand it except for flipping through Hensley, but Hensley has a different predicate, which is that plaintiffs are -- if they win, they're entitled to fees."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2668.466,2675.614,The district court has discretion to award fees fairly attribute to the portion of the lawsuit that is declared frivolous.
2010.10-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2725.936,2735.093,"How do you reconcile the test that the Fifth Circuit said it was applying, which is -- seems to be a but-for test, with the fees that were actually awarded here?"
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2735.093,2743.074,"Because the only work done at the time of the fee request was on a section 1983 claim, because the State law claims were not pursued."
2010.10-114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2750.139,2752.398,"Well, that certainly conflicts with the first magistrate."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2757.286,2763.888,"Your Honor, I don't disagree that there are questions and answers in these depositions that will be used in State court, absolutely."
2010.10-114,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2792.579,2794.609,Can I ask you a question I asked Mr. Rosenkranz?
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2812.71,2822.237,"Well, there are several options, and I would be remiss if I didn't specify that those State law claims will be hotly contested when they go to trial next month, and I don't want to leave any misimpression on that."
2010.10-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2871.309,2885.855,"You want to us decide this case on the basis that it was only -- it was only a 1983 claim for the entire time it was in Federal Court until the -- until the very end, right?"
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2885.855,2888.651,"Correct, Your Honor, and that it was not--"
2010.10-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2888.651,2890.114,What -- what good does that do?
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2892.622,2893.752,"--Well, Your Honor, we--"
2010.10-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2893.752,2899.687,What principle of law that's going to help the lower Federal courts would come out of that holding?
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2899.687,2900.9,"--Well, I think--"
2010.10-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2900.9,2911.64,"Whenever you have nothing but a 1983 case, you can give -- and it's frivolous, you can give attorney's fees right up to the limit of the fees expended, right?"
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2911.64,2923.676,"--I think the Court could announce the principle, that would helpful, which is, if the fees are fairly attributable, within the District Court's discretion, to the frivolous claim, they may be awarded, and then say 1983--"
2010.10-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2923.676,2925.639,"Well, I think nobody doubts that, do they?"
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2925.639,2933.667,"--Well, Your Honor, the fees fairly attributable to a 1983 claim, Petitioner says they have to be only attributable to a 1983 claim."
2010.10-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2934.583,2941.231,"Oh, no, but you're saying they were only attributable to a 1983 claim during all of this litigation except the very end."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2941.231,2944.073,"Correct, Your Honor, and we would be happy to win on that basis."
2010.10-114,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2952.638,2960.165,"So you disagree with the statement in the -- in the Court of Appeals opinion about, only for fees that can be distinctly traced?"
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2960.165,2960.849,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2962.045,2964.554,I understood your adversary to agree with that position.
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2967.397,2969.777,"--We almost did, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2979.85,2984.869,"But your argument has focused, in reference to the complaint and all that, on the legal theories."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,2998.118,3000.764,"--Well, because only the 1983 claims were pressed."
2010.10-114,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3030.106,3037.32,"Well, what percentage of the work done has actually been useful to you in defending the State court claims, approximate?"
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3037.32,3046.181,"I'm not in a position to answer that, Your Honor, because I'm not representing these parties in the State court, but I'll concede for purposes of today that some significant portion."
2010.10-114,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3079.51,3084.216,That's disembodying what -- we have a factual scenario here.
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3102.151,3109.715,"--Yes, Your Honor, and we don't -- we don't contest that investigating the facts are relevant to both, but it has to be pressed in Federal court."
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3113.474,3124.214,"I'm not sure what that means, because if you're taking discovery on the State law issues, defamation, extortion, et cetera, you're pressing it."
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3133.122,3134.472,"Well, again, Your Honor--"
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3134.472,3147.108,"Then why would -- if you have a bunch of different claims and the facts support some of the State court actions, why should you be entitled to fees that you would have incurred in State court no matter what?"
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3147.108,3159.757,"--Because the district court here, and in this case, and it may not be in many cases, but in this case the district court found the complaint did not sufficiently allege these State law causes of action to put the defendants on notice that a defense would be required."
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3159.757,3170.747,Did you -- are you seriously contending that the lawyer below didn't understand that the defamation and the extortion claims were part of this case?
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3176.599,3180.405,"Your -- Your Honor, that is precisely what the district court said."
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3180.405,3180.788,--Found?
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3180.788,3192.108,"And again, it says, the court finds that plaintiff failed to allege State tort law violations in the complaint such that defendants were adequately noticed, that a separate defense as to these claims would need to be prepared at the beginning of the litigation."
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3251.224,3269.892,"In answer to Justice Scalia's question, basically the only difference you have with the -- with the Fifth Circuit is that you would say fees fairly attributable to Federal claims as opposed to fees exclusively attributable to Federal claims; is that correct?"
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3269.892,3270.605,"Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3270.605,3280.762,"So your presumption would be that if the fees are -- support both State and Federal claims, you're still entitled to fees?"
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3280.762,3289.622,"But they have to be judged, and this is under the eighth of these Johnson factors, they have to be judged in the context of the overall suit or the overall action to enforce section 1983."
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3289.622,3291.835,I still -- I don't understand what that means.
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3291.835,3309.723,"Well, if we were -- if we had -- if as Petitioner suggests, this really was just an add-on claim, that it was a section 1983 claim, and by the way, you know, here are my breach of contract claims, and, you know, it may also be a taking; and nobody spent any time doing it and nobody spent a whole of lot of -- you know, worried about the taking claim."
2010.10-114,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3309.723,3316.622,You want district courts to determine how important the 1983 claim was in relationship to the State claim?
2010.10-114,1,36641,mark_t_stancil,,3316.622,3319.547,"Correct, Your Honor; I think -- I think that's correct."
2010.10-114,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3335.472,3335.905,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-114,2,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3338.915,3339.861,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2010.10-114,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3451.459,3461.782,"If the Fifth's Circuit's statement -- if the Fifth Circuit's statement of the test it was applying is correct, would you say that that is a discretionary determination?"
2010.10-114,2,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3466.967,3468.429,"Yes, Your Honor, absolutely."
2010.10-114,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3483.391,3491.836,Would you agree an assessment of the relative significance of the frivolous and nonfrivolous claims would also be a factor that would go into that?
2010.10-114,2,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3491.836,3515.575,"--I do not agree, Your Honor, because if you are -- if the defendant is properly in court and properly being forced to do discovery, the relative importance -- what was in their heads, what was motivating them is irrelevant, unless of course apropos of the earlier question, what was going on was they really ratcheted up because they lose sleep over Federal claims more than over State claims."
2010.10-114,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3522.64,3528.491,What if there's a cap on the liability for the nonfrivolous claim but not -- maybe treble damages on the frivolous claim?
2010.10-114,2,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3528.491,3537.519,I think that would be exceptional circumstance under which the district court would be entitled to take into consideration something that's quite a bit more extraordinary.
2010.10-114,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3548.009,3557.62,"I was wondering kind of as a starting point, and I don't know why you would fight so vigorously against the verbal formulation ""fairly attributable""."
2010.10-114,2,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,3578.98,3601.804,"--Well, Your Honor, I -- I actually believe -- if I may answer the question, it is quite a bit easier to apply a but-for test and review it on appeal than it is to apply a test that is just a mishmash of factors over, if which the stakes are high enough, and they will be under Mr. Stancil's rule, there is an enormous incentive to litigate to death."
2010.10-114,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3602.72,3603.683,"Thank you, counsel."
