1981.80-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.717,We will hear arguments next in Widmar against Vincent.
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,5.717,110.378,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as the Court knows, the case at bar presents issues which revolve around the religion clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the re-occurring question of its proper relationship with public education."
1981.80-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,110.378,112.627,Just the religion clauses of the First Amendment?
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,112.627,115.828,"It's our contention that it does, Your Honor."
1981.80-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,115.828,120.234,"How about the First Amendment itself, apart from the religion clauses?"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,120.234,125.356,"Mr. Chief Justice, that is an argument that has been made by the respondents in this case."
1981.80-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,141.538,152.877,"You concede, I take it, for purposes of argument that the entire First Amendment applies with equal force to the states as to the federal government."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,152.877,154.954,"Yes, Your Honor, that's no problem."
1981.80-689,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,228.753,230.956,Would you give me the dates for which they sought.
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,230.956,241.514,"--Justice Blackmun, the dates sought which led to this case were from January through May of 1977."
1981.80-689,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,241.514,245.763,"And prior to that time, had the group met on campus?"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,245.763,257.601,"Your Honor, the facts that were stipulated at the trial indicated that the Cornerstone group had met in university facilities prior to this time."
1981.80-689,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,269.222,274.328,By facilities you mean indoors or outside?
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,274.328,287.556,"Up to this point in time, Justice Blackmun, to my knowledge, the only usage that the respondents made of university facilities was indeed indoors."
1981.80-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.322,343.504,"The university system in Missouri has recognized the right of a gay rights unit, as I understand to meet on the campus and hold discussions and exchange views, has it not?"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,343.504,345.27,"That is true, Justice Rehnquist."
1981.80-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,360.122,374.305,"How about the Young Marxists League, if they had one on the campus, would they be permitted to meet to make attacks on the Democratic system of government and express their views?"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,374.305,390.298,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would assume that unless the meetings were such to advocate the immediate overthrow of the government and were such that would lead to imminent action, it's my belief that those such meetings would be permitted on campus."
1981.80-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,390.298,397.655,"So it's only religious groups that may properly be forbidden to meet on campus, in your view."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,397.655,417.161,"Justice Rehnquist, let me make it clear from the beginning that religious groups... in this case at the University of Missouri, Kansas City... has ten student groups that are recognized, official student groups, which could be said to have some sort of a religious affiliation."
1981.80-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,461.956,475.825,"Well, would you elaborate on the distinction you make between the ten religious groups which are recognized to meet and religious worship or services?"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,475.825,485.665,"Justice Rehnquist, I think we need to keep the case centered around the facts of this particular case."
1981.80-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,538.706,546.11,Could they sign up Jerry Falwell for once a month for a regular appearance on the campus?
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,546.11,571.943,"Without further clarification from this Court and based upon prior decisions of this Court, I would say the fact that... if Mr. Falwell comes in on a regular basis, let's say a monthly basis, depending upon the content of his presentation or his speech, in my mind there would be serious constitutional questions about allowing him to come in on a regular basis."
1981.80-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,571.943,580.299,How about someone like William Kuntzler or someone who had defended one of the groups in the late sixties?
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,580.299,597.871,"Although that individual might be considered by some to be controversial, I do not see that touching on the religious aspect, Again, there's no intent to restrict the freedom of speech of the students or anyone else properly on the campus."
1981.80-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,606.834,612.317,But isn't reading from the Bible a form of freedom of speech?
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,612.317,629.856,"Justice Rehnquist, again, and relying on prior decisions of the Court, this Court has said in the Schempp case and others that the Bible is clearly an instrument of religion."
1981.80-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,671.668,690.769,"Well, what if the program consisted of a reading of, say, four chapters of one of the gospels, followed by a student discussion of the content of those chapter and criticism and exchange and so forth?"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,690.769,707.341,"Based on that hypothetical, Justice Rehnquist, it would be my assumption that such activity would not be prohibited under this regulation, or it does not fall within the facts of the case now before the Court."
1981.80-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,707.341,716.573,In one of the hypotheticals presented you said it would depend upon the content of what the speaker said.
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,732.315,749.871,"Mr. Chief Justice, I am aware of this Court's opinion in Mosley and others, which indicates that content-related restriction is violative of constitutional law."
1981.80-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,832.665,858.843,"How do you distinguish what the Court has said was appropriate in terms of providing books to parochial schools and transportation to and from parochial schools, and that is certainly... the arguments were made that that was an aid of sorts to religion and also tax exemption."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,861.341,866.198,"I do not think those cases are applicable in this case, Mr. Chief Justice."
1981.80-689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,914.867,921.442,--What do you do with the provision of religious services in the military and the Navy and so forth?
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,921.442,946.338,"Justice Stevens, I would address that question by the fact that this Court has spoken often of the fact that if an individual is deprived of religious worship opportunities by something that the government has done; i.e., a soldier in the field, a prisoner--"
1981.80-689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,946.338,947.883,How about a church at Annapolis?
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,947.883,953.788,--A prisoner in prison... let me address your question.
1981.80-689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.545,977.669,"Well, what if the campus is out in the middle of the desert or something like that?"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,977.669,992.069,"To answer your question about Annapolis, I would submit, Justice Stevens, that the military academies, including Annapolis, are special institutions, provided to train our military officers."
1981.80-689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,998.88,1000.395,"Well, it's voluntary, I assume."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1008.97,1009.126,--That's correct.
1981.80-689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.126,1013.889,And the university doesn't either favor or disfavor the group.
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1013.889,1014.17,No.
1981.80-689,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1014.17,1023.557,"Mr. Ayres, the university draws no distinction between religious services in buildings and on its grounds, does it?"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1023.557,1028.445,"Justice Powell, that is a question that will be before the Court."
1981.80-689,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1064.493,1065.961,Your petition covers both.
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1065.961,1066.898,--Right.
1981.80-689,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1082.471,1083.923,May I follow up with this question.
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1093.483,1098.028,"--Justice Powell, the University of Missouri is a constitutionally-established institution."
1981.80-689,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1101.339,1103.369,Where is this one?
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1103.369,1107.414,"This campus which this case arose out of is located in Kansas City, Missouri."
1981.80-689,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1107.414,1115.91,"Well, do you think a religious service could be banned in a public park in Kansas City?"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1122.862,1133.919,"Justice Powell, it's not clear to me from the cases... I don't know that that question has ever been directly answered."
1981.80-689,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1148.164,1155.834,"Let's assume it's exactly like the student building involved here; it's open for all other groups, as your answers to other questions have indicated."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1163.377,1189.227,"--Justice Powell, it would be my opinion, responding to your question, that if it was... if the group involved was seeking to hold religious worship services in the park on a regular basis, to the extent they were sought in this case, it is my opinion that Kansas City, based upon establishment grounds, could prohibit such meetings."
1981.80-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1189.227,1211.029,"What about services which begin at the Lincoln Memorial sometimes with prayers and hymns being sung, and then even more specifically a religious service, the Mass held on the Mall when Pope John Paul II was here several years ago?"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1211.029,1215.481,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think we have tried to address those points in our brief."
1981.80-689,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1280.518,1284.328,How about the Christmas tree on the Mall every Christmas?
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1284.328,1286.516,"Justice Brennan,--"
1981.80-689,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1286.516,1289.5,And the creche.
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1289.5,1303.135,"--I think those questions have been answered to some extent by the fact that the Christmas tree, and again to some extent the creche, have gone beyond the religious significance."
1981.80-689,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1318.629,1327.719,"Mr. Ayres, does it disturb you that members of the Congress of the United States have prayer breakfasts in the National Capitol Building on a regular basis?"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1327.719,1336.075,"Justice Blackmun, when you say prayer breakfast, I guess I'm not quite sure what you mean--"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1336.075,1340.589,"At which Scripture is read, prayers are offered, papers are given."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1340.589,1343.947,"--To being the meeting, Justice Blackmun?"
1981.80-689,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1350.178,1354.675,"Of course, the Chaplain daily gives prayers in each House."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1354.675,1391.161,"--To respond to your question the best way that I may, I think that there are many decisions which indicate that prayer or an acknowledgement of God before a public meeting are suitable in that they serve to set the tone, get the meeting started out in a properly appropriate manner, and I would submit that this situation falls into that category."
1981.80-689,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1391.161,1408.967,"Well, Mr. Ayres, I gather some of us at least have thought that in God we trust above the Speaker's bench and the prayer breakfasts and other exercises of that kind fall into the category of political questions, not judicially reviewable in any event."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1408.967,1410.528,"I think that's right, Justice Brennan."
1981.80-689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1410.528,1422.337,"Mr. Ayres, you suggested with respect to the Mass on the Mall that the distinction is between a regular recurring event, as was involved here, and an incidental or irregular event."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1426.023,1427.898,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1427.898,1432.832,So I really don't think that's a valid distinction for purposes of defending your own regulation.
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1432.832,1442.094,"Well, let me say, Justice Stevens, that again in the context of this case, a one-time meeting was not sought."
1981.80-689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1448.014,1452.277,"I understand, but your regulation would prohibit a one-time meeting, if I understand the record correctly."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1452.277,1457.089,If it was known that the meeting was a religious worship--
1981.80-689,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.089,1462.446,"If people did give you advance notice of exactly what they intended to do, which would seem to be appropriate."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1462.446,1463.274,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1463.274,1479.219,"Mr. Ayres, I assume you were at 10:00 o'clock this morning when the Marshal of the Court in announcing the Court pronounced, in effect, a very short benediction when he said God save the United States and this honorable Court."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1482.656,1486.889,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would argue that it is, it is indeed."
1981.80-689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1523.263,1537.306,"Mr. Ayres, I suggest to you that you... I don't know whether you'll win this case or not, but I would think you could win it without having to claim that if the university allowed these meetings that it would be an establishment."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1591.957,1593.69,"I've tried to answer questions, Justice White."
1981.80-689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.69,1594.971,"Exactly, exactly."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1637.563,1638.141,"Yes, sir."
1981.80-689,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1638.141,1640.671,So why argue about these Ten Commandments.
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1641.796,1642.937,"That's true, Your Honor."
1981.80-689,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1643.998,1646.247,"He didn't get them down, so I don't see how you're going to get them down."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1646.247,1649.964,"Your Honor, it's certainly not my intent to get them down."
1981.80-689,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1649.964,1653.869,"Mr. Ayres, is the Attorney General of Missouri in this case at all?"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1653.869,1655.494,"No, Your Honor."
1981.80-689,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1667.224,1671.612,"Well, is the Office of the General Counsel representing the views of the Attorney General of Missouri?"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1671.612,1672.143,"No, sir."
1981.80-689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1685.919,1695.227,"Well, but you're here... the university is constitutionally organized and the Attorney General is not the lawyer for the university."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1695.227,1696.415,"That's absolutely correct, Justice White."
1981.80-689,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1696.415,1704.412,"And insofar as the state of Missouri is concerned, with respect to the university you are the attorney general."
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1704.412,1705.068,That's right.
1981.80-689,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1705.068,1709.471,Is that clear as crystal?
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1709.471,1712.126,"In our opinion it is, Justice Blackmun."
1981.80-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1754.656,1777.006,"But isn't it a familiar statement from any of our cases that just because the state allows you to exercise rights of free speech in some other place, then you want to exercise them, is not a defense to its refusal to allow you to exercise them where you do want to exercise them?"
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1777.006,1780.38,"Would you repeat your question, Justice Rehnquist?"
1981.80-689,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1780.38,1780.724,Yes.
1981.80-689,0,42365,ted_d_ayres,,1808.947,1818.412,"Some of the cases of this Court, Justice Rehnquist, have indicated that because a right is available somewhere else, you cannot foreclose that right at another place."
1981.80-689,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1836.297,1841.997,Mr. Smart?
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,1841.997,1864.816,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I want to just remind the Court here that as the Court is well aware, the university has the burden in this case of justifying this regulation, On its face, the regulation restricts freedom of expression in what would appear from the very facts to be a public forum."
1981.80-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1882.87,1892.444,"Could the university preclude the use of those meeting room for all purposes if it wanted to, except classes of the university?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,1892.444,1940.207,"The university... I think this Court, if that case were to come before it, the Court would have to look at the facts of the case and see, number one, if a free exercise claim was asserted, did this constitute a burden on the free exercise of religion because of the nature of the campus or did it inhibit academic freedom of the students and freedom to inquire because they had no opportunity to have meetings or to invite outside speakers on any subject, and the court might well find that such a rule that completely forbids any special interest group meetings might be unconstitutional on those grounds."
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1941.191,1944.05,"Even if justified, Mr. Smart, by a compelling state interest?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,1944.05,1945.642,"--Well, that is the key, Your Honor."
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1945.642,1948.189,"Yes, but it has to be a compelling state interest, I take it."
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,1948.189,1950.735,"It has to be a compelling state interest, Your Honor."
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1950.735,1963.227,Did I correctly understand one of Mr. Ayres' arguments to be that the compelling state interest in this instance was the desire to avoid any of the complications that might lead to the establishment of a religion?
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,1966.993,1971.367,I think that the establishment clause could be a compelling state interest.
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1997.84,2017.004,"Even so, I gather, if I understand Mr. Ayres argument, it is that... I know, but to permit this sort of thing is to expose the university to possible problems under the establishment clause of our being accused of favoring religion and therefore violating the establishment clause."
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2021.628,2023.143,"That's his argument apparently, Your Honor."
1981.80-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.357,2054.771,"Let me ask you, suppose a group of students organize a denomination of a particular religion on the campus, and they say well, we have to have someplace regularly to meet like others."
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2085.851,2087.101,"Well, Your Honor, I might not necessarily be making the same argument."
1981.80-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2089.288,2091.537,"Well, you know all the facts right now."
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2091.537,2091.99,Okay.
1981.80-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.488,2097.097,"No, just answer my question."
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2097.097,2101.846,--It will be basically the same argument provided--
1981.80-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.846,2108.545,"And you say the university would be required to let them hold regular church services, use their building as a church."
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2109.779,2112.184,--Provided they were treated as any other special interest group.
1981.80-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2112.184,2112.622,Exactly.
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2121.086,2124.398,"That's exactly what we're saying, provided they were treated like any other special interest group."
1981.80-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2124.398,2145.094,"Well, the university, as Justice Brennan suggests your colleague is arguing, the university doesn't want to get that close to religion, and it wants to stay more neutral, and it doesn't want to have its facilities... the university would be paying the light, the heat, everything else."
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2145.094,2145.906,Well--
1981.80-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2145.906,2152.513,No one charges enough to student groups to pay depreciation or anything.
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2152.513,2156.495,"--We don't deny there would be some financial aid here, we don't deny that at all."
1981.80-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2157.62,2168.646,Would there be anything to interfere with the university saying that there would a fixed fee for the use of the room by any group including this church group that is hypothesized?
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2168.646,2176.425,--There would be absolutely nothing wrong with a regular fixed fee that was applied equally across the board to all special interest groups.
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2236.058,2246.273,"May I ask, Mr. Smart, there is a rather rigid Missouri constitutional provision, is there not, dealing with--"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2246.273,2246.944,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2246.944,2249.505,--Precisely what does that provide?
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2249.505,2250.115,Okay.
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2264.031,2270.248,"Now, do those provisions add anything to the federal constitutional argument that Mr. Ayres has been making?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2271.59,2274.479,"In this case, Your Honor, I do not believe they do."
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2322.444,2327.582,"In any event, I gather the issue we have here has not been raised before the Missouri state court under--"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2327.582,2339.875,"--That's right, Your Honor, it's not been decided in the state of Missouri that individuals cannot use public property for religion the same way they can use... the same way other groups can use that public property."
1981.80-689,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2339.875,2356.259,--What if the Missouri Constitution contained a clause saying that there shall be no requirement of freedom of speech or that the state shall allow freedom of speech in its state and it shall regulate it as it sees fit.
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2368.519,2379.563,"There is a Missouri Constitutional provision, if I understand your question... there is a Missouri Constitutional provision that grants freedom of speech to the citizens of Missouri, the same as the federal constitution."
1981.80-689,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2417.031,2430.291,But what if a state had a constitutional provision diametrically opposite to the First Amendment that said the state shall be able to freely regulate discussion of public topics?
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2437.867,2455.049,"Well, Your Honor, the Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the land and no state is entitled to legislate away fundamental freedoms, and particularly in the area of religion and speech."
1981.80-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.201,2466.09,Since 1925.
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2466.09,2468.354,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.80-689,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2468.354,2485.567,"Mr. Smart, you have argued, I believe, that by not permitting the group to meet on campus for its services, that some stigma attached in the minds of the students by virtue of that."
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2497.546,2502.794,It does not imply approval.
1981.80-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2580.231,2593.929,"Mr. Ayres has conceded that the Young Communists League or the Marxist Society could meet, and surely, the university wouldn't undertake to sponsor or endorse them."
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2593.929,2599.99,"I trust they would not undertake to do that, and I think that also relates to the financial aid argument here."
1981.80-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2611.673,2617.092,Mr. Ayres says that these are spot times and it's not regular.
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2617.092,2623.604,"Well, I don't know that there's any evidence in the record as to whether they're regular or not."
1981.80-689,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2624.964,2628.181,"But that man from India didn't come over here a very week, did he?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2628.181,2628.915,"--No, that's correct."
1981.80-689,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2695.669,2704.775,"Mr. Smart, does the university have a specific regulation with respect to non-campus groups; those that may come in casually?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2704.775,2713.537,"The university's policy, as I understand it and Mr. Ayres can correct me if I'm wrong, is that the university allows non-student groups to come in and use the facilities."
1981.80-689,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2717.098,2718.504,On an ad hoc basis.
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2718.504,2719.473,--On an ad hoc basis.
1981.80-689,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2719.473,2723.111,And is there any specific regulation?
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2723.111,2738.652,"I'm sure there's a regulation that makes it available, I'm not familiar with that regulation, other than the one that says they cannot be used for religious services by any student or non-student group."
1981.80-689,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2738.652,2747.258,"Is it conceded in this case, or does the record show that no outside religious group would be allowed to hold any sort of meeting on the campus?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2747.258,2769.234,"Well, I think the facts would show... and Mr. Ayres can correct me if I'm wrong... that prior to the invocation of this regulation in January 1977, probably religious groups were... in fact, I know religious groups were using, outside religious groups to some extent, were using the facilities there."
1981.80-689,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2769.234,2771.984,Outside groups.
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2771.984,2778.167,"Outside groups, apparently on a payment basis, on an irregular basis."
1981.80-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2779.589,2783.525,And then the university decided to change its policy.
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2783.525,2807.969,"The university enacted this regulation in 1972 but began enforcing it in January of 1977, and in this case it is significant that it was applied not only to the use of the buildings, but also, to the use of the grounds for a small group Bible study, as was stipulated in the facts at the trial level in the case."
1981.80-689,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2807.969,2818.542,"Would you agree that a university has more control over the use of its campus than a city does over a public square, provided the control is exercised uniformly?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2818.542,2822.415,"I think that there could well be a distinction in a given case, Your Honor."
1981.80-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2839.612,2852.279,"But whatever the degree of control, counsel, could the university discriminate as between and among groups on the basis of the content of what took place in the meeting?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2852.279,2853.872,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2865.585,2869.974,"Yes, but in Healy we didn't have any implication of the religion clauses."
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2869.974,2870.614,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2870.614,2871.848,"Well, doesn't that make a difference?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2874.581,2879.782,It doesn't a void the establishment clause issue for us; we've still go to get around that.
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2879.782,2880.22,Yes.
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2880.22,2882.984,Which I believe we do.
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2930.325,2941.57,"I suppose, too, Mr. Smart, in applying this regulation somebody in the university has to make a judgment whether a given group is a religious group, does it not?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2948.005,2948.583,"That's right, Your Honor."
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2948.583,2950.488,"Does that implicate some establishment problems, too?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2951.894,2954.706,We believe that that is an additional factor.
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2968.45,2970.73,"Is Scientology a religion, for example?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2970.73,2982.584,--I think that my inability to answer that very well is an example of the difficulties that... I would suspect it probably is a religion.
1981.80-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2983.975,2989.081,"Some courts have held that it is not, but there's no uniformity."
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,2990.581,2992.268,--I would suspect that's correct.
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3032.36,3041.108,"I take it, for example, a Roman Catholic Church couldn't have a Mass under this regulation, but what about the Holy Name Society having a meeting?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3041.108,3050.212,"--If the Holy Name Society were going to only have a business meeting, then presumably, the university would let them."
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3051.275,3056.521,"But the university would have to decide whether it was a religious meeting or not, I take it, to apply this regulation."
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3056.521,3071.531,"--Also, you have an interesting question, whether a business meeting is not an integral part of the activities of the Holy Name Society, which would probably be a pervasively religious group, and we get back to some of the Lemon vs. Kurtzman thinking."
1981.80-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3071.531,3090.994,"But if the university rents its facilities to off-campus groups for a fee, your position would be, I take it, that if the Catholic Church wanted to rent one of its buildings on a regular basis to hold its church services, that the university would have to rent it."
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3090.994,3092.571,"Well, we think--"
1981.80-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3092.571,3094.365,"I've asked you this question before, I take it."
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3094.365,3099.88,--Non-students may stand in a little different footing than students because--
1981.80-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3099.88,3109.329,You mean the university could rent to some outside organizations but refuse to rent a building to the Catholic Church?
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3109.329,3115.811,"--Non-students as a group may stand on a little different footing, but where the university has opened up a forum--"
1981.80-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3115.811,3119.763,So your answer is they must rent the building to the Catholic Church.
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3119.763,3121.308,"--Our answer is that they must, Your Honor, that's correct."
1981.80-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3121.308,3127.228,"But they could exclude all off-campus groups, could they not?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3127.228,3129.821,I believe they could probably exclude all off-campus groups.
1981.80-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3134.867,3140.254,Could there be any question that the university could say that the facilities are limited to student body groups?
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3140.254,3143.534,"I don't have any question about that, maybe the Court does."
1981.80-689,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3145.94,3153.546,Is there any question that the university could give an advanced degree in one or more religions?
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3153.546,3174.756,"I know there are a number of state universities, and the University of Missouri has an interesting arrangement with the Missouri School of Religion, which is a separate entity but grants degrees, I believe, from the University of Missouri."
1981.80-689,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3187.125,3201.026,"Mr. Smart, do you see any differences between the circumstances here involving a university and the use of its premises as opposed to that of a high school or a grammar school?"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3201.026,3225.797,"I think when we look at the fundamental principles underlying the First Amendment, the principles of volunteerism, neutrality, we may find the younger we get... for instance, in Stein vs. Oskinsky, a case in the briefs which was a kindergarten class where some parents said we want our kids to be able to have voluntary prayer in the kindergarten."
1981.80-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3252.506,3258.034,Has this Court made a distinction between universities and high schools and grade schools already?
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3258.034,3287.101,"This Court has many times in its aid to education cases drawn a distinction, particularly where the aid is going to a university which is church-related, and the Court has noticed that the chances of that church-related institution using that to indoctrinate or impose its beliefs on students was very limited, very small."
1981.80-689,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3354.293,3362.447,Do we have anything comparable to the tax exemption history in the way of a custom of allowing religious meetings--
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3362.447,3363.243,"--Yes, Your Honor, we do."

1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3421.313,3421.454,Yes.
1981.80-689,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3432.152,3434.495,"So that's not really a very good argument, is it, for your--"
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3434.495,3437.885,"--Well, I think it's a very good argument when we're saying what is the history."
1981.80-689,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3455.159,3460.001,--I thought you were saying that what Thomas Jefferson did is the law today.
1981.80-689,1,32915,james_m_smart_jr,,3460.001,3463.561,"Well, we'd have to look at the exact facts of that."
1981.80-689,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3710.181,3713.523,Do you have anything further?
1981.80-689,2,42365,ted_d_ayres,,3713.523,3738.076,"I would like to say first of all that with regard to Thomas Jefferson, I might point out for the Court if it's interested in history that when Thomas Jefferson was a member of the Board of Visitors at William and Mary when it was a state institution in 1779, Thomas Jefferson was instrumental in having religious instruction outlawed at William and Mary."
1981.80-689,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3741.669,3746.151,"Well, religious instruction might be a little different from allowing a religious meeting."
