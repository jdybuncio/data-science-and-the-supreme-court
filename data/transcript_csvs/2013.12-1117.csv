2013.12-1117,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.03,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 12-1117, Plumhoff v. Rickard."
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,6.998,9.06,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1117,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,57.633,69.176,I thought it said -- did it not say in its opinion that there was room for disagreement or whether this was reasonable or not?
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,71.752,79.015,"They could not conclude that it was reasonable as a matter of law is the statement I recall, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-1117,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,114.985,123.701,"Would the court, in your view, ever have an occasion to decide whether conduct of this nature violates the Fourth Amendment?"
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,138.961,149.096,"Well, I mean, we've argued, of course, in our briefs, Justice Ginsburg, that it should be decided in this case, although today we're emphasizing the second prong."
2013.12-1117,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,185.753,191.804,Isn't it the case that the court has discretion to reach the second prong if it wants to?
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,200.271,204.971,"The way I read Pearson, Justice Alito, no."
2013.12-1117,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,221.355,222.448,"No, that wasn't my question."
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,246.439,247.001,--Oh.
2013.12-1117,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,308.351,316.099,Is there -- is there any situation in which the application of lethal force during a high-speed case in your view would not be justified?
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,316.099,316.738,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1117,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,316.738,317.956,Give me an example?
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,330.796,334.123,"Well, I'll give you one circumstance."
2013.12-1117,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,405.14,406.859,"Yes, I'd like you to talk about that."
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,406.859,424.413,"Well, the -- below in the Sixth Circuit, the Petitioners were willing to concede any alleged factual disputes, not legal dispute, but factual dispute, in the light most favorable to the Respondent."
2013.12-1117,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,438.922,454.73,"And is that -- is that how you think the jurisdictional question should be resolved, that whenever -- as you know, there's -- there's a disagreement in the courts of appeals as to what you do when there are claims that there are factual disputes."
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,490.824,500.337,"--Only to the extent supportable by the record, as Your Honor held -- as this Court held, rather, in Footnote A of Scott v. Harris."
2013.12-1117,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,502.993,506.304,"Well, you would say genuine factual disputes."
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,515.409,537.587,"--I think it wastes judicial resources if there is not true genuineness with respect to a particular fact, if there is no support for it in the record and clearly established, the argument has been raised for the court not to go ahead, assume jurisdiction and assume the facts in the light most favorable to the extent supportable by the record, Your Honor."
2013.12-1117,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.587,539.571,And -- and how does that work out here?
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,539.571,543.274,"In this case, I -- respectfully, I don't think it's very important."
2013.12-1117,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,565.107,593.097,"You would say that it doesn't really matter whether he bumped the police cruisers when he was finally cornered, whether he tried to back up into one of the officers, that all of that is just excrescences, that it was enough to justify the shooting that he was driving at 100 miles an hour, swerving around the road, endangering human life and would likely continue that if they let him to get away?"
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,593.097,594.236,"Two responses, Your Honor."
2013.12-1117,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,610.933,611.65,Had admitted what?
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,611.65,622.476,"Had admitted that Officer Gardner's car was, in fact, bumped by Respondent decedent's car, that the cars were rocking back and forth, that the front wheels were spinning."
2013.12-1117,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,646.919,649.605,"Well, he does in his -- in his briefing here."
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,649.605,652.026,He -- he takes issue with characterizations.
2013.12-1117,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,717.655,744.691,"Assuming -- assuming that at some point in this case, either now or on remand, it's appropriate and necessary for us to state -- set forth what the rule ought to be, what effect, if any, do you give to the fact that there was a passenger in the car, a passenger who apparently was not involved in any illegal activity?"
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,744.691,748.721,The passenger did not make Mr. Rickard less dangerous.
2013.12-1117,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,755.969,758.499,But it makes the police reaction more dangerous.
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,758.499,759.546,It does.
2013.12-1117,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.647,792.219,"I could see how the passenger could complain, but -- but I can't see how the -- how the -- the criminal fleeing felon who put the passenger in danger can say, you shouldn't have shot because you -- oh, you hurt my passenger."
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,797.81,798.607,Precisely.
2013.12-1117,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,815.788,817.038,Did Allen bring a suit?
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,817.038,818.007,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-1117,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,818.007,820.037,And was that settled out of court or something?
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,820.037,820.662,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-1117,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,823.709,824.404,"Oh, it remains."
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,824.404,828.276,"And the issue there, of course, is under the Fourth Amendment, the ""shocks the conscience"" standard."
2013.12-1117,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,847.667,848.021,Yes.
2013.12-1117,0,62289,michael_mosley,,859.349,861.302,"Well, it's interesting."
2013.12-1117,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,976.662,977.74,"Thank you, Mr. Mosley."
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,984.753,986.58,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1117,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1024.268,1036.388,"Mr. Bash, could I go back to Justice Ginsburg's question, because this is an area in which there's no alternative way really to develop legal standards other than by doing it in these kinds of cases."
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1052.819,1060.331,"I think the general point is correct, and as we say in our brief, it would hinder the development of constitutional law if courts never reached the merits question."
2013.12-1117,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1112.359,1124.682,"Mr. Bash, that question about the development of the underlying law, that's an issue that we faced and decided when we overturned the prior rule that there was a particular order of battle and you had to decide the Constitutional issue first, isn't it?"
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1124.682,1126.072,"That's true, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-1117,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1154.14,1156.326,"They -- they have in fact sued the municipality in this case, haven't they?"
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1156.326,1156.731,They -- they have.
2013.12-1117,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1189.812,1202.229,"Could I ask -- could I go back to a question the Chief asked earlier, which is, is the use of deadly force always permitted in a high-speed chase?"
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1202.229,1203.979,--We don't--
2013.12-1117,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1203.979,1211.131,"Let's assume a set of facts that's different from here, that they had surrounded the car and it had not moved."
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1219.596,1224.532,"--Well, the use of deadly force is justified to protect injury to the public or to the officers."
2013.12-1117,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1234.013,1236.23,Could have been in a ditch or something?
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1236.23,1240.433,--and there's no argument that the officers were in danger -- or maybe the vehicle is disabled -- no.
2013.12-1117,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.078,1268.811,"Mr. Bash, what's the government's position on the jurisdictional question?"
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1268.811,1271.357,We think there is subject matter jurisdiction in this case.
2013.12-1117,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1330.433,1330.527,Yes.
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1340.813,1342.345,"--As I understood Johnson v. Jones, it said that."
2013.12-1117,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1357.026,1357.838,I know that.
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1360.9,1370.879,"--Well, like you said in Johnson v. Jones, we think that Johnson adopted the incorrect position, and if it was properly presented in a case, we would ask that the Court reconsider the precedent."
2013.12-1117,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1374.394,1381.017,"Is your point that if Johnson -- is your point that if Johnson remains on the book, there's no jurisdiction?"
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1381.017,1389.794,"No, there is jurisdiction in this case, because on the undisputed facts it was not clearly established in 2004 in the relevant circuits that these officers could not use deadly force."
2013.12-1117,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1404.694,1407.911,"Yes, but Johnson involved only disputed facts."
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1426.856,1442.21,"If the Court were to hold that on a core sort of qualified immunity appeal that actually raises the question about clearly established, that appellate courts have jurisdiction to consider subsidiary factual questions of the sort that I think you're referring to, we would agree with that position."
2013.12-1117,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.21,1442.569,Okay.
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1453.472,1453.892,Correct.
2013.12-1117,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1460.952,1462.64,"Mr. Bash, could I ask you a question?"
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1490.206,1491.971,Let me start with the latter.
2013.12-1117,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1515.822,1516.04,It is a little bit weird.
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1528.924,1530.034,That's true.
2013.12-1117,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1567.134,1567.796,The degree of force.
2013.12-1117,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1567.796,1568.242,--the degree of force.
2013.12-1117,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1590.483,1591.545,"Thank you, Mr. Bash."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1597.653,1601.369,"Chief Justice Roberts, may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1117,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1634.856,1635.622,I'm sorry.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1653.71,1654.507,--The last 12.
2013.12-1117,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1654.507,1655.579,The last 12.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1655.997,1656.559,The first--
2013.12-1117,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1656.559,1657.228,--divide it--
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1657.228,1657.956,--the first three were.
2013.12-1117,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1657.956,1658.309,--between 3 and 12.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1658.309,1664.651,"And that's one of the points I would like to make, Justice Sotomayor, is that we have to separate the shooting sequences in this case."
2013.12-1117,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1670.664,1672.508,So why do we have all these other officers in here?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1675.366,1680.05,And that issue has not been asked at the district court.
2013.12-1117,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1695.404,1698.371,Go back to -- let's take the sequences.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1706.744,1707.556,--Okay.
2013.12-1117,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1732.421,1735.282,"Well, what do you think the officers should have done at that point?"
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1774.623,1787.868,"The first part of your question brings in the first sequence when Officer Plumhoff shoots the first three shots, and you reference, Justice Alito, the statement that he is trying to get him to get out of the car, show his hands, etcetera."
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.597,1805.47,The car is still trying to escape.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1816.732,1816.794,That--
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.794,1819.948,Is he trying to get away at that point or not?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1819.948,1825.104,--You can't tell because he is up -- he is bumper to bumper with the Gardner car.
2013.12-1117,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1827.181,1827.916,What do you mean?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1829.083,1831.943,"Well, we don't know."
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1868.196,1870.946,He had just -- he had just exited the interstate.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1870.946,1871.571,Yes.
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1871.571,1874.762,And so isn't that a good reason for putting your brakes on?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1877.199,1877.645,"No, no, no."
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.824,1915.287,"Mr. Smith, I was -- I was surprised to read what you said in your -- in your brief on page 25: At a minimum, reasonable minds could differ on the issue of the Petitioners' objective reasonableness."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1919.054,1921.586,"--I respectfully submit no, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1921.586,1929.502,"You say that, even though what they did was arguably reasonable, right--"
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1929.502,1931.579,That is--
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.579,1933.721,--immunity does not apply?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1933.721,1948.107,"--That statement, not prefaced correctly and perhaps inartfully, is simply saying this: That if you use the Rule 56 standard to view the facts in the light most favorable and thus you creat a jury question, reasonable minds can differ with the jury."
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.012,1960.758,"We don't it to the jury about whether, you know, whether the police officers violated the Fourth Amendment or not."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1987.691,1988.653,--It says at a minimum.
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.262,1990.522,At a minimum.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,1992.386,1996.885,"--That's addressing the constitutional issue, not the clearly established issue."
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1996.885,1998.647,I don't care what it's addressing.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2005.511,2006.693,And it -- no.
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2007.615,2008.524,I think you ought to take it back.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2008.524,2014.983,"--any time there is an issue, any time that there is a genuine issue of material fact, it can be resolved either way."
2013.12-1117,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2014.983,2024.949,"Well, objective reasonableness is a -- is at least a mixed issue of law and fact, and it seems to me Justice Scalia is correct."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2034.585,2037.32,That's not what that was intended to convey.
2013.12-1117,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2077.288,2084.222,"But I thought the reasonableness of a Fourth Amendment seizure was an objective question, not a subjective question."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2084.222,2085.331,It is an objective question.
2013.12-1117,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2085.331,2088.518,So why does it matter what reason he subjectively had?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2088.518,2100.434,He has to have some justification of danger under objective reasonableness to make the decision to use deadly force.
2013.12-1117,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2107.758,2107.943,"Well, I know."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2132.011,2133.152,I believe it would not be.
2013.12-1117,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2133.152,2139.415,Initiated by the fact by the officer who used the force had a different motive?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2139.415,2140.321,No.
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.741,2161.241,Such as?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2161.425,2165.675,"You're standing right there beside the car, you can -- you can disable the car with the gun."
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2167.682,2171.621,Are officers -- are officers trained to use their weapons to shoot tires?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2171.621,2186.162,--They're trained to -- they are trained to use weapons and they are trained to use -- these officers trained to use all safer alternatives before using deadly force.
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2186.162,2190.506,"Well, are they trained -- are they trained to use their weapons to shoot out the tires of fleeing cars?"
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2195.567,2200.425,"It is more appropriate, I would submit, than -- than shooting the person."
2013.12-1117,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2219.48,2220.011,Mr. Smith--
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2220.011,2220.791,They didn't block him.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2224.415,2225.977,--But they -- my point is they could have.
2013.12-1117,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.049,2246.235,"I mean, when I look at the film, I thought well, sure, he's going back to the highway."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2292.56,2299.009,"--Well, it is clearly established that the danger itself has to be the justification for the deadly force."
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2301.79,2308.663,"--That's too general a rule, and our cases hold that you cannot appeal to a very general rule to say the law is clear."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2317.284,2328.545,"--Well, shooting out fires, blocking, PIT maneuver as was discussed in Scott v. Harris, police are trained in alternative methods."
2013.12-1117,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.545,2330.731,Is there -- what is there in the record?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2369.512,2376.867,"Well, the issue still -- the threshold issue is the choice of using deadly force based on the danger."
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2406.123,2410.074,Let's say there's only one police officer chasing this fellow.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2426.583,2433.955,"It is going to depend, as this Court has said and other courts have said many times, on the factual context at that time and--"
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2433.955,2435.033,I've given you all the facts.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2439.593,2443.749,--The one fact that we haven't talked about is where he is at the time.
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2448.387,2452.463,We're at the -- let's start with the same place that he was at in this case.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2452.463,2458.007,"And -- and the scenario is, as I understand it, we've had the same chase--"
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2458.007,2464.38,"Everything is the same except there's one police officer and he goes off the interstate at that point; the same thing happens, but there's only one."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2478.843,2486.48,"--And since we've got two sequences here, I'm assuming we're talking about the second sequence, and the answer would clearly be no, because--"
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2486.48,2488.23,Not two sequences whatever.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2499.944,2504.878,"--In this case, the first three shots occurred--"
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2504.878,2505.378,"No, no."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2507.94,2513.829,"--But in the -- in the hypothetical case, if you assume that he takes off, the answer would still be no--"
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2513.829,2515.733,No.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2515.733,2530.822,"--because in order to shoot him, you are shooting at a heavily populated residential area, at oncoming traffic and you're endangering way more people by the ballistics of 15 shots and the potential for killing the driver who can do damage with the vehicle."
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2530.822,2534.82,Is there any circumstance in which lethal force is appropriate once the officer has stopped the car?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2534.82,2536.506,Certainly.
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2536.506,2537.898,"Well, when?"
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2537.898,2540.427,"Well, if the person is armed."
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2541.63,2542.785,No.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2543.551,2545.207,--If they drive straight at the officer.
2013.12-1117,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2551.08,2556.39,What if the situation is that the officer has -- has this choice.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2570.51,2572.866,It's going--
2013.12-1117,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2572.866,2576.27,Your answer is they have to let the -- they -- they can use lethal force?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2578.576,2585.987,--Depends on the context of the circumstances and whether the danger is sufficient to justify the use of deadly force.
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2585.987,2598.92,"The danger is he is going to be going 100 miles an hour, okay, that the chase up to now has been the way your client's chase was, in which he endangered a lot of other people, forced cars off the road, and so forth."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2611.945,2617.641,You could not as he is driving away because now you're endangering -- you're actually endangering the people that you say you're trying to protect.
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2617.641,2618.0,"No, no."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2620.255,2621.661,If there is nobody around--
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2621.661,2622.504,There is nobody around.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2626.721,2634.235,"--Under Scott v. Harris, I would say that -- that -- that you could because in Scott they had the road clear, blocked--"
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2634.235,2635.441,"Of course, we -- you know--"
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2635.441,2636.748,--and they weren't going to endanger anyone else.
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2636.748,2639.661,--You're just not willing to give answers.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2669.181,2676.037,"Smith v. Cupp, McKaslin v. Wilkins, going back to Garner, and all of the case--"
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2676.037,2676.846,So some of--
2013.12-1117,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2676.846,2679.006,How do you distinguish Brosseau?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2679.006,2680.83,--In several ways.
2013.12-1117,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2684.942,2686.05,This is the single--
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2686.05,2686.925,--And -- and -- and--
2013.12-1117,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2686.925,2698.499,--This is a single police officer trying to stop a fleeing suspect whose only activity was a reported fight in a residential neighborhood.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2698.499,2699.559,--Yes.
2013.12-1117,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2722.542,2723.448,But that goes back--
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2723.448,2724.977,--and there was no passenger.
2013.12-1117,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2724.977,2731.209,"--That goes back to my 12-shot sequence, which I still have a problem with."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2751.966,2753.294,"Well, he--"
2013.12-1117,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2753.294,2756.512,--to escape them when they finally get back into their cars?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2756.512,2765.478,"--It -- it may be more suspicious, but the decision at that point is going to endanger the life of the passenger, and those bullets did not discriminate."
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2796.355,2802.54,"--Was she trying to get out of the car when -- when he was trapped there and, you know, surrounded by the police car?"
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2802.54,2803.602,No indication of that.
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2803.602,2804.821,She didn't try to get out of the car.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2818.285,2820.377,"Yeah, there is no record about that."
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2820.377,2825.515,No -- I thought that there was some indication that he had drugs.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2825.515,2826.999,There was contraband in the car.
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2828.931,2829.26,Yes.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2830.979,2831.753,Well--
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2831.753,2832.987,And she might have been a cohort of that.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2837.277,2844.492,"--I don't know that she had in the four seconds' time to get out of the car before the shooting began, but--"
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2844.492,2856.081,"Well, I'd think you'd think pretty quick in a situation like that, where this guy has been driving you on the highway at 100 miles an hour, swerving into and away from police cars."
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2858.878,2864.687,--What -- what is the legal significance of the number of shots?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2871.419,2880.976,"--I think primarily only because on that second sequence, you're shooting at the public just as much as you're shooting at the driver of that car."
2013.12-1117,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2880.976,2882.648,But I'm not clear how that works either.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2897.08,2898.658,I think all--
2013.12-1117,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2898.658,2906.171,I -- I don't understand how -- how this bears on -- on the -- on the question of whether or not -- as to the reasonableness as to the driver.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2906.171,2919.775,"--The cases that have sustained qualified immunity have done so in part, and in many cases large part, because of the propriety of the decision based on the protection of innocent people."
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2938.079,2946.622,"But even -- well, again, what standing does the driver have to complain about the threat to civilians who are in the area?"
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2946.622,2951.058,"--It -- it -- the question is different than that, Chief Justice Roberts."
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2970.131,2974.127,"Of course it's a factor, but is it a factor that your clients can take advantage of?"
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,2995.575,3005.848,"There is no question that Mr. Rickard's conduct was unreasonable and he has culpability, but the issue is not him taking advantage of it."
2013.12-1117,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3023.554,3026.262,What do you say clearly establishes that?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3038.553,3044.773,There is no case that says specifically if there is a passenger there don't use a weapon.
2013.12-1117,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3074.836,3083.098,"As to the number of shots, even with all the shots that were fired, Mr. Rickard still was able to drive away for a short distance."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3083.098,3083.401,Yes.
2013.12-1117,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3083.401,3084.257,Isn't that right?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3084.257,3084.831,Correct.
2013.12-1117,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3084.831,3089.037,So what does that do to the argument that too many shots were fired?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3089.037,3092.395,It's not so much that it was too many.
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3115.233,3119.56,There are two ways in which the public is endangered.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3146.605,3160.064,"Or, Chief Justice Roberts, a greater danger by a car driving down the road with a dead driver behind the wheel, totally out of control, and that almost happened in this case, as you see in the video."
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3163.203,3170.017,So you're saying they can't apply lethal force because they may not be successful in -- in killing the driver?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3170.017,3175.061,Using it on a moving car in a circumstance like that is--
2013.12-1117,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3175.061,3178.026,I thought the car wasn't moving when the shots were first fired?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3178.026,3180.512,"--On the second -- in the second sequence, the car is moving."
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3180.512,3181.062,Okay.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3193.959,3194.271,If--
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3194.271,3196.443,Is that the principle you say is clearly established?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3196.443,3197.27,--If doing so--
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3197.27,3199.067,"My goodness, they do it all the time."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3209.422,3210.563,--In a--
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3210.563,3213.377,And that is -- that is not just your view.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3216.841,3221.623,--That was even referenced from -- in the Scott case.
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3229.725,3231.819,"And that's what Scott holds, that you can--"
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3231.819,3234.2,"--It doesn't hold that, but it references that distinction in Vaughan v. Cox."
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3234.2,3234.237,--What does hold it?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3251.358,3257.792,Vaughan v. Cox talks about not shooting someone in a moving car and that is re--
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3257.792,3258.655,Talks about it?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3258.655,3259.824,--And Scott.
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3259.824,3260.996,Talks about it?
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3260.996,3266.312,And that's -- which brings up a good point.
2013.12-1117,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3326.671,3339.136,"What about the statement that there was a police manual that says once you authorize to shoot, you can continue shooting until the job is done?"
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3339.136,3350.911,"I don't quarrel with that except to the extent, in this case, in that second sequence, you're endangering other people other than the person that you're trying to stop."
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3383.7,3390.317,What facts do you contest and we'll just subtract them from the facts that we consider.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3401.954,3405.873,We challenge that the car was a danger at the time the shooting stopped.
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3408.903,3409.657,That's not a fact.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3421.039,3425.62,--If we talk first about the chase part before the stop--
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3425.62,3425.995,Right.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3425.995,3434.412,"--then there is contested facts about whether or not there were assaults because the video does not confirm that, and the officer's own testimony was--"
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3434.412,3434.873,Okay.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3436.742,3442.113,"--Then when we get to the stop, they say that he rammed the cars three times."
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3443.929,3444.518,All right.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3447.052,3454.704,They -- they contend that Officer Ellis was in danger and that that was a justification for the shooting.
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3456.51,3459.326,Let's assume -- we'll assume he was not in danger.
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3460.048,3461.879,--Officer -- we contest that Officer--
2013.12-1117,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3461.879,3472.291,"But we -- we are still left with a very dangerous man careening down the road, who is surrounded by police cars and still tries to get away to continue his careening."
2013.12-1117,2,62291,gary_k_smith,,3479.004,3480.063,--And he didn't?

2013.12-1117,3,62289,michael_mosley,,3489.41,3490.55,Very briefly.
2013.12-1117,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3490.55,3496.531,"Just to clarify one thing, Mr. Mosley."
2013.12-1117,3,62289,michael_mosley,,3501.842,3519.303,"The three shots were fired, if you look at dash-cam Unit 286, at 12:17: 42 is where the strikes of the car begin and the the shot begins -- the first shot of the three begins at 12:17: 45, three seconds after the first contact was made."
2013.12-1117,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3519.303,3520.975,I'm sorry.

2013.12-1117,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3523.199,3526.329,We don't care about the seconds.
2013.12-1117,3,62289,michael_mosley,,3526.329,3526.817,Okay.
2013.12-1117,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3526.817,3528.315,Place it in the context.
2013.12-1117,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3528.315,3528.378,Yes.
2013.12-1117,3,62289,michael_mosley,,3538.109,3539.593,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-1117,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3556.867,3557.817,Got it.
2013.12-1117,3,62289,michael_mosley,,3557.817,3566.366,"The Petitioners did raise in their brief in support below that Officers Forthman, Officers Ellis and Officers Evans did not use deadly force."
2013.12-1117,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3604.057,3613.453,"Mr. Mosley, just out of curiosity, does -- does this police department actually have rules for what a police officer is supposed to do when there's a fleeing vehicle?"
2013.12-1117,3,62289,michael_mosley,,3620.715,3628.307,"--Justice Kagan, at Volume II of the -- the Joint Appendix, there are such rules."
2013.12-1117,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3635.037,3636.956,What were they?
2013.12-1117,3,62289,michael_mosley,,3638.567,3644.629,"Well, they're fairly -- fairly lengthy."
2013.12-1117,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3672.717,3674.27,"Thank you, counsel."
