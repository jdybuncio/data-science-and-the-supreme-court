1974.73-375,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.388,We will hear arguments next in William Otte against the United States and others.
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,30.67,34.29,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1974.73-375,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,34.29,36.809,"Mr. Karasik, how do you pronounce your client’s name?"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,36.809,37.405,Otte.
1974.73-375,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,37.405,40.08,Otte.
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,40.08,47.398,"I represent William Otte, the Trustee in Bankruptcy of Freedomland, the petitioner before the Court today."
1974.73-375,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,248.138,250.539,Where is that page?
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,250.539,254.655,It’s in the appendix Your Honor.
1974.73-375,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,254.655,255.943,It's not in your brief?
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,255.943,256.789,"No, it’s not in the brief."
1974.73-375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,359.819,367.404,"Under your theory Mr. Karasik, would the employees be nonetheless credited with having paid the withheld taxes?"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,367.404,368.818,"No, Your Honor."
1974.73-375,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,408.508,415.743,"You mean that every time a tax return is filed, an accountant has to be employed, do you do that for your personal one?"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,415.743,419.934,"I retain the accountant in my personal case and in this particular case, Your Honor."
1974.73-375,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,419.934,421.625,Do you think all tax payers do?
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,421.625,423.192,"No, all taxpayers do not."
1974.73-375,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,438.364,442.139,"So now, you have not only an accountant but junior accountants also?"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,442.139,442.87,"Well, this District Court --"
1974.73-375,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,442.87,447.235,"Suppose there is just one employee here, is he still an accountant?"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,447.235,449.747,It might not have to be an accountant.
1974.73-375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,459.827,462.716,They will show of any cost of administration isn't?
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,462.716,464.598,That’s correct.
1974.73-375,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,483.225,485.802,"Well, if that were so, why do we have withholding?"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,485.802,492.396,Withholding applies to the ongoing relationship between an employer and an employee.
1974.73-375,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,496.393,499.235,Do you think that’s the only reason for withholding?
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,499.235,507.287,"I think that’s the primary reason for withholding, unless the government assumes that the ordinary wage earner is going to default and not make the payment."
1974.73-375,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,510.252,516.351,"Do you have to assume that, can’t you assume that a recognizable proportion will?"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,523.599,524.321,That maybe.
1974.73-375,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,612.608,624.552,"I’m not sure, I’m sure that I follow the theory behind your comparison, it doesn't hurt the government very much but it does hurt the creditors a great deal."
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,629.072,632.067,I'm just talking generally in terms of the Brookings report.
1974.73-375,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,641.428,651.21,"That’s simply because we have a $300 billion or $400 billion I've forgotten what it is, now, $300 billion or $400 billion budget but what's that got to do with the creditor."
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,657.147,672.162,"Well, I was just suggesting that it's a general policy, the revision -- the proposed revision of the Bankruptcy Act suggested by the Brookings Institute that the amount of taxes collected are minuscule."
1974.73-375,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,736.835,741.292,Does that include social security as well as income tax too?
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,741.292,742.195,That’s correct!
1974.73-375,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,794.699,808.971,We’ll resume there right after lunch.
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,815.187,823.98,"In order for the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit to reach the conclusion, a bankruptcy trustee was required to withhold taxes."
1974.73-375,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,898.183,910.548,"Why would that be anymore true of the bankruptcy judge and a receiver for example, in a federal or a state proceeding trustee and bankruptcy?"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,913.669,931.677,"Well, the bankruptcy judge, under the Internal Revenue Code, it is only the person who is in control of the payment who is deemed to be the employer and it is only the employer who must withhold the tax and prepares the W-2 forms and the related forms."
1974.73-375,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,931.677,937.468,"There are certain derivative responsibilities that follow the funds, are there not?"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,937.468,945.954,"No, the Internal Revenue Code speaks in terms of the parties not the funds."
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.458,1076.967,What proviso is that?
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1076.967,1086.743,That’s the proviso that follows the priority Section under 64 (a) (4) of the Bankruptcy Act.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1086.743,1088.575,I don’t find it in the act.
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1088.575,1091.292,"All right, Your Honor."
1974.73-375,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1091.292,1092.111,It’s in the appendix --
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1092.111,1097.973,It’s in the appendix of page 95 (a) it says provided however that no priority of a general unsecured claim shall pertain --
1974.73-375,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1097.973,1100.762,Now Mr. Counsel hold on until we find the place here.
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1100.762,1101.716,"Yes, excuse me."
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1101.716,1102.826,The bottom three lines.
1974.73-375,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1102.826,1103.148,Yes.
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1103.148,1104.789,That’s correct.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.789,1106.058,Thank you.
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1116.195,1117.227,That’s correct.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.227,1118.466,And?
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1118.466,1119.561,They’re not wages Your Honor.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.664,1122.677,I don’t care what you call them.
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1124.794,1127.245,That’s correct.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1196.154,1200.254,Do you have any of authority supporting your position flatly at all?
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1200.254,1201.886,No.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.886,1212.208,"You have an array of cases internally inconsistent, first, second and fourth, but none of them support your position at this point --"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1212.208,1213.727,"Well, the only indirectly."
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1254.47,1269.0,"Do you think that if you said that this tax claim was the fourth priority or unsecured at all, or not secured at all, or no priority at all."
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1274.523,1277.153,"Well, if they were no wages paid."
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1277.153,1277.876,Yes.
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1277.876,1280.828,Then the trustee would not have to file any returns.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1282.766,1285.915,But when you pay them?
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1285.915,1287.411,"These would be wage claim dividends, where it's this --"
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1287.411,1291.386,"Well, I know, I know that he got to be paying wages, he is going to be paying $600.00."
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1291.386,1293.767,He’s going to be paying $600.00 but these are not wages.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.875,1301.069,"Well, I know but it still could be held that he’s paying wages."
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1302.701,1306.437,If he is held -- if it is held that he’s paying wages --
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.437,1308.067,Yes.
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1308.067,1313.203,Then I would assume that it would -- that he would have to prepare the appropriate forms.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1313.203,1323.211,"Well, I know but the -- the people by whom wages are owed, or owed by bankrupt up to $600.00 you’re going to paid, don’t you?"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1323.211,1323.698,That’s correct.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1323.698,1326.186,"The trustee is going to pay them, isn’t it?"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1326.186,1329.463,"Well, the trustee in conjunction with the bankruptcy judge."
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1329.463,1330.328,With the judge?
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1330.328,1330.618,Yes.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1330.618,1333.022,"Yeah, well, so those are the distributions that are going to be made?"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1333.022,1334.847,That’s correct.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1334.847,1346.273,And I suppose you could say that the trustee can withhold them -- can withhold the money?
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1346.273,1357.898,"There are several threshold questions, if we’re talking about a wage and if you’re saying that the bankruptcy trustee is the one in control and if you’re further saying that the Internal Revenue Code comes into play at this point."
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.898,1362.582,But the claims that are going to be filed to pay their wage claims?
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1362.582,1364.033,The claims or wage claims.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1366.794,1367.182,"Yes, I understand."
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1367.182,1373.417,And there’s a difference I submit respectfully between a wage claim dividend and a wage.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1373.417,1385.571,"Well, a fellow was owed this $599.00 and he gets it all, I suppose he thinks he's got his wages?"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1385.571,1393.708,"Well, if he got it several years after the event, I don’t know what he would consider it and he might considerate it a “windfall”, I don’t know Your Honor."
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1393.708,1396.576,Don't you usually pay wages or wage claims pretty fast?
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1396.576,1397.588,We attempt to do it.
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1419.053,1429.419,"But if you're right -- if you’re right that these wage claims, that these tax pay might be -- had no priority at all, what the trustee would do is to withhold the money and that would go into the unsecured --."
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1429.419,1432.032,"That’s correct – and that's illogical, Your Honor."
1974.73-375,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1432.032,1433.897,"Well, -- is that what you claim here?"
1974.73-375,0,27435,howard_karasik,,1433.897,1435.005,"Well, it’s not my claim."
1974.73-375,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1460.209,1468.064,"Very well, Mr. Jones."
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1468.064,1470.678,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.71,1854.375,Well are you -- you’re supporting the judgment below?
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1854.375,1861.267,We’re supporting the judgment below in the sense that we’re supporting the distribution of assets ordered by the court in its judgment.
1974.73-375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1867.066,1869.438,But if you were -- but if you were --
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1869.438,1871.943,Are distributable as second priority objects.
1974.73-375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1871.943,1877.152,"If accept your argument, the result below might be different."
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1878.978,1880.332,That’s true and you bring up the point I assume that --
1974.73-375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.332,1887.159,But you're -- but you really want to secure more than you got on judgment below?
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1887.159,1888.564,Yes and no.
1974.73-375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.948,1890.503,Did you petition or not?
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1890.503,1899.983,"We didn't petition, but as we pointed out in our brief, the question of first priority was opened up, opened up by the petitioner in his petition."
1974.73-375,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1936.221,1937.803,"Well of course, it goes further than that?"
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1951.421,1954.859,"Well, I don’t think that’s true in this case Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1974.73-375,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1989.218,1989.872,But that?
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1989.872,2004.246,"In other words, you could if you saw fit determine that as a matter of law with these withholding taxes are the first priority items but that in the absence of a cross petition -- we were entitled only to an affirmance of the judgment below."
1974.73-375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2030.653,2042.902,"I don’t know that -- it says you're not only, not entitled to the administration expenses but you’re not entitled to the priority (Inaudible)."
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2053.342,2080.321,"I think analytically there are two separate questions, the first is whether the issue is properly before the Court and the second separable question, is whether this Court can modify the judgment of the court below in the favor of the respondent and as to the first question, I think it's clear that this issue is before the Court, as to the second question, I'm less clear in the circumstances of this case whether we really are entitled to a modification of the judgment."
1974.73-375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.321,2093.313,"And you're suggesting that surely we're not required by the failure of the government to cross petition, to affirm what we think is an erroneous holding the Court of Appeals."
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2093.313,2093.858,That's correct.
1974.73-375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2093.858,2112.68,"Mr. Jones, it over simplifies, suppose you go a judgment for $15,000.00 in the Court of Appeals, and the other side brought it up and you didn't cross petition, would we be right in giving $25,000.00?"
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2112.68,2114.047,I'm sorry what was the last question?
1974.73-375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2115.062,2118.854,"You've got in the affirm judgment of $15,000.00 for damages."
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2118.854,2119.524,I say and --
1974.73-375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2119.524,2125.145,"And the other side appealed that we say, you should have gotten $25,000.00."
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2125.145,2127.92,"Well, and we don't cross appeal or cross petition."
1974.73-375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2127.92,2128.253,Right.
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2128.253,2134.577,"But we present an argument which if accepted logically would entitle us to a judgment of $25,000.00."
1974.73-375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2135.151,2136.486,Do they give it to you?
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2136.486,2142.327,"No, and we have spelled out our position at greater length on this point."
1974.73-375,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2142.327,2143.139,Yeah.
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2143.139,2148.022,In our reply brief in the Western Edition case which was filled last week.
1974.73-375,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2148.022,2156.406,"The fact is if you look at the petition for certiorari in this case, the question two doesn't raise the question that you raised."
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2156.406,2160.162,That's correct and it was in reliance upon that we acquiesced in this petition.
1974.73-375,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2160.162,2164.179,"And, we granted certiorari across the board."
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2164.179,2165.099,That's correct Mr. Justice.
1974.73-375,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2165.099,2169.524,Pleasantly accepting the proposition that these questions were --
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2169.524,2176.438,And for that reason we believe that this case really doesn't even present the issue that we discussed in our reply brief in Western Edition.
1974.73-375,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2184.572,2200.429,"Just two basic questions are these wage claim dividends subject to -- does a trustee have the duty to withhold at all and secondly, if it does what priority if do they dividend fall into?"
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2200.429,2202.402,That's correct.
1974.73-375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.402,2209.131,And would you expand for me the Government's theory as to why they should be first priority?
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2209.131,2212.997,"Yes, Mr. Justice White, and I would be delighted to do that."
1974.73-375,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2214.609,2221.379,Contrasted was the Second Circuit's conclusion that they were derived from wages and therefore belong in the second priority.
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2221.379,2222.412,That's right.
1974.73-375,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2238.162,2239.321,"Now, why is that?"
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2246.496,2257.688,"Well, these are very much like the expenses of hiring secretaries to mail out the wage distributions, the state really doesn't get anything for it, it's just an obligation that incurs in the course of administration."
1974.73-375,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2257.688,2263.927,"Well, I'll buy the obligation part but I wonder why it is a cost of administration?"
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2263.927,2264.644,Why?
1974.73-375,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2269.953,2274.412,"I think the first priority originated in the Eight Circuit Fogarty case, isn't not?"
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2274.412,2275.68,That's correct.
1974.73-375,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2275.68,2284.594,"And I look at this, this was a tag ambition because there were other primary issues there such as the --"
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2284.594,2285.801,That's right.
1974.73-375,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2288.262,2306.995,"And as all that I see that Judge Wood had said, is that the taxes should be allowed and classified as an expense of administration having priority, they were not payable at the time the petition was filed by the bankrupt and only approved as and when they paid."
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2323.476,2327.565,"Well, we're not relying necessarily from the reasoning set forth from the Fogarty opinion."
1974.73-375,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2327.565,2330.206,I guess I'd like to know what reasoning then you are relying?
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2330.206,2333.964,"Well, I'm not sure exactly what your question is, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1974.73-375,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.995,2382.999,Is that Collier you're speaking or are there some cases to support it?
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2382.999,2383.904,That's Collier speaking.
1974.73-375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.282,2416.977,And that (Inaudible) the taxes which improve during the administration?
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2416.977,2418.061,Like this tax.
1974.73-375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.061,2435.42,"Well, yes but this tax had to be related to wages earned before bankruptcy and arguably these taxes would all be treated like real property taxes that were due and owing in kind of bankruptcy."
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2435.42,2441.943,I don't know Mr. Justice why they can't treated that way because they were not legally due and owing before bankruptcy.
1974.73-375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.483,2453.002,Did it say I would put it in the fourth priority.
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2456.128,2457.181,Well --
1974.73-375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.181,2463.774,And I was also saying that Collier was directed to the taxes incurred in the operations of the business.
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2463.774,2465.562,"Oh, no he was speaking more generally --"
1974.73-375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.028,2471.27,"Oh, there weren't lot of cases holding there for that statement?"
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2471.27,2472.591,"Well, of course this Court had spoken on it."
1974.73-375,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.591,2474.603,You say that word and you probably wouldn't be here.
1974.73-375,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2474.603,2476.325,That's correct.
1974.73-375,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2484.987,2486.411,Mr. Warms.
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2486.411,2489.978,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1974.73-375,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2536.105,2542.461,"Well, in some other case it can make a difference whether it was administration expense or second priority?"
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2542.461,2545.908,I can concede none under the way we rush --
1974.73-375,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2545.908,2549.375,"Well, they've got to some reason for making this argument."
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2549.375,2549.996,I beg your pardon?
1974.73-375,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2549.996,2552.013,I should have asked the government this question.
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2554.064,2573.594,"Yes, they do, Mr. Justice White they do, because they are afraid that in the case where after the payment of administration expenses other than these they will not -- and where there's nothing enough left to execute a payment in full, that there will be diminution in the amount of tax claims."
1974.73-375,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2580.661,2584.412,So where there's not enough assets to pay the wage claims they would suffer too if the court --
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2584.412,2586.262,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1974.73-375,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.262,2587.094,Well that's what their claim.
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2587.094,2602.04,"That's their claim, but I've analyzed the argument and I analyzed the example, what they say is this, if in a state where there is $40,000.00 worth of wage claims, there are are only $20,000.00 to pay them."
1974.73-375,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2604.19,2610.245,"Well, you would say that as far as you can see it doesn't make that much difference in the state?"
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2610.245,2629.645,"I would say it doesn't make any difference because in such a case -- the residue would be paid if we assume 25% is the rate, 75% to wage earner and 25% on his behalf to the government not half of 25% as they argue in their brief."
1974.73-375,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2629.645,2635.208,"But nonetheless it's 25% of a smaller amount in the total wages claimed, isn't it?"
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2635.208,2637.613,"Well, that would be true in any case Your Honor."
1974.73-375,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2637.613,2639.577,"In other words, you tax only what is paid up."
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2639.577,2640.465,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.73-375,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2645.571,2665.098,"Well, but so far as net receipts to the treasury is concerned, if you pay a $100,000.00 on a $100,000.00 wage claim, and subtract 25% for tax, the government is getting more money than it would if you pay $50,000.00 on a $100,000.00 wage claim and pay $12,500.00 to the government?"
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2665.098,2676.965,"Well, that's absolutely correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist because the wage claimants is getting half -- the wage claimants is getting less --"
1974.73-375,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.965,2684.891,"He is now got therefore, the only thing is the administration expense would be 25% of $50,000.00."
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2684.891,2686.105,That is correct.
1974.73-375,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.105,2688.607,"So it wouldn't, and you say that wouldn't make any difference."
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2688.607,2691.586,It would make a slightest bit of difference.
1974.73-375,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.946,2905.02,"Mr. Warms, is this like a prior theories which I think emerged first time in this case in the Second Circuit, is this your argument below that the court pick it up on it's own clear argument?"
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2905.02,2907.085,I am sorry to say that it was my argument.
1974.73-375,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2977.757,2982.98,"Mr. Warms, have you ever studied calculus of differential equations?"
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2982.98,2989.624,"No, Your Honor, I haven't and I was wondering whether this was a case of them of the multiple variables."
1974.73-375,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.624,2996.798,"Well, it just seems to me that here you have two dependent of variables with one constant which you've forgotten to with the amount of money."
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,2996.798,2997.003,That's correct.
1974.73-375,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2997.003,3012.101,I think it's a routine problem in either differential equations or calculus -- I don't go along with this argument and I'll be trying to say that it is capable of solution I'm sure.
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,3012.101,3023.011,"Oh, just as the problem of the employer who pays the income tax on the employees' income is capable of solution, in a similar manner."
1974.73-375,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3023.011,3032.465,(Inaudible)
1974.73-375,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3032.465,3035.288,"Thank you very much, you have two minutes left."
1974.73-375,2,42263,samuel_j_warms,,3037.084,3041.21,If there are no further questions I will quit my time.
1974.73-375,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3041.21,3041.827,Thank you gentlemen.
