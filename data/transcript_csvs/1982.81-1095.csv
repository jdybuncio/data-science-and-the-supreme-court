1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.293,We will hear arguments next in Morris against Slappy.
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,67.552,69.3,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,71.08,78.843,"To avoid an interruption later on, I could not put my finger on the date of the criminal act that was charged in this case."
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,78.843,81.639,"--The date of the criminal act was July the 7th, 1976."
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,175.459,179.755,Is there any challenge here to the verdict as such?
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,179.755,180.443,"--None, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,218.396,219.677,And what was the date of that arraignment?
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,219.677,222.988,"That arraignment... I don't know the precise date, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,226.252,235.921,"Well, it seems to me that the papers before us don't have anything about the date of the arraignment, the preliminary hearing, the date of Mr. Goldfine's hospitalization, all of which, it seems to me, are somewhat pertinent."
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,235.921,247.338,"Well, the facts relating to the crime and the time and that such were not initially before the Court because they had never been presented to the lower federal courts."
1982.81-1095,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,348.313,350.53,"At that point, had any evidence come in?"
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,350.53,359.902,"--No, Your Honor, it had not, but a jury had been empaneled, and at that point it may have been necessary to declare a mistrial rather than simply a continuance, because jeopardy had--"
1982.81-1095,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,359.902,362.338,"Again, the record before us doesn't show that, does it?"
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,362.338,364.571,"--It does now, yes."
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,379.097,384.938,Did you say that no evidence had gone in at the time he made this motion?
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,384.938,386.187,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,386.187,388.218,The opening statements had been made?
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,388.218,388.858,"No, they had not."
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,388.858,389.514,Had not?
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,389.514,390.186,"No, they had not."
1982.81-1095,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,400.994,404.743,The Chief Justice referred to it in terms of a motion.
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,406.695,409.741,--That is how the state trial judge characterized it.
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,507.748,533.769,"I notice, counsel, and it may not be terribly important, but in the appendix here, the conversations reflecting what Mr. Slappy said, the Public Defender is simply indicated by P.D.> [""] Now, did he, Slappy, in the courtroom call the Public Defender P.D.> [""], or is that the reporter's shorthand?"
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,533.769,535.05,This comes on the second day.
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,536.111,536.768,Yes.
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,536.768,547.481,"No, on the first day he only refers to Hotchkiss, and he refers to him as ""my attorney"", referring to the attorney who is in court with him today, saying, I don't think that this attorney has had an opportunity to prepare."
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,551.73,555.478,"Well, did he use the abbreviation P.D.> [""]?"
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,555.478,556.525,"--Oh, yes, he did, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,557.868,561.508,Is that the way people describe the Public Defender in California?
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,561.508,562.756,--Sometimes they describe them--
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,562.756,563.053,P.D.?
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,563.053,565.334,--in even... well--
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,569.519,576.143,"What I am trying to get at, is this the vernacular of the street, as it were, or is this a common--"
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,576.143,578.188,--I think it's a common shorthand reference in the courts--
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,578.188,579.141,--In the courtrooms.
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,579.141,579.719,--by the district attorneys--
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,579.719,581.078,D.A.--
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,581.078,582.281,"--and... the D.A. Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.139,857.716,"--Mr. Gillette, may I ask one question?"
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,857.716,857.997,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,857.997,868.54,"At the second trial, after the mistrial on the two offenses, the judge there said he thought that the respondent was uncooperative and deliberately misbehaving."
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,868.54,869.259,Deliberately disruptive.
1982.81-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.259,881.971,"And then also in the Ninth Circuit, after they issued their first opinion, they wrote a second opinion in which they said at the time of the continuance, which I guess was before the first trial, they thought he was acting with sincerity and the state didn't disagree with that."
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,881.971,884.189,"Well, that's what they said, but that's not true."
1982.81-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,884.189,885.61,That's what I wanted to ask you.
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,886.141,903.15,"The Ninth Circuit modified in part its opinion in response to our petition for rehearing and hearing en banc, saying in that amendment that Slappy in their view was acting in good faith when he asked to have Goldfine, and was not being disruptive or uncooperative."
1982.81-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.826,933.966,"--So your position is, he was uncooperative all the way through."
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,933.966,934.575,Yes.
1982.81-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,934.575,935.98,What about the first trial judge?
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,940.886,942.165,"No, he did not."
1982.81-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,959.674,970.575,"But your position, as I understand it, just as one other question, is that even assuming he was sincere all the way through, you don't think there is this constitutional right to a meaningful relationship with counsel."
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,970.575,970.825,No.
1982.81-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,971.497,972.216,You don't.
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,992.364,993.77,"From the second trial, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,993.77,995.441,From the second trial?
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,995.441,995.675,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,995.675,999.533,Your comment was just addressed only to the first trial?
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1012.34,1013.09,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1013.09,1015.026,This pattern of conduct on the part of Slappy.
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1015.026,1015.339,"Yes, it does."
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1015.339,1019.682,Including his references to the P.D.--
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1019.682,1021.243,Yes.
1982.81-1095,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1024.538,1024.945,--Mr. Gillette--
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1024.945,1025.195,--Yes?
1982.81-1095,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1025.195,1042.171,"--may I ask before you go on, under your version, I suppose we could conclude that the trial judge was correct in the first instance in treating the comments of the defendant as, at best, a motion for a continuance--"
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1042.171,1043.28,Precisely.
1982.81-1095,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1043.28,1048.872,--because no reference was made at all to his first assigned attorney.
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1048.872,1049.794,Precisely.
1982.81-1095,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1049.794,1053.76,"And if we did that, we would never reach this Sixth Amendment question, would we?"
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1053.76,1074.017,"No, I think not, and I can address that right now, and I would like to, because it is important to emphasize here that as the Ninth Circuit saw it, the Sixth Amendment violation was not simply that Mr. Hotchkiss rather than Mr. Goldfine represented Slappy, but rather that the judge did not conduct the inquiry, which in its view was required by the record."
1982.81-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.167,1402.291,"Mr. Gillette, may I ask you a question?"
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1408.117,1408.742,"Yes, we do."
1982.81-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1408.742,1414.536,"In your view, what is the correct statement of the standard for determining whether there was effective representation of counsel?"
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1414.536,1443.977,"The definition of effective assistance of counsel as California has recently formulated it, which was based in part on language in some federal opinions, is that it must be shown, in order to establish that counsel was not effective, the defendant must show that he failed to act in a manner to be expected of reasonably competent attorneys acting as diligent advocates, and that that failure resulted in the withdrawal of a potentially meritorious defense."
1982.81-1095,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1443.977,1448.054,And you would consider that an acceptable statement of the federal standard?
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1448.054,1452.114,"Well, the federal courts have used that standard."
1982.81-1095,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1452.88,1456.598,How many have added that last--
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1456.598,1459.597,The withdrawal of a meritorious defense?
1982.81-1095,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.597,1459.831,--Yes.
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1459.831,1460.425,"That I don't know, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1460.939,1463.267,The court of appeals for the District of Columbia did once.
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1464.844,1465.594,--I think that is--
1982.81-1095,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1465.594,1466.422,"Does the Ninth Circuit, you think?"
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1466.422,1469.391,"--The Ninth Circuit, I believe, does have that standard."
1982.81-1095,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1493.442,1493.707,Wait a minute.
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1497.284,1498.175,"--Well, he had six days--"
1982.81-1095,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1498.175,1503.703,Are you telling me that a public defender in California only works on one case at a time?
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1503.703,1505.922,"--No, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1505.922,1507.219,I hope you don't try to.
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1507.219,1508.748,What I--
1982.81-1095,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1508.748,1516.231,"Because you know and I know that they handle five... I'm not saying they don't do it properly, but they handle several cases at the same time."
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1516.231,1520.305,--I am not saying that he necessarily did use all those six days.
1982.81-1095,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1520.305,1521.68,"Well, you said full-time."
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1521.68,1530.505,"He had that opportunity, and I think that the state trial judge in this case was required to take Mr. Hotchkiss at his word when he said, I am fully prepared."
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1544.984,1551.794,Did the trial judge at any point in the trial express any appraisal of the performance of the P.D.?
1982.81-1095,0,20873,dane_r_gillette,,1551.794,1553.339,"He did, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1596.183,1596.79,Very well.
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1600.101,1615.642,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is not whether or not Mr. Slappy received a fair trial."
1982.81-1095,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1621.936,1625.669,May I stop you right there?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1625.669,1626.45,Yes.
1982.81-1095,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.45,1637.337,"Does a federal district court in a habeas corpus proceeding have the right to set aside a conviction because there was an abuse of discretion by the state trial judge, if there was not an unfair trial?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1637.337,1643.864,The federal district court does as it impacts upon the right to counsel.
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1714.461,1719.663,Are you going to at any time explain why it wasn't effective counsel?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1719.663,1729.924,"The issue is not effective assistance of counsel as we see it, and the Court does not have to reach that issue by a narrow ruling in this case."
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1817.091,1823.308,Do you agree that an indigent does not have a right to a particular public defender?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1823.308,1825.947,--The--
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1825.947,1842.926,"The reason is, at one time when I was handling the assignment of pro forma cases on the Second Circuit, one of the prisoners insisted that he be represented by Edward Bennet Williams, but he didn't have that right, did he?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1842.926,1843.862,"--No, he didn't, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1843.862,1850.827,And does your client have a right to any particular public defender?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1850.827,1855.701,"As to the choice of initial appointment, no, the client doesn't have a right."
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1855.701,1856.326,I didn't say initial.
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1862.37,1871.726,"After there is an attorney-client relationship established, we would submit that the defendant has a right to maintain that relationship if--"
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1871.726,1874.475,"Well, suppose he resigns."
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1875.662,1883.237,"--Well, then, this is why the trial court is the final arbiter in the exercise of proper discretion."
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1921.159,1927.407,"As I read the Joint Appendix, he didn't mention the other lawyer until the second day."
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1927.407,1931.592,"He did not specifically state, I want Harvey Goldfine."
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1931.592,1932.372,"I don't want the word ""specific""."
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1934.341,1936.137,He did not specifically state Harvey Goldfine.
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1937.153,1941.229,Did he say that he had a prior public defender?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1944.056,1944.54,He said--
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1944.54,1946.742,"All he said was, this man didn't get in until Tuesday night."
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1946.742,1947.82,--Correct.
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1947.82,1948.976,That is all he said.
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1948.976,1949.819,Correct.
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1949.819,1959.487,"So now the trial is proceeding, and at that stage he comes in and tells the judge, you know, there was another public defender."
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1962.517,1964.626,"No, that's--"
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1964.626,1966.11,"Well, what should he do?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1966.11,1967.905,--The trial judge--
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1967.905,1969.545,When should he have had the hearing?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1969.545,1983.368,"--On the issue of who should have been his counsel, the hearing should have been made prior to the trial beginning at the time that Slappy made his objection as to who his counsel was, and that was--"
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1983.368,1988.35,Slappy did not make an objection to Mr.... He objected to the counsel he had at that time.
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,1998.066,2001.829,--I submit to Your Honor that the objection--
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.829,2006.468,"Well, will you point me where in the record he says that I object to this man representing me?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2006.468,2009.888,--He doesn't say that until the second day of trial.
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2050.871,2054.307,"Mr. Bassi, you are here by our appointment."
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2054.307,2055.432,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2055.432,2060.478,"I did not check in the record to see, did you argue the case in the court of appeals?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2060.478,2060.931,"Yes, I did."
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2060.931,2062.367,And you were there by appointment?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2062.367,2063.367,"Yes, I was."
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2063.367,2067.054,"But that was your first contact with the case, was it not?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2067.054,2067.585,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2067.585,2078.486,"Mr. Bassi, it was really the third day, not the second day, that the defendant first mentioned his original attorney, isn't it?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2082.36,2087.529,"He stated on the second day of trial, P.D., Mr. Goldfine> [""], or P.D. Goldfine> [""]."
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2182.88,2185.646,Who represented him in the second trial?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2185.646,2189.956,"The same attorney that represented him in the first trial, Mr. Hotchkiss, and in fact--"
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2189.956,2193.533,Did he say he wasn't properly represented there?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2193.533,2201.701,"--It is difficult to tell from the record whether or not there was effective representation, partially because Slappy didn't testify."
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2213.838,2215.273,On the second case?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2215.273,2217.742,"--On... Yes, on the second case."
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2217.742,2218.584,On the second case.
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2218.584,2220.897,I am referring to the first case.
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2222.536,2223.708,"Well, I am talking about the second case."
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2223.708,2231.033,"The second case, it is... he refused to testify again, and you really can't tell from the record."
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2231.033,2236.593,"Well, that isn't... When a man refuses to testify, that says that he is not represented by counsel?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2238.296,2240.795,"No, I am not submitting--"
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.795,2243.56,"Well, he raised it... Is the counsel point in the second case?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2243.56,2246.371,"--I am sorry, I--"
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2246.371,2247.027,"And if so, why?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2247.027,2248.12,--Is the--
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.12,2252.572,Is the inadequacy of counsel in the second case?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2252.572,2253.181,--The--
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2253.181,2255.226,"And if so, why?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2255.226,2262.504,"--I submit you can't tell from the record, Your Honor, because Slappy refuses to testify, because his right to counsel was violated in the first trial."
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2271.781,2276.703,"But the trial judge didn't have any difficulty in making that evaluation, did he?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2276.703,2284.715,"The trial judge indicated in the first trial that there was an effective representation by Mr. Hotchkiss, but--"
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2284.715,2286.074,"He said it several times, didn't he?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2286.074,2286.417,--He did.
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2297.334,2303.113,So you think... you are suggesting the judge perhaps was just protecting himself?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2303.113,2305.253,"I think that could be inferred from those statements, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2329.665,2331.774,Mr. Bassi--
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2331.774,2332.43,"Yes, Justice?"
1982.81-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.43,2338.521,"--you made a comment a moment ago that Goldfine, the original attorney, I believe, had done voluminous research."
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2342.299,2362.824,"The statements by Mr. Hotchkiss, actually by, I think it's the district attorney, Mr. Dondero, on the first day indicate that there was voluminous investigation done, that the investigators from the public defender's office had been down to the scene three and four times, speaking to witnesses."
1982.81-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2362.824,2366.494,Was that personally done... does the record indicate that was personally done by Mr. Goldfine?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2366.494,2370.961,"Actually, Mr. Hotchkiss does indicate that the investigation was... I'm sorry."
1982.81-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2399.183,2409.43,"Is it the custom of the public defender's office in San Francisco, do you know, to have most of the legwork in investigations done by actual lawyers, or just by investigators?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2411.46,2415.506,I think the... They have an investigative staff in the San Francisco public defender's office.
1982.81-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2482.479,2490.445,"--Well, now, the Powell case involved appointment of the entire bar of the county, and that has never been done since, has it?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2490.445,2491.834,"--No, it hasn't, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2507.016,2516.028,"Well, do you suggest that here there was a last minute appointment, or that there was a lack of opportunity to investigate and prepare, on this record?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2516.028,2525.555,I submit that there was a last minute appointment resulting in the failure of any attorney-client relationship being established.
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2525.555,2529.991,"Well, you link that just to this meaningful relationship concept."
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2529.991,2530.537,Yes.
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2530.537,2532.691,Not to the effective assistance.
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2532.691,2541.391,"No, we are not arguing effective assistance, because we don't feel that the record is... first of all, that the Court has to reach this issue."
1982.81-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2541.391,2555.699,"Well, if a court finds that a client was afforded effective assistance of counsel, could he nonetheless seek habeas relief on the grounds that although his assistance was effective, he didn't have a meaningful relationship with his attorney?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2555.699,2589.404,"If the trial judge were to make an adequate inquiry, and in finding in the exercise of discretion that there would be some prejudice to the relationship between the client and the attorney, but on the other side found a legitimate need to move the case towards trial and did so, then I suggest that prejudice to the defendant does not override an adequate exercise of discretion by the trial judge."
1982.81-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2595.589,2606.319,"Well, supposing you were back in the Ninth Circuit arguing this case on appeal, as I understand you did, and you concluded the part of your argument devoted to effective assistance of counsel."
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2630.185,2630.42,Yes.
1982.81-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2677.649,2678.914,Is Burton cited in your brief?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2678.914,2680.929,Burton is cited in our briefs.
1982.81-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2680.929,2682.054,Is that a case in this Court?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2682.054,2684.553,It is a case from the D.C. court.
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2684.553,2703.468,"Mr. Bassi, suppose the judge holds a hearing and finds that there has been a thorough investigation made, and all that is in a voluminous file in the public defender's office, and that no more investigation is needed."
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2706.201,2715.932,"If the judge held... yes, it would, if the judge completely exercised discretion."
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2715.932,2716.43,"Well, then, let me read to you."
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2734.767,2736.672,"Correct, Your Honor, but I submit that--"
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2736.672,2739.109,Didn't you say that was enough?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2739.109,2748.153,"--It's enough as to whether or not there has been investigation, but as to a complete exercise of discretion, the Court has to consider other factors."
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2768.925,2770.471,What did his illness have to do with it?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2770.471,2774.72,"--Well, his illness, I think, is critical in this case, because it is apparent--"
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2774.72,2776.079,It was critical to him.
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2778.546,2781.529,"--Hopefully, it wasn't that critical."
1982.81-1095,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2782.888,2784.387,"Mr. Bassi, may I ask you a question?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2784.387,2785.012,"--Yes, Justice."
1982.81-1095,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2785.012,2790.479,How would you define a meaningful relationship between a lawyer and his client?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2797.178,2804.894,"I think the American Bar Association standards for criminal justice put it well, and that is--"
1982.81-1095,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2804.894,2806.129,Does it use that term?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2806.129,2807.613,--trust and confidence.
1982.81-1095,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2807.613,2808.691,Does it use that term?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2808.691,2814.158,"They don't use the words ""a meaningful relationship"", but they do utilize the words"
1982.81-1095,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2818.562,2841.553,"What if you had the leading defense counsel at the San Francisco bar appointed to represent a defendant, and he had done all of the investigating that any lawyer would have done, but on the first day of trial the defendant said, judge, I just don't trust this fellow, and I don't have a meaningful relation with him?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2841.553,2847.27,--I think that is one aspect in the exercise of discretion that the court must look to.
1982.81-1095,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2847.27,2856.89,Do you think even in those circumstances there would be any right to have the second leading lawyer in San Francisco represent him?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2856.89,2873.228,"If the court properly exercised discretion and found no legitimate... and found there was a legitimate interest in going to trial for the prosecution, then the court is fully within its discretion to order the defendant to continue to trial with the first attorney or by himself."
1982.81-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2883.238,2892.485,"Isn't there always a legitimate interest on the part of the prosecution in going to trial if the case has been set, the prosecutor is ready, the witnesses are ready?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2899.67,2911.618,"--There is always a legitimate interest the prosecutor can set forth in going to trial, Justice Rehnquist, and I submit that the trial judge is best positioned to make the final determination who shall prevail."
1982.81-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2911.618,2912.898,"Well, and he made a determination in denying."
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2916.694,2927.908,"The trial judge did not make a complete inquiry into the matter, though, and that is the--"
1982.81-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2927.908,2932.548,"So that is your constitutional point, what it finally boils down to?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2948.946,2961.051,"--When it impacts upon the right to counsel, the federal habeas reviewing court may review a state court's determination as to whether or not counsel has been provided."
1982.81-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2967.189,2968.845,Set forth in what?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2968.845,2969.564,--In Cyler v. Sullivan.
1982.81-1095,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2969.564,2970.97,"Oh, Cyler, yes."
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,2981.699,2983.261,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2983.261,3003.956,"--this man's conduct during the trial, and the judge's observation about it, would it be irrational for someone looking at the record, not having been there, to conclude that this man, Slappy, was deliberately trying to make a record of no meaningful relationship with his counsel?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,3007.329,3012.296,"Well, I submit that it wouldn't be irrational, but I am not conceding the point that that was his purpose."
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3013.436,3019.621,"Well, he was interrupting the proceedings constantly, wasn't he, and the judge reprimanded him, what, two or three or four times?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,3019.621,3021.823,"--That is in the record, Your Honor."
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3023.823,3026.01,Do you think this was rational conduct on his part?
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,3026.01,3036.832,"I think in light of Wainwright, Rose, and Angle, that that is the type of conduct that is necessary for a defendant to assert his constitutional rights."
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3036.832,3043.283,"In the presence of the jury, or to ask for an opportunity to make these points to the judge in chambers?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,3043.283,3046.641,I think that he did make some of the points in chambers.
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3048.187,3052.53,Only because the court required him to come to chambers after his outburst.
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,3053.483,3066.492,"--The court asked him not to make outbursts on the record, but I submit that these were outbursts by an uneducated, indigent man trying to assert his rights in the best way possible."
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3068.211,3069.554,Did you say innocent or indigent.
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,3069.554,3070.273,--Indigent.
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3070.663,3071.273,Indigent.
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,3071.273,3078.05,I would submit possibly he was innocent if the effectiveness of counsel isn't demonstrated on the record.
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3236.798,3245.623,"Mr. Bassi, if you were to prevail here, then the consequence would be, the case would go back for a third trial?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,3246.81,3250.871,"Well, all five counts would be retried again."
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3252.432,3256.619,"Now, the crime took place in 1975 or six?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,3256.619,3257.229,Seventy-six.
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3257.229,3258.477,Seventy-six.
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,3277.282,3291.62,"She would, but she doesn't seem to be adverse to appearing, because she has filed a civil suit against the landlords, and that is cited in the Petitioner's brief in chief, which was recently decided by the California court of appeals."
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3338.101,3338.898,When you read--
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,3338.898,3339.226,"--Yes, sir?"
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3339.226,3350.737,"--When you read his testimony, couldn't you get the feeling that if Goldfine had tried this case and Hotchkiss had been in the hospital, he would have made the same argument?"
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,3350.737,3362.529,"That, Your Honor, I can't speculate on, and I think that is the type of speculation which this Court refuses to engage in when the fundamental right to counsel is violated."
1982.81-1095,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3362.529,3368.073,I try my best.
1982.81-1095,1,35499,michael_b_bassi,,3368.073,3386.129,"The position allows the trial court to preserve the traditional relationship between attorney and client when warranted, and to exercise discretion in achieving the legitimate interests of society when warranted."
1982.81-1095,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3398.812,3399.687,Very well.
1982.81-1095,2,20873,dane_r_gillette,,3401.919,3405.449,"Yes, I do, Your Honor, and may it please the Court."
1982.81-1095,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3496.991,3502.707,"Well, but you would be arguing roughly the same thing if that is what he had said, and the judge said, you are not entitled to him."
1982.81-1095,2,20873,dane_r_gillette,,3502.707,3503.799,"I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1982.81-1095,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3503.799,3514.655,"You would be arguing almost the same thing if he had said, I want Goldfine, and the judge had said, sorry, you have to be satisfied with this very competent substitute."
1982.81-1095,2,20873,dane_r_gillette,,3514.655,3515.607,That's correct.
1982.81-1095,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3596.325,3598.325,"Thank you, gentlemen."
