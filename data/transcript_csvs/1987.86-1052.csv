1987.86-1052,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,0.416,"Mr. Rubin, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,0.416,14.926,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,108.019,119.577,"Counsel, suppose that the CEO of Volkswagen Germany were in Illinois for a business meeting for a day and he were served, what result?"
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,121.695,126.933,"I think, Your Honor, that you would have to comply with the treaty."
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,200.629,211.67,What is the language in the treaty that you rely on in order to support your conclusion that the documents would necessarily have to be transmitted abroad as a practical matter?
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,214.472,238.32,"We respectfully submit that in presenting the proposition to the Senate, Mr. Carney, who was the representative of the State Department who presented it, indicated in the broadest terms how this treaty was to be administered and what it's purpose was."
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,263.305,265.238,But that's not what the treaty says.
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,270.208,274.862,"That's right and that, too, is stated in the broadest and most embracing fashion."
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,283.551,289.289,"Even if the company does it voluntarily, not as a legal requirement?"
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,289.289,295.943,"Your Honor, please, I believe that the intention was clear among the contracting parties."
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,302.263,307.166,"Well, then are you saying that it's irrelevant that the document has to be transmitted abroad?"
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,307.166,309.15,It is not irrelevant at all.
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,309.15,312.904,"Well, then we have to focus on the language of the treaty in that clause, don't we?"
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,312.904,315.337,"The expectation, Your Honor--"
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,315.337,315.856,All right.
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,320.391,333.734,"--There is the necessity to transmit it abroad, Your Honor, because the party that's being hailed into court has a right to know precisely what the contentions are against it."
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.734,334.168,It knows.
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,338.186,342.59,"Well, the president is receiving it, Your Honor, on the fly."
1987.86-1052,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.314,362.318,"Mr. Rubin, what if Volkswagen Germany had an office... that's the next question... in the state?"
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,362.318,368.705,"I think, Your Honor, that if it had an office in the state it would have qualified in the state."
1987.86-1052,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.776,376.061,"No, this is a state that doesn't have such a thing."
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,376.061,381.215,--If it had an office in the state--
1987.86-1052,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,381.215,382.732,Just has an office in the state.
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,385.667,390.32,"--I think in that respect, also, you have a question as to what kind of an office this is."
1987.86-1052,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.641,398.843,"No, this is a big office."
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,404.497,407.699,"--Well, that's not the situation, obviously, Your Honor."
1987.86-1052,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.551,438.035,It's not moved there.
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,444.955,455.68,"Your Honor, the expectation and intention still is that the address of the company is in Wolfsburg, Germany, and it's anticipated that service would take place at its office."
1987.86-1052,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,455.68,457.147,"Where it's incorporated, is that it?"
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,459.465,460.165,At its home.
1987.86-1052,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,462.084,465.869,And you find that in the language of the treaty where there is an occasion to make service abroad?
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,465.869,484.716,"I think, Your Honor, I find it in terms of the recital by the... in the Senate document... saying that where the action is commenced by a Plaintiff in one country against a Defendant who is in another country."
1987.86-1052,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,502.911,516.135,"Well, that's a dramatic departure then from the way process is ordinarily served on corporations outside of the treaty where, you know, you have to serve some human individual every time when you are serving a corporation."
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,520.705,528.395,"I say, Your Honor, that the treaty contemplates that there be a very, very significant formality in terms of service."
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,540.953,552.176,But I just don't understand the principle that you're urging on us as the determinant for when the treaty applies and when it doesn't.
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,569.286,594.167,"Respectfully, Your Honor, what we're saying is that the principle is that a formal document should be, was anticipated by the contracting parties to be, directed with a degree of formality, so that there could be certainty, so that they could put the simplicity or there can be an assurance, and that's what was achieved by the parties."
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,628.575,632.943,Unless it's an agent appointed for the service of process?
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,632.943,633.443,That's right.
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,633.443,637.263,"But in that situation, the papers still go abroad."
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,637.263,645.434,"But there, again, the treaty expressly provides that there can be a voluntary submission."
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,655.992,664.748,"Well, let's assume that there's an office in the state, that the foreign corporation voluntarily set it up."
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,669.216,681.459,"Your Honor, if there is a voluntary submission, if there's a voluntary acceptance, certainly that is within the shared anticipation, the expectation, of the parties."
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,684.761,696.802,"So you suggest that if a foreign corporation sets up an office in a state or in such a way that it should have qualified but did not, that that office could be served?"
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,706.041,713.68,"To the extent that there's a voluntary submission to the acceptance of process, that would be the case."
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,740.848,749.937,"Well, I take it you agree on my example that the foreign corporation could be served through its office in the United States."
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,749.937,750.637,Well--
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,750.637,751.97,Is that right or not?
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,751.97,757.523,"--I'm not sure, Your Honor, that I'm in a position to concede that as the intention."
1987.86-1052,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,788.495,790.681,"Mr. Rubin, that brings up an issue."
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,819.014,824.918,"I think, Your Honor, you're bound, you're interpreting, you're construing a contract."
1987.86-1052,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,872.732,873.949,Are you going to answer my question?
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,884.122,890.693,"I believe the Court has to give the meaning that the Court believes, because this is a federal question."
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.315,1039.79,And your rule is that this applies to any foreign corporation that has not appointed an agent for service of process within the state.
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1039.79,1055.149,"--Respectfully, I believe that that's what the treaty intended and that is, it was the huge mischief and evil which was sought to be overcome here is, indeed, overcome by this very, very simple procedure."
1987.86-1052,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.149,1057.001,Let me ask you one more question.
1987.86-1052,0,27898,herbert_rubin,,1074.077,1090.138,"Your Honor, again, on the basis of the formal position taken in the note verbal and the amicus brief, I think that the result would be that there would have to be service abroad unless Volkswagen was actually here."
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1580.473,1590.845,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1052,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.778,1692.48,May I interrupt you there?
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1692.48,1693.28,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1052,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1693.28,1696.531,What language was this treaty... what's the treaty language in?
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1696.531,1699.633,"The treaty, you mean the negotiating treaty?"
1987.86-1052,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1699.633,1703.002,What is the official language for interpretation?
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1703.002,1703.418,French and English.
1987.86-1052,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1703.418,1705.42,"And the word, occasion."
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1714.56,1716.095,I would say that there's an opportunity to serve abroad.
1987.86-1052,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1719.23,1724.368,"Well, if you read occasion to mean opportunity, then there sure was an opportunity here and the treaty covers everything."
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1724.368,1726.418,--I read occasion to be necessity.
1987.86-1052,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1728.253,1730.605,So you don't rely on plain language.
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1736.04,1743.028,"I read it as necessity because you have to look at the negotiations, the legislative history, the intent, the purpose that--"
1987.86-1052,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.028,1743.98,What's the French text?
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1743.98,1746.53,"--The French text, I think, is it would be a necessity."
1987.86-1052,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1749.432,1750.8,What is the French text?
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1752.317,1754.085,"--I don't understand French, but I--"
1987.86-1052,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1754.085,1754.518,But I do.
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1756.62,1761.405,--I would assume the French interpretation might be the same as ours.
1987.86-1052,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1761.405,1763.707,"If it says necessite, you're in good shape, aren't you?"
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1763.707,1764.893,"Yeah, if it's... it would be."
1987.86-1052,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.761,1769.011,But if it says opportune... where we can find it.
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1770.963,1779.2,"I think the French text, it says here--"
1987.86-1052,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1779.2,1783.021,Says where?
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1784.004,1792.174,"--I'm reading, Your Honor, from the Solicitor General brief, who I believe has been able to get the French text interpreted for us."
1987.86-1052,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1794.96,1795.66,What page?
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1795.66,1798.061,"--Page, Justice O'Connor, 14."
1987.86-1052,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.061,1801.446,"Well, I don't want the French text interpreted."
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1803.815,1805.0,"Well, I hope so."
1987.86-1052,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.689,1819.51,"Transmit... it means must be transmitted, doesn't it?"
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1819.51,1820.843,--Must be transmitted?
1987.86-1052,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1884.25,1886.035,Was it to simplify?
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1891.189,1894.308,"Justice, correct, in serving overseas."
1987.86-1052,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1896.26,1899.812,I mean after forty minutes I've been worried about how--
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1899.812,1902.831,--I didn't hear your question.
1987.86-1052,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1902.831,1907.299,"--After forty minutes of argument, I don't understand that it was simplified."
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,1907.299,1909.168,It wouldn't simplify it.
1987.86-1052,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.568,2004.862,"Mr. Ring, do you agree with the SG's position that this treaty did eliminate, however, two things: one, the... what's it called... French practice, notification au parquet, which is sort of you just serve some functionary in France and can sue anybody by doing that."
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,2006.564,2017.722,"I agree that... I can't pronounce it as you do, Justice... but I do agree that the purpose of the convention, it was a fair... and that's why Article 15 and Article 16 were--"
1987.86-1052,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2017.722,2018.222,Just answer.
1987.86-1052,1,32608,jack_samuel_ring,,2018.422,2018.505,--Yes.
1987.86-1052,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2809.781,2823.958,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1052,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2840.218,2843.837,"Well, that isn't the French language exactly, is it?"
1987.86-1052,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2843.837,2845.221,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1052,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2854.144,2856.41,"It says: doit, which is from devoir."
1987.86-1052,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2858.096,2858.512,Yes.
1987.86-1052,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.541,2906.826,When the French do that... how can you strike down the French practice?
1987.86-1052,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2909.295,2911.813,The notification au parquet practice?
1987.86-1052,3,27898,herbert_rubin,,3391.519,3394.804,"If Your Honor, please:"
1987.86-1052,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3534.459,3535.625,But isn't the long arm issue one of service of process?
1987.86-1052,3,27898,herbert_rubin,,3535.625,3536.244,Pardon me?
1987.86-1052,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3536.244,3538.494,But isn't the long arm issue one of service of process?
1987.86-1052,3,27898,herbert_rubin,,3539.946,3543.064,Long arm has to do with amenable--
1987.86-1052,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3543.064,3547.683,"--The question there was whether the service of process was valid as a matter of Illinois law, under the Illinois long arm statute."
1987.86-1052,3,27898,herbert_rubin,,3547.683,3548.968,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1987.86-1052,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3598.817,3599.9,"Thank you, Mr. Rubin."
