1982.81-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.513,We will hear arguments next in North Dakota against the United States.
1982.81-773,0,40691,robert_o_wefald,,36.924,66.397,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this appeal involves a statutory construction of the word 1961 and the constitutionality of certain North Dakota statutes believed by the United States to unconstitutionally interfere with the acquisition of wetland easements for waterfowl production areas in North Dakota's prairie pothole region covering central and northwest North Dakota."
1982.81-773,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,267.722,268.426,Mr. Attorney General--
1982.81-773,0,40691,robert_o_wefald,,268.426,268.863,"--Yes, sir."
1982.81-773,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,268.863,271.051,--prospective in what sense?
1982.81-773,0,40691,robert_o_wefald,,279.547,281.234,"765,000, Your Honor."
1982.81-773,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,281.234,289.559,And approximately the same amount in which they were described as unused or unconsummated.
1982.81-773,0,40691,robert_o_wefald,,294.525,304.708,"What we are suggesting is that there is... that the governor of our state has the right to say, I hereby no longer consent to the acquisition of any easements."
1982.81-773,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,366.371,369.854,"Well, Governor Guy was an able person."
1982.81-773,0,40691,robert_o_wefald,,369.854,371.697,"He certainly was, a good governor."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1652.037,1660.408,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to begin, if I may, with a few concerns that were raised during General Wefald's argument."
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1676.605,1677.074,Who is?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1677.074,1681.229,"--Well, I would say... we would be--"
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1681.229,1686.665,I take it that the Attorney General doesn't claim Governor Guy's consent has ever been revoked.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1686.665,1699.832,"--We would be very pleased if the consent had ever been revoked, but I feel constrained to show you that in a stipulation filed in the District Court, North Dakota took the position that the consents could be cancelled and in fact had been cancelled."
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.832,1700.363,"Well, by whom?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1700.363,1705.987,"They were not specific, but I think--"
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.987,1708.812,"Well, the Attorney General now says the governor's consent has never been revoked."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1708.812,1710.421,--Okay.
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1710.421,1717.669,"And if you were going to satisfy the legislative conditions imposed by the state legislature, you would have to still have a governor's consent, and whose would it be?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1717.669,1728.15,"Well, we would say that we have the consent of Governor Guy, Governor Link, and... of Governor Guy and Governor Link, and that they remain outstanding."
1982.81-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1740.128,1741.55,Where is that stipulation?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1743.877,1744.611,Yes.
1982.81-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1744.611,1746.204,Of the Joint Appendix?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1746.204,1746.547,Yes.
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1788.172,1790.622,Ms. Etkind--
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1790.622,1791.091,Yes.
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1791.091,1813.91,"--supposing that the 1977 statute, instead of reading the way it did, said that the legislature of North Dakota hereby cancels the consent previously given by Governors Guy and Link and forbids any future governor of North Carolina from ever entering into such consents."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1813.91,1820.267,I believe that the legislature of North Dakota could do that on a prospective basis.
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1820.267,1828.591,"If the governor can speak for the state, presumably the legislature can restrict his authority to... under federal law."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1828.591,1836.261,"I believe that the governor needed authority under state law to consent, and if he did not have that authority, then he could not make the consent."
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.261,1842.915,"Well, the stipulation just recites what the state's position is."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1842.915,1843.431,That's right.
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1843.431,1846.696,And it recites your contrary position.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1846.696,1847.258,That's right.
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1847.258,1848.227,And--
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1848.227,1850.054,But it recites their position--
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.054,1856.724,--But it doesn't... but it doesn't explain how the state claims cancellation has been effected.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1856.724,1859.331,"--That's right, but in 19--"
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1859.331,1863.456,Have they ever taken a position in this litigation how it has been effected?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1866.735,1868.187,--I understand that.
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1882.009,1882.54,By whom?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1882.54,1891.365,"--The state... at that point, the state was relying on a 1979 statement by Governor Link."
1982.81-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1906.671,1910.42,"That is somewhat ambiguous at the top of Page 72, is it not?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1910.42,1916.371,"Well, I think they are more like alternative arguments than ambiguous."
1982.81-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1916.371,1926.227,"They say it can legally be cancelled unilaterally by the state, that they have been cancelled, and that even if they have not been cancelled, and so on."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,1926.227,1929.539,"That's right, but I think they were trying to make alternative arguments."
1982.81-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2091.457,2104.328,Are you taking the position that the consent can be revoked within a reasonable time?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2105.465,2121.21,"We have conceded that after a reasonable amount of time for the federal government to act on the consents, they... they perhaps could be revoked, but we say that that is not the case here."
1982.81-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2121.21,2124.037,"Well, on what do you base that theory?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2126.959,2144.825,"No, it was not the position in the courts below, but then we have come a long way from the position in the... The courts below held that we didn't need to get any consent whatsoever, but we believe that that flies in the face of the statutory language, as well as in the face of our consistent administrative practice."
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.65,2161.772,"But your practice has always been to do it in the manner you did it here, namely, county by county, rather than parcel by parcel?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2161.772,2163.896,That's not in the--
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.896,2164.459,Or do you know?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2164.459,2165.864,--I don't know.
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.864,2167.349,Or you have done it both ways?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2167.349,2173.675,"I believe that we have always done it county by county, but that is not in the record, and I can't say for certain."
1982.81-773,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2173.675,2177.594,I interrupted Justice O'Connor.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2178.625,2179.359,Right.
1982.81-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2190.229,2191.385,In waiting 17 years?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2191.385,2192.042,I'm sorry?
1982.81-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2192.042,2195.164,In waiting 17 years to--
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2195.164,2197.398,"Well, in fact, we have not been waiting 17 years."
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2214.017,2224.983,"--Are there some consents executed by Governor Guy, who was the one that executed them in the early sixties, I take it, that still have not been acquired by the government?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2224.983,2230.621,"--That's probably true, because they weren't done on a parcel by parcel area."
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.585,2243.302,So then Justice O'Connor's suggestion of a period of 19 years would apply to those particular ones.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2243.302,2244.755,--To some... to some acreage.
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2267.825,2281.88,"Well, just as the state, I suppose, has to bear the responsibility for the failure of Governor Guy to ask for a copy, if he didn't, I suppose the federal government has to bear the responsibility for the failure of Congress to appropriate money."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2289.659,2304.419,"Well, but even within those constraints, regardless of who is responsible for them, we have gotten consents from the governors up to 1.5 million acres, and until 1977 we exercised a full half of those."
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2307.122,2309.495,"Well, but... what have you done, stockpiled the other half?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2309.495,2310.386,No.
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2319.725,2321.037,You don't have the authority to condemn?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2321.037,2322.771,"--We have the authority, but we have never exercised it."
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2322.771,2323.146,You have never used it.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2323.146,2324.068,Yes.
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2405.675,2407.534,Why do you say that?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2413.002,2428.387,"Well, we believe the full intent of Congress should be, but we believe that the full intent of Congress was that the states had a right to withhold their consent at the outset if that's what they chose to do, or to condition it prospectively, but not to revoke it once it had been given."
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2428.387,2432.352,"Well, I was curious about where you derived the principle of narrow construction."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2432.352,2441.583,"From the fact that in the normal case, we would be able to just go into a state and buy the land."
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2441.583,2444.472,"Well, but Congress has said this isn't going to be the normal case."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2444.472,2454.407,"That's right, but this is a proviso, a limiting proviso at the end of a general enabling provision, and the statutory rule of construction is that such provisions are narrowly construed."
1982.81-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2527.173,2546.87,"I think there is some tension in your argument that the statute has to be narrowly construed, and yet we should interpret is as giving the state a reasonable time within which to revoke, but 19 years is not a reasonable time."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2546.87,2561.347,"Well, I don't think... well, for one thing, our argument doesn't... this case doesn't require finding that the states can revoke after a reasonable period of time, since... if you agree with me that we have not been unreasonable here."
1982.81-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2561.347,2567.532,"Well, that's a question that perhaps this Court isn't equipped to decide."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2567.532,2569.516,The question of the reasonableness?
1982.81-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2569.516,2570.016,Right.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2570.016,2580.059,"I think the Court can look to the state of the record just in the sense of how many acquisitions we have made, with how much money, over the period of time."
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2592.54,2608.813,"Wouldn't you ordinarily have a hearing before some fact-finder on a question such as reasonableness, though, with the focus being on the sort of issues you say, rather than just kind of gleaning from a record that was devoted to focusing on other issues what you can about reasonableness?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2608.813,2616.483,"--In the ordinary course, perhaps that would be... that would be the thing that would be done."
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2628.697,2631.01,"Nineteen years is fine, but 20 would be fatal."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2631.01,2658.216,"If the Secretary could not rely on the continued effectiveness of gubernatorial consents, he would be forced to purchase immediately any land that he could as soon as the governor had consented to its acquisition, last that consent be withdrawn, without being able to weigh the relative merits of potential acquisitions that would have to be purchased out of very limited federal funds."
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2701.23,2712.585,Why didn't he just... why was the... why was the position of North Dakota such a hindrance to the Federal Government?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2712.585,2717.192,"Because we needed their consent, and once they said--"
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.192,2718.035,"Well, why didn't you just get it?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2718.035,2722.519,--After 1977?
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.519,2722.925,Yes.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2722.925,2724.721,They refused to give it after 1977.
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2724.721,2725.283,"No, they didn't."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2726.596,2731.249,There was no question that they were refusing to give it.
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2731.249,2741.667,"well, did you... did North Dakota take the position that there's no way that we'll ever give consent to acquisition of any more wetlands?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2743.542,2748.853,"Well, as I said before, I believe it's been North Dakota's position that it has revoked."
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2748.853,2749.915,"Well, it has revoked."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2758.413,2763.551,Governor Link said in 1979 that he would not consent to any further wetland acquisition.
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.551,2769.001,Even with the consent... even satisfying the conditions?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2769.001,2773.67,"Well, he was tieing it to the Garrison diversion project, which... it's a completely different, completely separate matter."
1982.81-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2789.259,2801.864,"Well, Ms. Etkind, why is this one thing, this one question of whether the present Governor or perhaps his predecessor will or will not consent, will or will revoke, so obscure in this record?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2819.559,2821.479,I don't think that's the case.
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2826.104,2833.741,"Well, has he ever proposed... have you ever gone to the Governor, Olson or to Link, and said, here's a tract, a specific tract of land we want to acquire, give us your consent?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2833.741,2836.786,"Well, that was done with respect to fees, yes."
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2843.722,2846.548,By the Governor?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2847.377,2853.311,"Well, they've been refused since... they were returned in '79, so they've been... I'm not sure when Olson took over."
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.311,2855.419,"Well, it's the Governor's consent that you needed."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2855.419,2856.216,That's right.
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2856.216,2859.245,"Were they turned down, the specific tracts turned down, by the Governor?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2859.245,2859.792,Yes.
1982.81-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2872.678,2879.004,"On the question of revocable and irrevocable, that's what we have to decide."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2885.752,2886.61,That's right.
1982.81-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2886.61,2888.921,You couldn't operate without it?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2888.921,2889.765,That's right.
1982.81-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2889.765,2892.935,Was it your duty to get it irrevocable?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2892.935,2894.107,We believe that we did.
1982.81-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2894.107,2897.653,"Well, I don't see the word ""irrevocable"" there."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2897.653,2899.589,He consented to any wetlands.
1982.81-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2899.589,2901.666,"But I mean, the word ""irrevocable"" is not there."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2901.666,2903.104,"No, the word is not there."
1982.81-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2903.104,2905.072,"Well, isn't that your duty?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2911.71,2917.411,Perhaps they could have been more artfully drawn.
1982.81-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2917.411,2927.75,So you don't think the state unreasonable in saying the failure of you to do it leaves you outside?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2927.75,2929.578,"Oh, I do think that is unreasonable."
1982.81-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2929.578,2936.542,"But you said it was a reasonable time, and you will decide what is a reasonable time."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2936.542,2939.51,"Well, the Court can decide what is a reasonable time."
1982.81-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2956.565,2959.159,"Well, suppose the present Governor revokes it."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2961.252,2963.532,If the present Governor revokes?
1982.81-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2963.532,2964.282,Yes.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2964.282,2971.919,"I think we can't purchase, if he could, if he had the power to revoke and he revoked."
1982.81-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2971.919,2990.036,"He issues an executive order and says, by this order I revoke any alleged signed paper you have on your stationery that a former Governor signed."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2990.036,2992.458,I believe that's exactly the question before this Court.
1982.81-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2992.458,2993.364,"Well, could he do it?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,2993.364,2995.893,"No, he cannot do it."
1982.81-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2995.893,2999.783,"You'd take him to court if he did it now, I take it?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3001.735,3003.454,We believe we've taken him to court.
1982.81-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3003.454,3009.249,"Well, if it's a subsequent development on this posture, if it's done subsequent to this day."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3009.249,3011.06,That's right.
1982.81-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3011.06,3011.903,That's a new event.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3011.903,3012.684,That's right.
1982.81-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3012.684,3013.762,And you'd take him to court then.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3013.762,3014.403,That's right.
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3014.403,3019.698,"You'd try to hold him in contempt, wouldn't you, for violating an outstanding injunction?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3019.698,3020.542,I'm sorry?
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3020.542,3022.994,Wouldn't you try to hold him in contempt if he did it now?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3027.96,3031.208,I'm not sure that there's an injunction outstanding.
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3031.208,3034.644,"Well, at least there's a judgment that says that he has already consented."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3034.644,3035.051,That's right.
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3035.051,3036.752,And he has no right to revoke.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3038.205,3038.751,That's right.
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3038.751,3042.344,I would think he'd think twice before he did it now.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3042.344,3043.406,I would hope so.
1982.81-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3043.406,3053.339,"But it sure would standing states' rights up on its edge if you say that the Federal Government can tell a Governor, you can't sign a paper."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3053.339,3054.964,You can't revoke.
1982.81-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3057.417,3058.354,I understand.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3079.938,3085.811,"I think that's an accurate reflection of the stipulation, and I think it's an accurate reflection of the way this case has been litigated all the way through."
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3119.579,3133.135,"Ms. Etkind, suppose you submitted a particular tract to the Governor now and he consented, but that the legislative conditions were not complied with."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3136.931,3138.306,That I could go ahead and purchase it?
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3138.306,3138.946,Yes.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3138.946,3140.898,The federal--
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3140.898,3146.693,What's the United States' position with respect to the relationship between the legislation and the power of the Governor to consent?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3146.693,3157.219,--The legislation itself works at least a partial revocation of the prior consent.
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3157.219,3165.496,"So you think the Governor's consent, future consents, must be consistent with and comply with the state legislation, the '77 legislation?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3165.496,3171.995,"Well, it's our position that they don't have to comply with it, that the '77 legislation is void."
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3171.995,3172.98,I understand.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3185.021,3185.615,Right.
1982.81-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3185.615,3192.674,"But when you go get the Governor's consent, do you have to get a consent on conditions that are consistent with the state legislature?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3197.704,3206.559,"If you agree with us that the Governor... I mean, if you disagree with us and you say that the Governor can revoke, then I believe that we would have to comply with the state statute."
1982.81-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3206.559,3212.714,I thought you took the position that at least compliance prospectively was required.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3212.714,3214.619,"Oh, clearly, yes."
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3214.619,3219.491,"Well, but you're not saying that as to land where you claim you already have a consent."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3229.738,3232.19,"If that consent is valid, which we believe--"
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3232.19,3238.578,"Then you say the legislative conditions that require you to reimburse them for an environmental impact statement and all that sort of thing, that's invalid?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3238.578,3239.015,--Exactly.
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3239.015,3243.216,What about the 99-year restriction on the easement; is that equally invalid?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3243.216,3244.653,That is equally invalid.
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.653,3248.824,"Is that geared to this particular program, the way these other things are?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3256.087,3257.056,That's right.
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3265.709,3275.828,But isn't there a justification for that rule that may not apply to some of these other conditions that place specific burdens on this program?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3275.828,3277.687,"Well, I think there's two problems with it."
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3287.106,3299.975,"well, but they would argue, I suppose, that what you've got a consent to is to acquire in accordance with the otherwise valid laws of the state of North Dakota that do not specifically burden wildlife land any differently than it burdens anything else."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3299.975,3305.91,"--Well, we would say that those statutes that were in effect at the time the consent was given, but not after-enacted statutes."
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3305.91,3315.156,"Well, supposing they passed a new recording statute that said every transfer of real property has to be recorded with the secretary of state instead of the country recorder of deed or something like that."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3316.594,3326.763,"Well, I think that would be on a different footing, because this particular statute has a particularly adverse impact on the acquisition program."
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3348.721,3356.109,"But they counter by saying, well, that may be better, but you have for a long time acquired a lot of easements for lesser periods, such as 20 years and 30 years."
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3356.109,3356.89,--That's not true.
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3356.89,3357.765,"Oh, isn't it?"
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3357.765,3362.122,The vast majority of our easements are perpetual easements.
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3365.418,3367.074,What is in the record on that point?
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3367.074,3368.79,What is in the record is reflected in our brief.
1982.81-773,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3371.242,3377.163,If it's in your brief I'll find it.
1982.81-773,1,17596,barbara_e_etkind,,3377.678,3399.311,"In particular, North Dakota Centennial Code Section 20.10218.3 purports to suspend gubernatorial consent to federal acquisition of any land or interest in land with money from the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund."
1982.81-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3411.493,3413.837,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Attorney General?"
1982.81-773,2,40691,robert_o_wefald,,3413.837,3416.07,"Yes, sir, I do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-773,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3472.751,3476.466,Mr. Attorney General.
1982.81-773,2,40691,robert_o_wefald,,3476.466,3476.95,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-773,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3476.95,3481.215,Is the present Governor Olson the former Attorney General of your state?
1982.81-773,2,40691,robert_o_wefald,,3481.215,3481.793,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3481.793,3487.245,"Well, did Governor revoke or not?"
1982.81-773,2,40691,robert_o_wefald,,3487.245,3495.897,"Governor Link... we cannot find a single document where Governor Link said, I revoke these consents signed by myself and governor Guy."
1982.81-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3495.897,3515.435,"But if he said, I will never... I will not agree to any further acquisitions, if some piece of land the United States claimed was covered by a prior consent and Governor Link says, I will not agree to that, has he in effect revoked or not?"
1982.81-773,2,40691,robert_o_wefald,,3515.435,3522.058,The only fair reading of that statement made by Governor Link is that it relates to the fee lands and not to the easements.
1982.81-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3524.338,3532.523,"You still say, then, that the prior consents have never been revoked by a Governor?"
1982.81-773,2,40691,robert_o_wefald,,3532.523,3534.96,"--There is no written document to that effect, that's correct."
1982.81-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3534.96,3536.599,Or no conduct by them.
1982.81-773,2,40691,robert_o_wefald,,3536.599,3540.473,"There's plenty of conduct to the effect, but there is no written document."
1982.81-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3540.473,3540.755,That they revoked?
1982.81-773,2,40691,robert_o_wefald,,3540.755,3541.411,Yes.
1982.81-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3545.378,3547.908,"Well, the Eighth Circuit said they were revoked, too."
1982.81-773,2,40691,robert_o_wefald,,3547.908,3548.907,Yes.
1982.81-773,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3551.579,3555.045,"In your argument on direct you said they weren't revoked, I thought."
1982.81-773,2,40691,robert_o_wefald,,3555.045,3562.48,"--Well, they are not revoked through an action of our Governor where he signs a paper saying, I hereby revoke these particular previous consents."
1982.81-773,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3562.48,3567.384,But you've taken the position that the legal effect is they've been revoked.
1982.81-773,2,40691,robert_o_wefald,,3567.384,3567.993,Correct.
1982.81-773,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3567.993,3573.288,"That's the position you've taken throughout this litigation until this afternoon, right?"
1982.81-773,2,40691,robert_o_wefald,,3573.288,3576.49,"In terms of the Governor's signature, that's correct."
1982.81-773,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3576.49,3585.173,We should judge the case on the ground that North Dakota's legal position is that the consents have purported to have been revoked.
1982.81-773,2,40691,robert_o_wefald,,3585.173,3587.047,"Well, that's correct."
1982.81-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3611.991,3613.474,"Thank you, counsel."
