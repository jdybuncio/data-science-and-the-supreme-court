1958.350,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,10.538,13.81,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,2917.277,2923.73,Mr. Chief Justice and Mr. Associate Justices may it please the Court.
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2946.469,2947.052,Are you going ask that --
1958.350,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2947.052,2947.491,From just --
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2947.491,2957.615,"-- if any rule of law that isn't expressed in absolute terms, you get back that you draw a line doesn't mean that there aren't -- that you can completely draw a line?"
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,2957.615,2960.049,"Exactly, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3027.498,3031.331,That isn't true of a case 500 odd people in this land.
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3033.576,3034.021,Mr. --
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3034.021,3034.556,-- hill as I say.
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3034.556,3043.318,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, there -- I -- my next comment was to be that there are exemptions to that rule."
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3055.365,3057.961,How many judges are there in this land?
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3057.961,3064.599,The second exemption that has been made to the General Rule is in the case of courts.
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3064.599,3066.443,That's not in any constitution.
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3066.443,3069.096,It's not in the course -- in the Constitution.
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3069.096,3069.531,All right.
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3069.531,3072.73,It is court made.
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3101.518,3103.563,But do you think that's the technical rule?
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3103.563,3104.509,I think it's a rule.
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3106.352,3111.112,I guess I know politics to protect themselves and protect themselves out of general responsibility?
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3111.112,3112.069,"No, Your Honor."
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3112.951,3114.771,"It's got some reason, doesn't it?"
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3114.771,3115.736,"It has reason, but high --"
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3115.736,3117.989,They have policy as to whether the relevant policy are --
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3117.989,3143.941,"It has policy behind it and that's what the -- what the Solicitor General said, that this is a question of public policy, to what extent must the right of the citizen to his quite good name and his reputation all the way in face of the necessity for immunity on the part of some officials to speak their minds and to make their act without fear of being hauled in the courtroom."
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3144.058,3145.945,"When you say necessity, you mean that?"
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3145.945,3146.665,I beg your pardon?
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3146.665,3152.783,"When you say necessity, you mean courts couldn't function if they didn't have that immunity?"
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3152.783,3155.318,It has been so held that it is necessary for --
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3155.318,3155.982,(Voice Overlap) --
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3155.982,3158.717,"-- them to hold, have that immunity."
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3158.717,3163.741,It's been held that they haven't got the immunity but it couldn't be held they couldn't function without it.
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3163.741,3164.332,"No, it's never been said --"
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3164.332,3164.679,That would go against --
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3164.679,3165.476,-- the court could not --
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3165.476,3166.066,-- that fact.
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3166.066,3171.933,"-- function without it, but it was held by the courts that judges should have this immunity."
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3171.933,3174.02,Why?
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3174.02,3187.391,For the very reason that -- it was mentioned a moment ago that they could not speak out fearlessly in the cases saying if they thought they would be held in the Court.
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3187.391,3192.895,Do you think public administrators are more -- ought to be held to a higher degree of fearlessness than justice?
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3192.895,3201.186,"No, Your Honor, but there is a distinction between judges and deputy directors are in control officers."
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3203.182,3207.708,But is it really looking them in the -- little justice of the peace.
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3207.708,3209.073,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3240.686,3244.345,How to fire a (Voice Overlap) people are constantly fired from the public office.
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3244.345,3266.209,And people are constantly put back into their jobs because several lawyers come along and prove that the regulations have been violated or the Civil Service Act has been violated or this was done because of somebody is in discretion or it was abuse of his discretion.
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3320.249,3326.478,"I'm sure, more, lower officials have been fired than members of the cabinet have been fired the members of the cabinet have been fired in our history."
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3326.478,3333.711,No doubt and I think there are cases in answer to a question that was raised earlier.
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3649.474,3659.416,"Was this fellow, this officer a civil service man, who worried about civil service rule? Is this covered in his position?"
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3659.416,3660.009,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3661.727,3662.069,"No, but --"
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3662.069,3675.822,"-- and he was in the classified service of -- rather than being on accepted status, he was a civil service employee with status."
1958.350,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3675.822,3677.809,Who appointed him in his place?
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3677.809,3691.667,"He was appointed by the Director of the Economic Stabilization Administration who at that time was acting, Mr. (Inaudible) who later replaced by Dr. Fleming who is now secretary of ATW."
1958.350,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3691.667,3705.396,Even with -- be entitled to the (Inaudible) Civil Service Regulation Commission on dismissal?
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3705.396,3712.383,"Mr. Justice Clark, I'm embarrassed because I don't know whether the petitioner was or was not a veteran."
1958.350,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3842.167,3845.264,They were in the other civil service --
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3845.264,3864.824,Neither of the two employees who are here as respondents have gotten preference or it would not have gone to the Civil Service Commission and could have gone there only on the question of a violation of regulations or whether it was an abusive discretion to fire.
1958.350,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3884.352,3886.398,You say these people were reinstated?
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3886.398,3889.409,They were reinstated.
1958.350,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,3889.409,3891.864,"Now, were they entitled to hearing or not?"
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3891.864,3894.527,Entitled to a hearing --
1958.350,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3894.527,3895.583,These people that were --
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,3895.583,3909.733,"They had a hearing on the suspension before a board appointed by the Director of the ESA at the -- when they were fired and they appealed, the Director of the ESA did not ask for a hearing."
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4002.509,4005.899,May then I ask you one thing -- one further step.
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4016.851,4019.583,"Yes, but the parties would be different."
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4028.23,4030.12,"Then may you, sir."
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4048.536,4058.219,"I think that under the decided cases and the way the law exists before this Court acts, it's a matter of rank."
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4058.219,4059.041,"Now, why?"
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4059.041,4059.962,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4108.836,4116.481,"Not disbarred, that he was simply barred by reasonable of the fact that he's an employee of the department within two years."
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4116.481,4117.225,Debarred.
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4117.225,4118.83,"Debarred, yes."
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4118.83,4123.243,"And that action had been taken by the secretary, debarred him."
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4184.277,4206.432,"Now, as I understand the distinctions you made there has to do only with the extent of the publication, but do you contend that in the Ickes's case, the secretary was exonerated simply because he was secretary that is on rank or because he was performing a duty incident results?"
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4206.432,4222.244,"As I read the decision of that court I think it was on rank and that he had a duty as the political appointee, as the head of the agency."
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4245.256,4252.791,"Mr. Scott, you're -- the Ickes case shed some light on our problem because Mr. Ickes was a true guy."
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4277.825,4283.284,It might possibly although I don't know -- I have no time when he focused on administrator.
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4285.466,4285.674,Why did he --
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4285.674,4289.82,-- Mr. Justice Vinson in writing the opinion said that it was as a cabinet officer.
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4289.82,4293.24,"You already spoke vividly in what ever he spoke, didn't he?"
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4293.24,4298.695,I so recall.
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4357.954,4358.72,Now --
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4358.72,4359.658,When --
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4359.658,4362.707,-- is -- is why is that?
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4371.059,4373.761,It's the duty of the official to report up.
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4373.761,4375.065,Yes.
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4375.065,4387.677,"Now, how high do you have to go before Glass versus Ickes would apply on the decided cases?"
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4400.868,4403.606,They didn't have press release in those days.
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4411.819,4413.85,I don't go back to Cleveland's time --
1958.350,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4413.85,4414.32,That was Vilas.
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4414.32,4419.489,-- and I don't know anybody ever issued a press release at that time or not.
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4497.574,4505.282,"Now, somebody had to make an explanation, however, to Senator Williams and the others who complained about this conduct in the Senate."
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4506.483,4521.617,"I wouldn't have had the head of the agency do it, either the head of the agency or in his absence the petitioner here or a letter was prepared for him and it was signed by his secretary and sent it to Senator Williams."
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4658.402,4658.801,I --
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4658.801,4659.328,-- certainly.
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4659.328,4679.864,"I hesitate to interrupt you again, but suppose that this petitioner had written only to some (Inaudible) the very matter contained in the complaint of press release is libelous."
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4688.174,4689.375,"Yes, Your Honor."
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4689.375,4694.422,"Now, would the letter have been absolutely privileged in your judgment?"
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4694.422,4695.602,"I think not, sir."
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4697.361,4703.849,"Now, if it had been written by his superior, the Director of --"
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4703.849,4704.568,Economic Stabilization Administration.
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4704.568,4709.013,"Economic Stabilization Administration, do you say that it would still not have been?"
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4709.013,4711.593,"Under the -- the decided cases, it would not have been."
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4711.593,4714.86,"Now, the latter was appointed by the President of United States."
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4714.86,4716.854,ESA Director -- was.
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4716.854,4722.657,"Now, if it had been done by the President of United States, would he have immunity?"
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4722.657,4723.106,Yes.
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4723.106,4724.585,And why?
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4724.585,4730.443,Because he's the Chief Executive.
1958.350,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4755.629,4777.755,"I noticed that Judge Danaher addressed in his dissent in the first case, the department is, that the -- the executive power had been delegated down to the Secretary of Economic Stabilization to this petitioner."
1958.350,1,18026,byron_n_scott,,4781.547,4798.648,The Director of the Economic Stabilization Administrator did not receive all of these powers and transfer all of these powers without reserving any to his Director of the Office Rent Stabilization.
1958.350,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4963.986,4965.765,Mr. Friedman.
1958.350,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,4965.765,4969.28,"Mr. Justice, and may it please the Court."
1958.350,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5151.613,5161.261,"Mr. Friedman, if the test is not ranked that -- what is the test, job content or job responsibility or --"
1958.350,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5161.261,5164.882,Take basically the -- the kind of function this man is performing.
1958.350,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5178.351,5182.737,And that responsibility is certainly not in terms of the number of people subordinate to him.
1958.350,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5182.737,5182.782,No.
1958.350,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5182.782,5184.326,You don't mean that.
1958.350,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5188.254,5188.933,That is correct.
1958.350,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5188.933,5190.175,That he has discretion?
1958.350,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5190.175,5191.384,He has discretion.
1958.350,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5201.843,5208.561,So it's on that basis that you would contend that he should have it -- this petitioner should have absolute immunity.
1958.350,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5208.561,5209.671,That is correct.
1958.350,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5209.671,5220.78,"And in the succeeding case as I understand it, it's going to be the position of counsel for the petitioner that for the exact opposite reason that he has no discretion, he should have absolute immunity, is that correct?"
1958.350,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,5226.914,5230.266,"No, I think -- I think there's a difference, Mr. Justice."
