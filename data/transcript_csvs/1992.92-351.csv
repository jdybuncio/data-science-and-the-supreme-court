1992.92-351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.998,"We'll hear argument next in No. 92-351, Leonard Heller v. Samuel Doe."
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,49.903,56.509,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,190.815,200.233,"What does that mean, Mr. Moore, to say a decision to place the children from a facility into a community setting?"
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,202.779,209.668,--The commonwealth's services for the mentally retarded are operated through the Cabinet for Human Resources.
1992.92-351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,223.193,229.253,All I did was ask you to explain two phrases you used in an earlier statement.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,231.8,232.954,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,263.458,268.831,A more community like setting is where they would have more freedom than they have in the so-called facility?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,268.831,271.564,"That's an issue which is subject to debate, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,305.144,311.906,"Well, why don't you just somehow get to the heart of your case then?"
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,311.906,322.965,"If Your Honor please, based upon the decisions of the lower courts, the Kentucky legislature adopted a whole new set of procedures for the mentally retarded."
1992.92-351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,357.56,360.794,Did you say participation?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,364.434,368.104,"It permits them to become parties, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,369.713,371.118,But that permits them.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,371.118,372.008,Permits them--
1992.92-351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,372.008,375.912,And that provision was held a denial of equal protection or due process.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,375.912,378.411,"--It was held to be both, Your Honor, denial of both."
1992.92-351,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,430.75,441.37,"Mr. Moore, if heightened scrutiny were applied, as was suggested by the plurality in that Foucha case, do you think you could prevail?"
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,441.37,448.977,"Your Honor, I think that we can and should prevail regardless of the--"
1992.92-351,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,448.977,453.443,How would you justify it then under any higher standard of--
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,453.443,474.576,"--Under any type of review, the issue for equal protection purposes is whether or not the legislature could first distinguish a group of people as a class, and this Court has held that that's clearly appropriate with regard to the mentally retarded."
1992.92-351,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,548.126,559.309,--Does Kentucky law require the parent of a mentally retarded child to continue to provide support after the age of majority?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,559.309,570.882,"There is a Kentucky statute which requires parental support for any child who is determined disabled beyond the age of majority, yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.882,574.506,Beyond the age of majority.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,579.018,580.096,"You do, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,586.141,589.781,Even after the child is put in an institution.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,589.781,590.858,That's correct.
1992.92-351,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,590.858,597.074,"Now, does the Americans with Disabilities Act... is that relevant here?"
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,606.415,610.601,"Your Honor, we believe that it does not."
1992.92-351,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,610.601,611.21,That it does?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,611.21,611.663,Does not.
1992.92-351,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,611.663,612.194,Does not.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,612.194,613.304,"Does not, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.055,687.663,Did the court of appeals rely on anything other than the Equal Protection Clause?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,687.663,699.142,"The court of... with regard to the participation of parents, guardians, and immediate family members, yes, Your Honor, the court of appeals said that that was also a violation of due process."
1992.92-351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,703.094,705.078,Did it rely on any statutory basis?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,705.078,707.999,"No, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.997,716.963,May I ask a question about... while we're on the ability to appeal?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,766.147,767.318,"It is, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,768.036,770.489,And which class are we arguing about here?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,771.364,779.203,"Your Honor, we're describing the first class, the parents and immediate family members."
1992.92-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,832.713,839.086,"--Mr. Moore, I just want to be sure I understand one thing."
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,865.825,871.792,The issues that you've described are the issues that are specified in the petition for writ of certiorari.
1992.92-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,871.792,872.339,Right.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,872.339,880.288,"We believe that the other issue is an overriding issue which permeates the entire case, and it was also the result of a clear error below."
1992.92-351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,890.988,896.47,And what provision is it of rule 24 that you think authorizes us to do that?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,896.47,902.468,"My understanding is that if there's a matter of clear error in the courts below, this Court can go ahead and address that as well."
1992.92-351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.468,906.263,Even if it's not presented in the petition for certiorari?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,906.263,908.731,"That's my understanding of rule 24, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,946.262,951.978,"Your point is that some mentally ill people can be committed voluntarily, but that isn't true of mentally retarded."
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,966.926,992.821,"Your Honor, the procedures that were in effect in Kentucky at the time the litigation began and weren't in effect until required otherwise by the court, were that the guardian of a mentally ill person could, as well, admit their ward on the guardian's substituted consent, provided there was a review by an independent physician at the facility, for treatment at a State mental hospital."
1992.92-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,996.117,999.256,"I'm not sure that answers my questions because today the procedures are different, as I understand it."
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,999.256,1001.287,They're different because of--
1992.92-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1001.287,1002.458,The burden of proof is different in the two.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1020.998,1022.56,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1022.56,1025.355,I don't think you've really said very much about that issue.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1025.355,1034.039,"If Your Honor please, in the Addington case, this Court held that the clear and convincing standard of evidence was the appropriate standard."
1992.92-351,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1041.896,1047.627,Did the Court say that a higher standard could not be employed by the States?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1047.627,1060.592,"--It did not say that it could not, but it appeared to chastise the States who had that standard, and most of the States, except for Kentucky, with regard to admission of mentally ill persons, has reduced their standard to the clear and convincing standard."
1992.92-351,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1060.592,1061.386,Yes.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1077.663,1084.253,"As a general rule, Your Honor, it would appear that it would be easier to diagnose."
1992.92-351,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1087.033,1091.329,Would that justify a different standard for admission?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1091.329,1097.31,"--That could be a factor relied upon in justifying a different standard of admission, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1097.31,1104.543,"You've made several claims of what the difference between the two groups were, and they were all rejected by the court of appeals."
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1104.543,1105.448,"They have been, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1106.713,1109.056,But you still stick by them I suppose.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1109.056,1110.088,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.085,1122.472,"Well, tell us again how they are different or tell us... finally."
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1122.472,1123.738,--Okay.
1992.92-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.899,1200.363,"Does Kentucky law require parents to support the mentally ill past the age of majority, as well as the mentally retarded, or just the mentally retarded, or both?"
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1200.363,1202.769,--The law does not refer to either one directly.
1992.92-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1206.939,1207.781,Disabled.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1211.56,1217.184,"It would cover a small percentage of the mentally ill, Your Honor, but it would not cover the majority of the mentally ill persons."
1992.92-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.184,1220.526,And it would cover all of the mentally retarded at issue here.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1220.526,1221.635,"Yes, it would, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1243.908,1256.558,"Mr. Moore, your argument... if I understand your argument, it is that it is easier to make an accurate and sound determination of mental retardation than it is to make such a determination about mental illness."
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1257.371,1263.353,"Your Honor, it would appear that that is the case, that it--"
1992.92-351,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1263.353,1266.993,Why then is that an argument for having a lower standard of commitment?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1274.817,1282.548,"--If Your Honor please, it was not my intention to argue necessarily that that supported the decision to have a lower standard for the mentally retarded."
1992.92-351,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1308.913,1314.8,"Well, I understand that, but it's still, as I understand it, your position that it is appropriate to have a lower standard."
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1314.8,1315.941,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1315.941,1316.894,All right.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1322.065,1325.375,That is one of our authorities for that.
1992.92-351,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1325.375,1329.234,What does Addington got to do with an equal protection distinction?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1329.234,1330.171,Okay.
1992.92-351,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1346.241,1365.266,"Okay, and the... but the issue here is whether you have a difference which justifies a different standard for valuing human liberty and valuing the justification for limiting it, and I don't see what Addington has to do with that at all."
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1365.266,1379.853,"The Addington case determined that there was... there were reasons why the clear and convincing standard should be utilized, that that was the best--"
1992.92-351,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1379.853,1394.097,"Okay, but Kentucky is not utilizing it for mental illness, and the issue here is whether you can utilize a different standard on an issue which deprives someone of liberty depending on the distinction between mental illness and mental retardation."
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1395.924,1404.094,"--The connection, to the extent there is one, Your Honor, is that with regard to the mentally ill, Kentucky has made a mistake."
1992.92-351,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1406.343,1419.29,"And the Equal Protection Clause seems to say that unless you can justify that, either by a rational basis standard, perhaps as you would like it, or by a standard of higher scrutiny, that having made that election, you've got to live with it and you've got to apply it across the board."
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1419.29,1425.927,"--It's the State's position that if you apply the Equal Protection Clause in that fashion, that it leads to a bad result in this case."
1992.92-351,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1425.927,1431.036,"Well, it leads to a bad result in every case in which the Equal Protection Clause applies then, doesn't it?"
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1433.785,1440.218,My understanding of equal protection is that it does not require an additional burden on a party.
1992.92-351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1454.105,1464.912,"Mr. Moore, several members of the Court have asked you to explain, as simply as you can, why Kentucky justifies one standard for the mentally ill and another for the mentally retarded."
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1469.114,1470.629,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1482.437,1486.529,That is not a reason for distinguishing the two classes.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1497.134,1502.771,"--Your Honor, as I understand the Equal Protection Clause, the focus should be on the purpose, the reason for the legislation."
1992.92-351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1518.547,1521.999,"Yes, but what's that got to do with the standard of proof for involuntary commitment?"
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1521.999,1530.871,--The purpose of the commitment is to make available to the respondent in that proceeding the services that the State is providing.
1992.92-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1530.871,1537.259,"Mr. Moore, why do you insist on rejecting the distinction that Justice Souter suggested?"
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1557.812,1558.812,That's correct.
1992.92-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1558.812,1559.656,Isn't that right?
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1559.656,1560.062,That's correct.
1992.92-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.062,1568.761,"And, therefore, by having a lower burden of proof, you're not as likely to commit very many people who really aren't mentally retarded--"
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1568.761,1569.23,That's right.
1992.92-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1569.23,1571.182,--because it's a lot easier to tell.
1992.92-351,0,45488,william_k_moore,,1574.884,1576.414,"That is a justification, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1580.397,1581.053,Very well.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,1583.646,1594.141,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1623.378,1642.669,"What about the reason that Mr. Moore gave in answer to Justice Scalia's question, that if, in fact, it's easier to make a diagnosis of the mentally retarded than it is of the mentally ill, that justifies a difference in the burden of proof because you're less likely to make a mistake with one than you are with the other?"
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,1642.669,1654.804,"Chief Justice, in response to your question, we would agree that Justice Scalia presented a very good question, but what's here is not the case."
1992.92-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1678.483,1685.323,But all you need is a rational basis for distinguishing between one class and the other.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,1691.212,1700.146,We would submit that equal protection should be viewed under the case of Foucha which said that when something is at stake--
1992.92-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1700.146,1702.145,Are you referring to one of the opinions in Foucha?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,1702.145,1704.175,"--The plurality opinion, Your Honor."
1992.92-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1704.175,1707.736,Why do you think it should be viewed in light of the plurality opinion in Foucha?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,1707.736,1721.496,"Because what Foucha was dealing with is exactly what we're dealing here, a fundamental interest at stake, a massive curtailment of liberty that this Court had recognized as early as Humphrey v. Cady and in Addington and O'Connor, and most recently last year in the plurality opinion of Foucha."
1992.92-351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1742.582,1756.279,"Well, I would think the Due Process Clause would certainly justify this Court's previous decisions that say to involuntarily commit, you need to have at least a clear and convincing evidence standard."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,1761.933,1762.948,"That's correct, and--"
1992.92-351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1762.948,1763.339,All right.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,1788.813,1789.609,--That's correct.
1992.92-351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1789.609,1796.373,We're not here to argue that it isn't a protected liberty interest and that they have to have a higher standard of proof.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,1797.387,1798.824,That's correct.
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1842.558,1858.863,"--that if you win this case on the standard of proof issue, that I'm not sure you've won very much because that will give the State the option of either raising the standard of proof in one case or lowering it in the other."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,1861.003,1864.126,"--Well, Justice White, I would agree and disagree."
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1870.842,1871.217,Which a lot of States have done.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,1871.217,1873.606,"--Well, the one thing... two things I'd point out."
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1939.439,1956.87,Why does the... why do you object so much to the presence of the... of family or guardians in the mentally retarded situation?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,1956.87,1963.258,The injection of the third persons is simply a due process and an equal protection argument.
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1974.036,1978.299,"Well, what kind of participation are you talking about that is so significant?"
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,1980.189,1980.704,--Exactly.
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.141,1983.765,And they have the right to appeal and that?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,1983.765,1985.39,"--Exactly, Justice White."
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1994.293,2002.852,"But when... if the parents are available in the mentally retarded case, do they also appoint a guardian?"
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2002.852,2004.023,--Not always.
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.314,2033.528,"So, you... so, if the parents can't become parties, other than... they can't do anything but witnesses, that means then there has to be a guardian appointed."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2033.528,2040.307,"Well, in Kentucky under the involuntary statutory scheme, the mentally retarded, as well as the mentally ill, have a right to an attorney."
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2048.599,2054.973,"What do they have to prove for an involuntary commitment, that he's a danger to him or herself or others?"
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2054.973,2055.551,Exactly.
1992.92-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2065.857,2066.388,"Well, excuse me."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2075.822,2076.808,That would be correct.
1992.92-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2076.808,2077.056,Okay.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2100.048,2104.734,"First, Justice Scalia, we're talking about adults, and what we have here in Kentucky is an adversary proceeding."
1992.92-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.734,2104.983,Incompetent adults.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2123.927,2126.459,I respectfully disagree on a couple counts.
1992.92-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.459,2127.021,"Well, then who appeals it?"
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2127.021,2133.627,"One is when you come to the involuntary commitment proceeding, there has been no adjudication of a guardian."
1992.92-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2141.749,2142.312,Why has an attorney been appointed then?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2145.107,2146.263,The attorney--
1992.92-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2146.263,2150.09,Why don't the parents select the attorney or the incompetent person?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2150.09,2158.477,"--In Kentucky... and we agree that it is unique, what they have done is they have set up basically a criminal proceeding, and in fact, the rules say this will function as a criminal proceeding."
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.394,2172.174,How does he get into the act?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2172.174,2173.096,The county attorney?
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.096,2173.362,Yes.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2173.362,2173.955,By statute.
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.955,2177.391,"Well, I know, but when what happens does he get into the act?"
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2178.922,2181.281,"No, and all circumstances--"
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2181.281,2181.546,When?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2181.906,2182.468,--At the very beginning.
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.623,2188.558,"I know, but how does the county attorney even know about this person?"
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2188.558,2195.071,"--In practicality, Justice White, what happens is a person can take the petition out to have an adult committed to one of these four institutions."
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2195.071,2195.446,You mean any person.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2195.446,2195.977,Any person.
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2196.915,2197.149,Any person.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2198.023,2199.601,"--Exactly, family, guardian."
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.836,2202.741,So that then there is a petition filed by somebody.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2202.741,2203.209,--Exactly.
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.209,2204.114,All right.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2204.114,2216.0,"And that petition is prosecuted by the county attorney in the county in which the mentally retarded person resides, and it's held before a judge and, if the mentally retarded person requests it, a jury."
1992.92-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2216.0,2220.655,Does the prosecutor have to prosecute every single petition that's filed?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2220.655,2221.265,Yes.
1992.92-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2221.265,2225.2,He does not have a right to say there are just not sufficient grounds here.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2226.278,2239.381,"I frankly don't know the answer to that, but from the quarterly reports that we've gotten, since the hearings have been conducted since 1986, all cases have been prosecuted."
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.381,2240.818,And how did you get into this case?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2242.755,2246.16,I filed the complaint in 1982.
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2246.16,2247.956,"Are you the... oh, you filed the complaint?"
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2247.956,2249.206,Along with other co-counsel.
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2249.206,2249.612,"Oh, yes."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2249.612,2253.923,"And we represent Samuel Doe, not Sammy Doe, and he's an adult."
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2256.203,2257.312,And this is a class action.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2257.312,2265.715,"This is a class action, and we represent all adults in Kentucky that are potentially facing involuntary confinement in a State institution."
1992.92-351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2265.715,2267.199,Where is Samuel Doe now?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2267.199,2273.477,"Samuel Doe, since the filing of the case, has been released and is in a small residential placement."
1992.92-351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2279.584,2286.925,And are there any named plaintiffs in the class that are presently institutionalized?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2286.925,2288.066,"No, they're not."
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2310.415,2321.863,I suppose you wouldn't be satisfied if Kentucky applied the same rule about the presence of third parties to the mentally ill.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2321.863,2325.799,"Well, we argue that it violates both equal protection and due process."
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2325.799,2326.19,"Well, I know."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2326.752,2327.706,"Exactly, Justice White."
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.706,2332.359,"And so, you would say also I suppose that it violates the due process rights of the mentally ill."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2332.359,2348.634,"That would be true, and the reason that we say that is that the involuntary commitment proceeding is a very narrowly defined procedure where what's at stake is the liberty interests of the individual adult facing commitment and the parens patriae interests of the State."
1992.92-351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2358.458,2359.817,"Well, how wide is it?"
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2362.363,2367.611,--It changes in the statute according to a right the State wants to give persons.
1992.92-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2401.534,2410.157,How are your clients hurt by allowing... by Kentucky allowing certain parents or guardians to appeal?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2410.157,2417.763,"First we would argue under equal protection, that the mentally ill are not similarly burdened in that they are not facing two prosecutors."
1992.92-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2426.884,2430.741,"So, there are two appellants rather than one?"
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2430.741,2433.053,Yes.
1992.92-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2433.053,2434.364,How does that hurt your client?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2441.44,2450.28,"Well, Chief Justice, in trying to determine what does due process require if you look to the Mathews case, the first thing is what's the private interest at stake."
1992.92-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2452.045,2455.591,I thought this was an equal protection argument you were making.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2455.591,2459.324,"--For the parents, it is both an equal protection and a due process."
1992.92-351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2459.324,2470.944,"And what... to show that your clients are some way injured in order to raise either the due process or the equal protection claim, how are they hurt?"
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2470.944,2485.47,We are saying to inject these vaguely defined third parties into the process would upset the balance that Mathews envisions and that Vitek envisions in an involuntary commitment process because what's at stake is the liberty of the adult.
1992.92-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.47,2490.216,"Ms. Miller, suppose all that happens, if this person steps in, is that you get an appeal."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2519.986,2531.185,"Justice Scalia, we would argue that it's still a violation of due process because you're having the mentally retarded adult face another party, face another court."
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.185,2533.528,"No, but there's a lawyer representing the person."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2533.528,2539.479,"That's true, but what we would say is that under Mathews, what interests do these--"
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.479,2550.881,"Well, the lawyer isn't going to be... I suppose if he's representing his or her client, he or she are not going to be put down by parents."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2550.881,2567.123,"--Again, what we would say is looking at the Mathews test... and I'm trying to make sense of this for you... what's at stake for the parents and other vaguely defined third persons, these other authorized representatives, the limited guardians, they have no liberty interest at stake."
1992.92-351,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2567.123,2569.53,"No, but you're... it seems to me you're now making a different argument."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2608.215,2617.494,"We would argue that it violates due process because before you even come into the involuntary commitment process, it skews the balance in favor of commitment."
1992.92-351,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2617.494,2625.834,"Well, but I thought the balance was reflected in the burden of proof, rather than the number of parties who may have the status as such."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2625.834,2631.13,"I think an appropriate analogy here that might help the Court understand, that in the criminal proceeding--"
1992.92-351,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2631.13,2632.206,"Well, how about the point that I just made?"
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2637.627,2642.921,--I think what Mathews was getting at in the second prong is what's the risk under the procedures used.
1992.92-351,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2643.436,2649.715,What's the risk and the risk is assessed in relationship to the burden of proof.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2649.715,2658.338,"--Well, we would say, Justice Souter, that the risk is that that it is tipping the scales in favor of confinement."
1992.92-351,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2658.338,2668.786,You think the burden of proof is in an de facto sense going to vary depending on whether only the county attorney can appeal or the parents can appeal?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2670.629,2672.52,I may be confused on this.
1992.92-351,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2677.766,2696.072,"But you would take... as I understand it, you would take the position that even if the burden of proof for those mentally retarded were beyond a reasonable doubt, that there still would be a due process problem in giving the parents or certain family members party status with the right to appeal."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2696.571,2697.024,--That's correct.
1992.92-351,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2697.024,2697.43,All right.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2712.94,2719.671,"Given that this is a judicial proceeding, and if the burden of proof were beyond a reasonable doubt, it is a much closer call."
1992.92-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2738.991,2749.285,"It would be perfectly good if there were no Double Jeopardy Clause, it seems to me, to say that whenever a criminal is acquitted, a member of the public who believes it wasn't a just verdict can ask for a retrial."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2752.284,2753.611,--It's not an identical analogy.
1992.92-351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.253,2793.564,"Yes, but couldn't... that fact could have been brought out through testimony whether the parent were a party or just a witness, couldn't it?"
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2801.404,2801.607,No.
1992.92-351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2802.997,2807.979,Isn't it also possible there may be cases cases where the parents would sympathize with the mentally retarded person?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2807.979,2819.756,"--That is the truth, but one... in Kentucky one of the things that we've seen in the record here is that parents often have an interest adverse to the liberty interest of the adult facing confinement."
1992.92-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2840.53,2847.667,Do you think the appointed attorney is more likely to have the interest of the person at heart than the parents?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2847.667,2856.693,"We would not say that, but what we are saying is that the attorney in the role of an advocate is the advocate for freedom."
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2859.771,2862.941,"Well, at least the attorney is for the client."
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2863.769,2863.972,--Exactly.
1992.92-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2865.862,2866.502,He's not for the client.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2875.406,2894.398,"Justice Scalia, that may, in fact, be true in an individualized case, but the record shows in Dr. Skarnulis' deposition that 97 to 98 percent of the mentally retarded adults in Kentucky live outside the institution, and for every 1 person in, there's 10 adults out with equally severe handicaps and mental retardation."
1992.92-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2958.216,2960.575,You're talking here severe mental retardation.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2962.464,2963.214,--Justice--
1992.92-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2963.214,2963.605,What are the two categories?
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2964.87,2968.182,"--Justice Scalia, there are four categories: mild, moderate, profound, severe."
1992.92-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2969.071,2971.087,Profound and severe are the only two we're talking about here.
1992.92-351,1,33902,kelly_miller,,2971.46,2972.038,--Absolutely not.
1992.92-351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2999.356,3001.808,I don't understand.
