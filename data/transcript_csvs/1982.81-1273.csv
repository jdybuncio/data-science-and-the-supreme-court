1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.782,"Thank you gentlemen, the case is submitted."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,61.101,74.095,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns the role of the Comptroller General in government procurement, specifically his statutory right to access to records of government contractors... books and records."
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,307.406,309.937,May I ask you what the basis of the nine percent figure is?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,309.937,315.076,"--That's the estimate in the article, I believe, by Professor Reike."
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,315.076,318.403,Was he dealing with the prices the government pays or with retail prices?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,318.403,325.54,He was dealing with... that nine percent figure is not nine percent of a price.
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,328.711,329.977,How did he get these cost figures?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,329.977,331.381,I wish I knew.
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,331.819,334.162,"Well, you don't really know they're right, then, do you?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,335.006,336.708,We don't know that it's nine percent.
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,336.708,339.333,"--So we really shouldn't rely on the nine percent figure, should we?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,339.333,343.487,The custom... the company has not indicated that it's anything higher than nine percent.
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,349.421,351.779,But would your case be any different if it were 90 percent instead of nine percent?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,354.528,372.771,It affects the legal issue in the sense that the Court of Appeals decision has... assuming it is nine percent or something close to it... prevents GAO from getting the vast majority of documents that it needs in order to determine whether the procurement methods involved in this case were the most appropriate ones.
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,372.771,378.097,Your purpose is strictly to improve your procurement methods?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,378.097,379.362,That's our purpose.
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,379.362,396.964,"When you say that prevents the Comptroller General from getting everything it needs, you're not suggesting that Congress in Heik Verba said the Comptroller General can have whatever he needs in a situation like this, are you?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,396.964,397.636,"No, it didn't."
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,407.382,421.003,"And your contention is that the way these costs are allocated, you would have virtually unlimited access to anything because of the way the funds come into the drug companies?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,421.003,422.22,"Well, not to everything."
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,461.174,487.133,"But when you say ""records of non-government work"", wouldn't... because of the non-allocation of costs, wouldn't you necessarily get a fair amount of records of non-government work under your theory that you are entitled to any records that are... or any records of any products that are paid for out of government funds, whatever it is your claim?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,487.133,489.085,"Well, the fact that they co-mingle the funds--"
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,489.085,489.444,Yes.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,493.051,494.082,"--No, not at all."
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,530.131,533.504,"--Well, suppose they have developed a product like, say, Bufferin."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,552.232,562.992,"We don't want the records of their sales to the public other than to determine that there have been substantial sales to the general public, to answer that specific question."
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,562.992,571.879,"Well, that puzzles me, because it would seem to me that comparable sales to private customers might be the most relevant to the determination of whether the government's getting a fair deal."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,571.879,592.45,"Well, under the statutes there is the built-in assumption that a contract that... something that is sold at a catalog price item and is sold in substantial quantity to the general public has a built-in, oh, built-in mechanism for assuming that there has been competition."
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.151,605.116,"Well, then you are not interested in any records pertaining to prices that are below a fair market price established by a catalog or something like that."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,605.116,627.498,"--Well, the point I was getting to is that it may be, in this industry, where they suggest that they pay no attention to their costs when they set their prices... a contention which I suggest is belied by their answers to interrogatories... it may be that in this industry the fact that something is sold at a catalog price and is sold in substantial quantities to the public provides no real assurance that there has been competition."
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.498,628.982,"Well, either it does or it doesn't."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,641.882,647.067,"Well, it might be the sort of thing that accountants do, where you need only some relatively small sampling to be able to determine--"
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,647.067,650.644,"But you disclaim any interest in those records, as I understand your argument."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,650.644,659.579,"--Well, to the extent that they are records that could verify the records that we do want, we might have some interest in sampling of them."
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,659.579,664.734,Do you or do you not want to see records pertaining to sales by the drug company to other customers?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,664.734,666.232,We would want to see some of that.
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.232,673.01,"So there is really no limit on your demand, then, in terms of kinds of records that you are seeking."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,673.01,690.879,"Well, there are... let me suggest that as I understand Merck's position at this point, they would be willing to give us information of sales to other customers at the same prices in order to substantiate the fact that they have in fact made sales of substantial quantities to the general public."
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.05,696.222,You're not satisfied with that.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,697.97,699.954,"No, because those aren't cost records."
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,707.764,714.51,Would that include all sort of unallocated expenses engaged in research and development?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,714.51,722.414,"--Well, since everything that they do in research and development, so far as we know, is unallocated, yes, it would address that."
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,723.148,726.553,"When you say ""would address it"", it would take it in, wouldn't it?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,726.553,727.46,--It would take it in.
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,756.979,777.486,"Well, is the mission of the Comptroller General to inquire into contracts with the government or in terms of the pricing, or is part of his mission to see whether on the open market the drug companies are charging more than they should?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,777.486,785.154,"The Comptroller General's interest is in the price that the government pays, and whether the procurement methods that are used by the government are appropriate."
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,785.154,788.481,"But the inquiry would appear, in many respects, to go way beyond that."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,788.481,822.687,"It may be that information is obtained that has implications beyond that, but the Comptroller General's purpose and his objective in undertaking the study is to provide a check on the procurement methods, to determine whether, for example, negotiated, fixed-price contracts really are the most suitable way to purchase pharmaceuticals, or whether, in this industry where, so far as we can tell, the costs bear no relation to the prices that are charged, we might be better off going to a cost-plus system for buying pharmaceuticals."
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,854.658,856.143,What authority do you have to touch it anyway?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,864.951,869.839,--The only authority that the Comptroller General has is to make recommendations to the procuring agencies and to Congress.
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.839,870.23,Right.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,874.011,883.928,"If they... well, for example, if they want to charge the prices that they charge and we feel that it's not a price that we ought to pay, there's not going to be a deal."
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,893.204,893.501,--Couldn't you do that anyway?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,895.173,898.485,That might be one of the recommendations that would come out of this.
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,898.485,900.53,And you've had several years to think up that one.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,900.53,905.935,"Well, unfortunately, we have had all too many years in this case before we have gotten any information."
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,931.893,934.579,You are running a little fast for me.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,940.515,943.047,"--You would think that the company would know what it's spending, what products it's spending its advertising on."
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,943.047,945.17,"--Oh, a great many companies just advertise the company."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,945.17,945.702,Fine.
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,945.702,958.43,Television and newspapers and magazines constantly have Exxon or Weyerhaeuser... no particular product... and these are all conglomerates now.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,960.024,961.568,"Well, accountants can certainly do it."
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,976.688,979.234,"Well, that's not... your answer now is different from your previous statement."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,979.234,980.64,"--Then, you see, you'd be able to allocate it."
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,994.15,995.853,How is this going to help the Comptroller General?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1018.312,1026.996,"--Well, the interest in advertising is only a halfway measure to getting a notion of what their total costs are for their products."
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1062.278,1074.914,Suppose they sell an item for $2 to the government and they advertise Merck as a great druggist and mention no product.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1079.272,1080.991,"Well, the accountants would have to decide."
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1085.317,1085.489,Maybe.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1087.083,1087.676,--Excuse me?
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1087.676,1091.205,"You just don't know where you are, do you, when you get into the advertising business?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1091.205,1092.19,"Oh, sure we do."
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1095.282,1097.171,"Well, how do the people collect so much up on Madison Avenue if you know too?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1097.171,1098.109,--Well--
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1098.109,1110.682,There are certain fields it seems that are very impossible of delineation and I think advertising is a great one.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1110.682,1114.056,--But the accountants certainly have a way to do it.
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1114.056,1119.569,You have a man who's in a moving picture and he picks up a bottle of Coca Cola.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1122.38,1126.785,"And it's Coca Cola, and you know what the product is."
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1126.785,1129.487,"If Coca Cola were selling you products, you would look into that?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1129.487,1136.124,"Well, the point is that accountants can make these kind of delineations, and let me give you two examples."
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1136.124,1139.358,"If you give me two, I can give you 22."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1144.886,1150.869,"If it's the corporate name that's being advertised, that Merck is a great company--"
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1150.869,1151.526,--Right.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1151.526,1154.993,--And you can break that down on the basis of how many products Merck has.
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1155.602,1158.881,You also have to find out how many products he sells.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1158.881,1159.896,--That's right.
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1159.896,1162.269,And how much he gets for them.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1162.269,1164.691,We wouldn't have to know how much he gets for them.
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1166.894,1167.394,"Well, how else could you know?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1173.408,1176.203,We are interested in what he gets for the products that he is selling to the government.
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1176.203,1177.249,That's what I'm talking about.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1177.249,1178.109,That's... then we are in agreement.
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1181.045,1184.153,You and I are in agreement?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1184.153,1185.09,On that point.
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1185.09,1187.027,You want to bet?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1187.027,1190.416,"At least we both, I hope, understood that we were talking about the same point."
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1261.825,1266.245,But that's something they do when they are told to do by a court or when they are trying to plead a case.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1266.245,1266.417,They weren't told to do it.
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1268.151,1268.729,Right.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1275.164,1276.32,Absolutely not.
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1276.32,1278.413,You're saying give us the information and we will allocate.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1278.413,1279.662,Exactly right.
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1296.953,1304.37,Do I understand correctly that the government does not make any claim that Merck is guilty of any impropriety in any of the contracting?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1304.37,1305.636,That's correct.
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1305.636,1306.964,And--
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1306.964,1309.384,Or is that necessary for us to get access.
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1309.384,1316.976,--You concede that there is no suggestion of unreasonableness about the contracts?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1316.976,1321.739,As to the methods of the contract or the prices of the contract?
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1321.739,1322.442,Both.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1322.442,1327.907,"As to the methods, they followed the methods and procedures that were in place and should have been used."
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1334.718,1343.542,"This is not like a case where the government, as it does sometimes, suspects bid-rigging in competitive bidding and wants to inquire."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1366.688,1372.874,"Well, I understand that there are some cases that suggest that the government would not be in a position simply to blacklist companies."
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1376.436,1377.03,There are cases.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1396.974,1400.27,"Well, that may be one of the recommendations that comes out of the study."
1982.81-1273,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1420.683,1424.978,May I ask this question since you're speaking of recommendations that might be made?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1478.176,1491.515,The answer to that is that the government's purpose is not to tell companies that they are spending too much or too little on research or to penalize companies for spending too much or too little on research.
1982.81-1273,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1497.48,1499.23,What are you going to do with it after you find out?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1499.23,1507.649,Anything from saying that the system works fine to saying that there are significant changes that ought to be made.
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1523.721,1535.935,"Would you concede that there are some industries, including those dealing with the government, who don't want anyone to know how much they are spending on pure research, that that in itself is a trade secret?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1535.935,1540.432,There may be some industries in which that's the case.
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1546.21,1561.659,"On the contrary, it would occur to me that, as Justice Powell has just suggested, the pharmaceutical people would probably be doing more pure research than Detroit with automobiles and other companies."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1561.659,1562.034,They may.
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1583.413,1607.811,"Well, if you take those examples, might those facts not be matters that the company legitimately would not want anyone to know about, just as during the early part of World War I we were spending billions of dollars in atomic research, and if it had been known how much was being spent that might have been an important factor to other countries?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1616.886,1619.79,--We're not talking about... we're not talking about disclosure of any information to competitors.
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1645.016,1650.216,Who would enforce the confidentiality order... the Comptroller General's office?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1650.216,1651.357,And the Court.
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1652.293,1656.354,What about those that you don't have a court order?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1656.354,1662.821,In all of the cases that have been litigated in the pharmaceutical--
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1662.821,1665.757,"Well, how about all of the cases that haven't been litigated?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1669.147,1678.19,--In this particular set of requests there was only one that was not litigated and I don't know what the status of--
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1678.19,1680.032,"Well, are there any that weren't litigated?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1680.032,1682.359,--There was one that was not litigated.
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1682.359,1688.81,"Well, that doesn't have a... in other words, the only way you get the confidentiality order is to go to court?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1688.81,1691.028,Not necessarily.
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1691.028,1691.809,"Well, how else?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1691.809,1694.854,It may be that it could be negotiated at the time that the request is issued.
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1697.978,1700.212,"And if they say no, what happens?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1700.212,1703.788,"If they say no, then you've got to go to court in order to get the records."
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1716.033,1724.545,"I just don't see how the court ordered confidentiality protects the statute in this case, which doesn't mention court."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1730.403,1730.887,That's correct.
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1731.309,1733.512,"That's what's before us, isn't it?"
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1733.512,1739.837,--Is the statute that says that the contracts are to provide that the Comptroller General has the right to go in.
1982.81-1273,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1739.837,1743.164,Which statute has no confidentiality provision in it at all.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1743.164,1745.881,That statute does not.
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1755.799,1762.797,Can you subpoena post-1980 records of Merck now under the 1980 amendment?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1762.797,1766.748,Under... I believe that's right.
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1766.748,1769.139,Has the Comptroller General started doing it?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1769.139,1770.105,He has not.
1982.81-1273,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.4,1782.445,"So really the 1980 Act doesn't give you anything, I guess, that you don't have now."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1782.445,1784.319,It gives us an additional remedy.
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1807.653,1809.794,May I ask you one... one legal question?
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1824.757,1839.547,"Well, I think that given that this statute... I think one must come to this statute with a pro-disclosure bias or one must certainly come to that conclusion after reading the statute because it's a broad authorization."
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1839.547,1842.451,"Just if you make an impartial approach to it, maybe you don't win."
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1843.186,1848.872,"No, I think whether one makes a partial or impartial approach, the only--"
1982.81-1273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1848.872,1852.729,He says he must come to it with a pro-disclosure bias.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1861.944,1871.112,"--Well, I think he had already reached his... he had provided his analysis before he made that statement and having come to his conclusion he addressed it that way."
1982.81-1273,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1871.112,1875.048,Saying this is a biased conclusion.
1982.81-1273,0,30448,jerrold_j_ganzfried,,1875.048,1881.466,I think it's certainly an appropriate conclusion to come to and it's a conclusion that we suggest... we submit that this Court should reach.
1982.81-1273,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1882.748,1897.211,Mr. Lacovara?
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,1897.211,1900.179,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.81-1273,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1992.579,1995.031,"Well, isn't that a little bit like a prosecutor saying"
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2009.274,2021.379,"Justice Rehnquist, I think this case is a little bit different because we're talking here about the use of a coercive power given under a statute that we think was given by Congress for a very limited purpose."
1982.81-1273,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.432,2051.539,But is Mr. Bowsher bound by Mr. Staats' subjective feelings on the thing?
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2051.539,2068.047,"I think it's not quite whether he's bound by that, Justice Rehnquist, but whether or not when one passes beyond the scope of access that the government is demanding one gets to the question whether this was a bona fide or legitimate inquiry in the first place."
1982.81-1273,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2099.942,2107.516,"If the inquiry were directed at a search of all the cost-plus contracts that Merck had, would you have any problem?"
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2107.516,2109.562,"Your Honor, no, we would not."
1982.81-1273,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2110.281,2112.28,"That would be part of the audit function, would it not?"
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2112.28,2112.874,--Exactly.
1982.81-1273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2274.198,2276.792,"Of course, if that's the fact, why didn't you give them the profit margins?"
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2276.792,2277.729,--Pardon me?
1982.81-1273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2277.729,2279.619,"If that's the fact, what's the big secret?"
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2279.619,2296.564,"The secret, Justice Stevens, is that the government wants not the records that Merck has offered, which are the records to show that the prices that were agreed upon in these contracts were actually based upon catalog prices at which these products were sold to the government."
1982.81-1273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2411.517,2413.985,"Well, I understand their request is very broad."
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2432.791,2436.43,"Well, what we would do on a cooperative basis, Justice Stevens, is another matter."
1982.81-1273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2492.937,2503.98,Does that mean that your underlying interest is not so much in keeping the information from GAO as the danger that it might become... fall into the public domain?
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2503.98,2505.355,That's one concern.
1982.81-1273,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2938.773,2947.895,"Mr. Lacovara, you haven't yet covered in your oral argument, have you, your objections to what the District Court did give to the Comptroller General?"
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2947.895,2951.128,"Well, I'll deal with that right now."
1982.81-1273,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2951.128,2953.376,"Well, no, I just meant to keep track of you in a way."
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,2953.376,2958.843,"I should have given you an outline of where I wanted to go, and I apologize for not having done that."
1982.81-1273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.338,3101.754,"Is it not true that even in the kind of contract we have here you do have the clause in your contract, though, so we're not necessarily confined to knowing what the statute means or even if it was just intended to apply primarily to other contracts."
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3104.629,3105.924,"Yes, that's correct, Justice Stevens."
1982.81-1273,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3189.172,3211.773,"Mr. Lacovara, it would seem to me that it would make it difficult for the government to know that Merck's position was correct, that the price of the goods bore no relation whatever to cost of production, without giving the government access to enough of the records to check the veracity of that proposal by Merck."
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3211.773,3233.452,"--The position, Justice O'Connor is that this access authority is designed to let the GAO check and see whether the contractor and the purchasing agent on behalf of the government did something improper or negligent in the course of negotiating the contract."
1982.81-1273,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3245.228,3251.101,"Of course, if you limit... if that's the limited purpose, you have already won your lawsuit, I guess."
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3251.101,3253.647,"That's one ground for us to win, Justice White."
1982.81-1273,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3305.908,3315.918,"Just the point is simply that the verification might take you into some areas that are more in keeping with the District Court and the Court of Appeals order, wouldn't it?"
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3315.918,3324.79,--We agree that the GAO would have the right to examine records that show that the government was getting the products that it contracted for.
1982.81-1273,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3358.745,3361.916,If you... these are negotiated contracts.
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3361.916,3365.353,"Negotiated in a technical sense only, Justice White."
1982.81-1273,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3371.692,3375.145,And do they actually negotiate?
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3375.145,3380.175,The evidence is that there was no negotiation about price.
1982.81-1273,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3389.561,3390.326,Yes.
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3397.807,3399.931,That's in part what the--
1982.81-1273,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3399.931,3416.472,"Would it be legal for the government to say, even though it isn't a cost-plus contract and it isn't a bid contract, if they refuse to deal with anybody unless they tell them their costs?"
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3416.472,3419.158,"--Oh, no, nothing illegal about that at all."
1982.81-1273,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3419.158,3426.328,"So the government could tell Merck, well, look, don't send us any... when you send us your bids, send us your costs or we won't deal."
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3426.328,3428.842,"There's nothing illegal about that, Justice White."
1982.81-1273,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3428.842,3430.857,What do you think Merck would do then?
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3430.857,3434.2,"Oh, the record shows what Merck would do or has done."
1982.81-1273,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3434.2,3436.731,They would say we'll sell it someplace else.
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3436.731,3447.697,"If you look at record reference 23 attached to the affidavits of Merck's general counsel, Mr. Banse, are copies of correspondence with the government on this very point."
1982.81-1273,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3460.285,3463.174,And then the government didn't call your bluff.
1982.81-1273,1,38084,philip_a_lacovara,,3463.174,3464.079,--That's correct.
1982.81-1273,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3716.478,3717.759,"Thank you, gentlemen."
