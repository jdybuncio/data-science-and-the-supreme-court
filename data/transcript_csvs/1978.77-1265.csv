1978.77-1265,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.0,The case is submitted.
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,94.097,101.709,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, counsel, I do speak on behalf for the interest of the State of Minnesota in this case."
1978.77-1265,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,507.79,522.582,"With respect to that counsel, would the Minnesota's purposes be served if the Court had simply enjoined the subsidiary in Minnesota from carrying on this kind of conduct?"
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,522.582,525.546,We're not sure what the National Bank would've done.
1978.77-1265,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,543.717,547.702,But the Supreme Court of Minnesota felt not even the subsidiary could be enjoined.
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,547.702,550.246,"The Supreme Court of Minnesota, that's correct Your Honor."
1978.77-1265,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,561.133,562.826,"They weren't happy, obviously."
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,562.826,579.513,"Okay, and the reason they weren't happy is because of the anomalous result and that is that one state could go anywhere a bank from one state could go anywhere in the country and beat up the competition there because they're bringing a different interest rate with them."
1978.77-1265,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,579.513,586.0,I would have thought that you'd more business if you charge lower rates?
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,586.0,591.957,"Okay, the problem comes up here Mr. Chief Justice is they have advertise their --"
1978.77-1265,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,591.957,595.191,(Voice Overlap) in terms of competition.
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,598.372,601.338,"Well, it would have made a difference here and here is how it happened."
1978.77-1265,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,702.742,705.696,"Well, those are really minimum context cases I think."
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,709.895,710.567,That's true Your Honor.
1978.77-1265,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,779.968,786.965,"General Allyn, why do you think the Minnesota Court was so deferential to the Eighth Circuit?"
1978.77-1265,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,786.965,787.517,Nobody else is.
1978.77-1265,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,787.517,793.617,But that hasn't been historically true and I wondered why they were persuaded here.
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,793.617,812.313,"[Laughter Attempt] Your Honor, I think the justice opinion felt that because of the procedural way the case actually came up to Minnesota courts with the First National Bank itself of Omaha not being there that they felt that in effect their decision was going to effect that bank."
1978.77-1265,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,813.525,816.823,And all the parties were Eighth Circuit people were they not?
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,816.823,819.637,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1265,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.355,834.443,Didn't they feel that the Eighth Circuit felt and then this Court feel it was bound by Tiffany in a way that Tiffany case?
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,834.443,837.047,"Actually, no they were -- well, they mentioned Tiffany."
1978.77-1265,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,838.099,840.261,"Well, you would suggest we overrule Tiffany, wouldn't you?"
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,840.261,842.944,"I don't suggest you over rule Tiffany, Your Honor."
1978.77-1265,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,855.88,860.729,What did the Fisher -- what it did in the Fisher wasn't the Fisher case didn't purport to follow Tiffany?
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,860.729,862.392,"Your Honor, it was in dicta."
1978.77-1265,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,926.223,929.867,Except there's talking about a different rate of interest for small loan companies.
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,929.867,934.032,"Okay, Mr. Justice Stewart, if I may address that real quickly."
1978.77-1265,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,934.032,936.815,"Omaha still has its Small Loan Act, does it not?"
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,936.815,937.266,It does Your Honor.
1978.77-1265,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,937.266,940.039,Which allows 36% in the aggregate or something in that (Voice Overlap)?
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,940.039,949.651,"33% for a loan up to $300.00, 18% for $300.00 to $600.00, and 15% up to $1,200.00 which is the outside limit."
1978.77-1265,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.051,980.276,"Well, under Tiffany, what if in the home state of the bank?"
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,992.518,993.179,Alright.
1978.77-1265,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.179,996.71,"Now, under Tiffany, the National Bank isn't bound by that, is it?"
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,996.71,998.233,"Under Tiffany, they could charge a higher percent."
1978.77-1265,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,998.233,999.085,18.
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,999.085,1001.508,And we're not contesting that.
1978.77-1265,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1003.621,1004.002,"Very well, --"
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,1004.002,1009.568,Was the Small Loan Company Act issue raised in Minnesota Court?
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,1009.568,1011.401,It has been alluded to.
1978.77-1265,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1011.401,1013.264,You can see that it was?
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,1013.264,1013.745,"Yes, I --"
1978.77-1265,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.745,1014.847,In this case?
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,1014.847,1016.348,Yes.
1978.77-1265,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1029.584,1032.622,Did the Minnesota Court pass on it?
1978.77-1265,0,38564,richard_b_allyn,,1032.622,1035.886,I don't believe the Minnesota Court decided that it had to.
1978.77-1265,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1040.388,1043.153,Mr. Troyer.
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1043.153,1046.708,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1265,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1187.539,1193.85,Don't you think the Eighth Circuit understood to stand for something a little more broad than that?
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1193.85,1204.586,"I don't believe -- certainly, the Eighth Circuit extended Tiffany beyond what I think ought to happen here."
1978.77-1265,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1235.571,1253.378,Do you think the Section would prevent the Minnesota from passing a statute that would require Iowa banks to charge a higher rate of interest than Minnesota banks or lower rate in Minnesota banks?
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1253.378,1255.011,Would you give me that again please?
1978.77-1265,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1255.643,1260.619,"Well, you say that the Section, this doesn't apply at all to interstate transaction, is that it?"
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1260.619,1271.154,Marquette's position is that Section 85 is totally silent on issue of what rates of interest make -- on the rates of interest which may be charged in interstate loan transactions.
1978.77-1265,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1275.179,1277.211,So it doesn't apply at all to an interstate transaction?
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1277.211,1278.093,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-1265,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1278.093,1285.151,"So that as far as that Section is concerned, Minnesota could require an Iowa bank to charge a higher rate or a lower rate than --"
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1285.151,1289.888,"No, no, no, Minnesota couldn't require an Iowa bank in Iowa obviously."
1978.77-1265,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1289.888,1291.19,"No, I mean in Minnesota?"
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1291.19,1299.766,"When that Iowa comes in to Minnesota, when it solicits Minnesota residents, when it --"
1978.77-1265,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1299.766,1308.809,"Well I know, but could it require the bank to charge a higher rate or a lower rate or either one than a Minnesota bank, when it's doing business in Minnesota?"
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1308.809,1314.255,All it could require under the first -- most favored lender doctrine in Tiffany is that --
1978.77-1265,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1314.255,1318.609,"What about the Section, you say it doesn't apply at all to protect the Minnesota bank?"
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1318.609,1319.755,That's correct.
1978.77-1265,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1319.755,1328.741,"And so that as far as that Section is concerned, Minnesota could require the Iowa bank doing business in Minnesota to charge you to the higher rate or a lower rate than Minnesota banks?"
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1328.741,1350.559,"The Iowa bank, when it comes in to Minnesota, has the privileges of Minnesota national banks, so that the Minnesota, that passes a law permitting Minnesota banks to charge 12% or 18% certainly, the Iowa bank could take advantage of that."
1978.77-1265,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1350.559,1351.791,By virtue of what Section?
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1351.791,1353.304,By virtue of Section 85.
1978.77-1265,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1353.304,1355.097,"So, it does apply the interstate transaction?"
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1355.097,1358.832,"No, it applies to intrastate transaction."
1978.77-1265,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1358.832,1361.476,"Mr. Troyer, I've missed something."
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1365.522,1375.623,"Well, the Marquette National Bank is given a special standing under Minnesota statute as sort of a private attorney general to enforce the Minnesota statute."
1978.77-1265,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1398.238,1406.586,"Well normally, other state I know, when somebody was charged as there is interest, they manage to get indicted."
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1406.586,1413.964,"Well, we would have loved -- Marquette would have loved to been able to bring cause of action against that Omaha Bank for usury but we simply didn't feel we had standings."
1978.77-1265,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1413.964,1425.025,"I didn't say the bank brought it, the individual people, once you tell them that they get all their money back, plus they're very glad to join in a suit, aren't they?"
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1425.025,1440.031,"The State of Minnesota, as a matter of fact, in it's intervention --intervening complaint has a sort of the cause of action against the Omaha subsidiary for that purpose and is asking, if the Minnesota Supreme Court is reversed here."
1978.77-1265,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1449.719,1473.786,"I mean, is that a great problem with the cause of action that says that when people charge extra high prices, it interferes the competition and the free marketplace and all of those other trade places?"
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1473.786,1479.913,"In response to that Your Honor, all I can say is that the Marquette Bank has been disadvantaged."
1978.77-1265,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1518.381,1533.527,"Well, suppose a gasoline company start to selling gas for $3.00 a gallon, would the other companies object?"
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1536.363,1538.569,I assume not.
1978.77-1265,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1538.569,1554.912,"Well, I undertook your friend, your colleague to say that the come on was that the Omaha Bank could advertise no membership fee initially, not forget the customers enter the house and after they fined they were paying 18% instead of 12%?"
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1554.912,1556.425,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1265,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1556.425,1564.174,"That's how you explain my confusion about competitive advantage, at least to me."
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1564.174,1590.594,"Back to my point, if you look at the -- the Seventh Circuit here has taken the position of the plain language of the statute, it talks in the first clause of 12 U.S.C. 85 that's on page 23 of our brief, it talks about to the fact that the words are “any loan” and that means any loan made in the State of Nebraska, any loan made in the State of Minnesota."
1978.77-1265,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.426,1817.54,"Well, this was more then just a national bank crossing state lines."
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1820.283,1824.959,"That's correct, for purposes of conducting business in the State of Minnesota."
1978.77-1265,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1878.722,1887.753,"What if someone from Worthington, Minnesota went down to Omaha and borrowed from the First National, would the First National be entitled to charge him a Nebraska rate?"
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1887.753,1895.623,"If that consumer goes to Omaha, Nebraska, and our Act specifically provides for that provision, subdivision 8, I believe it was."
1978.77-1265,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1924.759,1953.694,"Mr. Troyer, the amicus brief filed here by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors makes alternatively at least different argument as you know, makes three first of all as the Court to overrule Tiffany and then it says even if Tiffany is not overruled, there are at least two alternative grounds on which your position can be and should be vindicated."
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,1999.996,2003.95,"We don't disagree with that position, that is really the position of the State of Minnesota, that for intrastate --"
1978.77-1265,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2003.95,2005.47,"No, I didn't hear you make it."
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,2005.47,2011.787,"-- for intrastate loan transactions, the national bank is located in Nebraska."
1978.77-1265,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2011.787,2020.853,"The argument is really made only in the -- so far, as I've heard today in the brief, this amicus brief of which you have referred, I haven't heard and made orally."
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,2020.853,2023.102,"Well, let me make it orally."
1978.77-1265,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2023.102,2025.806,"Well, you don't have to because you just stated it."
1978.77-1265,1,33234,john_troyer,,2026.948,2035.875,"No, no, I can accept that argument as an alternative ground for holding the favor of Marquette and State of Minnesota."
1978.77-1265,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2035.875,2038.378,"Your time is expired now, Mr. Troyer."
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2043.842,2047.054,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1265,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2137.467,2144.285,"Are you telling us that all of these transactions are made in this way, Mr. Bork?"
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2144.285,2154.583,"Mr. Chief Justice, I am saying that anybody who wants a First National Bank of Omaha credit card sends an application to Omaha, Nebraska."
1978.77-1265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2178.391,2190.861,"What do you think the act of extending credit is in the credit thing, it's when -- if a customer goes to a restaurant and uses it's credit card and signs his slip, it's when the bank pays the --"
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2190.861,2192.423,When the bank pays the restaurant Mr. Justice White.
1978.77-1265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.564,2194.786,"And that happens in Omaha, you think?"
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2194.786,2195.985,Oh!
1978.77-1265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2211.059,2226.853,"Well, why can't Minnesota say, if Omaha Bank wants to have one of its customers use his credit card in Minnesota, that Minnesota can control the terms of that?"
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2226.853,2229.266,You mean a different kind of a statute?
1978.77-1265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2229.266,2229.687,Yes.
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2229.687,2231.854,That could happen.
1978.77-1265,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.261,2256.535,Then what does Minnesota said that's different in that?
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2256.535,2283.038,"Well, Minnesota says that if our -- if you ask our customers to write to you to get a credit card approved in Omaha, you have to comply with Minnesota interest rates even though the entire making of the loan, the entire extension of the credit and everything about that transaction is centered in Omaha and even though, and I should express this, that credit card will be used anywhere in the country and many nations abroad."
1978.77-1265,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2283.038,2289.556,"If the business is so heavily centered in Omaha, why did they incorporate a subsidiary in Minnesota?"
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2289.556,2296.906,"To make phone call, to make it known that if you send an application to the First National Bank in Omaha, we will consider it and perhaps extend your credit card."
1978.77-1265,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2296.906,2301.003,Do you think the Minnesota card could have enjoined that?
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2301.003,2313.379,I do not think so Mr. Justice Rehnquist because that would be to apply Minnesota law through a subsidiary to a Nebraska banking transaction.
1978.77-1265,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2324.631,2349.614,"Would it be that if some resident in Minnesota insist on paying more than the going rate of interest and prefers to pay 18% instead of the going rate, then the only way to do it is either to mail it to -- or to go to this office in Minnesota."
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2349.614,2375.662,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, I should say that the Omaha plan has a lot of advantages, that the Minneapolis plan does not if you are a prompt payer, if you engaged in a transaction for the restaurant on September 15, get billed on October 1 and pay before October 25, you will play no interest rate to the Omaha National Bank, but the other --"
1978.77-1265,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2375.662,2378.111,That's for mails on time?
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2378.111,2388.235,"Yes, but the other plan, Mr. Justice Marshal, charges you a $10.00 or a $15.00 charge whether or not you're a prompt payer so that it is the advantage of prompt payers to use the Omaha -- card."
1978.77-1265,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2388.235,2401.132,But the problem I have is the 18% interest when given to your office in Minneapolis --
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2401.132,2402.715,I beg your pardon?
1978.77-1265,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2402.715,2405.979,Can you pay your bill in the office in Minneapolis?
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2405.979,2412.424,"No, the bill is mailed -- the payment of the bill is mailed to Omaha."
1978.77-1265,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2419.75,2421.682,"No, but -- and you can't pay it."
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2421.682,2425.927,"No, you must mail your check or your money order to Omaha."
1978.77-1265,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2425.927,2428.406,And that's the way you get around the usury law.
1978.77-1265,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2428.406,2431.439,Does the Nebraska Bank advertise in Minnesota?
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2431.439,2434.022,"It does indeed, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-1265,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2515.808,2518.104,You said that Tiffany is a holding to that effect?
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2518.104,2518.675,"No, sir."
1978.77-1265,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2604.941,2612.89,"Incidentally, Mr. Bork, the Section 30, that was in Tiffany read almost exactly (Voice overlap), didn't it?"
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2612.89,2614.862,"Yes, it did, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1978.77-1265,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2615.964,2616.385,Yes.
1978.77-1265,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2616.385,2620.996,"Well, that's okay if one precedes on the assumption."
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2629.681,2636.259,"Well, of course at the time the 1864 Act was written, branch banking was absolutely prohibited."
1978.77-1265,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2636.259,2636.791,Correct.
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2636.791,2638.384,So that one would have to --
1978.77-1265,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2638.384,2640.657,So a bank could have a single location.
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2640.657,2642.079,Single location.
1978.77-1265,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2642.31,2643.691,But is that now true?
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2643.691,2644.983,I think it is still true.
1978.77-1265,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2647.456,2648.989,"Yes, but how about the Bougas case?"
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2648.989,2676.343,"About the Bougas case, Citizens & others against Bougas said I think entirely on reasoning that I think applies to this case that there is no particular reason to confine the word “located” so that a bank cannot be sued at its branches because all of the policy reasons against -- or for requiring the word “located” to mean sue the bank --"
1978.77-1265,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2676.343,2678.237,Or one single place.
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2678.237,2683.623,"-- have now changed, so those same reasons permit suit at the branch banks."
1978.77-1265,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2759.492,2766.682,"Well, you're -- you're saying then that if the banks have construed Section 85 this way for so long, we should construe it that way?"
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2766.682,2771.139,"Well, I think given, Mr. Justice Rehnquist -- I think given the Tiffany case --"
1978.77-1265,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2771.139,2773.002,If that's not Tiffany you agree (Voice overlap).
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2773.002,2775.095,"No, no, I was about to make a --"
1978.77-1265,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2775.095,2775.656,By all means.
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2775.656,2786.638,"I was at part, Mr. Justice Rehnquist to suggest that there was some reason for the banks to have felt this way given the Tiffany case, given the plain language, any loan made by National Bank, which is in Section 85."
1978.77-1265,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2801.78,2807.188,Would you really think form books should be an important part of our decisional apparatus?
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2807.188,2808.25,"[Laughter] No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-1265,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2873.482,2874.414,Mr. Bork.
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2874.414,2875.354,-- of Section 85.
1978.77-1265,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2875.354,2895.369,Would you agree that in Minnesota or any other state places a statutory limit on interest rates and declares that with certain penalties that are anything beyond the -- that is usury that what their state is doing is expressing an important social policy to protect its citizens?
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2898.914,2900.987,"I certainly do agree to that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-1265,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2900.987,2908.486,If you say that doesn't stop them from gambling by mail if they have a mail gambling apparatus in Las Vegas.
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2912.421,2914.044,I doubt -- I doubt that you can gamble by mail.
1978.77-1265,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2936.137,2943.733,"Well, Minnesota may be -- would put it in a little different light that might say Minnesota is going to try to shelter and protect its native citizens."
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2943.733,2956.193,"Well, I think that's so, but I don't think Minnesota can shelter and protect them when they leave the state in effect to do their transactions and when a federal law reads directly upon that transaction."
1978.77-1265,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2956.193,2959.216,"(Voice overlap) Of course, there aren't really in the state really, are they?"
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2959.216,2959.277,There --
1978.77-1265,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2959.277,2964.613,"There is in the state when they have a branch, a Nebraska branch in Minnesota?"
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2964.613,2967.515,Nebraska has no branch (Voice overlap).
1978.77-1265,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2971.85,2977.134,"Yes, I was using branch not in a technical banking sense but they -- they have an arm under Minnesota?"
1978.77-1265,2,38778,robert_h_bork,,2977.134,2986.496,"They have people in Minnesota who -- who make Minnesotans aware that they may write, may send an application to Nebraska for a credit card."
1978.77-1265,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3016.28,3039.91,"Mr. Bork, the complaint in the case, which is referred to on page a (3) of the Supreme Court Minnesota's opinion, paragraph 3 says, “Defendant first of Omaha Service Corporation will participate in the system by entering into agreements with Minnesota merchants and Minnesota banks, which will govern the participation of these merchants and banks in the system.”"
