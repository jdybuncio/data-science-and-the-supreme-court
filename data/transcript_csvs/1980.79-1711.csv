1980.79-1711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.122,We will hear arguments next in Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. the National Sea Clammers.
1980.79-1711,0,35616,milton_b_conford,,67.258,71.679,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1711,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,233.182,234.899,He agrees with you that there is not?
1980.79-1711,0,35616,milton_b_conford,,234.899,236.801,He agrees with us that there is not.
1980.79-1711,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,236.801,239.336,In which event the case is over?
1980.79-1711,0,35616,milton_b_conford,,239.336,239.836,The case?
1980.79-1711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,246.273,247.189,I see.
1980.79-1711,0,35616,milton_b_conford,,248.856,250.391,That is right.
1980.79-1711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,321.82,324.522,We'll resume there at 1 o'clock on that point.
1980.79-1711,0,35616,milton_b_conford,,338.663,341.299,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1711,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,437.257,439.357,"Well, is this an argument, Judge Conford?"
1980.79-1711,0,35616,milton_b_conford,,441.975,451.247,"What I'm trying to do, Justice Brennan, is to indicate that of the generally accepted criteria for applying federal common law, none is appropriate to the present situation."
1980.79-1711,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,451.247,455.116,Without regard to others?
1980.79-1711,0,35616,milton_b_conford,,458.818,461.62,Where there's a statute?
1980.79-1711,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,461.62,462.553,A federal statute.
1980.79-1711,0,35616,milton_b_conford,,462.553,464.236,Where there's a federal statute?
1980.79-1711,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,464.236,468.274,That displaces any room for federal common law.
1980.79-1711,0,35616,milton_b_conford,,468.274,473.428,Except to the extent that it is thought necessary to supply statutory interstices.
1980.79-1711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,514.486,519.973,"Well, then that was said in the context... or put it another way, was that said in the context of a private party suit?"
1980.79-1711,0,35616,milton_b_conford,,519.973,523.175,"No, it was said in the context of a state party suit."
1980.79-1711,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,525.376,528.395,"Which began as an original jurisdiction, case."
1980.79-1711,0,35616,milton_b_conford,,528.395,529.262,Exactly.
1980.79-1711,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,580.78,585.601,Would that be illustrated by the Lincoln Mills kind of case?
1980.79-1711,0,35616,milton_b_conford,,585.601,587.067,Yes.
1980.79-1711,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,596.29,598.342,And that it should be--
1980.79-1711,0,35616,milton_b_conford,,598.342,600.192,"Applied uniformly, whether--"
1980.79-1711,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,600.192,600.775,--Uniformly; nationally applicable.
1980.79-1711,0,35616,milton_b_conford,,600.775,606.845,"--Nationally, whether the problem arose either in state or federal system."
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1371.611,1374.377,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1711,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1623.835,1631.572,"Mr. Horowitz, before you leave the savings clause, you construe it as applying only to preexisting remedies."
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1642.446,1654.42,"Well, I think the simplest explanation of that language in the statute is that the citizen suit provisions specifically refer to suits to enforce effluent limitations."
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1677.02,1686.558,"Is it your position that the savings clause did no more than preserve previously existing rights of action, whatever they may have been, if any?"
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1686.558,1687.041,--That's right.
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1687.041,1694.331,"Or that it had, it preserved some sort of private rights of actions, depending upon this very statute?"
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1694.331,1699.299,"Well, we don't think it... it did not create any new causes of action."
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1699.299,1701.068,"The savings clause didn't, certainly?"
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1701.068,1702.385,The savings clause didn't; right.
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1703.57,1705.187,"Preserve preexisting causes, if any?"
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1705.187,1707.955,--preserve every single action that had existed before.
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1714.176,1723.6,"Well, then, wasn't... isn't Mr. Justice Stevens correct in suggesting that until this statute came along there was no such right of action?"
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1724.266,1733.306,"--The citizen suit provision refers to any other relief, it doesn't refer only to effluent limitations."
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1734.889,1735.272,It does.
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1735.272,1740.693,--but it said... I don't think there were these effluent limitations prior to the enactment of the Clean Water Act.
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1740.693,1741.745,There weren't; there were not.
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1744.93,1746.297,"No, the concept didn't exist; that's correct."
1980.79-1711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1748.299,1753.37,"Well, you're referring to a nuisance suit, common law nuisance claim that's preserved?"
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1759.023,1764.825,"Well, certainly, the common law nuisance remedy was preserved; also any remedy relating to water pollution under any other statute."
1980.79-1711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1766.293,1769.562,"That's where you and Mr. Conford part company, at that point?"
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1769.562,1771.847,"--As far as the federal common law, that's correct."
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1771.847,1776.985,Was there a common law nuisance right of action in a federal court with no diversity--
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1776.985,1780.869,"Yes, the Illinois v. Milwaukee case was decided prior to the passage of the statute--"
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1780.869,1782.969,"--Yes, I know, but the state was a plaintiff there."
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1783.552,1784.304,--The state was the plaintiff.
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1784.304,1785.821,--A private nuisance action.
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1788.623,1790.325,No.
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1794.26,1795.795,"Which was the state, the state was the plaintiff there."
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1795.795,1800.93,"As far as I know, no private party had sought to invoke that decision prior to the enactment of this Act."
1980.79-1711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1800.93,1802.449,"Well, then, what was there to save?"
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1804.482,1808.453,"Well, Congress was just making it clear that they were saving whatever there was to save."
1980.79-1711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1808.453,1810.036,--Whatever existed.
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1827.664,1832.484,"Well, the court gave many explanations for why it was implying common law."
1980.79-1711,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1896.41,1905.349,"Well, the rational explanation being that if there is another remedy created under this statute to enforce an effluent limitation, we don't want to tamper with that remedy."
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1911.92,1926.513,"It just seems inconceivable that in enacting this detailed citizen remedy that Congress intended to imply some other remedy without saving so, and by doing it in this very mystical fashion, using the word ""effluent limitation"" in the saving clause."
1980.79-1711,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1926.513,1931.065,"But if you don't read it that way, that language is clearly superfluous."
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1934.683,1937.969,The clause is drafted as broadly as possible.
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1943.739,1948.442,"Although that doesn't answer the question about what remedies existed, if any."
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,1948.442,1949.159,Right.
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2041.619,2047.739,And will you tell me again what the basis of federal jurisdiction is?
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2047.739,2052.409,"The basis of federal jurisdiction is under Section 1331(a), because there's a federal common law."
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2063.8,2073.59,So a federal court has jurisdiction of a common law nuisance cause of action because of 1331?
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2073.59,2074.273,Right.
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2078.477,2082.429,And this is only because this is an interstate nuisance?
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2082.429,2082.879,Yes.
1980.79-1711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2084.381,2087.064,"Otherwise you'd overrule Erie v. Tompkins, wouldn't you?"
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2087.064,2088.833,"--Well, I'm not seeking to overrule Erie v. Tompkins."
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2096.086,2098.588,But that wouldn't be 1331 jurisdiction?
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2098.588,2099.723,"--Well, no."
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2099.723,2101.373,That would be the other jurisdictional statutes--
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2101.373,2108.412,"Certainly, where a private party brings a suit and there's no interstate effects, we agree that the federal common law of nuisance does not apply."
1980.79-1711,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2108.412,2111.031,"--And a federal court would not have jurisdiction, would it?"
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2111.031,2114.566,"No, because there's no federal question."
1980.79-1711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2172.418,2202.103,"Why do you say that, when the federal statute provides for effluent limitations and specific permits and so forth, and a federal nuisance remedy could simply involve a single federal judge saying, well, I don't think the EPA or whoever it is that administers the effluent permits acted with sufficient stringency here."
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2206.555,2218.946,"--Well, I think that's... considering the preemption clause I think it's important to draw a distinction between whether a cause of action for nuisance exists at all and what standards are to be applied on the merits in determining whether there's a nuisance."
1980.79-1711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.346,2263.289,"Do you think that the federal judge could go beyond the permit and say, well, this permit allows too much effluent and under the common law of nuisance I'm going to say it's only half as much?"
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2263.289,2266.241,"--Unless he found some deficiency in what EPA did, I wouldn't--"
1980.79-1711,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2266.241,2275.847,"Well, isn't there a statutory review provision for EPA that a person dissatisfied by the permit issued can appeal <EPA's> [= EPA's] actions?"
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2275.847,2276.313,--Yes.
1980.79-1711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2291.772,2294.491,"Just one question, if I may, before you sit down."
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2318.357,2321.291,"--Well, perhaps there's a little confusion here."
1980.79-1711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2368.789,2377.045,You wouldn't have any uniformity until finally all of these cases would work their way through the circuits by conflicts up to this Court.
1980.79-1711,1,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2383.099,2388.151,"Well, you would have uniformity in a particular... as far as a particular pollution incident."
1980.79-1711,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2402.91,2411.016,Thank you.
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,2412.332,2415.051,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1711,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2664.598,2679.558,"But can't that be read as simply preempting, federal law preempting state law and not necessarily precluding federal law preempting preexisting federal common law?"
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,2679.558,2681.327,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1980.79-1711,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2732.925,2749.554,"Well, but, in the Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, the court was quite specific about stating that perhaps eventually federal common law would be superseded by a federal statute too."
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,2749.554,2760.76,"--I would certainly concede, Your Honor, that that argument was made, but with respect, we would submit that if that time is ever going to come, it certainly hasn't come now."
1980.79-1711,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2839.112,2863.227,"Well, why didn't Congress simply endorse the common law of nuisance rather than provide for a whole series of effluent limitations and that sort of thing, and the EPA issues specific permits, and the Army Corps of Engineers to permit dumping, and allow review of each of those actions in federal courts?"
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,2863.227,2874.302,"I would submit, respectfully, Your Honor, that indeed Congress did endorse precisely that, namely, the continued availability of the private damage remedy where damages can be shown."
1980.79-1711,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2934.173,2950.885,"Well, at the time that was formulated in Congress, had there been any cases affirming the existence of a private action for damages for nuisance in a federal court invoking independent federal jurisdiction of it?"
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,2950.885,2954.67,"To my knowledge, Your Honor, there had been no such cases at that time."
1980.79-1711,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2989.777,2992.712,"Except for the misnomer, ""savings clause"", and you say it's a misnomer?"
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,2992.712,2993.495,--Exactly.
1980.79-1711,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2993.495,2998.449,"A savings clause ordinarily is just that, a time lock, isn't it?"
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,2998.449,3002.735,I would agree that if it was a true savings clause it would be that.
1980.79-1711,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3009.84,3021.212,"Until this case, have there been independent actions by private parties for damages for nuisances invoking federal jurisdiction?"
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,3021.212,3022.064,"Yes, there have, Your Honor."
1980.79-1711,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3042.312,3047.713,Did that invoke federal jurisdiction under 1331?
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,3047.713,3048.381,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1711,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3049.898,3052.85,It wasn't a diversity case?
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,3052.85,3053.433,"--No, Your Honor."
1980.79-1711,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3060.187,3063.639,"So, it was thought, there held to involve a federal question?"
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,3063.639,3068.46,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1711,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3120.827,3126.648,"Isn't that an assumption, that Congress was buying a pig in a poke?"
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,3126.648,3134.902,"I would not believe that to be the case, sir, particularly if one remembers the history of the development of this statute."
1980.79-1711,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3162.587,3179.031,"Well, in your Byram River case, supposing there had been an effluent permit granted, and the district court said, we think EPA was just all off base here, and therefore we're going to cut the amount of effluent in half."
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,3186.02,3203.648,"Yes, I do, sir, and I would submit that that so called conflict, we certainly recognize it as a real one, but would submit that the conflict of that nature already exists and indeed my opponent urges that it continue to exist."
1980.79-1711,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3251.895,3263.953,"Well, what is the person who has the effluent permit supposed to do when the district judge tells him, no, you can only do half of what the EPA has told you you can do?"
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,3263.953,3283.433,"Well, before that question is reached, sir, I believe that there is a further safeguard for that person, and that is particularly with respect to the standards to be applied to determine whether something is in violation of the federal common law of nuisance or, indeed, constitutes a public nuisance."
1980.79-1711,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3432.361,3445.953,"Mr. Corbin, may I just ask... I understand your common law theory, but your statutory theory, your implied cause of action theory, do you allege that the defendants violated the effluent limitation?"
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,3445.953,3446.987,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1980.79-1711,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3481.876,3487.347,Are you still able to make those claims by giving the 60-day notice?
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,3487.347,3489.299,"Without giving the 60 days, or--"
1980.79-1711,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3489.299,3492.418,"No, with, giving, say you did it, you gave notice today?"
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,3494.72,3496.086,--I believe we could.
1980.79-1711,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3497.186,3503.207,Why couldn't we have avoided the whole implied cause of action issue by having you give notice a couple of years ago?
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,3503.207,3520.001,"--Well, the difficulty with that, Your Honor, as we argued unsuccessfully to the district court, somewhat more successfully to the 3rd Circuit... as Your Honor may recall, the <third> [= 3rd] Circuit indicated that could have been an alternate basis to support our federal statutory claims."
1980.79-1711,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3541.082,3544.451,"Oh, I see, and your 60-day... that claim would not be a damage claim, would it?"
1980.79-1711,2,38989,robert_p_corbin,,3544.451,3545.569,"That's correct, sir."
1980.79-1711,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3645.584,3647.201,"Judge Conford, do you have anything further?"
1980.79-1711,3,35616,milton_b_conford,,3647.201,3649.303,"Nothing further, sir; thank you."
1980.79-1711,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3649.303,3650.17,Very well.
