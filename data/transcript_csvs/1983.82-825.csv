1983.82-825,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.33,"Mr. Wilkins, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,28.33,31.75,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1983.82-825,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,105.283,109.72,"Mr. Wilkins, you say that one of the issues here is whether there must be a trial."
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,123.931,124.62,I misspoke.
1983.82-825,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,267.183,268.824,Was he alone in the dissent?
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,268.824,273.117,He was alone in the dissent as far as I am aware.
1983.82-825,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,317.818,325.395,"Mr. Wilkins, I think that the Eighth Circuit relied on a particular provision of the Civil Rights Act, did it not?"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,325.395,326.175,Exactly.
1983.82-825,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,360.802,365.657,"And it was that last language that you mention now that the Eighth Circuit relied on, wasn't it?"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,365.657,366.035,--Exactly.
1983.82-825,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,387.525,393.803,"What has that got to do with the definition of the terms, date, place, and circumstances that Congress put in the Act."
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,393.803,401.334,You have to look at what purpose Congress intended that notice provision to serve.
1983.82-825,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,448.315,454.187,"They defined ""fair notice"" as including the date, place, and circumstances, didn't they?"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,454.187,458.48,"Yes, and this charge fully complied with that requirement."
1983.82-825,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,484.611,486.971,You think that complied with the circumstances requirement?
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,486.971,487.814,Yes.
1983.82-825,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,487.814,491.327,Mr. Wilkins.
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,491.327,491.795,Yes.
1983.82-825,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.795,505.054,"Why would the Government not want to provide, in these pattern and practice cases, the real circumstances that the Government is relying, the statistical information that they looked at."
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,516.363,525.53,"There is a two-fold answer to that, Justice O'Connor, and I think there is a very good reason for not getting into that kind of detail at the very outset."
1983.82-825,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,549.973,576.026,"Sure, but what the Government in these cases is doing is putting together a few simple statistics covering given years, and saying these are the total number of employees in this category, and in that community there are so many Blacks, and so many women, and these are the actual figures that the company has."
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,582.304,596.72,"As the Ninth Circuit noted in the Dean Witter case, to require the Commission to get into providing a certain level of factual specificity, or providing the statistics, would merely prompt, as what has happened in this case, the Respondent would come back and say,"
1983.82-825,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,609.012,618.71,"The Court doesn't have to buy that, obviously, as a requirement and the Court wouldn't necessarily have to turn this into a mini-trial."
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,629.707,645.729,"--As Professor Moore stated in his treatise on civil procedure, just as a general precept, a requirement that facts be pleaded in a charge is illusory and unsound."
1983.82-825,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,648.509,659.257,"Sure, but we have the job of trying to figure out why Congress included this specific language, and they had something in mind and we have to determine what that something is."
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,678.7,679.542,I am not certain.
1983.82-825,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,742.466,751.587,"Mr. Wilkins, your answers assume that this is kind of a judicially fashioned doctrine."
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,769.099,779.889,"Yes, but, Justice Renquist, Congress in 1964 said that a commissioner's charge had to state its facts, and the courts never required that as requiring any sort of factual pleading."
1983.82-825,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,779.889,786.683,"Do you think that those were sound decisions, if Cogress said ""facts"", and the courts said ""no facts""."
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,786.683,794.037,"I believe, when you look at the purpose and the overall Title VII enforcement scheme, I believe they were indeed sound decisions."
1983.82-825,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,795.257,797.773,How would you rationalize those?
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,809.202,829.585,"--The uniform position that has been taken since 1964, beginning in the early '70s, in the Ninth Circuit's decision in Local 104 Sheetmetal Workers, was that the purpose of the charge is merely to commence an administrative investigation and inquiry to determine whether there is reasonable cause."
1983.82-825,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,854.092,861.432,"In other words, Congress should have provided the same provisions as the Rules of Civil Procedure, and so we'll assume that it did."
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,863.494,868.193,The courts reasoned this way.
1983.82-825,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,916.583,917.815,Mr. Wilkins.
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,917.815,918.486,Yes.
1983.82-825,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,918.486,931.014,"Your position, of course, is that the charge adequately puts Shell Company, in this case, on fair notice as to what is being charged against it."
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,942.573,943.368,Yes.
1983.82-825,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,943.368,947.74,Is that filed the same day the charge is filed?
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,947.74,948.851,Yes.
1983.82-825,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,952.005,963.939,"Does that suggest to you that the EEOC either doesn't know the facts, the basic facts and circumstances, or does it suggest that it has them and is unwilling to disclose them?"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,963.939,974.182,"--It suggests to me, Justice Powell, that the Commission has sufficient facts to have reason to believe there is indeed a pattern of practice of discrimination."
1983.82-825,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,982.477,985.038,Is that first request for information a standard form?
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,985.038,990.584,To the best of my knowledge there are standard requests that are made.
1983.82-825,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1003.188,1005.078,"It goes on for 16 pages, doesn't it?"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1005.078,1005.983,"Yes, it does."
1983.82-825,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1005.983,1012.511,"If you were counsel for the company and received this, what would your reaction be?"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1012.511,1019.132,I am certain that I would sit down and recognize that I was going to be busy for the next little while.
1983.82-825,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1019.132,1021.426,Little while... how many weeks?
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1021.426,1023.113,I have no way of knowing.
1983.82-825,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1023.113,1033.545,How many people would be required in a major corporation to help you gather all of this information which really undresses the corporation for years.
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1038.154,1041.683,There's a couple of things to keep to bear in mind on this question.
1983.82-825,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1049.306,1050.149,They aren't very helpful once in there.
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1050.149,1057.27,--The Commission also has procedures where it will help pay for the development of this information.
1983.82-825,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1088.414,1090.353,I'll come back to my initial question.
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1109.281,1114.234,That is the exact purpose of the conciliation and administrative litigation.
1983.82-825,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1114.234,1116.589,They make a charge without knowing the circumstances.
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1116.589,1138.676,"No, the purpose of the charge... In this case, we had from our analysis of the EEO-1 reports that had been filed by the Respondent, there were indications, statistical indications that Shell had engaged... had excluded Blacks and women from certain job categories."
1983.82-825,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1161.183,1170.881,"Congress chose this very curious language, if it really understood that the agency was going to file this sort of fishing expedition; don't you think so?"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1173.802,1185.547,"Well, Congress was aware in 1972 that the Commission needed more enforcement power and needed more investigatory power."
1983.82-825,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.448,1237.9,Why didn't you... Why not furnish some of those facts that you have looked at?
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1237.9,1242.708,For the exact reason that has occurred in this case.
1983.82-825,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1246.412,1249.313,What do you think qualifies as the circumstances?
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1249.313,1257.685,"--In this case, we told them that they excluded women from seven designated job categories, and Blacks from six designated job categories."
1983.82-825,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1274.976,1282.786,But you did have facts... You did have more facts than just an assertion that they had discriminated in these respects.
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1282.786,1287.112,"Certainly, we had facts to back up those allegations."
1983.82-825,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1287.112,1294.485,Why wouldn't you think that some summary of those facts shouldn't have been furnished?
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1294.485,1302.654,"It may be wise, and the Commissioners, the individual Commissioners of the EEOC certainly have discretion to give those facts."
1983.82-825,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1310.118,1312.992,"Judicially, the question is whether Congress anticipated it--"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1312.992,1314.525,"--Well, Congress--"
1983.82-825,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.525,1316.49,"--in the word ""circumstances""."
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1316.49,1317.13,--That is right.
1983.82-825,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1323.022,1324.816,How about the language?
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1325.989,1329.409,"That is how you can understand the language, that is why I want to look at the history."
1983.82-825,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1329.409,1330.782,I don't blame you.
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1330.782,1346.071,"In '64, Congress provided that Commissioner's charges could only be filed when they set forth the facts on which they were based, and the Commissioner had reasonable cause to believe that a violation of the Act had occurred."
1983.82-825,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1379.95,1387.321,You would be in a much better position if the provision that is at issue here had been included.
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1387.321,1398.302,"But the purpose of the provision, Justice White, was, as I have said earlier, merely to provide that the Respondent had some notice of that charge."
1983.82-825,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1398.302,1409.86,"So you think that the Commissioner, in prescribing requirements which you mentioned a moment ago, can say, we are not going to require circumstances the way the other section does?"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1409.86,1412.094,Excuse me.
1983.82-825,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1412.094,1419.09,You say that the statute provides that a charge shall be in such form as the Commission may provide.
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1419.09,1419.854,Yes.
1983.82-825,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1419.854,1428.632,"Do you think that the Commission could provide saying that the form of charge shall be the following, but it need not include either date, place, or circumstances?"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1428.632,1431.366,The charge could be... could provide that.
1983.82-825,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1442.533,1445.314,"Even though the notice of the charge would have to be more specific, then?"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1445.314,1448.796,"No, the notice would have to include the date, place, and circumstances."
1983.82-825,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1469.054,1476.896,"But, Mr. Wilkins, also, didn't the '64 Act require the Commissioner's charge to be based on reasonable cause?"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1476.896,1477.926,Yes.
1983.82-825,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1477.926,1484.048,"In '72, in those amendments, that requirement was dropped--"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1484.048,1484.578,Right.
1983.82-825,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1484.578,1487.28,--But Congress tightened up in another way.
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1513.036,1529.606,"Justice O'Connor, if you look at the comments that were made and the comments in the legislative report, there is no indication whatsoever that Congress felt that they were imposing any sort of a new factual pleading requirement or any kind of disclosure requirement."
1983.82-825,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1557.487,1563.594,"Mr. Wilkins, may I ask you a rather fundamental question on another point which your argument has brought up."
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1600.69,1607.763,"No, we are not really making any of those assertions, if I understand what you are getting at."
1983.82-825,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1607.763,1611.339,I just want to understand exactly what your position is based on SOCAL.
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1611.339,1619.224,Our position based on SOCAL is that the issuance of an administrative complaint is something that can always be challenged.
1983.82-825,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.707,1631.736,But is it always... can it be challenged in an independent proceeding in Federal Court or only in the proceeding itself?
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1631.736,1639.528,"--After the SOCAL case... After the SOCAL decision, of course, they can't bring an initial proceeding under the Administrative Procedure Act."
1983.82-825,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1661.22,1667.222,"Is it your position that in subpoena enforcement proceeding, they have no right to test the sufficiency of the charge?"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1667.222,1674.077,The sufficiency of the charge is to be determined in the administrative proceeding.
1983.82-825,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.296,1680.388,"You should have won on motion to dismiss without even looking at the language of the charge, is what I am asking?"
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1680.388,1680.856,--Exactly.
1983.82-825,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1680.856,1681.573,Okay.
1983.82-825,0,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1681.573,1685.807,"If the Court has no further questions, I would like to reserve a few moments for rebuttal."
1983.82-825,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1685.807,1694.991,Mr. Williams.
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,1694.991,1698.238,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1983.82-825,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1784.495,1809.269,"Whether that is so or not, I understand counsel to say that any requirement like that is satisfied by the notice that was given in this case, and he says that saying there was discrimination in these particular categories is enough of a notice of the ""circumstances""."
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,1809.269,1817.953,"Which brings us back, Your Honor, to the basic question which is what did Congress mean by that word ""circumstances""."
1983.82-825,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1833.446,1837.131,What would you say they should have furnished to you?
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,1837.131,1850.468,"The word ""circumstances"", Your Honors, generally, in dictionary definitions and in court opinions, is tied to facts."
1983.82-825,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.468,1854.203,"I know, so I am asking you what facts do you think they should have given you?"
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,1854.203,1862.057,At a minimum... I think what the Eighth Circuit required in its decision really sets forth a very minimal standard.
1983.82-825,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.136,1866.681,What specifically would have satisfied you in this case?
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,1866.681,1886.359,"--In an instance such as this, where the charge apparently is based on statistics, the Eighth Circuit indicated that the fact that the charge is based, at least in part, on statistics, the general nature of the statistical data relied on--"
1983.82-825,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1886.359,1894.95,"Because it is a practice, the charge necessarily is a statistical charge; is that it?"
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,1894.95,1900.884,"--Well frankly, of course, we are at a disadvantage because we don't know for sure what this charge was based on."
1983.82-825,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.962,1997.455,"Suppose, in addition to actually furnishing you notice, giving circumstances some meaning, would also assure that the Commissioner actually had facts on which to base a charge."
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,1997.455,1999.783,"That would be correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-825,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1999.783,2015.261,"Mr. Williams, suppose the charge says that you have 316 people assigned to the broom section of your plant, and not a single woman is there."
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2017.854,2020.353,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that would be sufficient."
1983.82-825,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2020.353,2021.399,That would be all right.
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2021.399,2024.101,That would certainly set forth the circumstances.
1983.82-825,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2024.101,2025.836,What would this one say?
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2032.364,2041.766,The charge said that it charged Shell with discriminating in various forms of employment practice against Blacks and women.
1983.82-825,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2042.858,2045.389,Because there were none in these particular sections.
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2045.389,2050.966,--It didn't say that the Commission had considered that there were none in certain sections.
1983.82-825,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2050.966,2052.042,Didn't it say that?
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2052.042,2058.085,"That information did not come forward until much later on in this litigation, Your Honor."
1983.82-825,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2058.085,2060.522,Didn't you know what they were talking about?
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2060.522,2062.741,"Well, Your Honor--"
1983.82-825,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2062.741,2066.894,"The question is, didn't you know what they were talking about."
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2066.894,2076.405,"--The Joint Appendix sets forth documents, about six months of correspondence and meetings between Shell and the Commission."
1983.82-825,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2076.405,2077.22,I am asking you.
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2082.387,2084.404,"Yes, Your Honor, that is the position."
1983.82-825,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2107.55,2111.032,"Who had the facts, the agency or you... your client?"
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2111.032,2115.248,"Of course, the--"
1983.82-825,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2115.248,2116.246,Who had it the first?
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2116.246,2125.57,"--The company has facts, and the agency purportedly has some facts that it has considered in determining to bring this charge."
1983.82-825,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2141.518,2176.395,"Mr. Williams, what if the EEOC in a pattern of practice case did give you information that it was basing their charge on statistical compilations it had made, let's say, the years '78 and '79, which reflected an insufficient number of women and Blacks being hired in certain categories, so you got presumably what you're asserting you should have had."
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2213.66,2214.392,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-825,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2214.392,2215.971,--specified in the charge?
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2215.971,2217.048,"No, Your Honor, it would not."
1983.82-825,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2228.887,2239.12,You concede that the subpoena could request any relevant information for prior or subsequent time-frames?
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2239.12,2240.477,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1983.82-825,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2240.477,2243.885,"You really would have to, under that Oklahoma Press case, wouldn't you?"
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2243.885,2263.327,"The question of its relevance, of course, would be determined under the usual standards of subpoena enforcement procedures, but it is a standard that is easily met at that stage, and we are not arguing that they can't look into those materials given a valid charge and notice."
1983.82-825,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2263.327,2276.196,"The concern, obviously, would be that if we were to agree with you, you don't want to put the EEOC in the position of having to have a mini-trial every time they issue a subpoena."
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2276.196,2279.008,"No, and that is not the concern."
1983.82-825,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2326.648,2343.778,"Do you contend that a Respondent in a proceeding like this, such as Shell, has any right to challenge the facts produced by the Commission and saying those facts aren't correct; in other words, we have other facts, so let's find out whose version of the facts is correct at this stage of the proceeding."
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2343.778,2346.044,"That's not our argument, Your Honor, no."
1983.82-825,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2348.512,2350.337,May I ask about the procedure.
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2350.337,2350.918,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-825,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.918,2356.494,Do you still maintain... Do you maintain that you could have raised these issues in an independent judicial proceeding?
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2356.494,2366.692,"No, we're really... Given the posture in which the case is before this Court, we are really only dealing with the subpoena enforcement procedure."
1983.82-825,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2366.692,2372.035,"It is your position that in a subpoena enforcement proceeding, you contest the sufficiency of the charge."
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2372.035,2372.518,Yes.
1983.82-825,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2372.518,2374.44,Any defect in the charge at all can be raised.
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2374.44,2375.001,Yes.
1983.82-825,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2375.001,2377.001,Are there precedents for that procedure?
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2377.001,2380.359,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-825,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2418.859,2424.076,"So there is really no precedent at all, is your submission, for the Government's... the third part of the Government's brief?"
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2424.076,2425.137,"We are not aware of any, Your Honor."
1983.82-825,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2935.868,2939.943,"As a matter of policy, of course, you can make some very strong arguments the other way."
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,2957.389,2962.154,--I would agree that the principal argument is based on the statute.
1983.82-825,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3188.747,3194.308,May the Commission file a charge just at the sheer request of another party?
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,3194.308,3204.774,"If there is a complaint or request from an individual, yes, the Commissioner can file a charge to--"
1983.82-825,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.774,3233.935,"What if the Commission just gets a letter from somebody that complains in exactly these words that were in this notice, that this company has since the date of the Act discriminated against women and Blacks in certain categories, period, and the Commission files the charge in those very words, and gives notice in those very words."
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,3233.935,3247.599,"--I think, then, Your Honor, the charge would be deficient because the individual's complaint has not complied with the basic requirement that the date, place and circumstances be specified."
1983.82-825,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3247.599,3255.362,So you're saying that the Commission may not file a charge based on the kind of a letter that I indicated.
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,3255.362,3256.704,Not without something more.
1983.82-825,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3281.836,3291.364,"So that any kind of a charge, in any circumstance, the Commission must satisfy this ""circumstances"" requirement."
1983.82-825,1,40791,robert_e_williams,,3291.364,3292.159,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-825,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3300.219,3301.735,Very well.
1983.82-825,2,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3306.372,3308.856,"Just one or two points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-825,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3349.262,3353.462,How do you know whether the charge in this case was facially valid?
1983.82-825,2,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3353.462,3357.6,"--We gave the date, place, and circumstances of the alleged discriminatory conduct."
1983.82-825,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3357.6,3359.553,"If the Eighth Circuit had agreed with that, they would have--"
1983.82-825,2,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3359.553,3363.784,"They wanted more than the date, place, and circumstances."
1983.82-825,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3364.833,3376.406,"--You are saying, though, that the question of whether the circumstances requirement has been complied with is something that can be raised in a subpoena enforcement proceeding."
1983.82-825,2,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3376.406,3377.919,If--
1983.82-825,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3377.919,3380.903,"Surely there is a yes or no answer to that, Mr. Wilkins."
1983.82-825,2,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3380.903,3398.036,"--Well, the subpoena enforcement proceeding should not become a forum for broad-base inquiry into such questions as whether or not the Commission had more facts, whether they could have given more information."
1983.82-825,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3398.036,3400.302,That doesn't help us much.
1983.82-825,2,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3404.19,3407.001,"If you could restate your question, I will give you a yes or no answer."
1983.82-825,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3407.001,3417.952,May the question of whether the circumstances requirement of the statute has been complied with in the notice be raised in a subpoena enforcement proceeding?
1983.82-825,2,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3417.952,3425.212,"Yes, but it should be determined on the face of the subpoena enforcement... on the face of the charge itself."
1983.82-825,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3453.843,3457.778,Nobody is arguing that you should go beyond the facial validity.
1983.82-825,2,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3466.837,3467.695,--Exactly.
1983.82-825,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3515.3,3528.73,"What is you think that one of the purposes for requiring the circumstances was to assure that the Commission didn't have unlimited discretion to file a charge, that it was a fact-based... that it had to be a fact-based charge."
1983.82-825,2,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3541.789,3545.896,--That argument makes some sense assuming that that is what Congress indeed did.
1983.82-825,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3551.301,3552.583,"Thank you, gentlemen."
