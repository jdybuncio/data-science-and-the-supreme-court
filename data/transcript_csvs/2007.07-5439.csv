2007.07-5439,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.197,"We'll hear argument first this morning in the Case 07-5439, Baze v. Rees."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,11.617,20.098,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Kentucky's lethal injection procedures pose a danger of cruelly inhumane executions.
2007.07-5439,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,43.76,48.978,"Mr. Verrilli, your argument is based on improper administration of the protocol."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,54.008,57.647,"I disagree with that respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-5439,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,78.654,94.556,"I thought your expert... I'm looking at page 493 to 494 of the joint appendix... agreed that if the two grams of sodium pentothal is properly administered, the way he put it, in virtually every case there would be a humane death."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,94.556,111.405,"That is true, but there can be no guarantee that it will be properly administered and that is because even in clinical settings there are always... there is always the potential for difficulty which manifests itself in actual problems, for example in the setting of an IV."
2007.07-5439,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,111.405,114.545,"Well, if it were properly administered, would you have a case here?"
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,118.779,126.415,"If there were a way to guarantee that the procedure worked every time, then we wouldn't have substantial risk."
2007.07-5439,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,126.415,126.821,"No, my question--"
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,126.821,127.214,But--
2007.07-5439,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,127.214,131.648,"--Let's assume hypothetically, and we know this isn't true, that 100 percent of the time it's properly administered."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,133.895,149.813,"--Well, if the 100 percent of the time the dose of anesthetic is properly administered into the condemned inmate, then we don't have a significant risk."
2007.07-5439,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,170.472,174.609,But would you... would the monitoring suffice?
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,195.99,197.566,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.949,225.914,"Who would be a medical doctor... and medical doctors, according to the Code of Ethics of the American Medical Association, can't participate."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,225.914,237.645,"Well, Your Honor, of course, that's why there is another practical alternative here, which solves that problem, which is the single dose of barbituate, which does not require the participation of a medically trained professional."
2007.07-5439,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,237.645,255.262,"Well, that seems to be a big part your argument, but it doesn't appear that that argument was raised at all in the Kentucky courts, and it seems that there is virtually nothing in the record of this case that shows that that's practical or that it's preferable to the three-drug protocol."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,262.383,272.237,"Well, if I may Justice Alito, I do think and I'd like to provide the references where it is raised and then the evidentiary references that support the argument--"
2007.07-5439,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,272.237,272.943,Where was it raised?
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,279.362,302.93,"--Well, at page 684 of the joint appendix, the... this is the trial brief, the brief raised in the trial court... one assertion made there is that an alternative chemical or combination of chemicals that poses less risk of unnecessary pain and suffering during an execution is--"
2007.07-5439,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,302.93,321.952,"No, that's... that's the trial court, and you think that just the word an ""alternative chemical poses less risk"" is sufficient to raise the argument that the three-drug protocol is unconstitutional, because a single drug protocol involving thiopental is preferable."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,322.841,323.672,"--And then... and then, no."
2007.07-5439,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,330.731,331.448,What are they?
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,380.054,385.085,The thiopental is a barbiturate and by definition will inflict death painlessly.
2007.07-5439,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,399.467,409.465,"But that's what they're... they're giving a three gram dose, I take it, and if... or two grams or three grams; I thought it was three grams here."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,448.48,463.114,"Well, I think the record references, which I think the record pretty clearly establishes, Your Honor, that death is certain to occur through the use of thiopental at the three gram dose."
2007.07-5439,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,463.114,479.558,"What do we do with the euthanasia... instead of talking... I looked; I found it more important to look at what they do with euthanasia than to look at what they do with animals, frankly, and I was therefore taken aback with the sentence I just read to you."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,482.405,494.712,"Well, I think to refer instead to the expert testimony in this case which says that death is certain to occur, and in addition, that medical testimony in this case that it is certain to occur in a very few minutes."
2007.07-5439,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,499.677,502.316,"That method has never been tried, correct."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,502.316,505.33,"Well, it has never been tried on humans."
2007.07-5439,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,507.611,512.044,Do we know whether there are risks of pain accompanying that method?
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,512.044,518.794,"--I think you do, Mr. Chief Justice, because by definition, barbituates cannot inflict pain and do not inflict pain."
2007.07-5439,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,518.794,525.214,The record establishes that the second drug that's used here is used to prevent involuntary muscle contractions.
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,531.102,537.584,"Well, yes there would, Mr. Chief Justice, because the reality is that thiopental and other barbituates are anti-convulsives."
2007.07-5439,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,543.05,555.544,"Can you... do you agree that that is an appropriate problem to be addressed by the execution protocol, that they should try to reduce the likelihood of involuntary muscle contractions?"
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,555.544,566.509,"--No, because to the extent that the reason that they are offering to do it, is because of the potential for discomfort that it may cause the audience given the risk that the--"
2007.07-5439,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,566.509,575.912,"I think that their... one of their reasons was that it would enhance the dignity, not only of the procedure as a whole, but also to the condemned."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,575.912,601.574,"--I understand that, Mr. Chief Justice, but given the extent to which it increases the risk that there can be ineffective anesthesia, and it can go undetected, it doesn't seem to us to be an argument of sufficient force to justify using it despite that risk particularly when it seems to us that the issue of dignity can be addressed by communication with the audience."
2007.07-5439,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,601.574,612.477,"What do we do with the... if you prevail here, and the next case is brought by someone subject to the single drug protocol and their claim is: Look this has never been tried."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,629.985,644.699,"Well, I think with respect to the lingering death point, I think it would, this Court's cases are talking about is the consciousness of lingering death and the torture that that imposes, which you wouldn't have of course in this situation."
2007.07-5439,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,664.236,682.696,"Mr. Verrilli, I think that your main argument in this case, I mean, there's... barbituate only seems to have come up rather late in the day, as Justice Alito pointed out, but your main arguments seem to be that the controls were inadequate."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,698.208,700.221,The monitor for anesthetic.
2007.07-5439,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,700.221,701.219,Yes.
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,701.219,703.156,To ensure that anesthetic depth has been achieved and maintained.
2007.07-5439,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,703.156,703.89,And what is--
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,703.89,704.518,That is correct.
2007.07-5439,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,704.518,707.829,--Two questions: Who would the trained personnel be?
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,713.077,721.773,"The trained personnel could be a physician, a nurse or anyone trained by them adequately in this process."
2007.07-5439,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,721.773,732.863,"Well, what do we do about the point... the point that the doctors or the nurses say it's unethical to help with an execution?"
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,748.609,756.058,"Well, I think the one point of the one-drug protocol, of course, is to demonstrate that we are not doing that."
2007.07-5439,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,788.774,790.79,Could you use those EMTs?
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,798.648,800.567,With additional training they could be qualified.
2007.07-5439,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,805.534,838.006,"Mr. Verrilli, are we in the difficult position in hearing your answers that, in effect, we're being asked to make findings of fact about the availability of medical personnel and the feasibility of training and so on that the trial court never made because it didn't think it had to make a comparative analysis here, so that if, in fact, the comparative analysis is crucial to the case, we should send the thing back for factfinding by a trial judge rather than trying to do it here."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,840.63,859.59,"It is true Justice Souter that the trial court did not make factual findings on a whole range of issues with respect to the difficulties of constituting the proper dose, the risk of catheter placement, the risk of blowouts, the risk of mixing up syringes, and the adequacy of the monitoring."
2007.07-5439,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,886.001,891.859,"You were interrupted, and you gave Justice Ginsburg... you said you have two problems for monitoring."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,895.547,896.031,Right.
2007.07-5439,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,896.031,897.185,And you were never able to get to the second.
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,897.185,899.623,"With respect to the second, it's a combination."
2007.07-5439,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,919.287,927.313,"Well, as to the cuff, I thought the record was rather clear that it is just not used at these low blood pressure levels."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,927.313,929.656,"No, I don't think so, Justice Kennedy."
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,942.057,946.697,"Mr. Verrilli, this is an execution, not surgery."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,969.029,970.187,--Well--
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,970.187,973.109,That's their contention.
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,973.109,974.45,--There is no slap in the face.
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,996.395,1017.715,"With regard to the trial court's failure to make findings about the availability of people to do this and about the possibility of... practical possibility of more effective and less painful drugs, was that a failure to ignore evidence that you produced?"
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1017.715,1018.449,Yes.
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1018.839,1026.381,Did you introduce evidence to show that indeed medically trained personnel were readily available to do the things you say?
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1026.381,1044.438,"--I don't think we introduced evidence that medically trained personnel were ready available, but we did introduce evidence about what needed to be done and, of course, as I said, Kentucky like the other states had their ability to bring medically qualified personnel to bear to run this process."
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1045.998,1061.304,"I'm very reluctant to send it back to the trial court so we can have a nationwide cessation of all executions while the trial court finishes its work and then it goes to another appeal to the State supreme court and ultimately, well, it could take years."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1061.304,1063.601,"--I understand that, Your Honor, and that's why I suggest--"
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1063.601,1064.397,You wouldn't want that to happen.
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1064.397,1075.268,--That's why I suggested that there is... that this case can be decided on the basis of the record here because the undisputed expert testimony on these key issues shows the deficiencies in the protocol.
2007.07-5439,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1075.268,1076.922,May I ask you another question?
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1076.922,1077.718,Yes.
2007.07-5439,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1077.718,1082.483,May I ask another question about the state of the evidence.
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1108.784,1109.408,That's correct.
2007.07-5439,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1109.408,1110.656,And that was undisputed?
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1110.656,1114.641,Each side's expert testified to precisely the same thing.
2007.07-5439,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1114.641,1115.25,Okay.
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1115.25,1117.0,Three grams was certain to cause death.
2007.07-5439,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1117.0,1128.887,"So that if the current three-gram dosage were used and the second and third drugs were not administered, death would occur based on the undisputed evidence in this case."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1128.887,1130.291,The record establishes that death is certain.
2007.07-5439,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1130.291,1147.596,"Secondly, my understanding, my recollection, is that in a couple of places in your brief, one at least, you referred to the preferability of administering a, and I think the term was, massive dose of barbiturate, which I took to mean more than the three grams."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1149.3,1150.096,No.
2007.07-5439,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1151.906,1153.048,That is the massive dose.
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1153.048,1159.295,"But if one had any doubt about the certainty of the effect of causing death, one could always just increase the dose."
2007.07-5439,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1161.588,1181.471,"Is there any evidence in the record about what the enhanced dose would appropriately be if you decided or if a protocol author decided that there would be no chance whatsoever that death would not occur, and the amount should be greater than three grams?"
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1186.081,1188.187,"--I'm not sure there's anything in the record, Your Honor."
2007.07-5439,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1193.794,1196.294,And the government has told us they do.
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1196.294,1196.949,Right.
2007.07-5439,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1196.949,1197.841,In the Federal response.
2007.07-5439,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1197.841,1202.744,You have objections that would apply even to your single drug protocol.
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1216.895,1222.627,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, because, as I've tried to say earlier, even if there is maladministration--"
2007.07-5439,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1222.627,1226.234,I'm focusing specifically on the mixing of the drugs.
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1233.686,1234.201,--That's correct.
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.803,1256.643,We have been discussing this as though that is a constitutional requirement.
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1295.786,1301.502,We don't make the argument that States are required to choose the least painful method possible.
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1320.633,1322.369,"No, I don't agree with that."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1345.391,1358.681,"That's the second principle, Your Honor, is that this Court's cases, including the ones that Your Honor averted to, have said that the standard is whether the means of execution inflicts unnecessary pain."
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1358.681,1359.321,No--
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1359.321,1359.867,And--
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1359.867,1365.333,"--Unnecessary and wanton, unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1365.333,1371.456,"--Well, the... with all due respect, Wilkerson and Kemmler say ""unnecessary pain""."
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1373.816,1374.299,"Well, then, you're changing your position."
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1379.142,1380.877,"--No, that's correct, because--"
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1380.877,1384.702,"But if you're not using the least painful way, you are inflicting unnecessary pain, aren't you?"
2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1384.702,1386.34,--No.
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1386.34,1387.638,Can you rectify that?

2007.07-5439,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1525.534,1526.392,--From this Court's cases.
2007.07-5439,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1526.392,1528.111,"Dictum in our cases, right?"

2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1608.577,1617.418,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Mr. Verrilli and I agree that if the first drug is properly administered there will be a painless death.
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1624.149,1631.694,But do you also agree with the counter-proposition that if it is not properly administered there is some risk of excruciating pain?
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1631.694,1632.272,Yes.
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.272,1640.502,"And do you agree that if that risk, say, occurred in every case, that it would violate the Eighth Amendment?"
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1640.502,1641.064,Yes.
2007.07-5439,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1675.724,1678.534,"I take it this is obvious, but I wondered when I went through the brief."
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1682.205,1684.47,--Correct.
2007.07-5439,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1688.014,1684.47,What is the training?
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1690.093,1697.775,The training is a certain amount of learning followed by on-the-job experience.
2007.07-5439,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1715.051,1721.5,So it's somebody like the Red Cross worker who puts in the needle when somebody donates blood.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1721.5,1722.58,"No, Your Honor."
2007.07-5439,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1744.289,1773.652,"Mr. Englert, I thought that there wasn't a serious question about who inserts the IV, that those are trained people, but the point that was highlighted was that the people who control the flow into the IV connection, that those people have no training, the ones that are called executioners, the ones who operate the, what is it, the syringe."
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1773.652,1782.929,"Your Honor, Kentucky has safeguards in place to make sure that the inmate is asleep before the second and third drugs are given."
2007.07-5439,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1824.443,1825.395,But they also are not trained people.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1851.602,1857.351,"That's... to say they leave the room is accurate, but the suggestion that they have no further part is misleading."
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1958.856,1964.901,"Yes, but isn't it clear that a five gram administration of that drug would be fatal?"
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1964.901,1965.665,"No, Your Honor."
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1967.179,1975.114,"It's not in the record, but it's in this document that we received the last few days, this long deposition of Dr. Dershowitz."
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1975.114,1978.877,"--Justice Stevens, let me be very precise in this answer, if I can."
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1989.982,1993.589,"And if it doesn't, if you just administered more of the drug, then what?"
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1993.589,1995.055,That's problematic actually.
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.68,1998.475,I understand.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,1998.475,2007.846,"My understanding is that the human body can't take more than a certain amount of the barbituates, so it actually becomes problematic to go past five grams, which is why nobody comes goes higher than five grams."
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2007.846,2014.393,Would you contend that the second drug in the three-drug protocol is necessary in order to make the execution effective?
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2014.393,2015.922,"No, not effective."
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2015.922,2018.718,Particularly the one that the Chief Justice described.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2018.718,2019.389,Correct.
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2019.389,2024.106,You don't want to have unpleasant appearance of death at the time.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2024.106,2026.747,"Well, it's more than unpleasant appearance of death, Your Honor."
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.747,2035.322,"What is the justification for the second drug when it does, that is the drug that creates the risk of excruciating pain?"
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2035.322,2041.054,That's the drug that creates the risk of excruciating if and only if the first drug is improperly administered.
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2041.054,2041.507,Right.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2041.85,2047.52,And the justification is many safeguards are in place to make sure the first drug is properly administered so it doesn't create any real risk.
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2055.543,2059.308,The dignity of the process outweighs the risk of excruciating pain?
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2059.308,2060.466,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.105,2067.071,But then the risk of excruciating pain outweigh the risk of an undignified death?
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2067.071,2073.927,"A substantial risk of excruciating pain, a substantial risk of excruciating pain--"
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2073.927,2074.772,Even a minimal risk.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2085.11,2089.235,"--Your Honor, if I may answer your question a little bit indirectly."
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2100.573,2101.54,"Well, what's"
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2102.928,2105.116,"Again, your Honor, this is way outside the record."
2007.07-5439,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2107.818,2113.036,They use a single drug protocol for animals because it's more humane than the three drug protocol.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2113.036,2114.487,"--No, no."
2007.07-5439,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2128.058,2128.948,"Well, isn't it required by Kentucky law?"
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2128.948,2136.664,"--The use of pancuronium bromide or any neuromuscular blocking agent, any paralytic, is barred by Kentucky law--"
2007.07-5439,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2136.664,2141.865,"Okay, so something more is involved than merely veterinary practice."
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2141.865,2155.998,"--In the veterinary setting someone, some appropriate policymaker has made the decision that what they perceive as risks outweigh the benefits."
2007.07-5439,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2155.998,2156.388,Right.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2165.807,2166.509,Well--
2007.07-5439,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2166.509,2173.1,Does the Kentucky law do anything other than adopt the AVMA guidelines.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2173.1,2185.204,--All the Kentucky law does is forbid the use of a neuro muscular blocking agent euthanizing animals and that's there is no record of this but presumably that's because veterinarians told the state legislature that was a good idea.
2007.07-5439,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2185.204,2225.782,"Why was that necessary to pass a law if the standard veterinary practice was not to use T I'm obviously trying to get to what evidence we have here for a finding somewhere that we can take into consideration that there is a comparative benefit under the, under the veterinary practice as distinct from the protocol which has been devised so isn't it reasonable to suppose that the Kentucky legislature needs some kind of a finding came to some kind of a conclusion that in fact there was/SEUG deleterious about using the second drug."
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2225.782,2226.796,That much is reasonable.
2007.07-5439,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2226.796,2227.654,Okay.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2227.654,2234.903,What's deleterious about using the second drug we all agree is if the first drug is maladministered it can cause pain.
2007.07-5439,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2251.395,2278.742,"The only cost correct me if I'm wrong but the only cost that you have identified in using the one drug only are number one, the appearance cost which you equated with dignity in your response to Justice Stevens and number two, the possibility and I don't know how strong a possibility but the possibility that the one drug would not work."
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2283.398,2283.959,Yes.
2007.07-5439,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2285.254,2294.675,"And I take it you don't have a figure for that, Justice Stevens said 10 minutes and I don't think you had a clear answer one way or the other as to whether there was likely to be more."
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2294.675,2304.607,If you go outside the record of this case in which the record wasn't allowed go into the Harbison record the logic I believe Dr. Dershowitz testified he would expect it to take 30 minutes.
2007.07-5439,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2304.607,2315.853,"And 30 minutes is against some risk of excruciating pain is, that in effect is it reasonable to say 30 minutes is too long."
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2315.853,2322.147,Depends on how large the risk of excruciating pain is here there is very little evidence risk of excruciating pain.
2007.07-5439,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2322.147,2325.739,Is your point that there is simply no quantification of what that risk is.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2325.739,2326.394,No.
2007.07-5439,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2329.033,2329.782,Okay what's your.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2329.782,2343.088,"Take a look at speaking rhetorically, one can take a look at the list of so-called botched executions in this country, the appendix to Professor xxxx law review article, the death penalty information center website."
2007.07-5439,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2389.703,2400.743,So the nub of your argument really is they have not made a case or they do not have a record case for any significant likelihood of excruciating pain.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2400.743,2403.008,That's correct.
2007.07-5439,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2441.13,2465.716,"It's still unclear why they should make such an effort to get trained personnel in the first instance and then even if they are in the next room, why isn't, why did they deliberately pick nonprofessional people to both administer the drugs and to check the inmate for consciousness."
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2465.716,2467.416,--There are reasons for that Justice Ginsburg.
2007.07-5439,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2467.416,2468.559,What are the reasons.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2468.559,2469.276,Okay.
2007.07-5439,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2483.583,2492.767,But have you that expert team and it seems that they would be preferable to executioners who have no professional qualifications.
2007.07-5439,1,39134,roy_t_englert,,2492.767,2499.108,--The expert team the people who have had 100 practice sessions since the last execution are the people who administer the drugs.
2007.07-5439,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2499.108,2504.727,I mean the people who administer the... who place the IV lines.
2007.07-5439,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2504.727,2506.837,They have... they have zero expertise in pushing drugs.
2007.07-5439,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2513.163,2515.786,"Mr. Englert, can I ask you a rather basic question?"
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2527.125,2531.189,"Well, I think what's properly before the Court is only the latter question."
2007.07-5439,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2532.421,2552.664,"So if we just decide this on the ground... and the record is very persuasive in your favor, I have to acknowledge... but if we decide the fact that Kentucky is doing an adequate job of administering this protocol, that would leave open the question whether the basic use of this second drug, which does nothing but avoid unpleasantness of the visitors, is itself constitutional?"
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2552.664,2553.382,--Well--
2007.07-5439,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2553.382,2555.974,Do we have to wait for another case to decide that rule?
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2555.974,2559.659,"--I... the Court could write an opinion either way, obviously."
2007.07-5439,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2563.141,2585.104,"Because I... to be very honest with you, I think that you're... you make a very strong case on the administration in Kentucky on the record in this case, but I'm terribly troubled by the fact that the second drug is what seems to cause all the risk of excruciating pain, and seems to be almost totally unnecessary in terms of any rational basis for a requirement."
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2585.104,2585.603,"Well, Your Honor--"
2007.07-5439,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2585.603,2587.432,But that we're not going to be able to decide today.
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2587.432,2591.991,--Petitioner's own brief acknowledges that the three-drug protocol can be applied constitutionally.
2007.07-5439,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.365,2597.11,"It may have been in this very case, it may be."
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2602.656,2607.514,"--Every State that has publicly said what it uses, uses the three-drug protocol."
2007.07-5439,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2610.529,2613.571,"But no legislature has ever required it, as I understand it."
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2613.571,2615.29,"No, no. 14 legislatures have required it."
2007.07-5439,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2615.29,2616.604,The three-drug protocol?
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2616.604,2617.4,The three-drug protocol.
2007.07-5439,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2671.251,2674.905,And the executioners are also not visible to the public?
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2674.905,2675.591,Correct.
2007.07-5439,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2675.591,2684.884,There was a finding that the second drug serves no therapeutic purpose.
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2684.884,2685.855,That's correct.
2007.07-5439,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2685.855,2686.526,That's--
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2686.526,2687.774,We don't quarrel with that.
2007.07-5439,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2735.318,2745.424,"But if we held that that justification was insufficient to justify this protocol, it's hardly likely we would hold that it's so serious and make the whole procedure unconstitutional."
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2745.424,2747.97,I'm not sure I follow the question.
2007.07-5439,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2747.97,2755.824,The interest in protecting the dignity of the inmate and of the observers is the justification for the second drug.
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2755.824,2756.479,Yes.
2007.07-5439,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2756.479,2768.381,"If we held that that... that that justification is insufficient to justify the protocol, how could we ever hold that that justification is so serious as to make the whole procedure unconstitutional."
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2768.381,2769.741,I'll tell you frankly how you could hold that.
2007.07-5439,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2783.203,2789.079,And presumably it would depend upon whatever new alternative the plaintiff in that case proposed.
2007.07-5439,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2789.079,2789.796,Correct.
2007.07-5439,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2810.554,2811.911,"Thank you, Mr. Englert."
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2819.097,2840.338,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioners ask this Court to invalidate a method of execution that everyone agrees is entirely pain free when followed and to order the State of Kentucky to adopt a method that has never been used in any execution and is out of step with the laws and practice in every death penalty jurisdiction in the United States."
2007.07-5439,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2889.85,2911.481,What do you say to the response which I think was in the briefs that the substantiality requirement has been derived in the course of conditions of confinement... sort of litigation... and we really should regard execution as sort of a... a separate subject for purposes of coming up with a standard.
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2912.495,2913.418,A few things.
2007.07-5439,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2940.578,2957.838,"Well, we did for purposes of making a habeas 1983 distinction, but I... is the distinction supportable when we come down to the question whether there should be a standard specific to execution as opposed to other conditions?"
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2957.838,2960.259,"I don't think it is, Justice Souter."
2007.07-5439,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3000.787,3018.952,"Is there any comparative element in the substantial risk standard, if it were clearly established, undisputed that there was an alternative method that was much less risky, would there be an Eighth Amendment problem with the State or the Federal government nevertheless persisted in using a method that was inferior?"
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3018.952,3025.12,We think that that could be part of the analysis... that you would look to other feasible available alternatives.
2007.07-5439,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3026.309,3028.684,"If that's part of the analysis, this never ends."
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3028.684,3029.51,"--Well, Justice--"
2007.07-5439,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3029.51,3038.273,"If that's part of the analysis, there will always be some claim that there is some new method that's been devised, and once again executions are stayed throughout the country."
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3038.273,3041.849,"--And we agree with that, and that's why we think that Petitioner's standard is wrong."
2007.07-5439,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3067.32,3076.66,"So you're standard is that there has... well, don't let me misphrase it for you, but there have to be other obvious available alternatives."
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3076.66,3090.625,"--Well, the way that we've described it, Justice Kennedy, is you that have to show a substantial risk that the method you're challenging would impose a considerably greater degree of pain than other available feasible alternatives."
2007.07-5439,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3107.006,3116.517,"So your threshold one is the only safeguard you have against Justice Scalia's concern against endless litigation, or does your threshold two do the same thing."
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3116.517,3130.197,"Well, threshold two would as well because once you're into that kind of comparative inquiry you would still have to take a careful look at the feasible other alternative and no one has ever tried the one drug alternative."
2007.07-5439,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.383,3141.146,Those who oppose capital punishment entirely across the board are quite willing to take a careful look at everything.
2007.07-5439,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3166.103,3172.21,"You have to, I mean, I can't, I don't know if ""substantial"" is the right word to capture it."
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3226.545,3228.214,And the answer is no.
2007.07-5439,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3243.411,3265.872,Yes but if we don't do something like that in this case Mr. Garre another case is going to come along and we are going to be right back here a year from now or 18 months from now and wouldn't it be better to get one case litigated thoroughly and get the issue decided rather than simply wait here for another one to wind its way.
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3265.872,3268.589,We think that this court should decide the issue.
2007.07-5439,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3274.603,3315.586,"Sure but if we decide it on this basis the next Petitioner is going to say I'm coming into court with evidence these people did not present and therefore we are going to have a new case and new round of litigation and I think what's disturbing Justice Breyer what's disturbing me and others is we want some kind of a definitive decision here, and it seems to me that the most expeditious way of getting it if comparison analysis is appropriate and I will be candid to say I think it is is to send this case back and say okay do a comparative analysis, make the findings and we will then have a case that will in effect resolve the issue as much as one case can ever do."
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3315.586,3334.951,Let me make two responses to that if I could again we don't think Petitioners have shown anything close to a substantially of risk that would get you into that comparative analysis here and second a virtue in allowing there is a virtue in not going further in this case and allowing the states themselves to continue to assess this matter.
2007.07-5439,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3353.13,3371.985,"--You say that substantial, that comparison with other possibilities is not necessary so long as the only risk that is coming is a risk of negligence or improper execution of what, of what the protocol requires right?"
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3371.985,3373.451,--That would be--
2007.07-5439,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3373.451,3383.511,"You would say that so long, so long as the only risk comes from negligent application of the protocol, no comparison is required?"
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3383.511,3384.089,--Yes.
2007.07-5439,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3384.089,3397.222,"And if we decided that, if we decided that if this protocol is properly executed, it does not create a substantial risk that would be the end of the matter wouldn't it."
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3397.222,3398.236,That would be the end of the matter.
2007.07-5439,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3398.236,3400.018,And we would not have another case in front of us next year.
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3400.018,3402.222,That's probably true.
2007.07-5439,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3413.655,3420.838,Mr. Garre would you explain to me why the Federal Government has picked five grams instead of three.
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3420.838,3422.527,May I answer the question.
2007.07-5439,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3422.527,3422.885,Yes.
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3422.885,3423.509,Yes Your Honor.
2007.07-5439,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3442.391,3443.813,Did you mean to say unconsciousness.
2007.07-5439,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3443.813,3451.028,"--Unconsciousness, yes to render the inmate deeply unconscious for a number of hours that's established by the record thank you very much."
2007.07-5439,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3451.028,3452.077,Thank you Mr. Garre.
2007.07-5439,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3455.041,3456.62,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
2007.07-5439,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3490.604,3505.832,But the anesthesia concern of course is you don't want to kill the person when you're administering just anesthesia in a surgery so you would want somebody trained there to ensure that you could bring them back if anything went wrong that concern is not present here.
2007.07-5439,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3505.832,3554.747,Nor is it present with respect to euthanizing animals and nevertheless it's the danger of the anesthesia going wrong there can be a torturous pain inflicted that has led veterinarians after careful consideration to say you have to have somebody in the process who is trained in monitoring anesthetic death and Justice Breyer if I could refer back to your Netherlands point my understanding is that in the Netherlands there is a doctor present who is trained in anesthesiology who administers this whole process and so the risk is dramatically different in a situation where you have that trained person there than the situation we have in Kentucky now with respect to the other states and the other so-called botched executions that my friend Mr. Englert referred to is just not right to say that they were all about cut downs and small problems.
2007.07-5439,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3670.556,3672.369,Finish your sentence.
2007.07-5439,5,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3672.369,3673.211,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-5439,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3684.719,3686.045,Thank you counsel.
