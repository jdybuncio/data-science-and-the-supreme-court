1956.619,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.155,"Number 619, Chester E.Jackson, Petitioner versus John C. Taylor, Acting Warden in United States Penitentiary."
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,28.804,30.837,May it please the Court.
1956.619,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,255.945,263.073,Do I understand your only complaint is regarding the -- the impropriety of the sentence?
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,264.338,266.515,"The -- the -- quite that, sir."
1956.619,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,275.218,276.746,A rehearing of what?
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,276.746,278.03,On the proper sentence.
1956.619,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,278.03,278.877,On the proper sentence?
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,278.877,279.229,Yes.
1956.619,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,279.229,286.3,"That is the -- the original court-martial would be reconvened for an imposition of sentence, is that it?"
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,286.3,295.698,"The law -- the law -- the code – the Uniform Code of Military Justice provide that a rehearing shall be conducted before a Board composed of officers, not members of the trial."
1956.619,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,295.698,301.178,"I'm not talking about the Board of Review, but if -- if you prevail, what would happen?"
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,301.178,310.522,The -- it will be referred for a new trial or a rehearing before a new court-martial with none of the same officers of that hearing.
1956.619,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,310.522,314.002,"A rehearing of -- a rehearing of what, the merits?"
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,315.913,318.578,"No, only as to sentence."
1956.619,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,318.578,320.015,With a new court-martial.
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,320.015,321.132,With a new court-martial.
1956.619,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,321.132,324.658,Is that -- would you mind telling me what the Code provision is as to that?
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,324.658,327.935,The Code provision isn't specific on the subject.
1956.619,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,351.277,364.18,"That is -- but a -- a -- a different body of officers who would accept the finding of guilt and then determine them, have merely a hearing as to what sentence should be imposed, is that it?"
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,364.18,366.322,I do not wish to say that.
1956.619,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,369.26,373.542,"But in your contention, if you -- if you prevail here, what would you be doing?"
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,373.542,376.652,That the Board of Review will return it for rehearing.
1956.619,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,376.652,377.09,Yes.
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,377.09,392.39,"I feel that on the rehearing, that the proper thing, do -- the only thing to do is to leave open to the court-martial the function to determine all of the things that happened here and then permit the court-martial."
1956.619,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,392.39,395.848,But -- but to not retry the determination of guilt.
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,395.848,396.25,"No, sir."
1956.619,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,404.212,411.914,"But a different body of officers would assess the heinousness or the gravity of the offense and then decide what sentence to impose, is that it?"
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,411.914,412.467,Correct.
1956.619,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,465.346,473.265,"Now, before you do that, did I understand you to answer Mr. Justice Frankfurter that you thought there should be a new trial on the merits by new a board of officers?"
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,473.265,484.079,"A new trial by a whole new court-martial, but I don't feel that we can still have the right to retry the issue of guilt."
1956.619,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,484.079,485.489,Just on the question of sentence?
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,485.489,489.25,Just on the question of sentence.
1956.619,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,663.139,667.754,"Well, under your proposition, exactly what evidence would be taken?"
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,673.329,687.427,"Oh, I believe it would have to hear all of the evidence concerning the facts of the case up to, but not including the facts that the woman died by some method, means or hand unknown sometime later."
1956.619,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,687.427,690.036,"Now, how long ago did this incident occur?"
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,690.036,694.325,"This occurred in March -- on March 16, 1951."
1956.619,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,694.325,697.204,"Now, that's six -- six years ago?"
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,697.204,699.378,"Yes, sir."
1956.619,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,699.378,706.238,"How -- how practical is a review of the testimony sure of the death, at this juncture?"
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,706.238,709.245,"At this juncture, it is I think impractical."
1956.619,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,720.646,726.772,"Well, suppose they -- suppose -- supposed they can't get a single one of the witnesses at this time, then what happens?"
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,730.642,740.122,I still feel that the court-martial can and may impose sentence because any other interpretation would be so –-
1956.619,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,740.122,741.942,"Well, I know but I'm trying to get, what –-"
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,741.942,742.056,I think it has to be --
1956.619,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,742.056,744.975,-- what the result of your -- what -- what was followed?
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,750.001,753.317,I think they have to read from the record of trial in the past.
1956.619,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,753.317,755.982,"And then impose sentence, merely upon what they read."
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,755.982,757.399,I -- I fear so.
1956.619,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,764.502,764.898,Is -- is there any (Voice Overlap) --
1956.619,0,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,764.898,775.339,"My contention is that this man is imprisoned under a void sentence, imposed by a tribunal having no authority to impose that sentence."
1956.619,1,34402,leon_s_epstein,,1173.905,1175.52,"Yes, if it please the Court."
1956.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1186.905,1188.144,"Well, you represent another defendant --"
1956.619,1,34402,leon_s_epstein,,1188.144,1188.397,"Yes, sir."
1956.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1188.397,1189.247,"-- anyway, don't you?"
1956.619,1,34402,leon_s_epstein,,1189.247,1189.577,"Yes, sir."
1956.619,1,34402,leon_s_epstein,,1189.577,1190.007,I represent --
1956.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1190.007,1190.324,Yes.
1956.619,1,34402,leon_s_epstein,,1190.324,1191.847,"-- the defendant, Fowler --"
1956.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1191.847,1192.074,Yes.
1956.619,1,34402,leon_s_epstein,,1192.074,1199.69,-- and we came before this Court on a little bit different theory of law and it must have been substring.
1956.619,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1199.69,1201.503,Do you have separate brief?
1956.619,1,34402,leon_s_epstein,,1201.503,1205.126,"Yes, sir."
1956.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1283.527,1285.214,You said they went into a house.
1956.619,1,34402,leon_s_epstein,,1287.035,1288.366,"Yes -- yes, sir."
1956.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1294.944,1295.394,"Well, it was a --"
1956.619,1,34402,leon_s_epstein,,1295.394,1296.224,They --
1956.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1296.224,1298.019,-- a habitat for a family anyway.
1956.619,1,34402,leon_s_epstein,,1298.019,1298.512,Well --
1956.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1298.512,1298.669,Is that a --
1956.619,1,34402,leon_s_epstein,,1298.669,1300.827,-- it was a habitat for something.
1956.619,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1300.827,1301.538,I beg your pardon?
1956.619,1,34402,leon_s_epstein,,1301.538,1305.201,Let's put it -- it was a habitat for something.
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2464.457,2472.347,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1956.619,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2744.851,2772.157,"Before you get to that, and that -- those figures of thousands of cases you gave us, is there any figure of the number of instances like this where the gross sentence was a sentence for an offense a, sentence greater than could in law be imposed for the lesser offense and then the greater offenses stricken out?"
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2772.157,2772.346,No.
1956.619,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2796.377,2806.062,"Well, I'm -- I'm just wondering how helpful those figures of thousands of cases are, we don't know how many situations such as this one have been acted upon before."
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2806.062,2816.696,"I take that the contention here would go so far as to say, that you're entitled in every case where there has been a modification of finding to have it divided to the Court."
1956.619,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2816.696,2818.147,I didn't understand it that way.
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2818.147,2820.394,But the logic of that I think would occur as that.
1956.619,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2820.394,2825.581,"That may be, but as I understood the argument, counsel was as applied to this situation."
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2828.768,2829.217,Well --
1956.619,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2829.217,2832.146,-- what you said.
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2832.146,2851.555,"I think they need not go beyond their own case certainly, but I -- I think the -- the logic of their argument is that since you have a gross sentence practice in the military, you can't predict -- predict is a wrong word."
1956.619,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2907.42,2926.341,"Mr. Spritzer, may I ask you to do what I know you will do in a few minutes and I don't mean to ask you at this phase, to come more directly to the -- to the problems that it created by the present legislative scheme regarding a reviewing authority."
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2951.173,2951.271,Yes.
1956.619,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2951.271,2966.583,"-- but I want to know more particularly, what -- what were the organs of review by a trial to the military code on the practice, which you can draw in order to illuminate military code."
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2967.823,2971.056,Yes you -- you have Your Honor.
1956.619,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2971.056,2977.891,"Otherwise, the -- the history is relevant only if we've got a continuity of -- of more or less continuity of -- of the procedure."
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,2977.891,2978.352,Yes.
1956.619,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3041.651,3042.529,If you're going to that --
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3042.529,3042.708,I hope --
1956.619,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3042.708,3043.608,"-- because, you intend --"
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3043.608,3043.964,-- to do that.
1956.619,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3043.964,3056.342,"-- but we will have to come to the very terms of (c) and (d) and I suppose what your argument is heading into is to read into (c) and (d) a glass from history, is that right?"
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3056.342,3057.422,"Well, I think the --"

1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3059.064,3059.621,I think the Articles --

1956.619,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3063.42,3073.368,"All right, but you have to -- you will have to go to the Articles themselves and also find what conflict you can from the history which underlined those articles."
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3073.368,3073.473,"Yes, Your Honor."
1956.619,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3073.473,3074.649,Would that be a statement?
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3074.649,3100.656,"Yes, and it is because of the fact that this case turned so largely upon an understanding of what the military system divides by Congress is that we've taken a rather unusual step of submitting to the Court several charts, which seek to set out in more or less graphic form what is rather complicated."
1956.619,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3114.941,3116.226,"Where is this, Mr. Spritzer?"
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3116.226,3121.857,"We have filled a set of charts with the Clerk, which were to have been distributed to the Court."
1956.619,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3121.857,3122.725,They have that.
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3126.417,3132.072,"Now, at the top of this chart one, one finds the court-martial."
1956.619,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3268.655,3270.357,What about agreement?
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3270.357,3271.445,I didn't catch Your Honors question.
1956.619,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3271.445,3273.68,What about agreement?
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3273.68,3278.389,The oral reviewing authorities are limited in two respects.
1956.619,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3288.194,3291.164,How long has that been the rule?

1956.619,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3309.812,3311.227,If it wanted too.
1956.619,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,3311.227,3311.765,Pardon?

1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,6519.716,6524.777,"First of all, I would like to comment in a good deal of what has been said by opposing counsel."
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6868.066,6868.822,How do we know that?
1956.619,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6868.822,6869.589,I don't see how you --
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6869.589,6871.775,How do we know that?
1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,6871.775,6874.814,"Well, we must presume that the Court, were honorable gentlemen."
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6925.602,6955.509,"I don't -- just as to me, just as rational to assume that didn't -- I now put the reverse of my difficulty to that which I put to Mr. Spritzer, just as -- that's for me to assume they say, “This fellow ought to get life for this retched did and he ought to got 20 years for the rape,” but the life takes care of the 20 years so we don't have to add a redundant figure of justice for action, for all I know probably true."
1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,6955.509,6969.022,"Perhaps, sir, but in discussing this situation where it is not and -- and taking up this -- this proposition that it is not necessary for the Army to burden itself with all of these rehearings and appeals."
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7008.003,7008.307,But it was --
1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,7008.307,7009.618,-- whether they don't have to change.
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7009.618,7011.691,But it was within the limits.
1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,7011.691,7015.748,"No, sir, the maximum penalty for the good count is 20 years or --"
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7015.748,7016.192,Well --
1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,7016.192,7016.885,-- life imprisonment.
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7016.885,7017.796,That's the excess.
1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,7018.905,7020.102,"Oh, yes."
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7020.83,7021.081,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,7021.081,7022.338,-- wholly court doing that.
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7022.338,7023.232,Pardon me?
1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,7023.232,7027.687,"That was the appellate tribunal locking it off, but the Mansfield doctrine is that when --"
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7027.687,7027.863,"Well, I --"
1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,7027.863,7028.921,-- a trial court --
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7028.921,7032.573,What -- why should I bother about the Mansfield doctrine anyhow to this military justice?
1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,7033.139,7049.081,"Well, you see, that is the only -- the only place where the Board of Review has any basis for any authority of any kind to tailor a sentence to or to -- yes, to tailor or fit a sentence to a crime."
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7049.081,7051.399,That all depends how you read.
1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,7053.265,7054.714,Paragraph?
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7054.714,7055.505,C.
1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,7055.505,7056.207,B and D --
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7056.207,7056.671,Yes.
1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,7056.671,7059.726,"-- of Section 66, yes indeed so."
1956.619,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,7066.955,7068.166,"Well, that's right."
1956.619,3,43525,urban_p_van_susteren,,7075.619,7083.692,I -- I think I have spelled out that it will not in this Court announce the rule that the Board of Review have no -- no authority or power to do as it does.
