2004.04-6964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.647,"We'll hear argument now in No. 04-6964, Jay Shawn Johnson v. California."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,69.118,72.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,148.366,149.171,"Well, that's not very--"
2004.04-6964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,149.171,154.638,"That's a very low standard in the first place, and why should it be watered down more?"
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,154.638,157.24,"I'm... I'm not suggesting it be watered down, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,170.045,175.692,Is the test for going to the jury the same as the test for whether or not discovery can proceed?
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,175.692,177.169,"No, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,179.26,182.135,"Well, I'm... I'm surprised you set the bar that high."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,183.602,204.882,"I guess I had the benefit of the argument before the Court last year and the benefit of further reflection, and I think that allowing the case to go to the jury is a good standard except for my proviso that if it was close and the... was in equipoise, then the benefit ought to go to obtaining the reason because it is a discovery-type request."
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.882,213.671,"--Well, I was just admiring your... your proposal in that at least it relied on something that the lower courts are used to applying."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,231.297,236.817,The tie goes here to... the standard would be fine with... with or without the benefit of a tie.
2004.04-6964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.497,247.616,"Well, what's the standard under title VII when we talk about that, when we talk about enough evidence to shift the burden of proof?"
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,249.467,269.104,"The standard under title VII is something less, Your Honor, because under title VII, under McDonnell Douglas, the plaintiff has to prove four factors, that the plaintiff was a member of a protected group, protected minority group; that the plaintiff was qualified for a job and applied; that the plaintiff was rejected; and that the position stayed open."
2004.04-6964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.037,280.954,"Well, in... in Batson, I guess the opinion for the Court suggested that it was basing it on the title VII cases, the McDonnell Douglas formula."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,283.263,292.137,"--It's a parallel... it's based on McDonnell Douglas in the sense that... that there's a parallel step of prima facie case, shifting the burden of production."
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.828,307.528,What... what happens if he doesn't come up with an answer in... in this case?
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,307.934,308.462,We have--
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,308.462,313.566,"--what happens if the prosecutor just says, gee, I... you know... or the... the prosecutor has died?"
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,318.03,319.555,"--That's about four questions, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,320.521,320.894,No.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,327.736,342.151,"The trial... if the State refuses, wilfully refuses to present an answer, the trial court could and most likely will, draw an inference from that intentional refusal and hold that inference against the State."
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,342.151,347.98,"--Are you going to say that if... if there's no answer, then the challenge is presumed to be correct?"
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,347.98,350.087,"No, I'm not saying that."
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,350.087,350.423,All right.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,353.607,354.482,Yes.
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,355.949,359.431,It seems to me that's quite different from the standard that requires it go to the jury.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,368.785,369.197,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,369.197,380.242,"And that's... it... it seems to me that's a... that's much more rigorous than the standard that you've proposed in... in your brief, and that... and that other courts use in the Batson case."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,390.774,393.056,"Very much so, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,393.056,395.066,And... and that's quite different than sending a case to the jury.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,395.066,411.226,The... the standard for... I believe the standard we're asking... that's... that's why I said the standard of sending the case to the jury but with the benefit of a doubt going to the... obtaining the reason.
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,411.226,423.076,"May I... may I go back to your answer to the... the question whether in the absence of an answer, there is a presumption of a Batson violation, and you said, no, there isn't a presumption--"
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,423.076,423.396,That is correct.
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,423.396,425.338,--where the court has still ultimately got to decide it?
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,431.124,434.526,"At step one, whether or not there's a--"
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,434.526,434.831,At step three.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,436.915,437.204,--Yes.
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,437.204,440.383,"Step one, whatever the standard is, it has been met."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,445.903,453.605,The court considers the plaintiff's showing of a prima... the... the objector's showing a prima facie case.
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,457.306,457.812,Which is zero.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,459.886,462.809,"If... if... I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,464.818,464.936,Yes.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,464.936,481.473,"If there's a prima facie case and if the prosecutor or the challenger wilfully refuses to answer, the trial judge is entitled to draw an inference from that refusal to answer and I believe most likely would draw the inference that there's something wrong here and therefore would find a prima facie case."
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,481.495,481.473,All right.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,502.663,506.614,"I do not know, Your Honor, because we have never seen a situation in which a--"
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,506.614,507.094,All right.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,507.671,509.01,--prosecutor has refused to answer.
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,509.01,510.279,--Let me suggest this.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,530.704,538.006,We have argued in our brief that it's not correct for the trial judge to speculate as to the prosecutor's possible reasons.
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,538.006,538.257,Right.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,581.061,582.0,"I... I agree, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,584.688,592.39,"Then why don't you have to say at that stage, if there is silence on the part of the government, he's got to find the violation?"
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,592.39,602.699,--I... I... the only words that would differ would be got to.
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,606.218,610.009,"But if he doesn't have to, he's got to have some reason for doing it."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,638.084,648.553,"--I believe that it... it would require... that he would ultimately uphold the challenge but on the basis of drawing an inference from the refusal to answer, and those two... adding two and two together, adding the--"
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,648.553,651.63,"No, but... but the refusal to answer... I just... you know, it happened so long ago, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,657.405,659.404,"--Alright, in the case of don't remember, Your Honor--"
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.404,659.532,--Don't remember.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,659.532,662.182,--Batson has been the law for 18 or 19 years.
2004.04-6964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,683.243,692.79,"Mr. Bedrick, in your brief you were very, it seemed, uncomfortable about addressing this question."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,703.968,704.219,Yes.
2004.04-6964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,704.219,705.387,--stage one.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,755.988,761.433,"The... the title VII test and the Batson test are parallel, but not identical."
2004.04-6964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,763.459,769.33,"But suppose you had in a title VII case the employer says, I'm not going to give you a nondiscriminatory reason."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,784.373,803.707,"--The trial... the trial court would find for the plaintiff because under the title VII formula, which this Court has established in the McDonnell Douglas/Furnco line of cases, the finding of a prima facie case entitles the plaintiff to a presumption."
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.707,805.525,"Well, that's because--"
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,805.525,806.549,And it's bursting the bubble--
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.549,806.708,--Wow.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,806.708,807.146,--slightly--
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.146,809.433,I... I don't think we've ever said that.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,830.889,837.913,--The employer will always give a reason and the challenger will always give a reason because of--
2004.04-6964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,837.913,843.807,"What happens in a title VII case if, in fact, we meet just what Justice Ginsburg said?"
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,847.439,847.902,--Yes.
2004.04-6964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,847.902,850.665,The plaintiff gets up and establishes the four points.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,860.158,865.336,I believe in the title VII context the judge would direct the verdict for the plaintiff.
2004.04-6964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,865.336,867.64,Unusual.
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,868.114,882.065,"And... and it seems to me the... your... there's some difficulty in... in trying to equate Batson challenges and... and title VII, and that's because your beginning point is that you base... you... you require too much of the prima facie case."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,886.738,887.313,Yes.
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,887.313,891.377,And that's... that's a special use of the term prima facie.
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.376,934.175,"May I suggest you might have put the high threshold because it's a threshold that judges are familiar with and can use, whereas reason to inquire would be a fine test for when a judge is permitted to demand a response but it cannot possibly be a test for when a judge is required to demand a... what does... what does reason to inquire mean?"
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,938.181,943.188,I accept the suggestion from the Court that the standard could also be reason to inquire.
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,946.456,946.794,What does it mean?
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,946.794,947.828,And the Batson procedure would work.
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,947.828,948.937,What does it mean?
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,948.937,951.795,It means when there is the purpose of--
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,951.795,953.086,Any suspicion whatever.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,953.086,954.883,"--Pardon me, Your Honor?"
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,954.883,957.268,Any suspicion... he strikes one black from the jury.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,957.268,959.161,"No, not any suspicion whatsoever."
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,960.158,961.747,It has to be reason to inquire.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,961.747,963.074,--It has to be reason to inquire.
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.074,962.941,What's--
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,962.941,965.746,It would vary depending on the circumstances.
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,966.082,968.38,And... and is that like permitting discovery to go forward?
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,968.38,972.167,--That's essentially what step one of Batson is--
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,972.167,973.58,And... and is that standard less than going to a jury?
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,973.58,975.356,--Yes.
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,975.356,976.63,All right.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,988.332,999.472,"But title VII doesn't quite work because the... the prima... the definition for prima facie case in title VII is different, and it's easier."
2004.04-6964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1025.605,1029.819,"--Then are you saying, look, judge... imagine you had a jury on this question."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1042.576,1043.739,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's my position."
2004.04-6964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1043.739,1044.209,That's it.
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1045.301,1047.066,Could... could I take that a step further?
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1061.77,1062.816,Yes.
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1062.816,1078.341,"Number two, if there is silence at stage two or in Justice Scalia's example, the prosecutor just can't remember, and we then go to stage three, your position is as follows."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1143.861,1144.56,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1144.56,1145.05,Okay.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1145.05,1164.4,"An example... the only example that I can think... the only practical example that I can think of, however, where a trial court is likely not to draw a strong negative inference from the prosecutor's failure to answer is in the situation suggested where it reviews it... reviewed it on appeal and the prosecutor died."
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1175.812,1183.845,I... I take it in your view the California standard is more strict than the title VII standard for prima facie case.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1183.845,1185.247,"Yes, Your Honor, in my view it is."
2004.04-6964,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1185.247,1192.352,"Well, the California court at least appears to say it's the same."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1192.352,1199.551,The... I believe the California court has misread title VII practice in several ways.
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1219.594,1225.391,And do we say that that equates to a standard of more likely than not or do we not say that?
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1225.391,1230.597,The... those facts under title VII must be proved more likely than not.
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1234.693,1237.598,Is... is step one of title VII more likely than not?
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1237.598,1238.591,--Yes.
2004.04-6964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1238.591,1242.5,"Well, I don't see how that's much different from what California is doing."
2004.04-6964,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1242.5,1248.44,I thought step one was evidence from which it could be found more likely than not.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1248.44,1251.113,Yes--

2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1263.854,1266.851,"--That's correct, Your Honor, under... under Batson."
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1276.263,1296.753,"--Can I ask you a question about the other part of your case, which is that the judge cannot consider in... in step one anything except the... except the... the racial strikes and... and nothing else and cannot even speculate as to what causes might have produced the strikes?"
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1299.083,1299.557,It is--
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1299.557,1304.895,How can you possibly decide whether it... a reasonable juror could find this?
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1323.199,1332.713,"--Your Honor, that's a... in that example, which I respectfully submit would be rather extreme and unusual, the trial judge should still not speculate."
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.033,1377.901,"But once... once you have the lenient test that you've established, why isn't it enough to say even with that... even with that speculation, a reasonable juror could find?"
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1397.907,1407.586,"In presenting a test... in presenting a test or significant formula, every once in a while there will be a case where this test is slightly over-inclusive."
2004.04-6964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1420.107,1427.238,"Yes, but one of the things, it seems to me, you're all overlooking is that if it's as obvious as they're all blind, those would be challenges for cause."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1427.238,1428.081,"Very much so, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1428.081,1431.899,We're talking about challenges where there are no... no obvious basis for it.
2004.04-6964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1431.899,1439.43,"Well, in practice, Mr. Bedrick, is it always worked out like this kind of a minuet?"
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1446.08,1446.886,Yes.
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1468.271,1472.474,Why do we need the same... the same rules for State and Federal courts?
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1479.466,1499.642,"Because under Batson and then under Purkett v. Elem and under Hernandez v. New York, this Court has declared that Batson is a rule of Federal constitutional law, that the purpose of Batson is to protect the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the jurors to equal protection and not being perempted for racial reasons."
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1500.031,1502.367,"Yes, but... but State courts have different rules of evidence."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1513.123,1514.233,--The California--
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1514.233,1519.107,Why can't... why can't the Batson question similarly be decided but decided under State rules of procedure?
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1519.107,1524.227,--The California Supreme Court made no claim to be deciding this case under State rules of procedure.
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1545.127,1552.07,"So you would have no objection to our limiting our opinion, saying, you know, reversing and remanding and saying this is not Federal law."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1558.309,1560.015,"I would respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1560.015,1561.162,"No, you don't want us to do that, do you?"
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1561.162,1562.03,"No, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1575.652,1595.385,"Isn't it sometimes even when you're not involved with a constitutional question, if you have a Federal claim in a State court... Byrd against Blue Ridge is one example... the Federal procedure... that the State procedure needs to be modified so it's in sync with the Federal?"
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1595.385,1596.586,"I agree, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1596.586,1600.159,That was a question of what kind of questions go to juries.
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1600.159,1600.767,Yes.
2004.04-6964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1600.767,1609.258,"The State said ordinarily we don't give this kind of question to the jury, but we're dealing with a Federal claim, and the Federal procedure trumps."
2004.04-6964,0,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,1609.258,1610.036,Yes.
2004.04-6964,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1613.817,1615.353,"Very well, Mr. Bedrick."

2004.04-6964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1654.191,1664.014,"Well, do... do you agree that the California standard is more rigorous than the standard applied by the Federal courts and by most State courts?"
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1664.014,1665.225,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1677.533,1680.556,Do you think the California rule is the same as the Federal rule?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1680.556,1683.777,--I think the Federal rule has been stated in many different ways.
2004.04-6964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1696.171,1699.909,"Well, what about Hanson, and is it Purkett v. Elem?"
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1699.909,1701.04,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1730.906,1738.975,"But that's in... in the title VII context, certainly you don't have to show more likely than not to get past the initial threshold."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1770.025,1773.849,"Your Honor, in the title VII circumstance, you are correct."
2004.04-6964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1834.407,1840.875,I thought all it did was shift the burden of production to the defendant.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1846.219,1847.654,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1909.79,1915.058,"I mean, you... you can say that its words say that, but what it does doesn't say that."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1941.676,1947.281,"--It is enough to say that when unexplained, when there's no response from the employer, yes."
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.609,1949.074,Really?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1949.074,1950.241,--That--
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.241,1950.946,Do you really believe that?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,1975.568,1977.596,"--Well, that is... Your Honor, sorry."
2004.04-6964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1980.519,1982.311,Hicks does say that.
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.153,1983.84,It does say it.
2004.04-6964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1984.602,1985.717,All right.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2054.793,2062.399,"--Well, Your Honor, in the title VII case, I believe that what happens is that the case does go to the jury."
2004.04-6964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2064.11,2071.699,"Well, if it's not a directed verdict, then a fortiori, then every analogy works against you."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2071.699,2072.152,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2085.158,2085.399,No.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2087.025,2087.152,Yes.
2004.04-6964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2087.152,2088.902,"--elements, directed verdict."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2090.257,2090.492,Right.
2004.04-6964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2090.492,2092.672,"--about that, which is what Hicks says--"
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2092.672,2092.876,Yes.
2004.04-6964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2092.876,2096.135,"--we have a choice, a fork in the road."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2097.143,2097.719,Yes.
2004.04-6964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2097.719,2098.594,Which fork?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2111.291,2115.35,Because that would upset the balance that... that Batson has drawn.
2004.04-6964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2162.469,2173.604,"On step one, I take it it's not enough to simply say, look, the person challenged is a member of a minority group."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2175.855,2176.756,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2202.83,2204.595,But I'm talking about step one.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2204.595,2205.858,"--Yes, and this is step one, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2205.858,2207.256,This is all step one?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2207.256,2207.922,This is all step one.
2004.04-6964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2253.319,2259.131,Why... why is the defense attorney in a better position to explain the... the motives of the prosecutor than the prosecutor?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2259.131,2259.717,--Not--
2004.04-6964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2259.717,2260.234,I don't understand that.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2260.234,2269.514,"--Not to explain the motives, Your Honor, but to confront the totality of the circumstances that are present in that courtroom that Batson requires that party to confront."
2004.04-6964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2269.514,2272.426,The question is what motivated the prosecutor.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2272.789,2273.285,Yes.
2004.04-6964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2273.285,2279.194,It's hard for me to see how the... the defense counsel is in a better position than the prosecutor to show that.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2279.194,2285.417,"He's in a better... he is in the position to meet his obligation under Batson to explain why, given--"
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2285.417,2292.57,--The question is not what motivated the prosecutor unless and until the step one showing can be made.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2292.57,2294.025,"--Yes, Your Honor, and thank you."
2004.04-6964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2295.028,2301.561,"But, of course, you can afford to be very rigorous at step two because your threshold at step one is high."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2312.046,2317.363,--Step two does not have any persuasiveness component to it.
2004.04-6964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2325.901,2328.108,And here there was no reason given.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2328.108,2330.661,"Here, because there was no prima facie case, Your Honor, yes, there was no reason given."
2004.04-6964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2330.661,2337.494,So why shouldn't this operate as so many things do in... in an unfolding proceeding?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2377.948,2382.694,There may be an adverse inference that would be drawn from that.
2004.04-6964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2411.321,2425.641,"But one of them, if we're going to continue with that analogy to someone who says I won't make discovery, is not just an inference but that you take what the opposing party says to be true on that issue."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2425.641,2427.182,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2431.076,2433.358,This is not... not issue preclusion.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2440.109,2455.821,"--Yes, but in... in this circumstance, the... the striking party's silence is one... when the test is set at the inference level not at the more likely than not level, the... the test is one... I'm sorry... not the test, but the... the silence is one of strategic judgment."
2004.04-6964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2464.167,2474.865,"I must confess I'm a little puzzled about the discussion of the trial strategy because is it not correct that whenever the judge thinks step one has been met, the prosecutor always answers the question?"
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2474.865,2488.625,"He doesn't always answer the question because it is understood that, having shown at step one it is more likely than not that there's discrimination, silence at step two will result in an adverse finding."
2004.04-6964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2489.532,2494.534,"Well... well, whatever it is, he... generally they are not silent when the judge says I think step one has been met."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2509.995,2511.878,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2511.878,2515.92,"Now, that is not the test in an ordinary tort case in California, is it?"
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2515.92,2518.432,In a case of... of--
2004.04-6964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2518.432,2519.509,In an ordinary tort case--
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2519.509,2519.839,--No.
2004.04-6964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2519.839,2530.948,"--if the judge, at the end of the plaintiff's case, says I'm not sure what the answer is, but there is enough evidence here to submit to the jury, so I'm going to overrule the motion for judgment... judgment at the end of the case."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2534.777,2537.577,"Yes, Your Honor, because in that circumstance in deciding--"
2004.04-6964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2537.577,2544.755,"So you... so you have two... in California you have two definitions of a prima facie case, one for Batson and one for all normal tort litigation."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2544.755,2552.61,"--In California, we like every other jurisdiction, as far as I know, probably has two definitions, just as this Court does."
2004.04-6964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2552.61,2561.921,And is it not true that the definition that your opponent asks for is the same definition that would apply in tort litigation in California and in most States of the country?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2561.921,2562.06,Yes.
2004.04-6964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2562.86,2566.972,So you're asking for a special rule for California's application of Batson.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2566.972,2568.423,"No, Your Honor, because in that circumstance--"
2004.04-6964,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2568.423,2572.577,It sounds like you are in that it's a tougher standard than normal.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2583.819,2584.885,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2584.885,2597.63,"And could that present enough evidence that the fact finder, if it were referred to the fact finder, could find a Batson violation?"
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2597.63,2599.071,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2602.196,2611.934,So why is that not enough to satisfy the standard to require the prosecutor to give an answer?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2611.934,2619.581,"--Because, for example, the appellate perspective as to whether a fact finder could make that conclusion, could any rational finder of facts draw that conclusion."
2004.04-6964,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2619.581,2626.348,Is it because the judge could imagine reasons that the prosecutor might have had?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2626.348,2629.26,"It is not a question of... of imagining reasons, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2635.584,2645.766,Would your answer here be exactly the same if there had been 12 African American prospective jurors and all 12 were struck?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2647.787,2654.586,"--Yes, it might in that the... the inference would be probably... it would be much stronger the greater number you have."
2004.04-6964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2659.626,2671.157,"But... but your test is... is that the judge under California law is required to find that there's a strong likelihood or a reasonable likelihood, but he must do that without hearing the prosecutor's reasons."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2672.778,2673.284,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.253,2712.935,"Yes, but it would be the same rule if it was a bench trial."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2727.611,2757.364,"--But it does also turn, Your Honor, in part on the nature of the interest at issue, and the particular process that the Court set up in Batson to create an order... order... system of proof and to allow the proper balance to be struck between the importance of peremptory challenges and their use in selecting a fair and unbiased jury and the interest in assuring that there has not been a constitutional violation, much for the same reason that in Ristaino we do not inquire on mere possibility."
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2820.53,2834.13,"Do you think that the... the steps in this case have to be determined by what we do in title VII, that whatever we do here should be... should be, must be the same as what we do in title VII?"
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2834.13,2835.666,I think it provides a close analogy.
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2846.411,2853.114,"Well, but perhaps only for... for the operation of, you know, what the various steps are."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2856.763,2868.902,"Well, Your Honor, I believe the phrasing was that it's explained the operation of prima facie burden of proof rules, and that's the footnote on page 94, sort of the operation of the burden of proof rules that is at issue here."
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2871.366,2872.838,A lot of people don't read footnotes.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2874.853,2877.963,"--Well, Your Honor, California's Supreme Court did."
2004.04-6964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2885.653,2891.178,Could I... I just confirm my understanding of how the jury selection process in California works?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2902.601,2904.142,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2915.746,2917.907,After the for-cause challenges have been--
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2917.907,2918.36,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2918.36,2918.861,--Then you exhaust it.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2918.861,2919.506,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-6964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2938.103,2939.921,May... may I just--
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2939.921,2940.545,"Oh, please."
2004.04-6964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2940.545,2942.641,--ask you to clarify one thing?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,2961.003,2969.525,California is following the standard that we believe Batson has identified.
2004.04-6964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2989.514,2999.62,So you're not arguing that States have flexibility to apply Batson according to different procedural rules.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3006.201,3013.641,"We're arguing, first, the Ninth Circuit is wrong and that California's rule is consistent with Batson."
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.791,3061.511,"Mr. Schalit, can you give me some reason why I should care a whole lot about this?"
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3089.265,3093.228,Because it intrudes on other interests that our State--
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3093.228,3093.585,What?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3093.585,3094.416,--It intrudes on--
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3094.416,3095.221,Like... like what?
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3095.221,3110.153,--I believe it intrudes on the parties' interest and work product and opinion work product and attorney-client privilege and perhaps even the defendant's Sixth... Sixth Amendment right because it may require divulgence of those types of confidences.
2004.04-6964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3110.153,3115.807,So the State has an interest in exercising peremptories.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3115.807,3116.937,"Absolutely, Your Honor, yes."
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3132.772,3133.155,"Well, I agree."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3151.997,3152.984,Because--
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3152.984,3156.578,"That's what I can't understand, why that is so important to the State."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3156.578,3163.282,--Because the... the challenges essentially cease being peremptory and become quasi-challenges for cause.
2004.04-6964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3172.338,3176.011,"But it still could be... I mean, you're not taking away the peremptory."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3187.483,3199.434,"--Well, the challenge does cease being peremptory because the Equal Protection Clause has overturned the State statute that provides that challenges... peremptory challenges are challenges for which no reason need be given."
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3199.434,3200.89,But Batson overruled that.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3212.383,3213.406,Absolutely not.
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3213.406,3213.994,So they're gone.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3222.612,3229.78,Because Batson could have chosen to adopt a Connecticut-style strict objection system.
2004.04-6964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3259.891,3266.6,"Of course, in avoiding that chill, you're in effect saying the prosecutor is entitled to one or two free discriminatory challenges."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3266.6,3275.314,"Well, certainly there... there is a somewhat different consequence in... in the standard as articulated by petitioner in that the striking party does get perhaps a freebie."
2004.04-6964,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3280.397,3281.97,The dog is entitled to one bite.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3281.97,3283.351,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2004.04-6964,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3283.351,3286.098,"I say, the dog is entitled to one bite."
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3286.098,3286.647,Oh.
2004.04-6964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3288.711,3290.044,It's a New Hampshire rule.
2004.04-6964,1,42050,seth_k_schalit,,3293.686,3295.553,"--Thank you, Your Honors."
2004.04-6964,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3296.997,3298.123,"Thank you, Mr. Schalit."
2004.04-6964,2,41012,stephen_b_bedrick,,3301.562,3314.528,Here the prosecutor perempted all three black jurors and left a black defendant to be tried by an all-white jury in a racially tinged case.
