1975.75-328,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,19.081,21.878,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.75-328,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,119.666,125.928,Has that not been -- in fact it is exclusive funding?
1975.75-328,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,125.928,126.84,It is difficult to say that.
1975.75-328,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,406.671,412.184,(Inaudible) corporate structure; is it just an activity that is conducted by Warren-Trumbull?
1975.75-328,0,28145,harry_r_sachse,,412.184,417.094,So far as I know it is just an activity conducted by Warren-Trumbull.
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,1750.685,1754.121,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.

1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,1879.569,1895.993,The public officials were either the chief public official in the community are his appointee and then certain other public officials selected by him.
1975.75-328,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1897.717,1900.303,Would this be the mayor for example?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,1900.303,1905.224,"The Mayor of the City of Warren in this instance and the County Commissioner, yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-328,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1905.224,1913.128,The Corporation authorizes the Chief Executive Office of the City to appoint the said members of the Board?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,1913.128,1928.075,"This Corporation, as the affidavits filed by the respondent show and especially that of Mr. Brekcenwich (ph) who was at the outset, one of the founders and was an attorney who helped in the setting up of the corporation."
1975.75-328,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1953.951,1959.409,"I am still curious, perhaps it in the record, but I did not observe it."
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,1964.377,1968.509,"Well, that I do not know other than to say that --"
1975.75-328,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1968.509,1970.019,Is there a copy of the charter in the record?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,1970.019,1972.632,A copy of the charter is filed.
1975.75-328,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1972.632,1974.818,"It is not in the appendix, is it?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,1974.818,1976.835,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-328,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1987.037,1988.61,Would that be an answer to my question?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,1988.61,1991.675,I am not sure that it would.
1975.75-328,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1993.537,2000.651,The articles of incorporation in page 32.
1975.75-328,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2000.651,2003.529,(Inaudible) I will.
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2003.529,2017.366,"Now, it is of the utmost importance that it be recognized that this was not a local agency in any ordinary sense of the word."
1975.75-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2123.2,2134.51,"That does not necessarily make it in an instrumentality or agency of the United States though, does it or a corporation primarily acting as such?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2134.51,2150.975,"Not necessarily, but there has not been any real contention that it was not prior to this and all of the facts and circumstances would indicate that this was a corporation acting primarily as an instrumentality of the Untied States."
1975.75-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2150.975,2158.467,"But that is really what you have to prove, is it not, not simply negative effect that it was a contractor?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2158.467,2159.943,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2321.5,2337.411,Do you suggest that this young driving the car was in essentially the same standing and position as the driver of the bus that would be furnished by the local bus company as a contribution to the program?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2337.411,2340.055,"Yes, Your Honor, This --"
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2340.055,2348.245,The man who came down the street and got into the line of cause would be in the same position?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2348.245,2350.736,"No, Your Honor, in this instance --"
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2350.736,2351.58,Why not?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2351.58,2353.858,Perhaps I do not understand.
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2353.858,2357.281,You say that this man is an employee.
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2359.78,2362.618,"What he has is this, Your Honor."
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2377.614,2380.785,Would that apply too for the car?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2380.785,2382.073,I do not know.
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.671,2386.078,"He will say, he could deduct it from his income tax?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2386.078,2388.994,"[Laughter] Well, I do not -- That might well be."
1975.75-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2390.536,2392.869,"But that turns it upside down, does it not?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2398.564,2399.213,Correct.
1975.75-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2440.327,2450.565,"But what you are saying is not that this fellow got paid something and was therefore an employee, but that he paid something and was therefore an employee?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2450.565,2455.978,"Well, in this instance there were two buses which would be used."
1975.75-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2481.321,2486.552,"Now, to say you donate your services does not make you a volunteer to act as an employee?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2493.169,2500.555,"That is true, but I do not believe that that excludes the possibility of this man being an employee."
1975.75-328,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2511.427,2517.336,Has there been an action against the driver of the automobile?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2517.336,2519.988,"The record is silent on that, Your Honor."
1975.75-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2540.339,2562.926,"Under the Sixth Circuit holding in your view of the case, if on this outing, one of the boys or girls had been drowned while swimming in the lake, assuming they went swimming on the picnic, would there be in you view a cause of action against the United States for not furnishing adequate supervision to see that no one drowned?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2562.926,2567.911,"If there were such factual basis, yes."
1975.75-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2572.273,2588.804,"Or if they started a little league baseball team and one of the boys with the bat got hit in the eye by the pitcher’s throw, cause of action against the United States?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2588.804,2615.574,"Under the Ohio Law, of course there is a substantive risk of that sort thing, but absent that, the agency, it is our position that the activities of the Warren-Trumbull Council are just as much activities of the United States as activities of the Office of the Economic Opportunity or any other Federal agency that it is within the definition a Federal Agency."
1975.75-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2615.574,2628.708,"These two buses that you described which are owned by the local council, suppose there had been a serious accident on one of those, same result, the United States is responsible?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2628.708,2629.395,Yes.
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2644.65,2653.933,"If we find that this young man was an employee rather than independent contractor, he just donates his services?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2653.933,2656.555,"It is our position, Your Honor that the agency --"
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2656.555,2660.776,What hold did the Federal Government have over him?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2660.776,2667.838,"They told him when to leave, what route to follow."
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2673.598,2679.473,"I submit that in other agency, if they tell you to do something, you do not do it, you get fired."
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2684.364,2686.008,"Correct, not to take his services to have some else --"
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2686.008,2688.257,"Would it break his heart, would it not?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2688.257,2689.906,[Laughter]
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2689.906,2695.985,"I just do not see this man volunteered the services and in this later date, you find that he is an employee?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2695.985,2702.42,"Well, that I respectfully submit is not an issue before this Court."
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2702.42,2707.303,Does the Tort Act say employee?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2707.303,2708.843,The Tort Act says --
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2708.843,2710.777,That word?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2710.777,2722.092,The Tort Act says that employees of a Federal Agency are employees of the United States and the issue --
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2722.092,2728.181,"Well, all the children that were in that bus, would they have any action against the government?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2728.181,2730.03,Yes.
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2730.03,2732.351,Have they sued?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2732.351,2735.464,To my knowledge none of the others were hurt.
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2735.464,2737.499,"Well, if they had been hurt, they would have a right of action too?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2737.499,2738.828,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2738.828,2742.437,And that would go to everybody in that caravan?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2742.437,2743.293,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2757.165,2763.335,"You say, they are immensely controlled, what are you going to do with the Court of Appeals finding that they were not?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2763.335,2765.769,Day-to-day the Court of Appeals --
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2765.769,2769.23,"Yes, day-to-day is a magic word in this Act."
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2769.23,2771.025,Alright.
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2771.025,2778.172,"Magic series of words, did not the Court hold that?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2778.172,2797.805,"The Court of Appeals, if I may read from its opinion, the portion that was not read by Mr. Sachse, he did not read this portion, “On the underhand by withholding --"
1975.75-328,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2797.805,2798.332,What page?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2798.332,2799.344,Oh! I am sorry.
1975.75-328,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2800.134,2801.702,Thank you.
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2801.702,2807.232,What did the (Inaudible)
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2807.232,2820.578,"Moreover, the requirements imposed on his local agencies by statute and regulations are not concerned with the details of the day-to-day operations of the agencies or the programs which they carry on in the Warren-Trumbull County area."
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2852.769,2866.747,"Well, I think that the principal usually if he says, “I will give you money providing you do thus and so and you agree to do thus and so and you stop doing thus and so, you stop getting the money?”"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2866.747,2875.072,"Correct and if there is a contract, you have a right of action to claim that you did do thus and so in substance."
1975.75-328,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2879.2,2893.129,"Supposing the Mayor of Warren had been driving the car, would the young man injured have the same cause of action that you are depending here?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2899.164,2901.277,That was a point made by the District Court.
1975.75-328,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2901.277,2902.701,"The District Court, that is right."
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2902.701,2935.058,"And the Mayor of Warren or John Jones or anyone else, if he were acting on behalf of the Warren-Trumbull Council was in our contention a temporary perhaps employee of the Untied States Government and the Federal Tort Claims Act specifically provides that though the employee be only temporary, if he is on an activity of the Untied States Government, he is an employee of the United States and covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act."
1975.75-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2943.473,2950.323,Is there some provision in fact that members of the Board cannot be employees?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,2950.323,2951.203,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.75-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2998.837,3033.361,"Mr. Pfau, is there not a certain incongruity of Mr. Sachse's right, that Congress' basic intend and I am talking about instrumentality of the United States' Corporation, he says with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, The Commodities Credit Corporation, all kinds of national operations based in Washington and then you say this too is that and it is one of apparently 800 similar entities, each localize in a small part of one of the states?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,3033.361,3048.631,There is no limitation in the Act to corporations of the nature pointed out by Mr. Sachse and the Congress specifically considered limiting the Act to such corporations and thought not to do so.
1975.75-328,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3100.331,3105.376,Is there anything in the regulations that require these organizations to carry liability insurance?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,3105.376,3107.664,"No, there is not, Your Honor."
1975.75-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3157.824,3165.798,"In rules of construction of statutes, what inferences do you suggest are to be drawn from that?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,3165.798,3182.226,"From the construction of the statute, it would appear that organizations not contractors with the Untied States were to be covered in the intent of Congress by that provision."
1975.75-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3183.141,3191.053,On the other hand it shows that when Congress wanted to create liability that it did so explicitly?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,3191.053,3204.837,"It did so explicitly with job core members because it might otherwise, they would be considered loaned servants or that sort of thing on loan to various industries that they might be working at and --"
1975.75-328,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3204.837,3208.916,"The job core itself is not a corporation, is it?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,3208.916,3211.525,"The job core, I think that is correct, Your Honor."
1975.75-328,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3213.279,3224.722,It would be covered with by the general language of the federal Tort Claims Act in the absence of a specific provision making it --
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,3224.722,3225.238,The job --
1975.75-328,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3225.238,3236.733,"-- or as your claim is that your client is a corporation and under the general language of the Tort Claims Act, a corporation primarily acting as an instrumentality or agency of the United States?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,3236.733,3238.5,"Yes, Your Honor and rather remarkably --"
1975.75-328,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3238.5,3241.154,The job core simply could not and would not fit into that?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,3241.154,3248.611,"Well, the job core members were appointed directly by the Office of Economic Opportunity."
1975.75-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3281.367,3287.847,There been a good many decisions defining instrumentality of the United States?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,3287.847,3289.928,"Astonishingly, there have not been."
1975.75-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3289.928,3293.387,"Well, not in this Court (Inaudible)"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,3293.387,3297.349,"Astonishingly, Your Honor there have not been."
1975.75-328,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3464.88,3471.258,"But you can have public corporation, can you not, without it being an instrumentality of the United States or acting on behalf of the United States?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,3479.452,3480.566,That is perhaps true.
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3537.69,3544.309,The United States government official dissolved a state corporation?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,3544.309,3545.592,They simply did it.
1975.75-328,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3546.797,3549.501,You know what they said was no more money?
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,3549.501,3553.143,They wrote and said your Board of governing -- this what they did.
1975.75-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3559.227,3569.839,"They did not -- if the regional director did not have the power, is that not quite significant, is that not something the Court must inquire into?"
1975.75-328,1,45877,william_e_pfau_jr,,3569.839,3601.417,"Perhaps the Court must inquire, but it is the fact as to how this agency, this particular agency was run and governed that is controlling in this particular case on the motion for summary judgment and we respectfully submit that we have established here by these affidavits and depositions that this was a corporation, acting primarily, actually exclusively as an instrumentality of the United states."
1975.75-328,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3601.62,3602.604,Thank you Mr. Pfau.
1975.75-328,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3605.406,3607.71,I have nothing else unless the Court has questions.
1975.75-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3607.71,3610.258,There is a question I would like to ask you if I may.
1975.75-328,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3618.994,3626.183,"It would not through the United States, whether it is so much as State Corporation I suppose would be a question of local Ohio Law."
1975.75-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3626.183,3636.951,"I am just thinking of the impact of a judgment against this organization if it is entirely funded by the United States, I suppose ultimately the judgment will be paid by the Untied States, if it were to be paid at all, is that right?"
1975.75-328,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3636.951,3650.92,I think it would depend on whether the corporation has funds in its accounts and also whether the suit was brought against the corporation as a corporation or against the individual directors who failed to do what they --
1975.75-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3650.92,3656.199,"In theory of this complaint, the suit would go against the corporation, would it not?"
1975.75-328,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3666.564,3673.692,I do not want to put myself in the position of telling the plaintiff what he should do other than (Voice Overlap) United States.
1975.75-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3673.692,3677.326,"Assuming that (Voice Overlap) was committed, that no one is responsible?"
1975.75-328,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3677.326,3679.472,"No, it is my position that --"
1975.75-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3679.472,3680.481,(Voice Overlap) was committed by the corporate entity?
1975.75-328,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3680.481,3689.581,That these vehicles should be ensured and that the corporate entity should be insured and that if the Board of Director--
1975.75-328,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3689.581,3692.119,(Voice Overlap) corporation?
1975.75-328,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3692.119,3700.675,I think that will be correct and if the Board of Directors had failed to provide adequate insurance then the proper defendant may be the Board of Directors.
1975.75-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3700.675,3707.888,"If the corporate entity were ensured, the defendant in this lawsuit would not be the insurance company, it would be the corporate entity?"
1975.75-328,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3707.888,3709.984,That is correct.
1975.75-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3709.984,3710.961,And in fact that the --
1975.75-328,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3710.961,3711.94,I get a little confused on --
1975.75-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3711.94,3727.25,"The fact he was not insured, but that does not detract from the appropriateness of the Corporate Entity being the defendant in this lawsuit and the further fact is that it is only funds are funds that came from the federal government?"
1975.75-328,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3727.25,3731.68,We actually do not know whether the corporate entity was insured.
1975.75-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3731.68,3734.559,"Well, you told us earlier that it was not, I thought or implied?"
1975.75-328,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3734.559,3736.473,I do not think so.
1975.75-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3737.348,3743.677,"Well, whether or not insured, has nothing to do with the appropriateness of the defendant in that lawsuit?"
1975.75-328,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3743.677,3745.756,That is correct.
1975.75-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3745.756,3756.841,"It was your friend who suggested the inadequacy of the insurance carried on the particular vehicle is what entered in the decisions, tactical decisions about the lawsuit?"
1975.75-328,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3756.841,3757.446,"Yes, sir."
1975.75-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3757.446,3759.14,May I ask you one other question before you sit down.
1975.75-328,2,28145,harry_r_sachse,,3777.858,3780.358,I think that is correct.
1975.75-328,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3780.358,3782.072,Thank you.
1975.75-328,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3782.072,3782.834,Thank you gentlemen.
