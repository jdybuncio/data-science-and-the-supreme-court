1995.95-340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.469,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-340, United Food & Commercial Workers Union Local 751 v. The Brown Group doing business as Brown Shoe Company."
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,13.3,17.872,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.917,161.66,"Mr. Gold, what is the actual injury to the union?"
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,161.66,162.491,--The--
1995.95-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.491,164.031,The failure to get the notice?
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,164.031,171.297,"--Right, the violation of its right to get the notice--"
1995.95-340,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.297,179.635,"Well, how does giving a recovery to the employees redress that injury to the union?"
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,179.635,193.252,"--The nature of the notice right is not one which inures to the union as an institution, as a person."
1995.95-340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.1,373.791,The damages sought are back pay?
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,373.791,374.992,Correct.
1995.95-340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,399.028,400.109,Liquidated--
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,400.109,402.521,Liquidated damages or penalties is what was referred to.
1995.95-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,402.521,407.676,"--Mr. Gold, what is the standard procedure in these cases?"
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,427.969,441.88,I can only say that at the time... this was 1992... people who brought the case read the statute and proceeded in the way that they believed was right.
1995.95-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,524.554,541.253,"Mr. Gold, you're in one different position here, I suppose, from the CBA situation, because you're union is in effect a statutory representative, so the fact that you don't have a union member as a party doesn't really prevent you from arguing that this is essentially a class action."
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,557.255,558.405,"Oh, absolutely."
1995.95-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,581.121,589.096,"Isn't that the easy way, in effect, for us to decide this case, or the easiest, you might say?"
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,589.096,592.308,We believe that this is a direct standing case.
1995.95-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,604.687,608.348,"Well, we know it's not absolutely like it, but we're worried about Article III here, and--"
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,608.348,608.658,Right.
1995.95-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,608.658,616.933,"--And it's, the analogy is, I suppose, close enough for you to say it's, for Article III purposes you ought to treat it just like a class action."
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,616.933,619.076,Absolutely.
1995.95-340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,659.0,672.2,"Mr. Gold, do you think the reasoning of the Eighth Circuit was that, conceding that Congress has authorized this, it violates Article III to authorize it, or simply that it was not clear that Congress had authorized it?"
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,672.2,680.846,"--No, I... we understand the Eighth Circuit to have said that Congress couldn't proceed this way."
1995.95-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.801,713.947,"Mr. Gold, why is the injury in this case the failure to give notice?"
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,732.178,734.14,"Well, there is--"
1995.95-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,734.14,748.63,"You see, I have a sort of instinctive resistance to the notion that you can create purely abstract procedural rights, like the right of everybody in the world, or the right of a particular union to ""notice"" without any substance behind the notice."
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,754.494,758.067,--It is the conjunction.
1995.95-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,780.53,789.937,"So you have no objection to my considering the injury in this case to be not the failure to receive notice but the closing of the plant, without having done that beforehand, of course."
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,789.937,790.318,--Right.
1995.95-340,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,790.318,792.408,"Oh, but it's both, I take it."
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,792.408,792.718,Yes.
1995.95-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,819.816,821.567,Let me ask another question.
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,821.567,821.937,Yes.
1995.95-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.937,848.705,"If you want us to pursue the theory that Justice Souter was asking you about of representational capacity on the part of a union, I'm... again, my problem is I'm reluctant to acknowledge that for Article III purposes Congress can make anybody the representative of anybody else and just say, you know, for purposes of vindicating this right, you know, John Doe shall have standing to sue."
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,863.595,866.366,"Well, but in the trustee situation--"
1995.95-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,866.366,867.518,The trustee owns the property.
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,867.518,868.647,"--All right, but--"
1995.95-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,868.647,869.589,--so the person really interested can't sue.
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,869.589,884.539,"--The beneficiaries aren't incapable, and in this situation you do have a situation that Congress took very much into account."
1995.95-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,904.504,907.976,And it is not an organization formed just for the purpose of this suit.
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,909.186,909.447,Right.
1995.95-340,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,909.447,910.378,--representational existence.
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,910.378,928.811,"Right, and it has... one of its representational existences is to negotiate collective bargaining agreements and bring suits like this, if there is a breach, to collect back pay and other remedies for the individuals."
1995.95-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,950.696,958.531,"Mr. Gold, you don't concede, do you, that in the associational standing cases the members of the association are incapable of suing?"
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,958.531,958.912,No.
1995.95-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,958.912,959.352,No.
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,959.352,960.431,No.
1995.95-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,960.431,962.334,So they're in the same boat as the--
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,962.334,962.713,Right.
1995.95-340,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,962.713,963.794,--union members here.
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,963.794,977.491,That was yet another... that is yet another example of the fact that these... that representational litigation is not so narrowly defined as to be for people who are incapable.
1995.95-340,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,977.491,985.979,What do you make of the argument that to determine the compensation the employees must come into this lawsuit as individuals?
1995.95-340,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,985.979,1003.521,"I don't think that... first of all, Congress purposely simplified the remedy here so that it is according to a formula and based on back pay."
1995.95-340,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1027.205,1031.887,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1033.909,1042.595,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1083.782,1084.173,But Mr. Jenkins--
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1084.173,1084.363,Pardon me.
1995.95-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1084.363,1095.291,"--it does seem that the remedy granted is not particularly designed to redress the union's injury, if it's back pay for all the members."
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1095.291,1097.122,"We think it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1112.622,1115.755,"Well, why is that?"
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1132.235,1151.859,"We think that's correct, but the nature of the injury in this instance is a harm, a frustration of the union's ability to participate in its statutory role and in its organizational role, to participate both in the retraining and readjustment process which Congress found notice to be relevant to, and its ability to function as a collective bargaining representative under the labor laws."
1995.95-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1151.859,1155.459,"Yes, but these damages are not going to affect that in this... in a given case."
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1179.585,1185.049,"I don't think so, although I do think that deterrence is certainly one of the goals that Congress had in mind."
1995.95-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1208.173,1212.738,"What would speak to it would be an injunction against the plant closing, and that is specifically what Congress withheld."
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1212.738,1225.127,"Well, but it... that would be one remedy that would speak to that harm, but under Article III the requirement is simply that the remedy sought be likely to redress the injury, not that it necessarily be the best remedy to redress that."
1995.95-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1225.127,1260.019,"No, but the injury, as I understand it, is the injury to the union in depriving it of a capacity either to negotiate about the actual decision to close, or to retain those who are going to be put out of work, and the only... I should think the only remedy that is going to redress or vindicate the union's interest in failing to receive the notice would be a remedy that gives them the statutory amount of time to do that, and that remedy would be an injunction against closing the plant short of 60 days for the union to do whatever it wants to do."
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1288.206,1291.739,"I... Justice Souter, I don't think that's the only way to tie this right to the remedy that's imposed."
1995.95-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1314.174,1319.557,"But they don't... as a practical matter, they don't get the money during the time in which they would want to be doing this, do they?"
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1319.557,1322.349,"Well, no, Your Honor, but I think for many employees--"
1995.95-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1322.349,1326.002,You're talking... you're making a very practical argument.
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1343.334,1344.764,"--Well, I don't think so, Your Honor."
1995.95-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1365.317,1369.53,"So you're saying it may take a long time to get the money, but it's going to take a long time to retrain and get another job."
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1369.53,1370.422,"--I think that's right, Your Honor."
1995.95-340,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1370.422,1371.751,So that they ultimately can match.
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1371.751,1372.643,I think that's right.
1995.95-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1372.643,1388.254,"Isn't the consequence of that argument that any organization which has the interest of others at heart can be given standing to sue for injuries to those others, because, after all, that's the organization's function?"
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1388.254,1389.022,I don't--
1995.95-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1389.022,1404.412,"So I suppose the American Civil Liberties Union could be given standing to sue for any deprivation of civil liberties to anyone in the country, because their whole ratiocination is to serve those people and prevent those injuries."
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1404.412,1406.375,"--I don't think so, Justice Scalia, for two reasons."
1995.95-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1406.375,1407.104,"Well, why is this different?"
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1407.104,1412.607,The first reason is that unions are unique in that they have a right to notice under the statute.
1995.95-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1419.092,1425.807,"Well, yes, but that's just to say that Congress has created it here, and I'm saying Congress could also create it for the ACLU."
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1425.807,1426.997,"Well, that's correct."
1995.95-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.229,1429.14,So what's your other argument?
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1430.52,1437.875,--There would still be a requirement under Article III that there be a tangible effect on the plaintiff through the union of the layoff.
1995.95-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1445.279,1451.033,"Well, the tangible effect here was that it was unable to provide the kind of assistance to the people served that it wanted to, right?"
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1451.033,1464.213,"That's correct, but this Court has frequently recognized that that type of impairment of an organization's ability to carry out its functions not simply a disagreement or an ideological conflict with action taken is sufficient to provide an injury in fact for Article III purposes."
1995.95-340,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1464.213,1472.127,"Yes, but the remedy given is not the remedy of providing the people what the people are entitled to."
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1474.35,1476.62,"Well, that's correct, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-340,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1476.62,1485.126,"Mr. Jenkins, is it relevant to this inquiry that the union is not stepping forward as a union?"
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1490.549,1494.302,"Well, I don't think that's entirely so, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.95-340,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1497.605,1505.559,"I thought that the workers get the notice, personally, when the union is not representing the plan."
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1505.559,1505.97,That's correct.
1995.95-340,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1505.97,1512.315,"But when the union is, that only the union is entitled to notice under the statute and the workers aren't."
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1512.315,1513.303,That's correct.
1995.95-340,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1513.303,1524.68,But does that distinguish the situation of the union that has this preexisting representational obligation from an organization that is merely a do good agency?
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1524.68,1530.647,"We think certainly so, and that was my point in saying that there's a right to notice here, and as you pointed out, it's an exclusive right to notice."
1995.95-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1538.661,1542.353,What about a plant where there is no union representing the employees?
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1544.075,1546.807,"The notice goes directly to the employees under that circumstance, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1546.807,1553.071,It would seem odd that if notice were also required to the employees that you would have a weaker case.
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1553.071,1555.371,I'm not sure that I follow--
1995.95-340,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1555.371,1566.519,"Well, you said one of the reasons the union has standing here is because the union is the only one to get notice, and I observed it would be a rather odd statutory scheme if the notice also went to the employees that you would then have a weaker representational argument."
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1566.519,1568.762,"--Well, perhaps it would be weaker in that narrow respect."
1995.95-340,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1595.029,1599.721,"Mr. Jenkins, does this statute provide for fees to the plaintiffs?"
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1601.534,1601.874,May I answer?
1995.95-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1601.874,1602.904,"Yes, go ahead."
1995.95-340,1,16292,alan_jenkins,,1602.904,1607.227,There is a fee shifting provision and I believe it's discretionary with the district court.
1995.95-340,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1608.667,1610.079,"Thank you, Mr. Jenkins."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1611.93,1615.703,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1671.889,1681.787,"What's the relationship between that requirement and our associational standing cases, because in the associational standing cases, the association doesn't necessarily get any relief."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1695.477,1695.738,No.
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1725.577,1731.652,"Right, but none of those requirements say that there has got to be a redress flowing directly to the association."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1736.935,1744.919,"--Well, the law has been universal that an association cannot sue for damages to its members."
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1744.919,1748.201,"Well, I don't think there is a case in which they have done so."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1748.201,1748.512,Correct.
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1748.512,1759.298,"But in the cases in which there has been equitable relief, the benefit of the equitable relief has always been for the members of the association, hasn't it?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1759.298,1761.131,"Well, it's been for both, I think, Justice Souter."
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1781.223,1790.78,"But the organization without that attribution does not, in fact, have an interest which would be vindicated if it alone sued."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1806.46,1812.685,"--Well, in that case actually they did have an interest because they claimed that they were losing... they would lose dues if the--"
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1812.685,1813.516,"Oh, they were reaching in--"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1813.516,1815.336,--said statute were not overturned.
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1824.152,1825.164,"--Well, they never have."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1825.832,1826.453,--That's correct.
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1826.453,1830.207,"--haven't held that they couldn't, and that's what you want us to do here, I realize, but we never have."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1840.184,1840.483,Yes.
1995.95-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1841.935,1853.021,"Well, if you attribute their members injuries to the association, why not attribute their members compensation for the injuries to the association?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1854.733,1855.224,I don't think so.
1995.95-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.577,1883.663,"The wrong can be a very individualized wrong that the injunction is addressed against, for example, not paying a certain level of wages, which the association claims each individual employee is entitled to."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1887.126,1897.472,"--Well, if that were the case, that each union or association member were entitled to a different form of relief, then I think you would have the same kind of problem with that as you would with a damage case."
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1897.472,1902.916,--But it is the case that the union and the association members are not suffering the same harm.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1902.916,1904.748,It depends on--
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1904.748,1909.421,"In the example you gave, the applegrowers' case, the association is saying, we're losing members."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1944.303,1950.216,"--Well, as the Court said in Warth and in Brock again, the ability--"
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1950.216,1959.552,"Let me... well, I want to be sure, but just on the terms that I just gave you, doesn't it follow that you can't make the argument that they are all in the same boat?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1959.552,1961.124,--That's probably true.
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1961.124,1961.854,Okay.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,1961.854,1977.785,"But where they are close enough to being in the same boat that the relief sought will remedy the communal wrong, that's the rationale for allowing associational injunctive cases and for disallowing damage cases, and--"
1995.95-340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1977.785,1982.628,Why doesn't it help the union to give the employees their money?
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2043.298,2047.219,"--The problem is, Justice Breyer, that there's no evidence anywhere that Congress made such a--"
1995.95-340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2047.219,2048.31,"Well, what about the statute?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2048.31,2051.681,--The statute is silent on the purpose of the notice.
1995.95-340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.681,2072.806,"The statute says that a union can come in, sue when it doesn't get notice, and collect liquidated damages in an amount equal to the number of days times the average wage, which presumably it pays to the workers, so the workers then think, well... I don't know, does it pay it to the workers or not?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2079.281,2088.428,There is nothing either in the legislative history or in the statute itself which suggests that that is the so called injury that's being redressed.
1995.95-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2088.428,2088.768,"Oh, well then--"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2090.728,2091.5,The money would go to the individuals.
1995.95-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2091.5,2092.688,--It goes directly to workers.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2092.688,2093.04,Right.
1995.95-340,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2093.04,2096.132,"Well, but how does that follow from the statute?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2104.309,2109.052,"Well, they have filed here on behalf of... that's the language of the complaint, on behalf of the individuals."
1995.95-340,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2117.256,2125.31,In that respect it would be no different than if one employee had stepped forward and sued on behalf of the 276 similarly situated.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2125.31,2129.954,"The statute does contemplate class actions, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.95-340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2129.954,2130.355,But--
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2130.355,2135.478,But I don't think that could apply to the damage part of the case for the same reasons that we've discussed--
1995.95-340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2135.478,2150.237,"--The question I was trying to ask is, why isn't the remedy aimed at redressing a real harm to the union, namely, its inability to help its workers by arranging for some interim relief for the workers?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2182.708,2189.703,"--Well, because first of all, with all due respect, Justice Breyer, there's nothing in the statute that suggests that that's the injury that's being redressed."
1995.95-340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2192.595,2196.539,The injury that is being redressed is the failure to get notice.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2196.539,2198.339,--The lack of notice to the union.
1995.95-340,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2248.422,2250.565,"Mr. Walsh, may I ask you a question that's concerning me?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2275.73,2276.872,"--No, I do not."
1995.95-340,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2276.872,2278.682,What's the difference between a contract and a statute?
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2278.682,2281.794,Because the union there is a party to the contract.
1995.95-340,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2283.106,2284.726,"Well, here it has a statutory right, there it has a contractual right."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2287.408,2291.692,--The injury to the union is that it is a party to a contract that has been breached.
1995.95-340,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.692,2295.044,"Well, but it has a statutory right that's been breached here."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2295.693,2296.914,"Well, before with that--"
1995.95-340,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2296.914,2299.236,Why is a contract right entitled to greater protection than a statutory right?
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2299.236,2306.361,"--Because the union is not designated as the litigating agent of claims, statutory claims for its members."
1995.95-340,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2313.866,2316.529,But under this statute it's the litigating agent for the same people.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2322.681,2326.975,--Because as the party to the contract that has been breached it has an injury.
1995.95-340,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.324,2330.317,Is it different from the statutory injury in this case?
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2330.317,2332.959,--We contend there is no statutory injury in fact.
1995.95-340,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2332.959,2336.572,You've admitted there's a statutory violation of a duty to the union.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2336.572,2341.184,"But that creates a procedural injury, in our view, to the--"
1995.95-340,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.184,2343.966,"Then why isn't the contractual thing a procedural injury, then?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2343.966,2349.72,--Because it's a breach of a substantive right under the contract to notice in your hypothetical.
1995.95-340,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2349.72,2350.761,I... isn't your--
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2365.721,2387.223,"Well, Congress certainly can create rights the violation of which will justify Article III standing, but it has to be a real right, it has to be a substantive right, and the violation of it has to create an injury in fact, and merely saying that you have to give somebody notice does not, in our opinion, create anything more than a procedural right where it's not--"
1995.95-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.223,2402.674,"Surely it cannot be true that any right which could be acquired by contract, any right to sue which could be acquired by contract can, since it can be acquired by contract, be conferred by Congress without violating the separation of powers."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2417.283,2420.115,--I'd say you couldn't enforce that contract--
1995.95-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2420.115,2421.717,"It's the end of the doctrine of standing, I would assume."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2421.717,2422.418,--I would think so.
1995.95-340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2422.418,2425.4,Then you couldn't enforce that contract in a diversity case.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2425.4,2431.124,I don't know.
1995.95-340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2431.124,2437.917,"Right, I've a different question, which is... the question that I'd have would be, what about the associational standing?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2475.931,2489.681,"Because each of the individualized determinations of damages for these employees depends on a number of variables, including his wage rate, his piece rate, how many days he was entitled to notice but he didn't get it, what his benefits were--"
1995.95-340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2489.681,2491.453,But the same would be true in a contract action.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2502.661,2511.546,"--But if I am the party to the contract, then I have a substantive right to enforce that contract and collect damages for those who are properly aligned with me."
1995.95-340,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2514.568,2533.97,"No, no, no, but I mean, my point is, why does it require the employee to come into court or to be a participant in the case, any more than in a breach of contract action where the measure of damages is wages paid to individual employees, any more than that kind of case requires an employee to come into court?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2539.646,2554.753,"--Well, that is the Hunt test, and the Hunt test is, the third prong is based upon the fact that in that situation, in the absence of a contract or other substantive right, the association as such does not have an injury."
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2569.954,2571.906,"Well, we've called it that repeatedly, haven't we?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2571.906,2572.866,"--Well, I--"
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2572.866,2575.27,And don't we... let me ask you a related question.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2579.441,2581.333,"--No, Justice Souter, I don't think so."
1995.95-340,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2589.619,2601.506,"Before we get into the question of characterization, do I understand that nothing more would be required than payroll records to determine the compensation due here?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2606.09,2622.59,"Some of these piece rates, I'm told, Justice Ginsburg, vary from day to day, from hour to hour, even, so it takes an incredible amount of calculation and actually interviews probably with the individual employees to determine what they're entitled to from hour to hour and day to day, so it is a very highly--"
1995.95-340,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2622.59,2631.286,"I can understand that it might be a complex formula, but I don't understand why the testimony... if you have time records, why the testimony of the employee would be necessary."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2631.286,2634.538,"--Oh, I think it's the participation of the employee that's the key."
1995.95-340,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2641.704,2651.461,"I thought you agreed with me before that you could have one class representative, only one named representative suing on behalf of all similarly situated, and that would do it."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2651.461,2661.466,"--I said for liability purposes only, but when you get to damages, then the individual determinations under Rule 23, in our opinion, would outweigh the class deter--"
1995.95-340,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2661.466,2664.868,"Well then, for liability purposes, why shouldn't we say the same thing about the union?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2664.868,2669.732,--Because the only remedy that's permitted under this act is this back pay remedy.
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2675.276,2691.366,"Okay, now, third Hunt prong, I thought we had characterized that, number 1, as being merely prudential, and number 2, if we don't so characterize it, are we going to be in conflict, in effect, with class action cases?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2691.366,2692.598,"No, sir."
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2704.863,2706.155,And hasn't it been called prudential?
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2706.155,2706.616,--No.
1995.95-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2742.34,2744.449,Warth came from a prudential error.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2759.783,2759.974,Yes.
1995.95-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2760.992,2772.89,"And that's been effectively overruled by later cases, which say its purpose is not to assure concrete adversariness alone, but rather that it has a constitutional component, which is what Warth explicitly denied, that it had any constitutional component."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2772.89,2773.551,"--Well, this--"
1995.95-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2773.551,2779.024,"So if you're trying to make your case from Warth, you're going to be in a lot of trouble because Warth says the whole thing is prudential."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2779.024,2781.755,"--Well, I don't read it--"
1995.95-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2781.755,2785.949,"So long as there's concrete adversariness, which there surely is here."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2785.949,2801.861,"--But this analysis was reiterated in Brock, and what it means is... this prudential requirement that the Government is relying on means that I can't try to prop up my claim by asserting the constitutional rights of third parties."
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2819.292,2833.131,"No, but the third prong... I think we're talking about the same third prong, which is that it does not require the appearance of individual third parties to prove their damage... supply the evidence for the specific damages that they have suffered, isn't that right?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2833.131,2833.762,It does--
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2833.762,2834.182,Isn't that what we're talking about?
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2834.182,2834.731,--Yes.
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2838.454,2838.654,Okay.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2855.517,2855.907,Yes.
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2855.907,2856.086,Okay.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2861.537,2865.07,"Because in a class action, the plaintiff is a member of the class."
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2869.134,2870.554,"Yes, but that's not the requirement we're talking about."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2895.252,2898.755,"--Because in the class action, the plaintiff has his own injury."
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2902.127,2913.375,"Well, he has his own injury, but before the class action is over, the injuries of other people have got to be shown, and those other people are in the same boat, aren't they, as the association members?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2913.375,2923.642,"--Well... and in a lot of those cases, where the individual circumstances, damages if you will, are diverse, courts routinely deny class action treatment."
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2923.642,2925.402,For Article III purposes?
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2925.402,2926.454,"No, for--"
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2926.454,2927.425,"No, and--"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2927.425,2929.055,--For manageability purposes.
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2929.055,2930.417,"--Yes, but not Article III."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2939.313,2949.319,"Well, there is a question, I think, about whether there's germaneness, but we haven't briefed that, but we do think... the third... the Eighth Circuit decided that the third prong of Hunt had not been met, and clearly it hasn't."
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2963.159,2965.25,"With respect, I'm missing that point."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2973.144,2975.756,"--It's not a rule of evidence, Justice Souter."
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2976.357,2977.588,I don't know what it is.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2987.964,2989.766,--I don't think I--
1995.95-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2989.766,2990.745,You seem to have accepted that.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2990.745,2991.516,--I don't think I did.
1995.95-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2991.516,2998.811,"I mean, I thought in these associational cases the association cannot demonstrate any injury to itself, and it is relying entirely upon the injury to its members."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,2998.811,3001.112,I don't think class actions are associational.
1995.95-340,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3003.304,3006.306,So what we do with class actions has nothing to do with the third prong.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3006.306,3007.507,--That's my view.
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3007.507,3029.231,"Yes, but it has everything to do with what Article III requires, which applies to class actions as well as associational standing cases, and if the same objection could be raised in the class action case that could be raised in the associational standing case, and it is not effective in the class action case, then it seems to me it has to follow that it's not an Article Third requirement in the associational standing case, isn't that correct?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3029.231,3034.576,Class actions are not associational actions.
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3036.086,3047.553,"I know, but they're both... class actions in associational action cases are, standing cases, are subject to the same bedrock Article III standing requirement."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3047.553,3048.795,"--But the first question is, does the plaintiff--"
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3048.795,3052.886,"And if it doesn't apply in one, then it can't be an Article III requirement for the other."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3057.801,3059.942,"--Well, I'm sorry, but I'm doing my best."
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3060.773,3063.194,"If I'd just be quiet and let you answer, I--"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3064.124,3071.059,"--The... in the class action context, the plaintiff is a member of the class who's been injured."
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3086.568,3096.346,"Okay, and there's no problem in the fact that there has to be extraneous proof of the various damages for the various class members once he's in, right?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3096.346,3098.477,"--Well, there may be--"
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3098.477,3102.1,"You know, it may make him nasty, and we may not certify the class for just that purpose."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3102.1,3102.558,--Right.
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3102.558,3105.092,But at least there's no constitutional problem.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3105.092,3105.64,But--
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3105.64,3106.602,Right?
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3108.074,3109.483,--Well--
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3109.483,3111.534,"No Article III problem, standing problem."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3111.534,3113.157,--I don't really know.
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3113.157,3120.392,"Well, we've never... I don't... and I will stand corrected if I'm wrong, but I don't think we've ever given... our Court has ever given that as the reason."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3123.281,3125.495,Generally that's correct--
1995.95-340,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3125.495,3126.143,Yes.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3126.143,3136.592,"--I would agree, but I think it could create a problem if one plaintiff would try to recover for mass tort victims, for instance, without joining those people in."
1995.95-340,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3136.592,3147.509,"But concentrating on this case, if the union had joined one member, then you would see no problem and everything could go forward without Article III impediment?"
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3147.509,3159.486,"If the union had joined one member, and that member had asserted a class action on behalf of himself, and he would be injured, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated--"
1995.95-340,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3159.486,3160.397,That would be okay.
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3160.397,3164.738,--Then possibly that would be an appropriate determination of liability only.
1995.95-340,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3164.738,3184.663,"Well, if that is so... there would be no Article III impediment, I think you're agreeing... then in view of the debate that has been going on here and among other courts, at the very least, shouldn't the union be allowed to amend its complaint to join a member, and then everything else follows."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3184.663,3199.413,"The union refused, despite repeated admonitions in the lower court, to ask for leave to amend until after this case was decided by the district court then, for the first time, they asked for leave to amend, came in and said we'd like to join the class members."
1995.95-340,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3218.545,3219.786,"Well, it's not before the Court."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3219.786,3221.136,That's correct.
1995.95-340,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3226.69,3235.516,"But it's not before this Court because it wasn't raised in the petition for certiorari, so we would ordinarily take no action with respect to any such assertion."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3235.516,3236.447,"--That's correct, yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-340,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3301.109,3302.441,"Thank you, Mr. Walsh."
1995.95-340,2,43475,thomas_c_walsh,,3302.441,3302.772,--Thank you.
1995.95-340,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3302.772,3303.5,Your time has expired.
1995.95-340,3,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3305.422,3307.543,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.95-340,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3393.53,3394.191,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
