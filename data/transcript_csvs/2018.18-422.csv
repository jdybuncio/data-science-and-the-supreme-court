2018.18-422,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.8,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-422, Rucho versus Common Cause. Mr. Clement."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,6.8,17.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has repeatedly failed to identify a justiciable standard for partisan gerrymandering claims."
2018.18-422,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,54.24,54.76,Mr. Clement --
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,54.76,56.76,-- the federal Congress supervisory authority.
2018.18-422,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,56.76,62.08,"Mr. Clement, that ship has sailed in Baker v. Carr."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,99.68,130.0,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, I suppose the question of whether that ship sailed in Baker v. Carr is one way of presenting the question before the Court today. And I would submit that you don't have a one-size-fits-all solution for justiciability, and I don't think Baker v. Carr supports that proposition. Indeed, I took the central lesson of Baker v. Carr to be that the same claim, essentially, when presented as an equal protection claim, was justiciable when the same claim presented as a Republican Guarantee Clause claim was not justiciable."
2018.18-422,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,130.0,130.6,"But, Mister --"
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,130.6,131.16,And I took --
2018.18-422,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,131.16,156.52,"-- Mr. Clement, does one person have one vote that counts equally, which I take it to be the -- the message of those cases, now well accepted, does one person have one vote that counts equally with others if the impact of her vote is reduced based on her party affiliation?"
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,156.52,159.24,"The answer to that question, Justice Ginsburg, is yes."
2018.18-422,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,229.8,235.04,"Mr. Clement, would your position require us to overrule Davis versus Bandemer?"
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,235.04,239.4,"I -- I think, Mr. Chief Justice, it would decide -- it would depend on which way you decided the case."
2018.18-422,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,241.2,244.4,"Well, if we decided it in your favor, would it require us to overrule? (Laughter.)"
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,244.4,255.84,"And it would still depend, Your Honor, on whether you decide it in our favor on standing grounds or on justiciability grounds. If you decided it in our favor on justiciability grounds, I think you would have to overrule the Bandemer case."
2018.18-422,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,298.44,341.36,"Mr. Clement, if I understand the bottom line of your argument, you would answer the question that one of my -- I don't want to call him a former colleague, he's still a colleague but no longer on the -- on the bench with us, Justice Kennedy asked in one of these cases, and it was if a state constitution had a provision that required redistricting to be based solely on partisan grounds -- forget about whether they -- they were meeting any other traditional grounds or not -- you would say that was constitutional?"
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,341.36,367.96,"Well, actually, Justice Sotomayor, I -- I think I might say to the particular hypo -- and I think it matters how you frame it, I mean, I do think that if you took a state constitutional provision and tried to have it impose some requirement that's going to apply to every redistricting going forward, there's at least an argument that there's actually an Election Clause problem with that effort to try to control sort of subsequent redistricting efforts. Now you may or may not accept that argument, but --"
2018.18-422,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,367.96,385.6,"You're saying -- you're basically saying yes, that would mean, as occurred here, that almost 50 percent of one party's vote is going to result in maybe less than one-third of their representation in Congress?"
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,385.6,387.88,"That's exactly right, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.18-422,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,396.04,413.44,"No, that -- that -- no, because all of the tests that they're proposing and that the district court looked at didn't talk about proportionate representation. It looked at only the opportunity to elect. An opportunity is different."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,437.36,467.48,"Well, I think that that difference -- first of all, I think that difference is implicit in the idea of having districts rather than statewide elections for the Congress. And keep in mind that the Constitution as originally enacted, there's now a statute that changes this, but as -- for constitutional purposes, it is perfectly constitutional for a state to embrace the policy idea that proportional representation is a good thing and implement it by saying we're going to elect Congress not by districts but by statewide votes."
2018.18-422,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,467.8,467.96,"Well, Mister --"
2018.18-422,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,467.96,469.0,"Mr. Clement, can I -- can I take --"
2018.18-422,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,469.0,470.4,"-- Mr. Clement -- no, please."
2018.18-422,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,470.4,476.08,-- can I take you back to Justice -- the Justice Kennedy question that Justice Sotomayor talked about.
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,480.16,480.44,Sure.
2018.18-422,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,480.44,518.44,"Because it -- it -- it seems to me that this is kind of Justice Kennedy's hypothetical come to life in -- in this sense, that there is a particular provision in the legislation here that says the partisan makeup of the congressional delegation is 10 Republicans and three Democrats, and the committee shall make reasonable efforts to construct districts to maintain that current partisan makeup, 10 and three. So it was specifically written into the law that whatever else you do, and there were definitely other things that the lawmakers wanted done, but whatever else you do, go come back with the same 10 and three."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,527.92,530.52,"So, Justice Kagan, two responses."
2018.18-422,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,546.32,547.92,This seems pretty enshrined.
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,548.16,548.4,Well --
2018.18-422,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,548.4,550.16,-- 10 and three. That's the current.
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,551.8,599.6,"But, no, I think there's a difference, and -- but I'm happy to respond to your -- your question about can you have it as an express criterion for a particular districting. And I think the answer -- sort of obviously given who I'm representing -- is absolutely yes, that's not a problem, and, by the way, I think actually being candid about it probably serves accountability principles in the long run, which is to say if you think -- which I think almost everybody does -- that implicitly that's what the Republican legislature was doing in Bandemer, in fact, they were explicit in their deposition testimony, if you look at Footnote 5 of Justice White's opinion, that the people who drew that map, the speaker of the Republican House of Indiana was express that his goal was to preserve as many Republican incumbents as possible."
2018.18-422,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,599.6,600.32,Could I take you back to --
2018.18-422,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,600.32,601.36,"Yes, but --"
2018.18-422,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,601.36,608.48,"-- to the way Justice Kennedy formulated the question, which hypothesized a provision of the state constitution."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,629.36,650.92,"They -- they don't, Justice Alito, and that's why I do think it is important to figure out -- I mean, I think Justice Kennedy may have framed that question in a particular way. I mean, I -- I don't want to go too far down the road of relitigating the Arizona independent redistricting case here, but, you know, I do think there is a certainly respectable argument that state legislature means state legislature and not the other parts of the state government."
2018.18-422,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,652.84,654.32,It can mean the people --
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,654.32,654.68,It -- it -- it --
2018.18-422,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,654.68,656.16,-- when it's done by referendum.
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,656.16,657.88,"-- it well could, Justice Ginsburg."
2018.18-422,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,664.36,664.56,Well --
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,664.56,669.72,-- think the result in that case -- I think that case can be taken as a given --
2018.18-422,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,669.72,670.04,-- along --
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,670.04,705.68,"-- and you can still say that the claims here are not justiciable. And to be as responsive as I can to Justice Kagan's question, I don't think there is a constitutional problem when a state legislature makes explicit with respect to the redistricting they're undertaking at that moment if they make explicit what was ultimately explicit after the record was built up in Bandemer and Vieth, which is it just didn't happen that they got a map that was favorable to Republicans, that they actually intended to do that, along with traditional redistricting principles. And I think, Justice Kagan, the way you read the criteria is exactly right."
2018.18-422,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,726.04,772.04,"Mr. Clement, along those lines, in terms of Democratic accountability on this, one of the arguments that we've heard is that the Court must act because nobody else can as a practical matter. But -- but given Arizona, and that is the holding of the Court, is that true? And to what extent have states, through their initiatives, citizen initiatives, or at the ballot box in elections through their legislatures, amended their constitutions or otherwise provided for remedies in this area? I -- I -- I just happen to know my home state of Colorado this last November had such a referendum on the ballot that passed overwhelmingly, as I recall."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,782.68,784.0,That's right.
2018.18-422,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,796.08,799.52,But how many -- my sense is there's a lot of movement in this area.
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,805.56,809.08,That's exactly right. Michigan is another state that passed a ballot initiative.
2018.18-422,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,842.28,848.16,"Well, I suppose the -- I suppose the members of Congress are pretty happy with the way the districting has been done. (Laughter.)"
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,848.16,883.0,"Well, you -- you might think, Mr. Chief Justice, but, actually, I don't think the majority of them are, because that was a bill that I think passed on party line votes. And so, I mean, to the extent that -- that people, other justices of this Court in the past have been concerned about things like entrenchment and the like, I mean, it's a little odd here that we've had all of this supposedly partisan redistricting to benefit the composition of Congress, and yet a majority of Congress thinks that they should pass HR-1. So I just don't know that there really is that much of a problem."
2018.18-422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,913.92,918.76,"Imagine I -- you may not want to answer this question, which I'd understand."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1078.76,1085.08,"Well, Justice Breyer, in -- in all candor, there's so much in that that I disagree with that it's a little hard to know where to start. (Laughter.)"
2018.18-422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1085.08,1085.76,"All right, all right."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1085.76,1091.52,"I'm going to resist at first the temptation to take issue with the premises, though if I have time I'll get back to that."
2018.18-422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1117.64,1118.4,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait --"
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1118.4,1119.16,-- which is have a legislature --
2018.18-422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1119.16,1120.2,-- wait one second there.
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1128.84,1133.2,"Well, I thought I heard you say that if you were a state that used a bipartisan commission, dot, dot, dot --"
2018.18-422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1133.2,1134.04,"Oh, yes, that's right."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1134.8,1135.92,-- you would get a pass.
2018.18-422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1135.92,1136.4,"Yeah, yeah, you're right."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1136.4,1150.12,And that seems to me itself to be remarkably revealing because you're basically saying that it would be a good thing for the state if they chose to use a mechanism other than the one that the framers picked. So that's my big objection to the intent prong.
2018.18-422,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1150.12,1157.24,"Not if you -- not if you say that for this purpose, the legislature is the people."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1160.24,1187.48,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, in fairness, I think what Arizona held is that the people are within that concept, but I certainly don't think Arizona stands for the proposition that what the framers had in mind primarily was something other than the state legislatures. So it seems to me it's a strike against your test that it identifies as a problem something that the framers would have associated with the primary mechanism they used for redistricting."
2018.18-422,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1188.68,1191.4,If I -- if I can just interrupt for one second.
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1191.4,1191.56,Sure.
2018.18-422,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1191.56,1230.36,"I mean, going down that road would suggest that Justice Gorsuch's attempt to sort of say this is not so bad because the people can fix it is not so true because you're suggesting that the people really maybe can't fix it, you were wrong about the people being able to fix it, and if the people could fix it, while it's not the constitutionally prescribed way because it's never been done before, so Justice Gorsuch's attempts to save what's so dramatically wrong here, which is the Court leaving this all to professional politicians who have an interest in districting according to their own partisan interests, seems to fail."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1230.36,1233.04,"Well, I -- I would disagree, Justice Kagan."
2018.18-422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1246.32,1246.92,Yeah.
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1246.92,1252.68,"-- the federal government, through its justices and judges, are going to intervene and put limits on what the state does."
2018.18-422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1252.68,1276.24,"All right, I've got this point, but what I'm trying to get you to focus on -- because I've read the briefs, you know, I -- this is the fourth time, and I -- and I -- I think I -- but the thing that I want you to focus on, if you can, if you want to, is the two-thirds majority idea. Look, my party got a majority of the votes in the state, but we ended up with less than a third of the seats."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1297.2,1326.12,"Well, I -- I think the way I would respond to that, Justice Breyer, is I am not here to tell you that if the Constitution included a one standard deviation from proportional representation clause or a one-third/two-thirds clause, that judges somehow would be incapable of administering that clause. So I think the fundamental problem is there is no one standard deviation from proportional representation clause in the Constitution."
2018.18-422,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1345.08,1345.96,"Well, Mr. Clement --"
2018.18-422,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1345.96,1346.28,Actually --
2018.18-422,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1346.28,1363.48,"-- you keep saying that, but I -- I -- I don't quite think that that's right given the statistical analysis in this case. I mean, you're quite right that this Court in the past has said this country does not run on proportional representation and this is a hang-up in our ability to solve this problem."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1456.76,1458.92,"So, Justice Kagan, two points."
2018.18-422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1465.92,1466.64,"No, I don't think it does --"
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1466.64,1466.92,"Well, okay."
2018.18-422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1467.08,1470.6,-- for this reason. The reason is all it says is a part --
2018.18-422,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1470.6,1472.64,"Well, yeah, I -- I -- wait."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1475.68,1476.72,Okay.
2018.18-422,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1477.08,1478.32,-- I want you to ask mine -- answer mine.
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1478.32,1491.2,"-- I hear one-third/ two-third, and I -- I sure thought we were talking about proportional representation. As to the maps, you know what I found striking about the maps -- and I think this is different from what you found striking about the maps -- but, first of all, you can do this 24,000 different ways."
2018.18-422,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1506.2,1508.24,"Well, that's making lemonade out of lemons."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1508.24,1509.56,"Well, let me -- let me try to make -- can I make -- (Laughter.)"
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1509.56,1510.72,-- can -- can I make one point more?
2018.18-422,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1510.72,1519.64,"You can do it 24,000 different ways and 23,999 produce an outcome that's less partisan than the one the legislature picked here."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1519.64,1549.76,"But, see, what I think is remarkable is actually that what the statistics show -- and this is on page 162 of the -- of the -- of the JSA -- is that if you run 24,000 maps with partisanship taken out entirely and you just use traditional juris- -- traditional principles, you get 162 different maps that produce a 10/three Republican split. So, yeah, it's one percent, it's .7 percent -- I mean .7 percent, just to be clear."
2018.18-422,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1556.16,1590.2,"But, if you have 24,000 maps that satisfy all of the so-called neutral criteria that you put in your computer program, don't you need a criterion or criteria for deciding which of the 24,000 maps you're going to choose? And implicit in Justice Kagan's comments is the idea, is it not, that you have to choose one that honors proportional representation? You have no other criteria for distinguishing among the 24,000 maps."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1590.2,1591.32,I -- I think that's right.
2018.18-422,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1593.56,1594.64,"Why, Mr. Clement?"
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1594.64,1596.24,"-- because they're over here, are off limits."
2018.18-422,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1596.24,1597.2,"Yeah, finish your answer."
2018.18-422,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1597.2,1599.32,"Mr. Clement, let's go back to the why of that."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1698.64,1701.8,"So, Justice Sotomayor, I would have three points, if I could get them out."
2018.18-422,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1737.88,1746.44,"Yes, that's true, but, look, party A gets over and over and over 55 percent of the votes."
2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1776.52,1817.6,"So, Justice Breyer, let me say why I don't think that's such a horrible problem and let me try to put what's on the other side of the ledger. So why I don't think that's a horrible problem is even if it's as you described, what's going to happen in almost every state in the union, if that happens, is the 55 percent majority will elect to statewide office governors, attorneys general, and the like, and the next time around they're not going to be able to pass a map, and the next time around it'll probably end up in gridlock and a judicial line drawing. And I don't think that's the happiest result in the world, but it means that you're not going to be able to perpetuate this in the long run. Now here is what's on the other side of the ledger and then I'll try to sit down and reserve my time."
2018.18-422,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1817.6,1817.76,May I --

2018.18-422,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1919.0,1926.68,"But, Justice Ginsburg, sometimes an argument that's not a great argument in one context turns out to be pretty darn good in another context."

The North Carolina legislature's defense is equally extreme."
2018.18-422,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2042.52,2043.36,When you use the word --
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2043.36,2044.96,-- on partisan gerrymander.
2018.18-422,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2044.96,2051.08,"-- when you use the word ""extreme,"" that implies a baseline. Extreme compared to what?"
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2051.08,2068.36,"In this case, it is extreme in comparison to any statistical application of neutral redistricting principles in the context of the political geography of North Carolina. It was statistically impossible to come up with an 11/two plan."

2018.18-422,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2148.24,2154.08,"Well, I guess it just rephrases the question of what constitutes a material factor."
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2154.08,2162.4,"Well, the difference between material and being immaterial, having no consequence, is a very real difference."
2018.18-422,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2162.4,2170.92,"So -- so just so I understand, any partisanship that has a consequence is impermissible under your view?"

2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2192.4,2198.0,"It is a material part of the decision, as in, for example, firing in Mount Healthy."

If you -- if you make a list of the so-called neutral criteria -- compactness, contiguity, protecting incumbents, if that's really neutral, respecting certain natural features of the geography -- and you have a computer program that includes all of those and weights them all, and let's assume all that is neutral, and at the end, what you get is a large number of maps that satisfy all those criteria. And I think that's realistic."
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2297.36,2302.24,The choice would be the standards that the Court has traditionally applied.

2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2352.32,2364.64,"The legislature has wide discretion, as long as it does not attempt to do two things: dictate electoral outcomes, favor or disfavor a class of candidates."
2018.18-422,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2365.6,2402.6,"But, counsel, that -- that first one, dictate electoral outcomes, I think is going to turn -- turn on -- on numbers, right? How much deviation from proportional representation is enough to dictate an outcome? So aren't we just back in the business of deciding what degree of tolerance we're willing to put up with from proportional representation? We might pluck a number out of the air or see that, you know, maybe two-thirds is used for veto overrides, so we like that. Where -- where are we going to get the number on the business end of this?"
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2402.6,2407.12,The business end of it is looking at how this is done.
2018.18-422,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2430.68,2432.16,"Well, let me try one more time."
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2454.24,2468.24,"The -- the -- clearly, it's an evidentiary matter in terms of intent. If the predominant intent is to favor one party, to penalize another based on their voting history, that goes too far, but --"

2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2474.48,2478.24,It certainly is going to be a question of factual proof.
2018.18-422,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2486.12,2492.52,"Well, there we go. I think that's the answer to the question, right? Is that we're going to -- that your -- you would like us to mandate proportional representation."
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2492.52,2493.08,Not at all.
2018.18-422,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2502.32,2509.04,"And the further you deviate from proportional representation, the more likely you are to be found guilty of that."
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2509.04,2512.2,It is purely an evidentiary question.
2018.18-422,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2524.56,2525.08,Okay.
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2526.52,2527.4,-- that you have partisan gerrymandering.
2018.18-422,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2527.4,2540.72,"-- we're going to have to, as part of our mandatory jurisdiction, in every single redistricting case, look at the evidence to see why there was a deviation from the norm of proportional representation. That's -- that's -- that's the ask?"
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2540.72,2552.48,"You're going to have to look at the case and determine whether or not the plaintiffs proved intentional, predominant, partisan intent to discriminate based on --"
2018.18-422,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2552.48,2559.72,I would think that would always be present so long as you're deviating from proportional representation. What good reason could there be but partisanship at the end of the day?
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2559.72,2560.36,Not at all.

Why should we wade into this --"

2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2608.2,2619.88,"-- the simple answer, Justice Gorsuch, is this: The vast majority of states east of the Mississippi, including specifically North Carolina, do not have citizen initiative."
2018.18-422,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2619.88,2624.12,Can you amend your constitutions? That -- that has happened in a lot of states too.

2018.18-422,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2653.92,2687.08,"Mr. Bondurant, what do you do with the fact that partisan identification is not the only basis on which people vote? Do you see electoral results change dramatically depending, for example, on the particular appeal of individual candidates, turning on who's at the -- the head of the ticket rather than down ticket? And how do you deal with that -- those factors that depart from the arguments about the inevitability of electoral results based on partisan identification?"
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2687.08,2731.28,"Your Honor, the social science and the experts in this field, which included Dr. Hofeller, who designed this plan, was the Republican Party's leading redistricting expert -- he testified that based on social science and his 20 years of experience in redistricting in North Carolina, he could demonstrate that how a small, what are called voter tabulation districts had voted in past elections, whether Democratic or Republican, was the best predictor of how they would vote in future elections and that all partisan gerrymandering in the modern era is based on that kind of social science."
2018.18-422,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2731.28,2758.6,"Well, but the one thing that -- I forget where the -- which brief it is -- but it turns out that a lot of the predictions in this area -- and I don't know if this applies to North Carolina or not -- prove to be very, very wrong very often. I mean, you have the famous example in the Vieth case where the argument was this -- this change would -- or the method under challenge would never allow the election of Republican judges."
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2773.2,2800.92,"In this case, on this undisputed record, the way this was done was that Dr. Hofeller used a composite of seven statewide elections over four election cycles to come up with a calculation of partisan advantage and predict -- predictability. And it predicted 10 Republican districts, and the Republicans won all 10."
2018.18-422,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2814.44,2829.64,"Counsel, the reality is that with all statistical models -- and we spend our lives based on them, insurance is paid on statistical models, health insurance premiums are based on statistical models."
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2845.6,2848.76,There is a remote possibility sometimes.
2018.18-422,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2848.76,2854.2,"And the sometimes happen; that's why they're a probability, right -- a possibility?"
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2854.2,2855.4,Correct.
2018.18-422,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2855.4,2860.96,So the fact that you have one exception doesn't disprove the rule?
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2860.96,2866.0,"Certainly not 100 maps out of 24,000 maps."
2018.18-422,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2866.0,2894.4,"Yes, but the -- the -- the -- the problem I think your side throughout this morning has to deal with, a problem, is from this side of the bench, to some people looking at the prior cases, there is a great concern that unless you have a very clear standard, you will turn many, many elections in the United States over to the judges."
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,2933.8,2975.2,"And our square-on answer to that question is, in this case, we prove beyond a reasonable doubt a predominant partisan intent that was admitted on this record and demonstrated statistically beyond any possibility of dispute, and we have proved an extreme partisan effect not only on a state-wide level but on a district-specific level. In Dr. Mattingly's charts, six of the districts are extreme statistical outliers that would not be achieved in even one, in some instances, of 24,000 plans."
2018.18-422,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3028.08,3041.64,"Suppose the legislature had said we have all these maps we can choose from, but we don't -- we don't want to be too greedy, so we're going to pick a map solely for the purpose of giving us an advantage."
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,3048.52,3053.88,It would be very difficult to prove predominant partisan intent.
2018.18-422,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3053.88,3061.08,What if they said it outright: The only reason why we're picking this map is we want to build in a seven to five advantage?
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,3061.08,3103.92,"If -- to take your hypothetical example -- if, in North Carolina, the legislature said we in our wisdom have decided that the people in Charlotte are going to be represented by a Democrat, the people in Asheville are going to be represented by a Republican, that we're going to split Guilford County and North Carolina A&T to ensure that the students in that school are going to be represented by a Republican in one district and a Republican in another, they would be dictating electoral outcomes even if it were seven/six. The whole idea of the democratic process in a general election is the people elect a member of Congress in a general election in which everybody can vote."
2018.18-422,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3113.8,3114.08,So even if it's --
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,3114.08,3114.96,-- outcome determinative.
2018.18-422,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3114.96,3123.36,"-- I mean, even if the map provides only a very small partisan advantage, that would be subject to challenge in litigation?"
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,3123.36,3151.4,"If, in the facts that I posited, you had the legislature essentially deciding that the people in X part of the state were going to be represented by a Democrat and the people in Y part of the state were going to be represented by a Republican, that the people in those respective districts of the other persuasions were not going to have a choice, were not going to have an opportunity, that would clearly violate every principle for which this Court has stood."

2018.18-422,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3162.08,3164.72,-- judges are going to have to decide what's the right answer?
2018.18-422,1,21951,emmet_j_bondurant_ii,,3164.72,3194.92,"Quite the contrary. As with the one-person, one-vote rule, if the Court says, as this Court said in Term Limits and in Cook v. Gralike, that the Elections Clause means that the legislature can't put its thumb on the scale and pick winners and losers, dictate electoral outcomes, favor or disfavor a class of candidates, that is a standard that can be understood."

2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3217.6,3331.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The North Carolinians who are plaintiffs in this case come before this Court today seeking relief because, when the General Assembly enacted an allegedly remedial plan in 2016, its leadership essentially bragged to these voters and the public at large that, by enacting a 10/three plan, it was punishing voters who supported Democratic candidates and it was going to create districts that would not allow voters in those districts any meaningful ability to use normal democratic processes to redress infringements on their individual constitutional rights. This case is not the first North Carolina voting case to reach this Court this decade, but it represents the most extreme example of a non-responsive legislature that believes that this Court will implicitly endorse unfettered partisan manipulation in redistricting by declining to rein in this most egregious example. The vote dilution test presented to this Court today is a limited and precise test designed only to impose liability on the worst of the worst cases, thus limiting the number of partisan gerrymandering cases that this Court will see. And under this very limited and precise vote dilution test, a lower court will apply a three-prong test where all three prongs must be satisfied in an -- and under many of those prongs, there are multiple screens to limit the number of plans subject to liability. First, partisan intent has to be proven on a district-specific basis, that is, proving that district lines were drawn to subordinate the adherence of one political party and entrench the power of the party drawing the lines. Second, partisan effect has to be shown at the district-specific and plan-wide levels."
2018.18-422,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3370.8,3386.68,But do you deny that built into this is the idea that we should at least have proportional representation light? Proportional representation is in a sense that -- is in some way the baseline against which all of this is measured?
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3386.68,3394.08,"Not at all, Justice Alito. With the three prongs, there is plenty of room for non-proportional plans."

2018.18-422,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3526.76,3540.52,"From -- how much breathing room, from what standard? And isn't the -- isn't the answer that you just -- I understand you don't want to give it, but isn't the real answer here breathing room from proportional representation up to maybe seven percent?"
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3540.52,3540.84,No.
2018.18-422,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3540.84,3545.24,"Just -- if it's not that, then what is this breathing room and what -- where does it exist?"
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3545.24,3556.04,Breathing room exists in -- in the Bell curve of expected and reasonable map allocations of representation.
2018.18-422,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3560.92,3595.76,"Well, why -- why isn't the answer to Justice Gorsuch's question that what's not allowed is deviation from whatever the state would have come up with, absent these partisan considerations? In other words, the state can do whatever it wants, it can depart from proportional representation however much it wants to, however much the natural features of the state would suggest, it can come up with something that's not proportional representation at all. What it can't do is deviate from that based on partisan considerations."
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3599.36,3601.76,It -- that gets at the effects prong.
2018.18-422,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3603.48,3605.24,"Yes, that's what I was talking about."
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3605.24,3615.92,"But you would still potentially lack discriminatory effect, and it really is a question of whether the line-drawing party is imposing upon a disfavored party a severe and durable effect. And that's the legal --"
2018.18-422,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3615.92,3617.44,"Counsel, what -- what is --"
2018.18-422,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3617.44,3625.76,"Well, counsel, I get -- I get that, you know, you've -- you've wisely adopted a very fine answer, given for you."
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3668.96,3669.32,There is no --
2018.18-422,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3669.32,3671.84,Controlling for geography and everything else.
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3671.84,3674.68,"Well, the geography is baked into that Bell curve."
2018.18-422,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3674.68,3675.84,"It is baked in, I accept that."
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3691.2,3700.24,"If -- if what we're left with is no extreme statistical outlier or no grossly asymmetrical map, the legislature can choose from any of those plans."
2018.18-422,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3700.24,3703.24,"Counsel, what is -- what is wrong with proportional representation?"
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3703.24,3713.0,There are -- there are certainly states where the -- the natural geography of the state doesn't lend itself to proportional representation.
2018.18-422,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3716.76,3726.24,"If you -- if you were cracking or packing to get to proportional representation, would that in your view be unconstitutional?"
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3726.24,3734.36,"This Court has endorsed that kind of activity in Gaffney, where a legislature is striving for proportional representation."
2018.18-422,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3747.28,3757.96,Do you agree with Mr. Clement that the Constitution does not require proportional representation or require something close to proportional representation?
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3757.96,3761.68,The Constitution does not require it.
2018.18-422,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3819.24,3829.64,Am I right to understand that your -- your test allows a greater degree of partisanship in redistricting than Mr. Bondurant's?
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3829.64,3852.44,"I think they're -- they're complementary tests depending on how you understand the constitutional harm, where we see vote -- the vote dilution tests based on the one-person, one-vote and the racial vote dilution frameworks, we see those tests as allowing room for some political considerations, particularly the ones endorsed by this Court."
2018.18-422,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3892.32,3945.56,"I took -- I took some of your argument in the briefs and the amicus briefs to be that extreme partisan gerrymandering is a real problem for our democracy -- and I'm not going to dispute that -- and that the Court, even though it might be a problem to get involved in all these cases, should, in essence, recognize the emergency situation from your perspective. But what about, to pick up on something Justice Gorsuch said earlier, that there is a fair amount of activity going on in the states on redistricting and attention in Congress and in state supreme courts? In other words, have we reached the moment, even though it would be a -- have we really reached the moment, even though it would be a big lift for this Court to get involved, where the other actors can't do it?"
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3945.56,3950.04,The North Carolinian plaintiffs in front of you can do nothing to solve this problem.
2018.18-422,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3950.12,3952.96,But I'm thinking about more nationally.
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3973.12,3979.44,"And as Mr. Bondurant acknowledged, east of the Mississippi there's a very small number of states where this is a possibility."
2018.18-422,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3983.96,3996.2,"Well, but that -- that's on -- that's on initiatives, right? And even -- even there, I mean, there are -- I mean, New Jersey, Michigan, Ohio, have -- have -- have dealt with this in some way, just to pick a few that I -- I've got in front of me."
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,3996.2,3996.52,And --
2018.18-422,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3996.52,4002.72,"But -- but you also have the state supreme court option, as -- as Justice Kennedy -- Kavanaugh pointed out."
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,4010.08,4015.16,Other options don't relieve this Court of its duty to vindicate constitutional rights.
2018.18-422,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4080.32,4098.52,"Well, if we look at the -- the popular vote for the House of Representatives nationally in the 2018 election and compare that to the percentage of seats won by the two parties, what -- to what degree do they diverge?"
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,4098.52,4102.8,I don't know the answer to that question off -- off the top of my head.
2018.18-422,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4107.92,4115.32,"But, if this is a great national problem, is there -- would we see a great divergence there if we look at the statistics across the whole country?"
2018.18-422,2,62983,allison_j_riggs,,4115.32,4117.6,There's not gerrymandering in every state.
2018.18-422,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4128.64,4132.04,"Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Clement."
2018.18-422,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,4132.04,4172.88,"Thank you, Your Honors. Just a few points in two minutes. First, I do think at a very fundamental level my friends on the other side are the victim of their own technology because they have produced 24,000 maps that are permissible maps that don't take partisanship into account at all. And their submission is that a legislature organized on partisanship lines cannot take partisanship into account to any material degree in picking among the 24,000 maps. And that's just an argument ultimately to reassign this authority away from state legislatures and to somebody else who doesn't have a partisanship interest --"
2018.18-422,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4172.88,4173.28,I'm sorry --
2018.18-422,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,4173.28,4174.88,-- or a partisanship organization.
2018.18-422,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4174.88,4192.52,"-- that -- that's just not true because what they have shown is, if you don't use partisanship as the predominant factor, then you can produce a lot of maps that are not this one."
2018.18-422,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,4193.96,4194.36,Right.
2018.18-422,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4202.56,4202.72,Don't use --
2018.18-422,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,4202.72,4204.08,-- take partisan --
2018.18-422,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4204.08,4213.04,-- the one criteria that intentionally and invidiously looks to exclude the other party.
2018.18-422,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,4218.12,4219.56,That's right.
2018.18-422,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4265.96,4266.84,"Thank you, counsel."
