1980.79-1127,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.435,We will hear arguments first this morning in Estelle v. Ernest Benjamin Smith.
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,13.23,16.088,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1127,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,116.672,121.389,Has Texas had a bifurcated proceeding since the beginning of this century?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,121.389,126.262,"No, Your Honor, they have not but the statute has been carried over from the beginning."
1980.79-1127,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,134.368,141.335,So until the present statute this kind of evidence went in to this jury that determined guilt?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,141.335,142.459,"--No, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,160.328,162.39,But from the beginning of the century until 1965?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,162.39,166.261,"There was a single, a unitary trial, not a bifurcated trial."
1980.79-1127,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,166.261,168.605,Therefore this sort of evidence that you said has traditionally been--
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,168.605,173.072,Evidence as to mental status could be used as to guilt.
1980.79-1127,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,173.072,173.712,--As to guilt?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,173.712,179.773,But it was admitted for the purposes of punishment under the statutory provisions.
1980.79-1127,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,179.773,180.476,Were there any instructions?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,180.476,182.943,"Yes, Your Honor, there were generally instructions."
1980.79-1127,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,182.943,187.425,Limited to the determination of punishment?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,187.425,187.816,Yes.
1980.79-1127,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,194.329,194.767,"No, no."
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,196.172,201.155,"--If the prosecution introduced the evidence, it would be limited as to punishment, not as to guilt."
1980.79-1127,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,223.833,238.406,Is there any practice in Texas as distinguished from the rule in the Texas courts as to furnishing notice of witnesses to the adverse party before the case opens?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,238.406,250.962,"If the counsel requests a list of witness and it is so ordered by the court, it is provided, but it is depending upon the type of order."
1980.79-1127,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,351.329,356.748,"Does that psychiatric testimony, General Ashton, go beyond that, however?"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,356.748,376.739,"Your Honor, generally in the context it's used, the State uses it if a psychiatrist or psychologist has determined that the defendant has a sociopathic personality or an antisocial personality and will continue to commit crimes."
1980.79-1127,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,415.286,428.438,Then I take it that the State doesn't agree with the observations in the amicus brief of the American Psychiatric Association that this kind of testimony as to predictive behavior is unreliable?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,428.438,431.749,"No, Your Honor, we do not agree with that."
1980.79-1127,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,444.494,448.46,"It seems a little strange, doesn't it, for the APA to be taking an opposing position?"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,448.46,461.485,"Your Honor, the brief that was filed by the American Psychiatric Association reflects the viewpoint of some psychiatrists with that association."
1980.79-1127,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,501.581,507.578,"Yes, but how can you predict future behavior by way of recidivism?"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,508.858,514.793,"Your Honor, I'm not trained in the area of psychiatry."
1980.79-1127,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,527.148,529.146,But at least Dr. Grigson thought he could?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,529.146,532.02,"--No, Your Honor, not just Dr. Grigson."
1980.79-1127,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,564.335,566.242,"Dr. Grigson is one of the favorites, isn't he?"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,566.242,573.801,"Well, Your Honor, he has had more experience in doing criminal examinations than probably any other psychiatrist in the State of Texas."
1980.79-1127,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,573.801,574.723,And testifying.
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,574.723,576.69,And has testified numerous times.
1980.79-1127,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,576.69,580.095,Doesn't he testify in virtually every capital case in Texas?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,580.095,580.423,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,580.423,582.047,"Well, most, doesn't he?"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,582.047,587.248,He testifies in most of the capital cases in Dallas and in that surrounding northeastern part of Texas.
1980.79-1127,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,600.008,605.132,"There are some psychiatrists who consistently and regularly testify for the defense, are there not?"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,605.132,605.958,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,605.958,607.911,Not only in Dallas but--
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,607.911,609.598,--throughout the State.
1980.79-1127,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,609.598,610.645,--All over the country?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,610.645,611.113,And the country.
1980.79-1127,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,611.113,637.76,Was not the genesis of this caution about prediction based on... if you know... many situations where psychiatrists testified that there was no future danger and then very quickly it was found that that was erroneous and then psychiatrists began to retreat from predictions; at least some of them did?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,637.76,638.993,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,656.688,669.638,"Ms. Ashton, you said that there were psychiatrists who testified for the defense as to the absence of the probability of recidivism or future danger."
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,684.24,686.301,Generally they testify as to the latter.
1980.79-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,708.402,713.791,"Ms. Ashton, does this case present any issue with respect to the admissibility of this kind of testimony?"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,713.791,717.133,"Of the defendant's testimony, Your Honor?"
1980.79-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,717.133,718.491,No; the psychiatrist's testimony.
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,718.491,723.708,"Yes, Your Honor, it does present an issue, I believe, as to--"
1980.79-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,723.708,731.658,I thought it only was inadmissible... the Court of Appeals was unhappy about the way the testimony was obtained and the fact there was no notice given to counsel.
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,731.658,741.826,"--Your Honor, the Court of Appeals opinion went on in the second portion of the opinion, though, to state that in the event of the retrial that the testimony could not be used."
1980.79-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,741.826,742.997,Of Dr. Grigson because of the way it was obtained.
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,742.997,746.137,"Well, the way it was--"
1980.79-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,746.137,754.243,"But there's nothing in the opinion, is there, that would foreclose the use of another psychiatrist who would follow the procedures that they held were appropriate?"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,756.025,776.391,"--Well, Your Honor, the interpretation that I had of the second portion of the opinion said they were indicating that anytime a psychiatrist was court-appointed and went in to talk to a defendant and his testimony might conceivably be used during the punishment stage of a trial, that that psychiatrist must warn the defendant that he has a right to remain silent, a right to--"
1980.79-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,776.391,779.202,"Yes, but if he does give those warnings, his testimony is admissible, isn't it?"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,779.202,784.793,"--Yes, Your Honor, but previous to that time there's not been that standard of warning for a psychiatrist to give to the defendant."
1980.79-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.793,789.963,"I understand that, but the issue that you've been talking about up to now is whether the testimony is ever admissible."
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,801.114,807.064,No; their brief goes to the ultimate issue of presenting this type of testimony.
1980.79-1127,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.064,810.892,It didn't seem to me that was among the questions presented to us for decision; that's all.
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,818.107,820.092,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,820.092,820.981,--that
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,827.182,827.901,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,827.901,834.961,"No, let me put that: isn't that all the testimony that we have on every case in this Court in which he testified?"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,841.037,843.519,Give you one capital murder case in which he did not--
1980.79-1127,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,843.519,844.253,Which is in this Court.
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,844.253,845.096,--Court... presently?
1980.79-1127,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,845.096,851.906,"Yes, that Dr. Grigson was there and where he didn't say that"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,858.857,869.133,"Your Honor, the cases that have been in this Court and are currently pending in this Court in which Dr. Grigson has testified, the testimony is all as to a sociopathic personality."
1980.79-1127,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,872.632,874.241,Did he use the same words?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,874.241,878.598,--He uses approximately the same words for his diagnosis--
1980.79-1127,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,878.598,879.301,Same words; that's right.
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,879.301,880.676,--if it's a similar diagnosis.
1980.79-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.62,950.663,"This argument, I take it, goes to the suggestion that Dr. Grigson isn't a ""hanging psychiatrist"" necessarily."
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,951.178,952.115,That's correct.
1980.79-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,952.115,955.067,"Now, are these statistics... of record?"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,960.955,963.314,"No, Your Honor, it is not part of this record."
1980.79-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.435,975.826,Right; right.
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,977.794,981.838,"Your Honor, we have not had evidentiary hearings in any court on this."
1980.79-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.838,990.289,"Well, that's what I was leading up to, to asking you whether some of these claims were ever presented to the state courts?"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,990.289,991.693,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,991.693,993.895,The Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,993.895,1003.938,"They were presented by purpose of a... in this particular case, in a shotgun petition for writ of habeas corpus which--"
1980.79-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.938,1005.157,Where... in what... where?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,1005.157,1016.215,"--In the state courts, in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and to the trial court approximately I believe it was four or five days before an execution was scheduled to take place for this defendant."
1980.79-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1021.791,1027.851,"Well, would these claims have been open in the state courts on a state collateral proceeding?"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,1043.11,1051.498,"Your Honor, they have been presented by indirect appeal in some other cases."
1980.79-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1051.498,1051.998,I'm asking about this case.
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,1051.998,1057.636,"Well, the court has found, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has found that there is no Fifth and Sixth Amendment right as to psychiatric testimony."
1980.79-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1057.636,1063.587,"I know, but I'm asking whether these claims were properly presented in the state collateral proceeding."
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,1068.975,1070.582,"Yes, Your Honor, they would have been open."
1980.79-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1070.582,1072.691,So they denied them on the state collateral?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,1072.691,1075.05,They denied them.
1980.79-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1075.05,1077.112,So state remedies have been exhausted?
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,1077.112,1080.345,Technically the state remedies have been exhausted.
1980.79-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.681,1108.739,"Well, then your claim, is it, must be, then, that state remedies haven't been exhausted?"
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,1108.739,1117.158,"Well, yes, Your Honor, they have not been, except for the fact that the technical allegation was that it was copied verbatim from one petition to the other."
1980.79-1127,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.158,1123.374,I don't understand your position on exhaustion then.
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,1127.685,1147.459,"Your Honor, because of the decision subsequent to decision by the Court of Criminal Appeals holding that there is not a Fifth and Sixth Amendment right to psychiatric testimony as a matter of state law, I feel that it would be futile to bring the claims as presented to the federal District Court in this claim."
1980.79-1127,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1157.422,1188.802,"Well, as the case comes here, I had understood that the two issues were whether it was a violation of due process to fail to give notice of Dr. Grigson's testimony, that he would testify; and second, that the Constitution required that before any interview material could be used, that the defendant had to be informed that the information might be used against him."
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,1190.019,1191.144,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1191.144,1193.111,You've addressed one of them.
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,1193.111,1194.705,As to the--
1980.79-1127,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1194.705,1200.765,But the latter is based on the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.
1980.79-1127,0,15387,anita_ashton,,1200.765,1201.578,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1232.845,1239.094,Mr. Berger.
1980.79-1127,1,29070,joel_berger,,1239.094,1242.655,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1127,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1256.806,1259.477,"Well, is there a death sentence outstanding now?"
1980.79-1127,1,29070,joel_berger,,1259.477,1271.424,I believe there technically is because the 5th Circuit decision has been stayed and Mr. Smith is presently on death row in Texas.
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3104.079,3105.517,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3146.406,3147.14,"Well, did the judge give him an hour?"
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3147.14,3151.013,"--The judge gave an hour recess and said, is that agreeable?"
1980.79-1127,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3151.013,3151.185,Why?
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3151.185,3157.979,"Your Honor, trial judges frequently give recess during the presentation of testimony for one reason or another."
1980.79-1127,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3161.01,3164.836,May he not have done so here because he thought defense counsel was surprised?
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3164.836,3169.052,"--He may have, Your Honor, but there is no indication that that was the reason that he did so."
1980.79-1127,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3169.052,3172.285,"Well, he claimed surprise, did he not?"
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3172.285,3176.066,He claimed that the name was not on a witness list.
1980.79-1127,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3176.409,3177.861,"Well, wasn't that equivalent to claiming surprise?"
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3177.861,3195.198,"--Your Honor, there are facts in the record... first of all, the subpoena that was issued indicates that he knew Dr. Grigson had examined his client and obviously gave some consideration to the fact or he would not have requested the subpoena for the visitation records."
1980.79-1127,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3311.23,3331.427,"When you say that the report was placed in the court file, is it common practice in Texas for attorneys to run through the file rather than rely on a witness list or documents served on them?"
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3331.427,3351.652,"Yes, Your Honor, it is common practice for attorneys to look at a court's file fairly frequently, especially when they're trying a capital-type case, that the court's file is something that is open to either side and is going to have information in it as to subpoenas, as to other materials, communications with the court."
1980.79-1127,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3359.571,3380.062,"Ms. Ashton, if a state passed a statute that said in a capital case in the second part of a bifurcated trial as to whether or not the man gets death is determined by a psychiatrist."
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3383.139,3388.308,If that... the ultimate issue would have to be determined by a psychiatrist?
1980.79-1127,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3388.308,3389.558,I gave you what the statute said.
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3395.118,3416.859,"Well, Your Honor, I don't believe that under the context of having an expert witness make an ultimate factual determination without giving the jury consideration as to all the facts of the trial, I believe that probably would be a denial of due process."
1980.79-1127,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3497.377,3505.092,"At this point, Ms. Ashton, could the State have called Smith, at the penalty phase of the trial?"
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3505.092,3517.416,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think they probably could have called Smith to force him to testify; no."
1980.79-1127,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3517.416,3520.227,"Well, then you're abandoning part of your--"
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3524.944,3567.271,"Your Honor, although you could not force a person to give testimony from his mouth, the Fifth Amendment should not apply to prohibit use of testimony which has, serves as a basis for an opinion which has been rendered; that the Fifth Amendment should not go as to those statements made by the defendant after he's been found guilty as to statements of guilt, especially in circumstances where he has given the same testimony in the court as to the facts of the offense."
1980.79-1127,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3567.271,3585.075,"If while incarcerated he had boasted to the jailor about the crime and said if he had the opportunity he would do it over again, would that be admissible under Texas law in the second phase of the proceeding?"
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3585.075,3585.497,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3585.497,3595.196,So that you're putting the statements to Dr. Grigson in the same category as voluntary statements made to a third person?
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3595.196,3605.161,"Not necessarily because they are voluntary, but they are made to a court-appointed expert, but he is not serving as an official of law enforcement."
1980.79-1127,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3625.887,3632.12,May I ask another question about the penalty phase of the trial in the Texas procedure?
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3639.898,3641.053,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3641.053,3653.485,"Suppose the State did not present any evidence and then the defense, as I think in this case, presented no evidence, could the State then call Dr. Grigson?"
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3653.485,3655.89,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3670.854,3675.29,So there are some rules that apply in the penalty phase of the trial--
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3675.29,3675.962,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3675.962,3677.633,--even though you say the Fifth Amendment is not a--
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3677.633,3678.742,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3678.742,3684.989,--I just wanted to follow up on the same thought that Justice Blackmun was raising.
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3692.939,3694.518,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1127,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3694.518,3698.751,Could the State have used Dr. Grigson's testimony during the guilt phase?
1980.79-1127,2,15387,anita_ashton,,3698.751,3716.96,"The state could not have used Dr. Grigson's testimony because under the statute, under 4602, which provides for psychiatric, court-appointed psychiatric examinations in a criminal trial, it specifically states that no evidence may be used as to the issue of guilt."
1980.79-1127,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3716.96,3718.554,Thank you.
1980.79-1127,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3718.554,3720.209,"Thank you, counsel."
