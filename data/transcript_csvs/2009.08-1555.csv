2009.08-1555,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.121,"We'll hear argument today in Case 08-1555, Samantar v. Yousuf."
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,6.872,19.256,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The FSIA applies to suits against foreign officials for acts taken on the state's behalf, because such suits are the equivalent of a suit against the state directly."
2009.08-1555,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,19.256,24.738,"Counsel, I -- I want to just say that I have one problem with the case at the outset."
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,77.043,91.148,"The Torture Victim Protection Act creates a cause of action but is silent about immunity, and, therefore, has to be interpreted consistently with background immunity principles and consistently with a preexisting statute codifying immunity, rather than--"
2009.08-1555,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,91.148,92.49,What -- what authority do you have for that?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,92.49,94.816,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-1555,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,95.253,97.909,What case authority do you have for that proposition?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,97.909,101.126,"--Dellmuth v. Muth, for one thing."
2009.08-1555,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,116.841,119.107,It's like a -- it's like a clear statement rule?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,119.107,120.495,Yes.
2009.08-1555,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,124.102,149.109,"If you are right about that -- I guess it would be the same under the Alien Tort Statute -- then the Filartiga case -- if the -- if there had been a quest -- request to dismiss because Filartiga was a former officer, and the same thing in Karadzic, none of those could have gone forward?"
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,149.109,159.276,"If, in those cases, an immunity defense had been asserted and it had been established that the official was acting on behalf of the state, then, yes, immunity would apply."
2009.08-1555,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,162.29,180.765,"Is there -- is there any Alien Tort Statute or the torture statute that would have survived, under your view, because your view is it's no exception under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, end of case?"
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,180.765,185.764,"Absolutely, there are Torture Victim Protection Act and ATS claims that could be brought."
2009.08-1555,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,199.62,200.915,"Yes, but that doesn't -- that's not going to happen."
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,201.367,204.522,--There are cases where it has happened.
2009.08-1555,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,247.943,252.006,"Of course, that -- again, the Torture Victim Protection Act says"
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,266.387,270.762,"--Well, it's not a clear statement because it's only a clear statement creating a cause of action."
2009.08-1555,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,296.048,301.748,"Well, I'll jump on the hobby horse even if Justice Kennedy is jumping off."
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,312.366,317.209,You're talking about the exception in the TVPA for state sponsors of terrorism?
2009.08-1555,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,317.209,317.724,Yes.
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,317.724,327.266,"But the TVPA -- the FSIA, in addition, also has a cause of action applicable to state sponsors of terrorism."
2009.08-1555,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,352.017,364.967,"Well, when you -- going back to where you started -- you started saying the officer must go together with the state, because in reality it's the same thing; it's a suit against the state."
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,383.584,393.78,"Because the touchstone of foreign sovereign immunity law, which the FSIA codified, is that one nation's courts cannot sit in judgment of another nation's acts."
2009.08-1555,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,412.587,423.943,"Well, that sounds like you're -- you're talking about an ""act of state"" doctrine, not that the suit against one is the equivalent of a suit against the other."
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,423.943,432.202,"--The ""act of state"" doctrine is distinct from immunity doctrines, although they have certain shared underpinnings and shared comity considerations."
2009.08-1555,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,485.477,507.767,"I'm not sure that I followed your distinction of the domestic law, per se, because say, the Federal Tort Claims Act, to come within that Act and to have the government cover it, the officer has to be acting within the scope of her employment, however careless or reckless she may be."
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,507.767,514.623,--That -- and that goes to when the government would be liable for the employee's acts.
2009.08-1555,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,542.36,550.748,How will a court determine whether an official was acting within the official scope of the official's responsibilities?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,550.748,555.01,"Ordinarily, the foreign state would tell you, and that would be dispositive of the matter."
2009.08-1555,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,565.99,568.318,What if the court can't tell by looking at the complaint?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,574.753,584.077,--A foreign government ordinarily is going to -- is going to get involved in the case and indicate whether it wishes to assert immunity on behalf of the official or not.
2009.08-1555,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,611.612,620.093,So how is the inquiry any different than the one that would go under the common law head of state inquiry?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,623.232,631.355,"--I -- I think the inquiry as to whether it's an official act would be the same, but head of state immunity is a different sort of immunity than sovereign immunity."
2009.08-1555,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,647.065,647.502,So your--
2009.08-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.502,651.706,Is head of state immunity implicit in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act as well?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,651.706,652.689,No.
2009.08-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.017,659.891,So why can't this be a -- a different body of common law?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,659.891,662.578,"--Do you mean, why can't this--"
2009.08-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,662.578,662.828,No.
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,678.429,682.567,--Because head of state immunity is not a form of sovereign immunity.
2009.08-1555,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,693.922,694.639,--Wait a minute.
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,712.258,719.955,Because consular and diplomatic immunity are very different in scope and in purpose than state sovereign immunity.
2009.08-1555,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,745.463,757.971,"I'm trying to go before the Act, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, before it was passed, because that was Congress's first statement, and we have to figure out what they intended to replace or not replace."
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,786.477,787.944,He could get into a car accident.
2009.08-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,815.014,825.024,Can -- can you get to the text of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that you -- that you assert embraces this personal immunity?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,825.024,831.473,--Section 1603(a) -- excuse me -- section 1604 says that
2009.08-1555,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,845.874,861.07,Suppose that the -- the Department of the Army orders clothes for the soldiers at a time when the department is a separate agency of Government X in 1940.
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,888.418,893.417,I think this statute would block the suit--
2009.08-1555,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,893.417,895.526,The statute would block the suit.
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,908.567,915.127,"--Because the source of immunity in that case was head of state immunity, which is different from the state sovereign immunity--"
2009.08-1555,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,915.127,915.439,All right.
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,927.573,929.258,--If the state--
2009.08-1555,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,929.258,930.571,--you still can't sue anybody--
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,930.571,931.773,--It was--
2009.08-1555,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,931.773,934.008,--who was part of the official operation--
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,934.008,935.243,--If the--
2009.08-1555,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,935.243,937.1,--even though there is no present interference?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,937.1,941.989,"--If the state does not exist, then I think you probably could sue the official--"
2009.08-1555,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,941.989,942.395,Why?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,942.395,943.362,--Because--
2009.08-1555,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,943.362,953.142,"Because if the state doesn't exist, why is there any stronger reason than in the incident where the entity is no longer part of the state?"
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,953.142,962.513,"--Because ultimately, what foreign sovereign immunity and this statute are concerned with is protecting a foreign state's act from being judged in court."
2009.08-1555,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,974.336,975.646,"Oh, no, you may have act of state doctrine."
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,983.504,985.676,"--You may very well have the act of state doctrine, but--"
2009.08-1555,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,985.676,996.326,And that's my question: Do you need the act of state doctrine or does this statute cover it which removes the discretion from the Executive Branch to decide on a case-by-case basis?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,996.326,1003.045,"--The act of state doctrine might very well cover your hypothetical, but it's a different doctrine that is not duplicative of immunity."
2009.08-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1060.846,1063.517,Can I come back -- can I come back to the text?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1107.36,1113.388,Section 1603(a) does not define a foreign state exhaustively.
2009.08-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1142.33,1156.856,"Well, I -- I would find it extraordinary that it would go out of its way to say that it includes the Department of Defense but would leave up in the air whether it includes the Secretary of Defense."
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1171.819,1191.23,"And the reason that I think that Congress had to go out of its way to define what constitutes an agency or instrumentality is that, at the time that the FSIA was passed, there was uncertainty about whether certain governmental or corporate entities were included, maybe not the Department of Defense, but whether certain commercial entities owned by the state were entitled to the state's immunity."
2009.08-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.604,1193.558,And there was no uncertainty about -- about individuals?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1193.558,1194.213,--Precisely.
2009.08-1555,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1203.725,1222.937,"How can you maintain that position when the Department of State takes the position that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act applies to a state and agencies and instrumentalities, but it doesn't apply to officers?"
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1230.826,1241.164,"--The State Department asked, before the FSIA was passed, to have Executive discretion take -- taken away with respect to immunity determinations."
2009.08-1555,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1249.255,1260.298,"It's something of a -- it's something of a mystery that the FSIA doesn't say anything at all about this form of immunity; doesn't codify it, doesn't abrogate it, doesn't preserve the preexisting law."
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1261.452,1284.507,"--I don't, other than the explanation that I gave Justice Scalia, which is: This immunity was not in question at the time that the FSIA was passed, and when Congress passes a statute in an area where there had been preexisting common law, this Court presumes that Congress meant to incorporate and continue that common law and not abrogate it unless Congress has spoken directly to the contrary."
2009.08-1555,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1284.507,1286.488,But was this Act originally drafted by the Executive?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1287.833,1305.872,"I'm not sure whether it was drafted by the Executive or whether it was drafted by Congress, but it was passed at the request of the Executive Branch because there was -- the State Department was put in a position of being under diplomatic pressure to grant immunity on -- on favored status to certain nations who asked for it when they wouldn't otherwise be entitled to it."
2009.08-1555,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1306.324,1322.523,"Is there any case by us in which we -- prior to the FSIA, where we recognize that an individual was immunized in the way that the state was, if he was acting as an agent of the state?"
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1327.861,1332.33,--This Court's cases generally had to do with other doctrines.
2009.08-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.641,1386.887,"Well, entitled to it, or -- or able to obtain a letter from the State Department that would confer it upon them?"
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1386.887,1388.354,"--No, Your Honor--"
2009.08-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1388.354,1393.619,"I mean -- well, I mean, prior to the FSIA, you -- you had to get it from the State Department, didn't you?"
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1395.257,1395.775,--No.
2009.08-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.61,1423.09,"And what -- what if the State Department came in and said no, no sovereign immunity here, what would the court do?"
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1424.307,1426.963,"Ordinarily, the court would at least defer to that."
2009.08-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1431.697,1435.336,"So they didn't have to say yes, but if they said no, that -- it pretty much carried the day?"
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1435.336,1437.769,That's probably right.
2009.08-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.298,1445.035,"Well, you -- you don't assert that to be -- to be the law now, do you?"
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1446.548,1447.237,--No--
2009.08-1555,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1447.237,1448.08,--under the FSIA?
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1448.08,1455.606,"--No, because the whole purpose of the FSIA -- again, at the Executive Branch's request -- was to take the Executive out of that process and to--"
2009.08-1555,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1455.606,1467.445,"Well, and then I -- I had thought -- again, correct me if I am wrong -- that, ultimately, in this case, whether or not within the issues here present -- ultimately, you have two arguments."
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1488.845,1489.61,--Well--
2009.08-1555,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1489.61,1504.072,"I had thought when I read the House of Lords opinion in Jones and they talked about the statute, that they took your position, this first position, that the Act just won't work unless there's an agent -- immunity for the agent."
2009.08-1555,0,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1513.88,1519.862,--Our position is that the FSIA incorporates the common law and that Mr. Samantar is entitled to immunity under the statute.
2009.08-1555,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1529.373,1529.67,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1539.635,1569.247,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Kennedy, the hobby horse that you were talking about actually goes right -- right to the heart of this case, and that is of the Torture Victim Protection Act, in which Congress did create a cause of action, was -- that cause of action was created for -- to impose a liability, personal liability, for acts that were done with ""actual or apparent"" -- but included with ""actual"" -- authority of the foreign state."
2009.08-1555,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1586.301,1599.31,"Ms. Millett, I think it's a pretty empty statute as well to interpret the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to immunize the Department of Defense, but not the Secretary of Defense."
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1601.606,1613.18,"--It doesn't seem strange, for precisely the reason that we have still with us today a former minister of defense when we have no Ministry of Defense and no Government of Somalia whatsoever."
2009.08-1555,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1620.691,1624.785,But the state -- there is -- the distinction strikes me as artificial as well.
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1637.591,1643.167,--The only question here is whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is the source of that insulation.
2009.08-1555,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1645.491,1658.723,"Oh, well, then -- but the whole point of the Act was to codify what was there before, and -- and it seems odd to say, well, they were codifying the immunity of the state, but not the immunity of the only way a state can act, which is through individuals."
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1658.723,1664.22,"--Well, first of all, states do corporate acts that are greater than the -- the whole is much greater than the parts here."
2009.08-1555,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1687.583,1689.942,"The -- the Ministry of Defense is not the whole, either."
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1708.682,1719.694,"Well, Justice Scalia, if you're going to write a statute that addresses individual immunities -- in particular, what this case is about, personal immunity for personal liability, then those statutes look very different."
2009.08-1555,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1735.5,1735.765,"Well, what is your--"
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1735.765,1736.592,--want to identify--
2009.08-1555,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1736.592,1737.091,--Right.
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1784.479,1785.945,"--Yes, he does, because--"
2009.08-1555,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1785.945,1788.039,"Well, then, this Act does nothing whatsoever."
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1788.039,1788.882,"--No, that's -- that's not true."
2009.08-1555,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1794.302,1795.1,"Well, it doesn't protect--"
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1795.1,1795.74,You can't--
2009.08-1555,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1795.74,1801.566,"--the state, because all I did there is I made my complaint the same, relief was the same, everything was the same."
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1817.902,1824.374,"--Justice Breyer, there -- the question is whether Congress, in the FSIA, would have thought that is a suit against the state."
2009.08-1555,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1840.133,1840.585,So wait--
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1840.585,1840.944,That--
2009.08-1555,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1840.944,1844.177,--you're saying this Act is only good as against a bad lawyer?
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1847.58,1848.551,--I think--
2009.08-1555,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1848.551,1853.091,There is never a case where this Act would give immunity if the plaintiff has a good lawyer.
2009.08-1555,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1854.152,1854.417,Ms. Millett--
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1854.417,1855.181,--This Act is good against--
2009.08-1555,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1855.181,1862.555,"--I thought your point is, if the relief is against the state, it doesn't matter who you name as the plaintiff."
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1862.555,1863.023,--That--
2009.08-1555,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1863.023,1872.456,"Whether it's injunctive relief or money relief, if the relief is against the state, obviously, you can't dodge it by naming the officer instead."
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1872.456,1872.675,--That's precisely right.
2009.08-1555,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.518,1874.706,Oh.
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1874.908,1876.0,"--Well, that's what I was trying to say."
2009.08-1555,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1879.124,1879.705,--Fine.
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1880.594,1880.734,--if you're enforcing a rule of law against--
2009.08-1555,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.734,1882.325,--which I thought was what you would give--
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1882.325,1883.796,--That's what I was trying to give.
2009.08-1555,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1884.373,1894.793,"--then I have added my question: Sometimes the individual, in the first set of cases that Justice Ginsburg mentioned, does count as the state."
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1934.478,1936.428,"Well, there's -- there's two levels here."
2009.08-1555,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1959.139,1961.529,What is there to suggest that Congress was looking to domestic analogies?
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1971.461,1982.52,"--Well, this is a domestic statute, and for Congress -- for purposes of Congress deciding whether a lawsuit is a suit against a sovereign or not against a sovereign, then that is obviously a relevant framework."
2009.08-1555,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2038.513,2039.589,"Ms. Millett, I thought--"
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2039.589,2040.966,They understood it was individual liability.
2009.08-1555,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.966,2050.852,--I thought the whole point of the FSIA was to get the Executive Branch out of the business of sending letters to the court every time a state was sued.
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2075.372,2078.576,"No, I think it's because the inquiries are very different, as this case illustrates."
2009.08-1555,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.022,2176.303,Excuse me.
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2187.015,2188.094,--As you--
2009.08-1555,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.094,2190.075,Isn't that what it did?
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2191.795,2199.512,"--When you're interpreting the language in the FSIA, like ""under color of law"" -- ""under color of office"", that is undoubtedly a job for the court."
2009.08-1555,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2220.222,2230.185,"Courts -- courts decide this sort of question all the time, whether you're talking about principles of domestic immunity or even corporate liability: Is the employee on a frolic or is it a detour?"
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2240.133,2244.882,"Not in this area, where those decisions have foreign relations implications."
2009.08-1555,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2257.877,2259.409,"Then that -- I mean, I'm sort of there."
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2290.051,2299.768,"--Justice Breyer, the -- I don't think -- I think -- and this may seem a little formless, but I simply think it's right, because you're dealing with statutory text here."
2009.08-1555,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2392.619,2393.742,Your friend -- you friend--
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2393.742,2395.634,But there's no mechanism here for -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-1555,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2395.634,2397.225,--Your friend said it happens all the time.
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2403.882,2405.114,That may be.
2009.08-1555,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2453.3,2459.122,"Well, do you agree with the Solicitor General's position about the preservation of the immunities that existed before?"
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2459.122,2462.998,"Yes, as to -- as individualized, the specialized immunities--"
2009.08-1555,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2462.998,2463.404,Yes.
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2463.404,2464.199,--I do -- we do agree.
2009.08-1555,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2476.868,2482.69,"No, but whatever immunity existed previously for an official or former official was not abrogated by the FSIA."
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2485.74,2489.16,Our position is that the FSIA does not address that.
2009.08-1555,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2508.086,2514.02,"There's no -- there was no immunity for someone who is the equivalent of a -- of a cabinet officer, previously?"
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2514.02,2515.584,--There -- there--
2009.08-1555,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2515.584,2519.128,The minister of this or that in another government -- they have no official immunity?
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2519.128,2521.784,"--Well, look -- and much is to be debated on remand."
2009.08-1555,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2541.325,2541.466,"Ms. Millett, do you agree with the--"
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2541.466,2542.011,--or cannot be.
2009.08-1555,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2542.011,2552.194,"--Do you agree with the government that it's the government's advice -- the government said, in the old days, the Tate letters went out in all these cases."
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2594.528,2609.522,"I don't think that's the exclusive one, and I think, as this Court explained even in Altmann that deference given -- respectful deference is always going to be given when the Executive Branch weighs in, because these are foreign -- cases that have foreign policy implications."
2009.08-1555,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2652.163,2652.912,"--No, I gather the--"
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2652.912,2654.082,--you're going to have the Executive Branch and the TVPA at war.
2009.08-1555,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2654.082,2661.767,"--the State Department asserts the right to say: Yes, he was acting in a -- in an official capacity, but sock it to him."
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2661.767,2663.078,Yes.
2009.08-1555,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.078,2672.168,"I mean, the -- the State Department wants to be able to decide whether individuals will be held liable, whether they were acting in an official capacity or not; isn't that it?"
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2672.168,2675.637,"Well, they -- that -- I'll let them speak for their own position."
2009.08-1555,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.386,2714.932,I must say--
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2714.932,2715.073,--language that's missing--
2009.08-1555,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2715.073,2736.017,"--that I find it much more acceptable to have the State Department say that a particular foreign country should be let off the hook, which is what they used to do with the Tate letters, than I do to leave it up to the State Department whether -- whether an individual human being shall be -- shall be punished or not."
2009.08-1555,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2743.823,2745.34,And your red light has gone off.
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2771.534,2772.797,--I think--
2009.08-1555,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2772.797,2774.532,Please.
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2774.532,2775.375,"--May I, sir?"
2009.08-1555,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2835.805,2836.647,Finish your sentence.
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2836.647,2847.66,"--But in any given case, the role of the Executive Branch is going to have more or less deference based on whether it is speaking something within its traditional expertise: Are you a head of state?"
2009.08-1555,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2873.755,2875.116,You made that a long sentence.
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2875.116,2875.303,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1555,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2876.442,2878.52,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1555,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2878.52,2887.688,Thank you.
2009.08-1555,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2887.688,2888.422,Mr. Kneedler.
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2888.422,2902.151,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The text, the context, the purposes, and legislative history of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act demonstrate that it was not intended to apply to the preexisting common law--"
2009.08-1555,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2902.151,2902.197,Could you--
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2902.197,2905.836,"--doctrine of official immunity, but rather -- yes--"
2009.08-1555,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2905.836,2906.445,--Mr. Kneedler--
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2906.445,2906.85,--Yes.
2009.08-1555,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2906.85,2907.365,--Could you -- I'm--
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2907.365,2907.646,I'm--
2009.08-1555,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2907.646,2909.534,--I'm sure one of my colleagues--
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2909.534,2909.553,--Yes.
2009.08-1555,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2909.553,2910.208,--will get you back.
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2958.625,2959.721,"Well, let me answer that in two ways."
2009.08-1555,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3014.586,3017.679,But all you have to do is write a different word in.
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3020.35,3020.833,--Okay.
2009.08-1555,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3021.648,3023.052,--and then Ms. Millett sort of backed off that.
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3023.052,3023.458,--Right.
2009.08-1555,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3023.458,3027.474,And that -- and if -- what I'm seeing here is two extreme positions.
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3064.972,3065.221,And--
2009.08-1555,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3065.221,3067.374,You want to stick to your extreme position?
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3068.813,3071.016,--I don't -- I don't regard the position as extreme at all.
2009.08-1555,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3071.921,3074.499,"--Well, do you want to stick to that position, that all the plaintiff--"
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3074.499,3075.232,--Because this--
2009.08-1555,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3075.232,3075.981,--has to do is rewrite the name?
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3075.981,3085.429,--this is a statute that invaded the common law in the -- the background was the common law in which the Executive made the determinations for both foreign sovereigns and individual officials.
2009.08-1555,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3126.304,3126.865,That's an excellent reason.
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3134.395,3134.831,--It would -- it--
2009.08-1555,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3134.831,3140.954,--if -- if my lawyer is clever enough to look up who the individuals were and substitute their names?
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3140.954,3157.226,"--And -- and it would -- here's one example in which it would work: If the relief was going to run against the state, if there was an injunction to take money out of the state treasury or to convey land, for example, that would, in substance, be an action against the state, just like under Ex parte Young."
2009.08-1555,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3175.893,3176.876,Do you think as a practical matter--
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3176.876,3177.032,That's Pimentel.
2009.08-1555,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3177.032,3178.046,--there's a -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3197.85,3200.085,There -- there -- there is a difference in the operation of the suit.
2009.08-1555,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3231.883,3233.321,Could we go back to the practical--
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3233.321,3233.555,--Yes.
2009.08-1555,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3294.201,3295.063,That's -- that's very nice.
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3316.273,3323.408,"--It -- such a suit would not be perfectly okay in -- because, I mean, it would depend on the circumstances."
2009.08-1555,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3339.076,3345.027,"I wonder -- I wonder if the example you give or the point you make, that there's no functioning Somali Government, doesn't cut the other way."
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3367.703,3368.502,Well--
2009.08-1555,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3368.502,3371.968,And the United States is not going to give him the letter he needs because they like the new Somali government.
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3371.968,3375.997,"--Well, under international law the -- the official immunity exists for the benefit of the state, not for the individual."
2009.08-1555,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3386.463,3396.24,"But I take it your answer to Justice Scalia with reference to the indictment against the Secretary of Defense, is that that's not covered by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act."
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3403.096,3403.641,No.
2009.08-1555,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3425.463,3433.488,"But that just goes back to the Tate letter era, where we wait to get an e-mail from the State Department to tell us what to do."
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3433.488,3433.991,--And the -- this--
2009.08-1555,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3433.991,3437.161,I thought that was the whole purpose of the Federal -- of Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3437.161,3455.699,"--It -- it was the purpose with respect to foreign sovereigns, but there were good reasons why the court did that, precisely because immunity questions -- as I've said, this case illustrates, to -- to recognize an immunity or not to recognize would -- might favor one faction or another in the ongoing dispute in -- in Somalia."
2009.08-1555,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3455.699,3456.323,Mr. Kneedler--
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3456.323,3457.746,And so the -- what--
2009.08-1555,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3457.746,3467.257,"--This is -- it's now many years, and we still don't -- the State Department has said in effect: We decide."
2009.08-1555,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3481.347,3482.922,--We are not addressing that here.
2009.08-1555,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3556.315,3557.407,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2009.08-1555,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3557.407,3560.531,There were a lot of long sentences in there--
2009.08-1555,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3561.108,3565.187,"Mr. Dvoretzky, because of that, we'll give you 5 minutes."
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3565.187,3566.56,I'll try to keep it short.
2009.08-1555,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3583.99,3594.768,Wouldn't that be the same question that you would ask invoking a common law protection like head of state or act of state?
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3600.922,3607.683,--It is the same inquiry that you would have asked under the common law in inquiring whether the state's immunity extends to its officials.
2009.08-1555,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3617.007,3618.415,Isn't that the very point?
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3653.869,3664.035,"--First of all, as we argue in our brief, this has not historically been a long-standing power of the Executive in the way that the immunity itself has been recognized under the common law."
2009.08-1555,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3715.045,3735.868,"Why can't you say that if the person, the individual you are suing, is a member of the foreign state, is engaged in the kind of activity that you're complaining about, is subject to the orders of the foreign state, and the relief would affect the foreign state, you are suing the foreign state?"
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3770.29,3771.415,--All right.
2009.08-1555,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3771.415,3773.241,That -- that's where this is all leading me.
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3773.241,3786.659,"Because the Restatement -- what the Restatement, which summarized the common laws as of the time of the FSIA's enactment, says that an official is immune for his acts on behalf of a state if exercising jurisdiction would enforce a rule of law against the foreign state."
2009.08-1555,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3792.672,3793.608,How does this case--
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3793.608,3793.983,--as you do by issuing--
2009.08-1555,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3793.983,3799.543,--How does this very case establish a rule of law for the foreign state?
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3827.936,3840.056,"--Because enforcing a judgment against a foreign official, threatening to bankrupt the person as soon as he or she leaves office, has just as much effect on the state itself as -- as enforcing a judgment directly against the state."
2009.08-1555,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3843.523,3848.179,"Never mind that this person has long lived in the United States, in Virginia."
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3853.693,3867.482,"--But the -- the rule that the government proposes, and the courts would presumably be left to apply on their own in the many cases like this one and the 9/11 litigation against the Saudis where the government doesn't weigh in, that rule does not draw those neat lines."
2009.08-1555,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3877.776,3880.79,May I ask just ask one quick question?
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3888.847,3892.599,1603(b)(1) is the agency--
2009.08-1555,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3892.599,3893.956,It defines an agency or instrumentality of the--
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3893.956,3896.705,--We do argue that in the alternative.
2009.08-1555,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3898.705,3901.36,--The principal argument is not based on the text.
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3903.903,3905.218,--We make that argument in the alternative.
2009.08-1555,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3906.435,3908.965,It's interesting that nobody has talked about that section during the entire argument.
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3908.965,3914.884,"--Our principal argument is based on the text of 1604, which is that in -- that subjecting official acts--"
2009.08-1555,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3914.884,3922.32,"If they don't qualify under 1603(b)(1), it's kind of hard to get the statute to apply to them at all."
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3922.32,3928.131,"--I respectfully disagree, Your Honor, because 16 (b)(1) defines agencies or instrumentalities."
2009.08-1555,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3933.984,3940.076,"It's kind of hard -- I mean, I assume the reason you don't rely heavily on it -- because it says that an agency or instrumentality is an entity."
2009.08-1555,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3944.51,3947.336,And 1602 applies only to foreign states.
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3947.336,3956.803,"--1602 applies to states, and our argument is that exercising jurisdiction over the official in the circumstances like these would be exercising jurisdiction over the state."
2009.08-1555,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3964.345,3965.582,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1555,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3965.847,3965.987,Thank you.
2009.08-1555,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3965.987,3966.892,The case is submitted.
