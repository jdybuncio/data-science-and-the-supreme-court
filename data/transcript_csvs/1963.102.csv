1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,23.351,26.605,If the Court please.
1963.102,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,232.903,297.915,(Inaudible)
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,297.915,307.449,"I would say, in the factual situation that you put, Justice Goldberg, that the employees would be required through their Union to submit that matter to arbitration."
1963.102,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,307.846,312.206,Has that been authorized (Inaudible)
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,312.206,324.672,"I don't think they could strike without running a serious risk of violating the no-strike clause unless, first, they had endeavored, rather diligently, to have the matter determined by an arbitrator."
1963.102,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,324.672,335.72,In other words you (Inaudible)
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,335.72,342.937,I would say that there is room but I think it would be an extraordinary and very exceptional case.
1963.102,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,369.965,379.693,"Your point here, I think, is that even if there's room for material to be filed (Inaudible)"
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,379.693,381.351,"I don't think that there was, no."
1963.102,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,539.346,544.787,The arbitrator will hear your argument (Inaudible)
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,544.787,568.182,"I think the arbitrator could hear and pass upon the very argument which the respondent is making in this Court and wants the courts to pass upon, and I think it would require -- before the issue could be decided, it would require a full hearing of the evidence and the facts and circumstances surrounding the events which lead to the discharges."
1963.102,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,776.021,791.238,(Inaudible)
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,791.238,794.498,That's correct.
1963.102,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,794.498,796.463,(Inaudible)
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,796.463,802.874,"No, I don't think that it would be because, I think, there is -- there are two separate questions."
1963.102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.739,903.783,Is the argument broad enough to cover the question of whether or not a strike -- whether or not the contract allows the employer to repudiate for an unauthorized strike?
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,905.107,910.981,I -- I think it would if the issue arose in the context of a grievance.
1963.102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.981,912.109,"Yes, which this one did."
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,912.109,913.25,Which this did.
1963.102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.25,913.383,It might --
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,913.383,913.465,It --
1963.102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,913.465,924.842,-- be different -- It would be a different case if this employer were -- had brought a suit for damages and the Union countered and asked a stay in order to send the -- to put the damage claim on arbitration.
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,924.842,925.382,That's correct.
1963.102,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1103.512,1107.474,(Inaudible)
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1107.474,1115.403,"On the pleadings, the Union denied that there was a strike, admitted that there was a walkout."
1963.102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.081,1121.44,Suppose it had been --
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1121.44,1121.724,That --
1963.102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.724,1122.691,called or authorized.
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1122.691,1125.319,That it called or authorized or encouraged the strike.
1963.102,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1138.936,1139.828,You started to say there was a rough --
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1139.828,1140.168,I'm sorry.
1963.102,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1140.168,1141.418,-- and ready distinction between --
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1141.418,1143.047,A rough and ready distinction between them.
1963.102,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1159.136,1162.952,But the Union continues to deny that it called or authorized such a walkout.
1963.102,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1162.952,1165.053,That it called or authorized that walkout.
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,1698.031,1728.545,"Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, before addressing myself to the three points that are involved this case, namely, the jurisdictional issue, then the merits, and then the final question touched upon by Mr. Watt whether the record in this case permits a factual basis for the legal conclusions reached by the Supreme Court of Iowa, I would like briefly just to touch on some points that had been covered in part but perhaps not fully illuminated by Mr. Watt's presentation."
1963.102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.784,1757.626,You assume then this is the non-arbitrable matter?
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,1757.626,1764.703,"Yes, that's -- the claim for damages, Mr. Justice White, for breach of the no-strike clause is a non-arbitrable matter."
1963.102,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1863.198,1865.943,"Mr. Scanlan, (Inaudible)"
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,1865.943,1867.492,In the production gang?
1963.102,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1867.492,1868.73,(Inaudible)
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,1868.73,1874.822,"I -- I believe, Your -- Mr. Justice Goldberg, it isn't in the record but I think it was 205."
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1951.306,1959.183,"(Inaudible) -- what, in your judgment, would happen if it's held that this has to go to arbitration with reference to your lawsuit?"
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,1959.183,1959.703,That's it.
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1959.703,1963.104,I just read their brief and I can't understand exactly what they said.
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,1963.104,1964.671,"I -- I'm not clear on that, Your Honor."
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1985.194,2002.598,"Does that mean this man should embark on the field that we have in Interstate Commerce Commission other agencies in dividing a lawsuit into two parts, one in which the courts can decide and one which the arbitrators can decide, so that that can be sent back to the court later?"
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2002.598,2002.626,Well I --
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2002.626,2004.433,Is that -- is that the contention?
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2004.433,2009.313,"Well, I wouldn't want to characterize his contention, but I can see it being evaluated that way."
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2009.313,2011.021,Well what -- what other way would it be?
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2013.946,2014.865,"Well, I agree with you."
1963.102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2015.087,2021.101,"Mr. Scanlan, (Inaudible) don't you think that this matter had been dealt with in Atkinson?"
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2023.221,2031.454,"No, I -- I would like to be able to claim that Atkinson settled this case in our favor, but I don't think we can read Atkinson that way."
1963.102,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2131.113,2148.541,(Inaudible) to come and to see if they didn't have a bargain and you're now bargaining your rights to present it and that's going to be entered by the conditional (Inaudible)
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2169.828,2172.513,"Well, I'll say this, Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1963.102,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2197.448,2199.68,I would assume you likely will not (Inaudible)
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2199.68,2201.605,"Well, no, I don't think you could."
1963.102,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2253.135,2261.208,(Inaudible)
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2261.208,2261.536,Well --
1963.102,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2261.536,2269.379,Any -- any walkout or strike (Inaudible)
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2269.379,2276.479,"Well, it may be possible that language that I can't visualize that would be acceptable to Unions without bitter bargaining could protect them."
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2320.819,2321.965,"Mr. Scanlan, I --"
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2321.965,2323.038,Would be meaningless.
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2323.038,2327.77,I evidently departed considerably from what I had in mind.
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2375.67,2376.023,Well --
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2376.023,2379.64,"Well, what happens if they win here?"
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2379.64,2380.1,If I understand --
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2380.1,2381.424,What happens to your lawsuit?
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2381.424,2389.886,"If I understand my opponent's argument correctly, we can proceed with our lawsuit when this matter gets back to the Iowa courts, our counterclaim, and that --"
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2389.886,2390.752,Your counterclaim?
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2390.752,2395.577,"Our counterclaim, our lawsuit is inv -- is in the cast in the form of a counterclaim, Mr. Justice Black."
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2412.595,2413.31,"If you do that, you'd have --"
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2413.31,2413.827,-- which is the identi --
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2413.827,2414.573,-- to wait.
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2414.573,2414.603,Pardon?
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2414.603,2417.453,"If that's the case, you'd have to wait."
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2425.138,2426.088,We maintain that it's not.
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2426.088,2427.288,Then you would have to wait.
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2448.473,2466.049,"I would say, if this were a case where the particular issue was one of the economic questions, say, for instance, the one that gave rise to the dispute initially, whether using production -- supervisory employees in the production line, the court should wait for a proceeding to comeback to it."
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2475.668,2476.284,"Well, that's it."
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2491.463,2496.886,"I would say, Your Honor, that -- well, I may be -- that isn't the question in our case."
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2534.808,2535.493,That's the suit.
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2535.493,2535.602,Under the --
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2535.602,2535.842,That's the suit.
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2535.842,2536.856,-- grievance procedure.
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2537.201,2538.139,The suit began.
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2538.139,2544.87,"If the suit did, I can see the argument is in favor of having the court to wait the decision of the arbitrator --"
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2544.87,2544.923,"Well, of course, it --"
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2544.923,2545.039,But that is not --
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2545.039,2552.492,"Of course it -- of course it should, if the arbitrator has the right to decide some things that are of necessary importance."
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2552.492,2553.274,That's correct.
1963.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2553.274,2561.483,But that enters into the -- my consideration of the problem is to how far arbitration can do that.
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2561.483,2580.356,"Well, I don't think it should be pushed to the extent that our opponent's theory would push it here, that the mere allegation of a grievance concerning a walkout, at that moment, cuts off further court consideration of it in a situation where they concede that we have a cause of action that we can pursue in the court."
1963.102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.697,2623.191,(Inaudible)
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2623.191,2624.681,"Well, perhaps I cast it --"
1963.102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.681,2628.883,(Inaudible)
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2628.883,2630.531,"I don't -- I don't follow you there, Justice --"
1963.102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.531,2639.727,"I gather, as I understood, you've got the counterclaim (Inaudible)"
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2639.727,2641.953,Well --
1963.102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2641.953,2648.691,Regardless that this is the same question as I think Justice Goldberg asked you that (Inaudible)
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2648.691,2674.035,"Well, we're faced with the one problem, whether the Court -- suppose the arbitrator comes up with the finding that these walkouts were justified and these men should be taken back and be p -- back-wages paid to the date of the walkout and, on the other hand, the Supreme Court of Iowa pulls a trial court or a jury finding perhaps that the employer suffered a 150,000 damages because of the shrinkage of the cattle in the yards during the period of the strike."
1963.102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2674.035,2674.231,What if --
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2674.231,2677.627,"Same set of facts, two directly opposing the decisions."
1963.102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2677.627,2681.04,What (Inaudible) the arbitrator manage to award?
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2683.646,2685.692,"Well, that's another difficulty with arbitration, and I think it --"
1963.102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.692,2693.814,"Well, I don't know if that could be interpreted as (Inaudible)"
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2693.814,2703.87,"Well, I can't -- we can't be sure what trouble an arbitrator's award in this proceeding would have or would -- what impact it would have on our lawsuit, but we're certain --"
1963.102,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2703.87,2705.238,"Mr. Scanlan, look at the other side."
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2723.903,2727.003,"Yes, I think -- I think they could."
1963.102,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2799.991,2812.244,"Mr. Scanlan, isn't this -- doesn't this place the argument of getting a lot of strong men, aren't there two separate disparate issues involved here, a lawsuit here?"
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2840.358,2842.344,And -- and the employees engaged in.
1963.102,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2842.344,2857.554,"Now, in the arbitration, even if the Union didn't call or sanction the strike, even if the Union did not call the strike, you would still reach your case suppose the arbitrator assumes the employee walked out, if the employee walked out."
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2857.554,2858.336,I would hope so.
1963.102,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2858.336,2872.912,"Yes, the court explains that, under this provision, an employee who walks out, whether the Union sanctioned it or not, the employee walks out under -- without the -- under this provision, he commits a violation of the contract and could not make --"
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2872.912,2873.957,"Oh, I -- I agree."
1963.102,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2880.669,2881.506,That's the (Inaudible) now.
1963.102,1,17062,alfred_l_scanlan,,2881.506,2881.584,That's right.
1963.102,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2881.584,2892.497,But what I'm suggesting is that your lawsuit stands on a different box from their grievances and your winning the lawsuit --
1963.102,2,40747,richard_f_watt,,3546.878,3551.007,"I think I have just a minute left, Mr. Chief Justice."
1963.102,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3552.878,3556.05,(Inaudible)
1963.102,2,40747,richard_f_watt,,3556.05,3561.314,I think that's the question which has not yet been determined.
1963.102,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3561.314,3562.887,(Inaudible)
1963.102,2,40747,richard_f_watt,,3562.887,3566.737,"It certainly been suggested, there's a real problem there."
1963.102,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3574.741,3576.128,In enforcing (Inaudible)
1963.102,2,40747,richard_f_watt,,3576.128,3578.494,"Right, or whether it couldn't."
1963.102,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3630.049,3632.866,Suppose -- Mr. Chief Justice --
1963.102,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3632.866,3634.639,Just go ahead.
1963.102,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3634.639,3640.787,I'm asking just because I just don't understand quite from the facts here.
1963.102,2,40747,richard_f_watt,,3674.945,3687.373,"I think, although the factual circumstances upon which the arbitrator and the court would base a decision are substantially the same, the precise issue which each must decide is different."
1963.102,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3698.778,3699.677,That's right.
1963.102,2,40747,richard_f_watt,,3727.342,3729.869,I think the court could make a different decision.
1963.102,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3729.909,3756.05,"That would be a little contrary to the rule we've had with reference to primary jurisdiction of the various agencies, and I don't say that it should apply but it's the problem that worry me in connection with the arbitrator deciding some of the same things that would be involved in the right to sue which Congress has given for bridge of the contract, whether rightful or wrongful."
1963.102,2,40747,richard_f_watt,,3756.05,3770.166,But I think the arbitrator decides it in a context in which it is not bound to nearly the same extent by traditional notions as to evidence and as to just what could be introduced in the court of law.
1963.102,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3773.132,3773.223,But it's just a pretty bad --
1963.102,2,40747,richard_f_watt,,3773.223,3774.371,Such as the context of the --
1963.102,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3774.371,3800.974,"Wouldn't it be a pretty bad situation, and I think that's a great responsibility for the rule that's involved of that agency, to have one agency which the government has selected decide the thing one way and award damages to one group on the basis that it means this and the court come in and award damages to the other side for exactly the same thing, wouldn't that be a pretty bad governmental policy?"
1963.102,2,40747,richard_f_watt,,3800.974,3817.857,"I think it might, in a given situation, lead to a certain amount of confusion but I don't think the way the law and the procedures now exist that there's any reason why both the arbitration and the court proceeding should not proceed as it were on parallel rails."
1963.102,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3817.857,3831.875,"What you are asking then, as I understand it, you're not asking the court to say that the employer loses his full right to sue under 301."
1963.102,2,40747,richard_f_watt,,3843.471,3850.376,"In this situation, that could not arise, Mr. Justice Black, because, here, all we are seeking is --"
1963.102,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3850.376,3850.404,"Well, it's --"
1963.102,2,40747,richard_f_watt,,3850.404,3851.169,Reinstatement.
1963.102,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3851.664,3853.923,It's lacking in this case.
1963.102,2,40747,richard_f_watt,,3872.891,3875.693,I don't think we'll deprive them of the right.
