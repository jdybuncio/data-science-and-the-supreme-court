1967.75,0,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,24.91,28.777,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1967.75,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,98.6,105.033,"Mr. Hare, you say you do not concede that they are unconstitutional, do you contend that they are constitutional?"
1967.75,0,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,105.033,105.39,"No, sir."
1967.75,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,262.446,264.89,You mean that the facts are different?
1967.75,0,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,264.89,265.494,"Yes, sir."
1967.75,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,266.189,266.963,And you comment –
1967.75,0,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,266.963,267.437,"Now, here are the --"
1967.75,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,267.437,269.915,Does the record show that they're different?
1967.75,0,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,269.915,270.321,"No, sir."
1967.75,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,271.156,276.186,"Well, on what basis -- on what basis did you arrive at that conclusion?"
1967.75,0,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,276.186,279.607,"Well, the City of Birmingham is a Metropolitan City."
1967.75,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,400.435,404.249,Does he have any jurisdiction at all over the jails?
1967.75,0,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,404.249,419.526,"Only on those jails in cities above 10,000 and most of our -- well, I wouldn't say most of our jails, yes, I guess most of our jails though in cities under 10,000 a great number are anyway."
1967.75,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,435.888,441.067,"Do you concede that it should apply to him as to all jail as 10,000 --"
1967.75,0,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,441.067,449.653,"I concede that he can supervise those or that he can make reports as to those above 10,000, yes, sir."
1967.75,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,688.814,692.853,Or it's a -- I think I understand that.
1967.75,0,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,719.421,720.246,"No, sir."
1967.75,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,720.588,731.719,"You're not telling us -- you're not telling us that Alabama has to determine that it will not apply, I really know whatever it may be?"
1967.75,0,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,731.719,732.629,"Oh, no, sir."
1967.75,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,732.629,732.755,Generally.
1967.75,0,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,732.755,744.987,To the contrary the record shows that the prison -- the chief prison official stated that he would make every attempt to comply with whatever order was decided.
1967.75,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,745.262,747.38,Is that on the state wide basis?
1967.75,0,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,747.38,748.221,Oh!
1967.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,779.425,787.758,"Mr. Hare, do you draw a line between “racial discrimination” and “racial segregation?”"
1967.75,0,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,787.758,788.069,"Yes, sir."
1967.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,789.24,790.6,At this late date?
1967.75,0,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,790.6,790.844,"Yes, sir."
1967.75,1,29010,justice_bernnan,,2037.808,2042.832,"Well, actually Mr. Hare it's a very explicit sentence."
1967.75,2,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,2046.925,2047.981,"Yes, sir."
1967.75,3,29010,justice_bernnan,,2047.981,2049.286,Surely if you can go back there?
1967.75,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,2049.286,2052.641,"Oh, I don't think of that but we have the right to go back to that."
1967.75,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2077.234,2091.945,"Suppose you are right about that, if you decide to use that on that and let the order means but that unless you judge him in the part of [Inaudible]?"
1967.75,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,2110.187,2110.606,It would be --
1967.75,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2110.606,2116.835,-- at the same time fail a good part as decided part of the order?
1967.75,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,2116.835,2137.804,It would be -- It would be – really all we want is that we want the administrative officials in charge of jails or prisons when they are of the opinion that separation at a time will aid and maintain discipline in prison security that they're not violating any judicial order.
1967.75,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2144.973,2151.133,Do you point to your time when you might be a say after five between the Whites and the Blacks in the prisons.
1967.75,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,2151.133,2151.548,It happened in California.
1967.75,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2151.548,2152.826,Is that what you're talking about?
1967.75,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,2152.826,2153.136,"Yes, sir."
1967.75,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2154.319,2162.962,"And you are careful on that one, more than ten were [Inaudible] in need of that situation – a separation temporarily?"
1967.75,4,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,2162.962,2163.41,"Yes, sir."
1967.75,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2204.408,2206.6,"Well, very well."
1967.75,5,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2214.503,2218.968,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.75,6,29010,justice_bernnan,,2362.189,2368.115,"I didn't understand what you meant Mr. Morgan that the officials wrote this order, what do you mean by that?"
1967.75,7,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2395.181,2368.115,"Yes, sir."
1967.75,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2417.838,2432.411,That doesn't tell what the idea about that on the others should do that because the towns like you [Inaudible] with Judge Reeves [Inaudible]
1967.75,7,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2432.411,2438.273,"Well, I -- what is say is Judge Reeves and Judge Johnson in recognition of the discretion that must be vested in prison officials."
1967.75,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2438.273,2439.312,"Well, like habeas corpus."
1967.75,7,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2439.312,2441.398,"Have – yes, has relied upon their discretion."
1967.75,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2558.951,2559.319,Right.
1967.75,7,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2559.319,2564.071,Mr. Bailey had a month consider the -- rather six months as to the other county sheriffs.
1967.75,7,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.186,2679.567,How does this -- does this judgment is on this page?
1967.75,7,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2679.567,2680.805,"Yes, it has."
1967.75,7,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2687.256,2692.411,So this -- this system of recording or anything has never gone in the defense.
1967.75,7,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2692.411,2693.023,"No, sir."
1967.75,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2697.5,2704.408,Had there been any -- any noticeable change in convictions in the jail?
1967.75,7,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2704.408,2707.355,Not to my knowledge but I could represent either way on that Your Honor.
1967.75,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2707.355,2709.017,Did they state it – have we stayed that?
1967.75,7,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2709.017,2710.391,"Yes, you did."
1967.75,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2767.988,2778.493,[Inaudible] is that right?
1967.75,7,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2778.493,2778.897,Yes sir.
1967.75,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2779.918,2781.351,[Inaudible]
1967.75,7,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2781.351,2783.97,I made a little study of that as best we could.
1967.75,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2791.986,2792.837,Walker?
1967.75,7,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2792.837,2794.52,"Walker County, yes."
1967.75,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2827.29,2829.141,They're the ones to be called calabooses?
1967.75,7,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2829.141,2833.283,"They are the ones they call calabooses, yes, sir."
1967.75,7,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2833.744,2838.738,"What had they been doing in those places, do they have a Black and White jail?"
1967.75,7,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2838.738,2851.583,"Well, he could put this way but I record to those – in those small town but I guess they just haven't had a Negro and White man dropped on the same time, but that I don't know.[Laughter]"
1967.75,8,29010,justice_bernnan,,3078.813,3085.449,How would you get back to this suppose first claim [Inaudible] to back proceed from period of action against the [Inaudible]
1967.75,9,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3085.449,3087.943,I think we go back to place him under an injunction first.
1967.75,10,29010,justice_bernnan,,3087.943,3089.169,"Oh, you would go first?"
1967.75,11,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3089.169,3089.341,Yes.
1967.75,12,29010,justice_bernnan,,3089.341,3093.535,You would not regard this as a basis to contempt proceeding?
1967.75,13,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3093.535,3100.095,"I might, I haven't gone that far yet, but I might try to but I think that probably have to go back to injunction."
1967.75,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3100.095,3125.463,"Does the implication to your mind there is apparently drawn an inference that the Court wanted to obtain a little more flexibility before issuing sort of definitive mandate and they use this form, this technique for doing it."
1967.75,13,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3126.612,3126.827,"Yes, sir."
1967.75,13,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3126.827,3134.574,-- I'm just giving you something in return to this as I read the last and entirely clear words in the record.
1967.75,13,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,3134.574,3136.065,I -- I think that's exactly.
1967.75,13,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3168.706,3169.794,Mr. Hare.
1967.75,14,37140,nicholas_s_hare,,3169.794,3170.662,May it please the Court.
1967.75,14,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3231.508,3239.546,I -- I think that – I think your time expired so long ago.
