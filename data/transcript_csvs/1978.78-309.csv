1978.78-309,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,1.03,The case is submitted.
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,92.083,96.655,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-309,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,512.586,519.366,At that point Mr. Roth did the Government appear below?
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,519.366,519.76,I'm sorry Your Honor?
1978.78-309,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,519.76,524.034,Did the United States Government appear below in any capacity at all?
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,524.034,527.494,"Your Honor, the SEC appeared in the Second Circuit, is that --"
1978.78-309,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,527.494,528.794,And they're not here however.
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,528.794,529.705,They are not here Your Honor.
1978.78-309,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,529.705,531.354,Is there any significance in that?
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,531.354,539.325,I believe there is significance Your Honor.
1978.78-309,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,539.325,542.962,"Mr. Roth, I didn't understand what position did they take below, the SEC?"
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,542.962,563.512,Your Honor the District Court had dismissed this action because on the ground that the Section 17 (a) claims of the trustee and SIPC failed to state a claim for relief because Section 17 (a) does not imply remedy for anybody.
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,641.448,644.344,Costumers are not a party to either lawsuit.
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,646.314,648.926,No costumers are party to either lawsuit.
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,654.923,657.988,Have they been paid by SIPC?
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,657.988,665.73,Your Honor I think most of the costumers have been paid off in the liquidation.
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,678.611,682.32,"So the costumers have been paid dollar for dollar, have they?"
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,682.32,686.5,Your Honor I don't know that every single costumer has been paid dollar per dollar.
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,702.997,703.422,I see.
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,703.422,714.557,To make -- those amounts subsequently had been raised and I think if the new amounts had been in effect in 1972 --
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,714.557,714.696,They would've been paid.
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,714.696,720.582,-- they would have been even few that were not paid.
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,753.264,758.556,"Well those costumers who were paid off dollar for dollar, how have they been damaged, are they?"
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,758.556,791.023,"Your Honor there's another lawsuit which Touche Ross is not a party to, but there is a decision in the Second Circuit saying that even costumers who have been paid off in full by the trustee still have causes of action that they can assert for the kinds of damages that are not compensated by SIPC."
1978.78-309,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,806.015,810.077,"Against whom, this action is against whom?"
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,810.077,810.74,I --
1978.78-309,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,810.74,813.919,"This action is against whom, this last one you're talking about?"
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,813.919,838.27,That action was commenced against the New York Stock Exchange and a brokerage firm that the Stock Exchange and SEC tried to have Weis merged with -- in the last days of its existence.
1978.78-309,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,912.597,924.76,"Mr. Roth, was there any cross-petition on the part of Redington or SIPC from the decision of the Court of Appeals?"
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,924.76,925.502,Yes sir.
1978.78-309,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,925.502,925.679,There was?
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,925.679,930.966,"Both -- they both cross-petition, those cross-petition is --"
1978.78-309,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,930.966,931.849,Because it is still pending here.
1978.78-309,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,931.849,932.358,Depending here.
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,932.358,937.791,"As far as we know, yes."
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,937.791,943.702,So the Court of Appeals held that the costumers had a private right of action under 17 (a)?
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,943.702,944.08,Right.
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,944.08,949.864,And that these two respondents here had derivative causes of action only?
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,949.864,949.96,Yes sir.
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,949.96,952.876,"One as a bailee, the other as a subrogate."
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,952.876,955.231,Yes sir.
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1061.01,1067.91,Of course that's quite a different group of people for quite a different kind of damage isn't it?
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1072.536,1073.466,Yes sir.
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1073.466,1081.477,And their problem is that the brokerage firm through some chicanery went busted.
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1103.456,1115.066,Well Your Honor I think what you have done is to state the conclusion in a different way than I have just stated.
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1132.951,1140.121,Not because of anything they purchase or sold on the stock exchanges or elsewhere but just because their broker went busted.
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1140.121,1140.685,That's right.
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1328.32,1356.85,"Well but those cases did they not, and maybe they didn't, involve explicitly conferred statutory remedies and the claim in each of those cases was that in addition to those explicitly conferred statutory remedies there were other implied private causes of action as sanctions against the same category of wrong doing."
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1360.87,1361.787,Well Your Honor --
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1361.787,1381.395,"One would be wrong doing on the part of the issuers of securities that are bought and sold -- purchased and sold by investors in the securities market, and the other -- and quite a different kind of wrong doing in this case which is wrong doing, alleged wrong doing on a part of a brokerage firm vis-à-vis its own costumers."
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1381.395,1412.118,"Your Honor, yes in a way that is so, but I think Your Honor that we should -- I should take you to show you the substitute that Congress thought it was giving costumers in place of the private remedy that was given to purchasers and sellers."
1978.78-309,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1671.588,1673.114,Whether or not there was any fraud?
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1673.114,1675.529,That's exactly right Your Honor.
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1675.529,1687.686,"And of course those committee reports were a little mistaken, at least taking them on their broad statements because costumers did in fact have remedies."
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1692.394,1705.833,"Well Your Honor I think that if you read that -- read those statements in the context that they occurred, I think it's perfectly clear that they were talking about --"
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1705.833,1705.868,The '33 and '34 Act.
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1705.868,1709.138,-- they didn't have any '33 or '34 Act remedies.
1978.78-309,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1709.138,1709.242,Right.
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1709.242,1719.204,"And Senator Musky says, “There still exists a serious gap in our securities laws” and he was talking about that gap."
1978.78-309,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1726.104,1736.482,"But even if your -- even if there is an applied remedy you still would needed SEPA, even if there's an implied remedy for fraud you still would've needed SEPA to take care of the non-fraud bankruptcy situation."
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1736.482,1739.506,"Well, Your Honor that may be."
1978.78-309,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1739.506,1741.679,"Well, it is, isn't it?"
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1745.649,1762.037,"But Your Honor they -- I think that there is still is -- even you take care of the non-fraud situation, you are taking care of the fraud situation."
1978.78-309,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1762.037,1763.175,Well --
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1763.175,1781.151,"In other words Your Honor -- in other words, purchasers and sellers of securities don't have any agency they can go to and get money from if they lose money having relied on misstatements."
1978.78-309,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1781.151,1795.027,Could you explain this -- could you explain this to me -- could you give me an example of a violation of 17 (a) by a broker that would give rise to litigation by a purchaser or seller where he could recover?
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1795.027,1805.681,"Yes sir, in fact Your Honor we have one in the southern district arising out of this very same case -- this very same Weis situation in which we are the defendant."
1978.78-309,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1845.574,1848.576,"They treated the bank as what, a purchaser of securities?"
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1848.576,1850.162,Yes sir.
1978.78-309,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1850.162,1858.313,"I see, but there's no -- there wouldn't be a claim by a common ordinary person just buying and selling stock over the exchange, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1858.529,1878.731,"Well, no Your Honor that's hard to imagine because the purchasers and sellers -- you know a costumer is a purchaser and seller, I mean we're talking about almost the same person but a purchaser and seller is dealing in stocks of General Motors, United States."
1978.78-309,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1882.095,1887.973,"That's right, that's why 18 (a) primarily deals with misstatements that relate to the issue or the security, does it?"
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1887.973,1892.008,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-309,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1900.447,1900.819,I understand that.
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1900.819,1903.849,-- that is filed.
1978.78-309,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1914.195,1925.733,"I find it difficult to imagine a case, if I am a costumer of Weis and I get a false report about Weis' financial situation, I go out and buy General Motor stock, the two just don't fit."
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,1925.733,1933.335,"That's exactly right, Your Honor, and that's part of the crux of this problem Your Honor."
1978.78-309,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2018.427,2023.775,I think you have completed your answer to the question Mr. Roth and your time has expired.
1978.78-309,0,16804,arnold_i_roth,,2023.775,2027.444,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.78-309,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2027.444,2030.83,Mr. Forlenza.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2030.83,2033.533,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
1978.78-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.801,2079.195,"Mr. Forlenza, is there any substantial difference between the position of your client SIPC and the position of Redington, the trustee?"
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2079.195,2081.161,On the merits?
1978.78-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2081.161,2083.213,On the issues before this Court on --
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2083.213,2083.313,I believe not Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1978.78-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.313,2085.076,-- two trustees for this petitioner?
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2085.076,2087.085,No sir.
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2089.706,2092.378,Well except you're here as subrogee --
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2092.378,2093.043,Yes sir.
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2093.043,2095.183,-- and there is that ultimate question --
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2095.183,2095.466,I meant on --
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2095.466,2095.784,-- about whether --
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2095.784,2097.279,-- that's right on the merits of no understanding.
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2097.279,2100.945,(Voice Overlap)-- and your co-counsel represents an --
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2100.945,2101.624,Correct.
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2101.624,2103.37,-- asserted bailee.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2103.37,2103.703,Correct.
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2103.703,2106.632,And there's a question of whether or not he has standing in that capacity.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2106.632,2107.198,Yes but we have no --
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2107.198,2109.569,So to that extent you are different cases.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2109.569,2110.787,That's right on the merits we have no --
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2110.787,2119.961,"Because basically, as I understand the Court of Appeals the judgment is that neither you, your client nor his client has a right of action on his own."
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2119.961,2120.799,That's correct.
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2120.799,2121.292,Isn't that correct?
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2121.292,2123.606,Well actually I don't think they raised it in a footnote --
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2123.606,2125.491,It's only a costumer's right of action.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2125.491,2126.207,That's right.
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2135.479,2137.218,Court held that's a costumer's right of action.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2137.218,2137.712,That's correct.
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2137.712,2142.798,And further held that you and he for different reasons have standing to assert that right of action.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2142.798,2144.151,"That's correct, absolutely."
1978.78-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2144.151,2147.457,And was that the position of the Commission in the Court of Appeals?
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2147.457,2148.781,That's correct.
1978.78-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.772,2158.893,Do you know whether the Commission's brief filed in the Court of Appeals is part of the record here?
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2158.893,2161.152,"I'm not sure it's part of the record, I --"
1978.78-309,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2161.152,2163.035,But they haven't filed their own brief here now.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2163.035,2169.183,"No, and I must say that I take issue with Mr. Roth's contention that their absence is significant."
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2216.762,2217.701,1934 isn't it?
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2217.701,2226.824,"1934, I think this Court has said time and again that congressional silence, particularly when there is no pending or proposed legislation, is evidence of very little."
1978.78-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.824,2232.563,Well you say the question is why should costumers be denied this right of action?
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2237.293,2241.034,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, my point was addressed to the arguments that Mr. Roth was making."
1978.78-309,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2259.06,2262.496,But you're not contending that it's an expressed cause of action?
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2262.496,2267.061,"Absolutely not, so the question is, should this Court imply a private right of action."
1978.78-309,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2269.843,2283.365,"Here again, we've said -- we've implied it before from time to time, but we perhaps haven't always followed it that Congress knows how to state a cause of action."
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2283.365,2286.641,Mr. Justice --
1978.78-309,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2286.641,2293.812,You have to rest on the general contours of what we said in Cort against Ash and some of the other cases.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2293.812,2307.491,"Absolutely, and the fact of the matter is that I think in Cort v. Ash, the Court recognized that there are times when Congress creates the duty, does not address the remedy other than placing in the hands of the Commission for example."
1978.78-309,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2315.391,2329.051,But then in the Piper case which is more recently certainly indicated that some necessity must be shown that it's necessary to do it or else there is no remedy whatever.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2329.051,2354.585,"Well, on the question of necessity, let me say this, I think that as to the necessary supplement to Commission action which is the phraseology used by this Court in several occasions, there is no question that the Commission nor the exchanges has ever intended to have the resources or ability to conduct the kinds of audits that are required to expose brokers fraud in hiding in that capital violation."
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2580.797,2582.205,That is in 1970?
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2582.205,2585.332,1970 with the enactment of SEPA.
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2585.332,2590.586,"The Section 18 remedy was part of the original '34 Act, wasn't it?"
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2590.586,2591.494,That's correct.
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2614.554,2616.06,Anymore they did under Section 10?
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2616.06,2620.963,"10 (b) as this Court specifically pointed out, neither Congress nor the Commission considered the question."
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2620.963,2621.119,Right.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2621.119,2623.326,The same is true with 14 (a) under Borak.
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2623.326,2624.422,Right.
1978.78-309,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.422,2637.283,"Mr. Forlenza, on the question whether 17 (a) is directly intended to benefit costumers, your opponent argues well the real purpose of it is to help the SEC with its enforcement function."
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2656.284,2663.554,"It's the latter Mr. Justice Stevens, in addition, I'm not sure that in this kind of case reliance in its classic sense is really an element."
1978.78-309,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2663.703,2665.953,But reliance is an element of an 18 (a) cause of action.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2665.953,2667.203,That's correct.
1978.78-309,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2676.919,2680.808,"And the failure of the accountants to catch it and the failure of the SEC to catch it too, of course."
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2680.808,2688.537,"Well, but again the point is upon whom is there duty evolved."
1978.78-309,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.537,2689.173,Pardon me?
1978.78-309,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2689.656,2691.334,Federal exchange to catch it (Voice Overlap).
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2691.334,2702.623,"Yes, but the fact of the matter is, the mechanism set out by Congress initially in the Commission thereafter is that the Commission doesn't have the ability to pick up these kinds of deceptive practices."
1978.78-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2732.031,2734.312,Because the exchange doesn't have the personnel?
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2734.312,2740.468,"The personnel, the resources, the expertise, if you will, in terms of these kinds of detailed audits."
1978.78-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2740.468,2740.767,How about the --
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2740.767,2741.607,They can't be --
1978.78-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2741.607,2742.647,How about the SEC?
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2742.647,2759.205,"I think the same, except for the expertise question, I mean the fact of the matter is, if I may Mr. Justice Rehnquist, they can hardly be criticized if in fact the machinery set up by Congress is such they were not intended to take on the function that the independent auditor voluntarily assumes."
1978.78-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2760.01,2780.519,"Well I wasn't taking it as a criticism, but I was thinking if there are any number of criminal statutes in the country and many under staffed U.S. attorney's offices, and I don't suppose someone would come here making a claim that the fact that there aren't sufficient resources allocated to the U.S. attorneys gives an implied private right of action because the U.S. attorneys are understaffed."
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2780.519,2789.251,"Well, but that reasoning has been applied under the '34 Act and securities laws and again I point to 10 (b) which is a criminal statute, 14 (a) which is a criminal statute."
1978.78-309,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2800.561,2803.019,And you rely on Borak for that?
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2803.019,2808.114,"Rely on Borak, Cort v. Ash I don't think this Court has said otherwise."
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2808.114,2810.155,Going back to the Safety Appliance Act.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2810.155,2810.705,That's correct.
1978.78-309,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2836.476,2837.678,"Mr. Forlenza, may I ask one --"
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2837.678,2837.736,Yes sir.
1978.78-309,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2837.736,2839.036,-- other question?
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2852.137,2856.685,"Well, other than state causes as Mr. Roth addressed to, there are just criminal with full --"
1978.78-309,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2856.685,2858.36,Well what would their crime be?
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2860.237,2872.02,"Yes, I believe Section 32 of the '34 Act makes it a crime to violate any of the filing statutes or regulations, so that there actually there would be a criminal --"
1978.78-309,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2872.02,2872.761,Against the accounting.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2872.761,2880.897,"Against the accounting firm, but as I've said before the Court has noted that criminal sanctions just don't work often and this is the reason for applying a private cause of action."
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2880.897,2887.799,"Well, might not the trustee, as trustee have a private cause of action under state law against the accounting firm?"
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2887.799,2892.209,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I'm not sure of the answer and Mr. Colbeck's going to address the state law question if I may differ to him."
1978.78-309,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2892.209,2893.341,Right.
1978.78-309,1,37906,philip_r_forlenza,,2893.341,2911.223,"I would like to point out that there are only certain of the costumers in this lawsuit that Mr. Roth has made reference to and that has been stayed, and this Court, if it decides in favor of affirmance, I believe that case would probably be dismissed because between the two of us, we cover all the basis."
1978.78-309,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2957.954,2968.188,Very well.
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,2969.327,2973.123,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.78-309,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3159.206,3165.714,"You would have a -- you do have, do you not, a cause of action under the law of the State of New York?"
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3165.714,3166.417,According to Touche Ross --
1978.78-309,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3166.417,3167.897,As trustee not as what --
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3167.897,3173.612,"-- as trustee, we have a derivative cause on behalf of Weis, as a corporate entity."
1978.78-309,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3173.612,3173.881,Right.
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3173.881,3178.907,That is not a cause of action on behalf of the hundred costumers who have lost the million dollars.
1978.78-309,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3178.907,3180.868,"No, but it's on behalf on the corporation."
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3180.868,3181.741,That's correct.
1978.78-309,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3181.741,3184.256,If it is a corporation or partnership whatever it was.
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3184.256,3189.812,We have a negligence action and perhaps a breach of contract action under state law.
1978.78-309,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3196.033,3204.155,"Whom except derivatively, if they get -- if you recover, the corporation would have more money to pay them their claims."
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3204.155,3209.079,"Oh, but that would be money that would be paid to general creditors and not necessarily the costumers."
1978.78-309,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3265.101,3275.613,"I thought wouldn't the effect of those provisions be that if you win this case you no longer have a state cause of action, because this would be your exclusive remedy?"
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3275.613,3292.816,"They said in the papers filed both in our state court action and with the District Court when they made their motion to dismiss, we had a cause of action based on negligence per se in the accountant's breach in failure to follow the provisions of Rule 17a-5."
1978.78-309,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3305.034,3313.363,"Well, I take that you don't finally accept your opponent's word in the lawsuit as to whether a cause of action exists, do you?"
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3313.363,3320.719,"No I don't necessarily Your Honor, but I think that is an issue that may exist in state court actions."
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3570.502,3577.655,"Suppose you're right there's this so called private right of action, what are the elements that your client would have to prove?"
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3577.655,3588.202,"In our case, we would have to prove duty on behalf of Touche Ross breach of that duty and causation, the elements of any lawsuits."
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3588.309,3592.247,And causation would amount to what?
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3592.247,3612.912,"Well, in our view, our prima facie showing of causation would require us to show that Touche Ross through its negligence or gross negligence or recklessness failed to detect fraud which had it discovered in a timely fashion, it would have had to alert regulatory authorities to the existence of it."
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3621.935,3634.159,But in no event does either the regulatory agency or your clients or anybody else have specifically to rely on the accuracy of the statements that were filed.
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3634.159,3638.157,"Well, the regulatory authorities do rely, our costumers --"
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3638.157,3646.675,"Well you don't -- they don't rely, they just -- you wouldn't have to prove for example that they examined these statements and relied on them?"
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3646.675,3649.959,"No, that's correct, they rely on them to the --"
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3649.959,3651.983,So your answers is nobody has to rely on them?
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3651.983,3667.185,"No, they don't have to rely, the regulatory authorities rely on the fact that the auditor has been there has supposedly performed the minimally acceptable steps required in the Rule 17a-5 audit and has discovered no irregularity."
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3667.185,3677.829,"To that extent they were there and for all anybody knows, they did go through some steps, they filed some wrong statements that's how I take it."
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3681.815,3684.093,"My clients are the costumers, we're the bailee --"
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3684.093,3688.321,"I understand, I understand you know -- but you don't have to rely on anything with respect to these statements."
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3688.321,3696.356,"No, in fact at the time in question, there was no congressional requirement or regulatory requirement of the SEC."
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3699.185,3702.841,Would a purchaser of securities have to rely on them?
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3702.841,3705.461,A purchaser of license securities would.
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3711.989,3718.02,Except that costumers are in a better shape than buyers.
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3718.02,3722.117,They're in better shape than buyers because Congress --
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3722.117,3726.441,In so far as being able to impose any liability on the accountants?
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3726.441,3731.153,In those rare case when they suffer a loss because of a brokerage house failure.
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3747.905,3753.199,"But the buyer can recover from the accountant, but he's going to have to prove some reliance on the statements."
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3753.199,3756.886,"He's going to have to prove reliance, that's correct because he's in a different category."
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3758.929,3769.651,"I know, I know he's different but so your answer is yes, the costumer is in a better position and with respect to reliance than the buyer?"
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3769.651,3782.531,"When there has been a brokerage house failure, the costumer through the trustee, has to show that the system could not work because the accountants failed to alert the regulatory authorities to the existence of fraud and falsement financial statement."
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3782.531,3788.929,"But if he's both a costumer and a buyer and sues in both capacities, he has to prove reliance in one and not the other."
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3788.929,3794.464,"Well, I don't think he can't sue in both those capacities at the same time."
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3796.649,3801.815,"Do you mean about the same thing, he can certainly could be a buyer, couldn't he?"
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3801.815,3805.815,"Well, you could conceivably have someone who is both the Weis costumer and a Weis shareholder."
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3805.815,3806.233,Exactly.
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3806.233,3808.972,"Yes, he'd be dealing in two different capacities."
1978.78-309,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3811.818,3816.226,17 and 18.
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3816.226,3827.123,But tell me you're saying that -- what you're really saying is that there's implied cause of action that the Act provides a cause of action for you.
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3843.09,3854.534,"Congress wanted these costumers -- Congress wanted innocent, the ignorant man in the street, the most naïve person imaginable to deal in the nation's capital markets."
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3856.294,3859.382,"There are an awful lot of ignorant buyers around, aren't there?"
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3859.382,3867.681,"Well, that may be Your Honor, but I suggest those ignorant buyers are unable to sustain their causes of action because they're unable to prove reliance and fraud."
1978.78-309,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3867.681,3872.025,"Why shouldn't -- I'm just asking, why shouldn't costumers have to prove them?"
1978.78-309,2,31262,james_b_kobak_jr,,3872.025,3886.476,Because Congress wanted the costumer to be able to rely on the regulatory authorities to do that for them and not have to make his own sophisticated analysis of a broker's financial statements.
1978.78-309,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3886.943,3887.641,Thank you gentlemen.
