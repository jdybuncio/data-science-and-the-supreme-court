1996.96-667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.808,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-667, United States v. Hyde."
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,89.539,92.311,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,259.672,274.61,"Mr. Feldman, there seems to be a certain amount of interchangeability of these terms in appellate opinions, acceptance of a plea, or acceptance of a plea agreement."
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,294.675,298.909,"I think... Your Honor, I haven't been able to get... let me put it this way."
1996.96-667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.056,316.019,"Well, and how often is it that the district court has to separate the decision?"
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,316.019,339.274,"As I said, I think it's in every case in which the Government agrees to drop certain charges in response for the defendant's... in exchange for the defendant's guilty plea, and when you have that kind of a plea agreement, under the Sentencing Guideline... under the Federal Rules of Procedure the district court is permitted to defer a decision on whether to accept that plea agreement, and under the guidelines it says that the district court is required to do so."
1996.96-667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,439.334,454.475,"And if at the end of the day the judge decides not to accept the plea agreement by virtue of what the judge reads in the presentence report, the rules permit the defendant to withdraw from the plea."
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,454.475,454.845,That's right.
1996.96-667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,489.407,499.755,Do we take this case on the assumption that there was no fair and just reason for the withdrawal within the meaning of the rule?
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,499.755,500.156,--That's right.
1996.96-667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,522.549,525.32,"Mr. Feldman, there's one difference."
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,535.758,536.928,Right.
1996.96-667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,542.103,542.921,That's right.
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,542.921,545.233,"I mean, that's contemplated by the rules that that's going to happen."
1996.96-667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,568.53,570.881,How does it work with the Government?
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,648.873,655.608,"I would agree, and actually I think respondent in his brief agrees that the Government would be free to withdraw during that period of time."
1996.96-667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,655.608,657.128,"Oh, wait... the opposite."
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,657.128,657.899,I beg your pardon?
1996.96-667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,657.899,659.512,"Oh, I... yes, but your position--"
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,659.512,659.719,And we also--
1996.96-667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,659.719,662.811,--is the Government is not free to withdraw during that time.
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,662.811,665.704,--Our position is that neither party is free to withdraw--
1996.96-667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,665.704,666.245,Okay.
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,674.198,679.684,--I don't think there's any thing in the rules... there certainly is nothing in the rules that addresses the Government's attempt to with--
1996.96-667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,679.684,684.976,So why shouldn't the Government be free to withdraw if there's nothing in the rules that addresses it?
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,684.976,692.57,--I think it's really just based on the contract analogy of plea-bargaining that the Court has referred to a number of times and the rule in Santabello that the Government does have to--
1996.96-667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,692.57,695.333,Santabello wasn't a Federal case.
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,695.333,703.109,"--That's correct, but generally the Government does have to fulfill the undertakings that it assumes in connection with a plea agreement."
1996.96-667,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,703.109,704.179,Why is it a contract analogy?
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,715.896,724.513,"I think... yes, and I think in fact even aside from whether there's detriment or not there's been an exchange of promises on both sides, and I think it's just as binding on both sides but--"
1996.96-667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,724.513,726.104,It seems to me you're overlooking one thing.
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,736.06,741.904,"--I think generally the Government's... I tell you, things work out... I think things work out a little bit differently."
1996.96-667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,748.479,754.67,"But all I'm suggesting is if it's an equal balance, both rights are the same, the Government does have some right to withdraw, then."
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,754.67,756.843,--The Government may be able to withdraw under those circumstances.
1996.96-667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.712,803.003,I'm a little puzzled as to your position.
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,810.987,811.608,--No.
1996.96-667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.369,814.61,Because I thought you suggested--
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,814.61,826.048,"I think what the Government is... I think the Government has always an obligation to the court to be frank, and to bring to the court any facts that may have come to its attention that maybe it didn't even know before."
1996.96-667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,863.682,870.818,"--Can you go back for a second to Justice O'Connor's question, because this is another point I'm not certain about from the briefs, and from having read this."
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,892.362,893.053,That's correct.
1996.96-667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,893.053,893.592,Okay.
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,921.65,922.78,I think it contemplates--
1996.96-667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,922.78,926.904,"Now, if you decide we're not going to reinstate the indictment, that's your decision."
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,927.735,928.804,"--The... actually, the one--"
1996.96-667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,928.804,934.07,So you can make me take the telephone count by changing the indictment and going... can't you?
1996.96-667,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,934.07,935.619,--I guess ordinarily the--
1996.96-667,1,33050,jonathan_d_soglin,,1465.872,1481.483,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-667,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1505.889,1514.285,"Well, do you have to go against the text of Rule 11(e) to do that, to take your position, and the reason I ask the question is this."
1996.96-667,1,33050,jonathan_d_soglin,,1561.246,1561.696,That's correct.
1996.96-667,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1561.696,1582.639,"Okay, and under the... in the following sentence, if the agreement is of the type specified in subdivision (B), the court may advise... shall advise the defendant that if the court does not accept the recommendation... i.e., that which is part of the agreement... the defendant nevertheless has no right to withdraw."
1996.96-667,1,33050,jonathan_d_soglin,,1620.683,1622.896,I don't think so.
1996.96-667,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3295.159,3298.27,I just had one point I wanted to make.
1996.96-667,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3320.907,3325.078,What's the best textual support for your position?
1996.96-667,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3329.502,3348.814,"I guess... it's hard for me to answer, because I do think there are several of them, but I think 32(e) would be rendered a nullity in a... most cases if the Ninth Circuit's view were right, and I don't think that rendering... I think that that would be the strongest one in my view."
1996.96-667,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3355.139,3356.911,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
