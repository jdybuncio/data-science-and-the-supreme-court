1964.82,1,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,1782.868,1798.724,"Mr. Justice White, I'm not contending if that's a reason, just an example to show discrimination does exist in other fields in favor of the military as they are now claiming there is some discrimination against them in this area."
1964.82,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1952.726,1953.966,Instead of reform?
1964.82,1,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,1953.966,1957.024,"A reform, I beg your pardon."

1964.82,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1960.22,1962.296,Ameliorating statute?
1964.82,1,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,1962.296,1969.145,It is because Texas did not allow the military to vote at all.
1964.82,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2048.456,2051.982,(Inaudible)
1964.82,1,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,2051.982,2073.01,"I do because now the reason given by the legislature and given in the opinion of our Supreme Court, was that this was to prevent a concentration of military vote in a particular area, in a particular county, whereby the military might take over the local government."
1964.82,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2087.428,2089.833,I thought we had the largest numbers?
1964.82,1,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,2089.833,2090.699,I can't answer that.
1964.82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2094.06,2097.984,(Inaudible) that many more than we do?
1964.82,1,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,2097.984,2098.423,Sir?
1964.82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2098.423,2102.963,I suppose Hawaii proportionately has many more military than we do.0
1964.82,1,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,2102.963,2103.569,That couldn't be.
1964.82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2106.227,2123.379,But the (Inaudible) -- the -- I take it since this applies only to those who have made Texas as domicile of the 162 odd thousands stationed there at any one time.

1964.82,1,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,2139.87,2143.823,"Well, that -- I think that would be a question of intent."
1964.82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2143.823,2152.892,"In other words, they've given up whatever that may have been their place of abode in their home state and have decided that henceforth it shall be Texas."
1964.82,1,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,2152.892,2153.776,That's right --
1964.82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2153.776,2154.444,But that must be I think --

1964.82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2154.964,2161.531,-- a small number isn't it to -- proportionate at least of 162 odd thousands are maybe stationed there.
1964.82,1,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,2161.531,2170.259,"At the present time under the present state of the law, I don't think -- don't know the exact percentage of -- that have acquired domicile."
1964.82,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2180.265,2189.48,"I mean, Texas with all its appeal, and I take it the -- most military men are looking forward to getting out and go back home."
1964.82,1,27774,hawthorne_phillips,,2189.48,2195.771,In a good many instances and of course there are a lot of military that do retire in the areas of the places --

1964.82,3,46642,wayne_windle,,4892.543,4896.604,"No sir, it surely is not."
1964.82,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4944.599,4947.901,And what about this -- what about this situation.
1964.82,3,46642,wayne_windle,,4965.069,4968.927,(Inaudible) that was one of the things mentioned in there.
1964.82,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4968.927,4969.401,That's right.
1964.82,3,46642,wayne_windle,,4983.275,4988.718,"If those men were qualified voters while they were there, they have the right to do that."
