2008.08-6,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.62,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-6, District Attorney's Office for the Third Judicial District v. Osborne."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,8.899,15.93,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State of Alaska fully recognizes the importance of DNA evidence."
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,57.069,62.349,"Well, he's -- he's not -- at this point all he's doing is seeking evidence."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,90.009,108.094,"Well, Your Honor, the -- Mr. Osborne's case is comparable to Balisok v. Edwards, where the Petitioner was seeking damages for -- as a result of a biased hearing in prison."
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,108.094,108.656,Right.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,129.148,131.008,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,144.61,145.252,No.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,167.71,172.195,--But this -- his request is -- is simply a discovery request.
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,180.064,185.22,"Well, he's got to because he doesn't know whether he has any evidence of actual innocence at this point."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,185.22,190.764,"--But he -- to assert a claim of actual innocence, he doesn't need to have the result of a DNA test, and--"
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,190.764,191.793,He's not asserting it.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,195.404,203.196,"--But the -- this evidence has a singular relevance, and his -- his true intent is to -- is to assert--"
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,203.196,203.539,No.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,203.539,204.194,--a claim of innocence.
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,204.194,208.554,"He has a singular objective in getting the evidence, but we don't know what the evidence means."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,211.677,218.345,"That's true, Your Honor, but what this represents, what his request represents, is a discovery request."
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,218.345,238.665,"Well, it's a -- that's -- that's a fair way of putting it, but what he -- I think ultimately his strongest argument or his -- his basic argument is, this evidence is potentially so important that the State has no valid interest in keeping me at least from seeing it; i.e., testing it."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,250.801,259.282,"Well, the -- the State does have an interest in -- in insisting that Mr. Osborne follow the established procedures."
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,259.282,260.327,"Oh, that -- that may be."
2008.08-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,261.766,270.372,Would the other side concede the premise that he doesn't say that this is going to exonerate him?
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,306.404,307.48,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.08-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,307.48,308.981,"Well, which is he doing here?"
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,310.716,315.431,"Well, he hasn't -- he has never really asserted that he is actually innocent."
2008.08-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.649,337.361,"So -- so it's not a constitutional claim of entitlement to evidence which he asserts will prove his innocence, but rather a constitutional claim to evidence which might or then might not prove his innocence?"
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,337.891,339.92,"--He -- he has hedged, Your Honor."
2008.08-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,339.92,351.525,"Perhaps we should let the -- let Osborne, Osborne's attorney, address that question, because you're not really equipped to answer for the other side."
2008.08-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.525,356.056,"--Well, we were -- we're assuming the premise, though, in -- in the questioning."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,356.056,364.288,"Well, as this case started, Your Honor, Mr. Osborne was asserting that it would establish his -- his innocence."
2008.08-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,382.295,391.292,There was -- there was evidence in -- at his trial at the state of the art at that time.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,395.881,401.567,"--Justice Ginsburg, at trial the State performed what is known as DQ alpha testing."
2008.08-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,401.567,405.101,"And that was not the state of the art at the time, was it?"
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,405.101,415.267,"That's my understanding, that the RFLP testing was a much more discriminating type of -- would yield a much more discriminating result than the DQ Alpha."
2008.08-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.267,416.0,He didn't ask for that.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,416.0,417.095,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.08-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,417.095,422.215,But -- but when did the current technology become available?
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,425.717,428.088,"I'm not certain about that, Your Honor."
2008.08-6,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,437.649,446.443,Does the State routinely keep evidence of the sort Osborne is seeking available?
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,449.816,454.375,I can't answer whether the State has a policy.
2008.08-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,470.604,471.602,What now?
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,551.444,578.933,"Justice Breyer, the State doesn't have an obligation to provide this evidence to him because there is no -- a -- prisoners have no Federal right to postconviction relief, and the State of Alaska has provided procedures by which -- which Mr. Osborne if he chose to use them could make available the evidence that he seeks."
2008.08-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,581.152,581.651,--Would you explain that--
2008.08-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,581.651,585.226,"Is there any reason to think that if, in fact -- sorry."
2008.08-6,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,585.226,586.743,Justice Breyer.
2008.08-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,586.743,597.756,"--Just to clarify his statement, he said that the State of Alaska provides a means for him to get at this information; but if it did, I think we wouldn't be here."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,601.284,602.785,That's correct.
2008.08-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,602.785,617.386,"So what -- you say -- I mean, this whole controversy is whether the State is obliged to give him this information; but you're saying it's simply that he picked the wrong procedure."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,629.696,631.318,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.08-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,686.921,700.227,"Has there been any case in Alaska where a defendant postconviction was, in fact, able to get DNA testing under the procedure you just described?"
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,700.227,720.345,"Well, Your Honor, there's -- there was one case and it's cited in the yellow brief, Patterson v. State, that a prisoner did apply in court and was granted access to the DNA evidence, but then it came to pass that the evidence had been destroyed by -- by that time."
2008.08-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,729.969,745.897,"Can you give me some idea of how many cases there are in, say, the last 10 years in which in State postconviction proceedings the convicted prisoner has asked for DNA evidence?"
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,745.897,748.802,I believe--
2008.08-6,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.802,749.255,Three?
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,750.506,773.651,"--Less -- we did an informal search and found seven cases where there were actual requests; and I -- I believe that five of them involved court cases, the one that I have just mentioned where the relief was granted, and I believe the remaining are pending decision."
2008.08-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,773.651,780.213,"Of course, that -- that relief would -- would require him to assert his innocence, wouldn't it?"
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,794.391,794.766,Well--
2008.08-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,794.766,795.301,It might help me.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,796.829,811.589,--That's -- prisoners have never been able to postconviction simply seek over the counter the evidence that -- that was used in their earlier -- in their--
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,811.589,815.792,I don't know that they're -- they're arguing with you on that score.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,865.865,867.332,--But Justice Souter--
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,867.332,868.864,"Well, first tell me whether that's correct or not."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,868.864,869.863,--That--
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,869.863,872.753,He doesn't know what the test is going to -- he doesn't know what the test is going to show; so--
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,872.753,873.377,--That is correct.
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,873.377,877.171,--he cannot say that it requires vacation of the conviction; isn't that correct?
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,877.171,878.36,That is correct.
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,878.36,878.874,Okay.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,878.874,884.28,"But, but -- but only Mr. Osborne knows whether he is innocent."
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,885.216,888.76,But Mr. Osborne doesn't know what that evidence is going to show.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,888.76,889.513,--If--
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,889.513,890.605,He hasn't tested it.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,890.605,891.712,--That -- that's correct.
2008.08-6,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,891.712,900.037,"Whether -- whether he believes he's innocent or whether he doesn't believe he's innocent, he can walk into court, as I understand it, and say, I am absolutely innocent."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,909.895,916.485,"But if he is innocent, then he does know the -- the result of the testing."
2008.08-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,916.485,920.467,"--Well, I thought you said the State has -- has indeed granted a habeas request."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,930.633,936.428,"Well, I think actually, Your Honor, it did not, because in that case he never asserted his innocence."
2008.08-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.563,957.079,It is the case you are referring to.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,959.497,966.809,"--Well, in -- in Mr. Osborne's first postconviction relief case that was decided in -- are you talking about the--"
2008.08-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,966.809,967.23,No.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,976.834,977.302,"--Oh, okay."
2008.08-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.692,979.756,--but for the fact that it no longer existed.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,993.485,993.969,Right.
2008.08-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,994.452,1003.76,"I know your time is up, but I really have only one question this morning and I would like to have a chance to ask it, and I am trying to clear away some undergrowth."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,1053.194,1060.771,"--Because, Your Honor, the State of Alaska has a procedure that was not invoked in the--"
2008.08-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1060.771,1065.205,I -- I -- there I -- that's the undergrowth I tried to clear away.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,1102.379,1108.844,"--Because, Your Honor, the State of Alaska has a procedure that would enable him to obtain that evidence."
2008.08-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1108.844,1109.328,No.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,1134.082,1146.674,"With respect, Your Honor, that was the test they applied in that case, but that is not the test that would apply if Mr. Osborne were to file a new postconviction relief application asserting that he is actually innocent."
2008.08-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1152.406,1153.903,And then -- a different -- then they'd give it to him?
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,1153.903,1154.917,Pardon me.
2008.08-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1154.917,1158.184,"In other words, all he has to do is file a new piece of paper tomorrow, and he gets the DNA?"
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,1158.184,1158.652,Right.
2008.08-6,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1161.636,1162.057,Okay.
2008.08-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1162.057,1163.792,But you said something significant.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,1182.268,1187.705,"If he doesn't allege his actual innocence, Your Honor, then this is really an empty exercise, a fishing expedition."
2008.08-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1194.262,1204.585,"You gave the one case in which in the habeas in Alaska the court granted access to DNA, but the evidence wasn't there."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,1217.52,1229.016,"My -- my -- there were -- as I said, there were seven cases; And my understanding is there have -- has not been a denial."
2008.08-6,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1229.016,1233.325,"Well, you told us it was granted in one case."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,1234.932,1236.043,There -- well--
2008.08-6,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.043,1239.245,I thought you said they were still pending.
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,1239.245,1241.792,--There were -- there are four or five that are pending.
2008.08-6,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1249.49,1251.067,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-6,0,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,1254.363,1254.862,Thank you.
2008.08-6,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1254.862,1271.934,Mr. Katyal.
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1271.934,1280.696,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit created a novel constitutional right by extending Brady to the postconviction setting."
2008.08-6,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1327.382,1328.676,What -- what were the two confessions?
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1332.629,1335.363,There are two confessions to the parole authorities.
2008.08-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1352.682,1358.916,"Yes, but isn't it true that we've had DNA cases where the person has been found innocent despite the fact they confessed?"
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1358.916,1361.022,--That is -- that is correct.
2008.08-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.022,1363.241,How do we know this isn't one of those cases?
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1363.241,1379.736,"Well, I am not quite sure that we have had any situation like this, in which you have had so many different facts all together that -- that suggested both that he -- that he's guilty and that -- and you are talking about a confession that's taking place years after."
2008.08-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1436.587,1446.161,Am I right in understanding that the State has agreed that if this evidence is exonerating; that this evidence potentially could exonerate him?
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1446.161,1447.881,--The -- the State has so agreed.
2008.08-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1447.881,1448.411,Yes.
2008.08-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1448.411,1456.719,"And is it true that all he has to do is file a piece of paper in the court that says: Whatever I said before, I did it under pressure; I am innocent?"
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1459.905,1463.123,"Well, it is -- it is not clear to me under State law."
2008.08-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1490.83,1496.0,You think we could attach that to the new constitutional right that we invent?
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1504.247,1533.767,"--Our position, Justice Scalia, is that there is no constitutional right to DNA, but if -- were the Court inclined to find one and locate it somewhere in Brady or the procedural due process clause, something we think which would be very difficult to do, but were it -- if that were the Court's inclination, absolutely, it should at least mirror the Federal statute and the -- and the rock solid requirements of 3600, which do require that perjury -- that perjury statement to be made in order to--"
2008.08-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1533.767,1548.569,"Do you think there's a constitutional right to establish innocence in some cases where there is new and -- evidence that could not previously have been discovered, that has a high likelihood of exonerating?"
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1548.569,1551.899,"--Well, this Court has struggled with that and so far has said no."
2008.08-6,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1554.27,1555.88,I'm asking for your position.
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1555.88,1562.486,Our position is that the logic of this Court's precedents is that there is no right at present to actual innocence.
2008.08-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1562.486,1570.407,"Mr. Katyal, the -- the right that they're asserting may be located not in procedural, but in substantive due process."
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1629.581,1649.23,"The United States wouldn't -- wouldn't have an interest as a -- would -- would generally permit as a matter of prosecutorial ethics access to -- if the United States knew that there was some exculpatory material that it had within its purview, it would turn that over."
2008.08-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1651.152,1653.196,"Well, you know, prisoners say all sorts of things."
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1666.661,1674.328,"--Well, I think that it would -- it would have to -- if it adopted such a rule and allowed the talking in any situation--"
2008.08-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1674.328,1675.284,Why wouldn't it?
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1675.284,1677.595,"--Well, Let me talk about DNA, for example."
2008.08-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1677.595,1678.718,"Why do you need a rule, I guess is what I'm saying?"
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1678.718,1679.561,Let me talk about DNA.
2008.08-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1687.56,1688.043,"Oh, okay--"
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1688.043,1688.62,--so that's why--
2008.08-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1688.62,1695.213,"--Are you starting with the premise that the United States would not have a legitimate interest in my hypothetical in saying, you can't even talk to him?"
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1695.213,1708.315,"--Well, the -- it depends on the circumstances of the hypothetical and whether or not there's some -- whether or not it would open up the floodgates, I guess, to other requests and so on."
2008.08-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1711.033,1722.498,"Well, let's assume that if you let this guy talk to -- X's lawyer talk to this guy, other individuals may say, boy, I can have my moment in the sun, too; I'm going to claim this."
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1733.351,1741.673,"--It's possible, because there is -- it may be that as a policy matter they will allow it, but as a matter of constitutional law, Justice Souter, this Court has repeatedly said--"
2008.08-6,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1741.673,1742.581,I haven't gotten to the constitutional law yet.
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1747.827,1749.733,"--Again, there may be because of floodgates or other reasons."
2008.08-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1750.638,1752.342,You mentioned the floodgates.
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1759.088,1760.604,"--Seven thus far, Justice Stevens."
2008.08-6,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1764.212,1764.633,Yes.
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1764.633,1768.836,"--for all 50 States, there would really be, I think, quite a dramatically different result."
2008.08-6,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1768.836,1775.395,"And especially, I would assume, one constitutional right in which you do not even have to assert your innocence."
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1775.395,1776.394,Precisely.
2008.08-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1796.386,1797.307,Why can't you do this?
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1818.329,1822.19,"Because, Justice Breyer, that's not the way this Court approaches due process questions."
2008.08-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1827.794,1832.824,I'm not saying every instance in which there are outliers is unconstitutional.
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1848.476,1865.685,"But you enter the thicket of practical problems, it seems to me, Justice Breyer, when you do that, because the 44 States that have these statutes do it in a variety of different ways with respect to perjury requirements, felonies versus misdemeanors, who gets access, who pays for it, do they get lawyers."
2008.08-6,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1868.871,1877.508,"So the constitutional right is bring yourself within any one of them, unless that any one of them is a real outlier, which you can make as an argument that you will never win."
2008.08-6,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1877.508,1884.32,"--Were that the case, then Alaska itself would be within that framework, because it already has a process in place."
2008.08-6,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1884.742,1885.491,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,1890.926,1892.704,Thank you very much.
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1912.589,1924.817,"Well, there was a more reliable one at the time of trial as well, and his counsel made the tactical decision not to use it because, I assume, she was concerned it would show his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."
2008.08-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1924.817,1928.178,Which apparently he had told her about.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,1928.178,1934.301,"The test actually, the RFLP test I assume you are referring to, is not actually more reliable."
2008.08-6,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1955.448,1962.193,But what was the reason that -- that Respondent's counsel provided for not requesting that test?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,1962.193,1975.046,"Respondent's counsel said that she was doing it for strategic reasons, although I think it is quite important that Mr. Osborne at all points said he wanted the testing, okay, and that his counsel rejected his advice."
2008.08-6,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1979.89,1989.604,"Well, let's assume for the sake of argument that there is some constitutional right to obtain DNA evidence for testing postconviction."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2016.767,2025.011,"Justice Alito, first -- first of all, he was never asked in this pleading to assert his actual innocence."
2008.08-6,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2026.606,2029.215,You think that -- you think that's a novel idea that never occurred to him?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2029.215,2029.948,"--Well, no, no."
2008.08-6,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2045.893,2046.345,Under oath?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2049.644,2050.97,"--No, because it wasn't required."
2008.08-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2072.945,2073.478,"Well, he just doesn't--"
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2073.478,2076.991,"That is what the Innocence Protection Act requires, and no one has opposed that."
2008.08-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2076.991,2087.641,"--Well, why isn't that the end of this case, because I heard opposing counsel say if you go tomorrow and file a piece of paper and swear on that piece of paper you're innocent, Alaska will give you the DNA."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2089.844,2091.797,"He said it, but I don't believe that--"
2008.08-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2091.797,2096.594,"Well, if he said it in this Court in answer to a question, I don't see why that isn't binding."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2096.594,2106.058,"--Well, they took the same position in the -- in the trial court in Alaska they said that he is not entitled to DNA testing under the postconviction statute under any circumstances."
2008.08-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2106.058,2106.76,"Well, wait."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2138.623,2147.635,"Well, I don't believe that you need the swearing requirement, because he has previously asserted his innocence; but what's most important here--"
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2147.635,2153.664,"Well, but the whole point is that, Justice Ginsburg brought out the point, that he hasn't asserted his innocence under oath."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2174.28,2175.153,--And I would agree with that.
2008.08-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2185.464,2189.571,If you accept that -- of course it does; and this is not a new procedure.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2211.154,2214.686,"That contradicts the position they took in the -- in the State court, Your Honor."
2008.08-6,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2227.087,2233.428,"Well, we can ask your opposite, opposing counsel."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2306.193,2307.678,"I agree with that, Your Honor."
2008.08-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.202,2360.204,"You know, it is very strange."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2361.873,2363.202,Well it's very--
2008.08-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.202,2365.402,"There was a lot of other evidence in the case, wasn't there?"
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2365.402,2366.123,"--Well, that's--"
2008.08-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2366.123,2367.823,I don't know what they thought they were doing.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2367.823,2384.772,"--10 -- 10 years ago, Justice Scalia, the U.S. Department of Justice articulated a materiality test for DNA testing; and they said, like you're saying: Yes, let's look at the evidence of guilt; but then let's say to ourselves, looking out of the other eye, what if there's a favorable results?"
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2402.529,2404.373,So if it is so clear--
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2404.373,2404.716,Only Alaska--
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2404.716,2405.387,"--Sorry, counsel."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2415.491,2419.461,"--It is not a question of displacing what the legislatures have done, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2427.315,2437.75,"It is exactly a question of displacing what the States have done, because now this question is going to be subject to constitutional law and it's going to be litigated in a variety of cases with a variety of claims."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2450.01,2451.87,"I don't think necessarily, Your Honor."
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2483.416,2486.309,"Well, but the whole question -- it is kind of along the same lines I've been talking."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2500.77,2501.944,"--Well, I agree with you."
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2514.391,2518.201,"So, just to get back to the point you were making earlier, it really doesn't matter what the Congress said."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2521.449,2522.591,--That is -- that is correct.
2008.08-6,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2535.428,2551.39,"Is the irrationality ultimately that they require a -- an assertion, with some basis for the assertion, that in fact there is evidence that would show innocence?"
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2555.109,2558.233,I think I understand the question.
2008.08-6,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2558.233,2558.826,"Well, you were--"
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2558.826,2560.95,Please interrupt me if I don't and I apologize.
2008.08-6,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2560.95,2561.543,--I'll put it quickly.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2608.119,2622.052,"You are correct; and Justice Souter, they never, ever said in -- in their brief, in their petition for certiorari, that they believed that a condition for getting the test should be that a person swear out an affidavit asserting innocence."
2008.08-6,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2626.143,2628.907,"Well, that -- that goes -- that goes to the first point."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2628.907,2629.453,Yes.
2008.08-6,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2629.453,2632.624,And I -- I was concerned with the second.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2637.919,2654.679,"The second point is -- and that -- which is why the only rational test is -- the Catch-22 or cart before the horse that you're referring to -- which is we can't speculate, based on the other evidence, whether it's going to be a DNA exclusion or a DNA inclusion."
2008.08-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.81,2684.9,And you will see cases where the defendant maintained that the defendant was innocent.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2715.684,2722.496,"I'm not ignoring it at all; I'm simply saying that 1983, by its very nature, doesn't require it, and Alaska practice--"
2008.08-6,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2722.496,2723.15,Why shouldn't--
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2723.15,2724.725,"--didn't require it, but if you do--"
2008.08-6,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2724.725,2733.551,--Whether 1983 requires it depends in part on whether we recognize a free-standing right to test DNA evidence.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2757.841,2760.181,"--There would -- nothing would be unreasonable about that, Your Honor."
2008.08-6,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2760.181,2762.041,Is your client prepared to make that claim?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2762.041,2763.962,"Your Honor, I assume he certainly would."
2008.08-6,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2764.336,2765.194,"Well, I'm not asking you."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2768.583,2774.206,--I know he has told every other lawyer who has represented him that he was actually innocent.
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2774.846,2781.0,Was his assertion before the -- his confession -- his confessions before the parole board made under oath?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2781.0,2783.328,"--I believe it was made under oath, Your Honor--"
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2783.328,2789.043,"So he's guilty of perjury one way or the other, either before the parole board or in his assertions of actual innocence here."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2789.043,2805.691,"--Well, wouldn't it be ironic, Your Honor, if we do the DNA test and he's exonerated and it proves he didn't do it at all, that then the State went ahead and prosecuted him for perjury because he did something just so he knew he could get out because, under Alaskan law, unless you accept responsibility, you're not going to get out."
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2805.691,2807.02,"Well, wouldn't it be ironic--"
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2807.02,2807.332,Two of our--
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2807.332,2808.284,"--Excuse me, counsel."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2814.609,2818.625,--I think that would be terrible.
2008.08-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2834.102,2852.375,"Could you say this -- could you say, suppose -- I'm just testing this out -- that like any other governmental action, this action of refusing the DNA evidence is subject to the Fourteenth Amendment's requirement that there be a reasonable basis?"
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2929.644,2933.688,"--I think that's a very sound approach to this, Justice Breyer."
2008.08-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2933.688,2934.967,"Well, it does help you win."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2935.716,2938.921,"It has that added advantage, Justice Breyer."
2008.08-6,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2939.342,2940.122,Yes.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2940.122,2947.918,"But -- but, quite honestly, we've had two exonerees that are pointed out in the prosecutors' brief and in the exonerees' brief who did in fact that."
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2958.036,2958.8,Would you have a--
2008.08-6,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2958.8,2961.015,For -- sorry.
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2961.015,2968.935,--Would you have a constitutional right to the DNA evidence if the accuracy of the test was the same as the one that your counsel submitted at trial?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2968.935,2970.121,Well--
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2970.121,2972.932,"In other words, limits it to -- what was it -- 16 percent or something like that?"
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2972.932,2975.931,--I think you would -- probably because number -- number one--
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2975.931,2976.633,"Well, all right."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,2983.226,2987.535,"--Well, the constitutional right doesn't apply with a -- with a level of accuracy."
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2997.063,2998.173,"Well, just so to follow up on that."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3011.619,3018.119,"--No, I think the reason you have it here, Your Honor, is that Alaska concedes -- I mean, when have you ever heard it before in a case?"
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3044.465,3047.811,So fingerprint -- fingerprints apparently are covered by it.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3054.822,3063.287,"--Well, I know it's slightly outside the record, but just this week the National Academy of Science said that fingerprints don't have the same indicia of reliability that these DNA tests have."
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3063.287,3063.88,"No, I'm sure--"
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3063.88,3064.285,And--
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3064.285,3065.787,--I'm sure they're not as accurate as the DNA tests.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3070.954,3108.502,"--The limit is -- the limit is -- it's the same limit, if you will, that the Innocence Protection Act articulated -- and at least 41 of the States that passed statutes articulated, and by common law the other States all gave DNA testing, the ones that didn't have a statute, with the sole exception in the country being Alaska -- is, if there's either a reasonable probability that the DNA tests will -- that a favorable DNA test result can prove innocence, okay, and you did not -- you know -- that's the standard, if you will, okay, to get the test."
2008.08-6,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3118.766,3122.731,How can this constitutional right be limited just to DNA evidence?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3134.961,3136.01,I hope--
2008.08-6,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3136.01,3140.537,Advances in -- advances in detecting fingerprints or testing fibers or all sorts of other things.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3140.537,3143.957,"--Well, again, fibers didn't do any better than fingerprints."
2008.08-6,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3175.617,3179.317,"I'd like to get back to the second part of the question I asked at the start, which you never really got a chance to answer."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3206.509,3210.151,"--Well, first of all, in this case, that didn't happen."
2008.08-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3214.865,3222.334,"His counsel -- his counsel forwent the DNA testing, and we attribute the actions of counsel to the defendant."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3222.334,3226.065,--And the prosecutor also forwent the DNA testing because they--
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3226.065,3229.0,But can we get an answer to Justice Alito's question?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3241.09,3250.085,"--I don't think so, if you -- if you couch it in the loosest terms that Justice Alito did, namely, ""gaming the system""."
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3257.569,3270.437,"Well -- well, let's assume that counsel and the defendant -- after full discussion and being fully advised, say this is too dangerous; we don't want the DNA test; we'll shoot the dice; we're not going to have the DNA test."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3291.408,3291.97,--Okay.
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3314.228,3314.696,Sorry.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3325.412,3345.748,"--What I'm saying is it would not be an unconstitutional restriction, like the Innocence Protection Act, if the State of Alaska required -- which it does not now because there is no legislative scheme, but in the future required -- that the -- a defendant who doesn't want DNA testing has to voluntarily and explicitly waive that on the record."
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3376.124,3377.935,"Well, you seem to be sympathetic to that position."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3387.308,3387.979,--Why would it--
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3387.979,3393.275,You have a -- you have a built-in -- you have a -- a built-in second chance.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3393.275,3394.882,--Let's for a moment--
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3394.882,3398.929,"And that's just -- that's just not sound trial strategy, counsel, and you know that."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3398.929,3405.177,"--Justice Kennedy, let's for a moment think about it in a purely logical way."
2008.08-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3444.581,3445.814,But they will--
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3445.814,3446.426,"And, in fact, the parole board will--"
2008.08-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3446.426,3453.89,--But they will have acquired the advantage of having a chance of the jury's acquitting them at the trial.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3466.399,3484.722,"--Well, the reason why I -- I don't believe it is gaming the system -- and perhaps, you know, you can help me with this -- is if he's getting the test now and he doesn't get out of prison while he's having the test and he's actually using his own money to pay for the test, and if the test shows he's guilty, the parole board is going to turn him down."
2008.08-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3494.889,3495.903,Ex ante.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3512.522,3513.645,"Well -- well, why--"
2008.08-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3513.645,3520.005,"So why not just not ask for it and if it turns out that the jury happens to convict him anyway, then ask for it?"
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3520.005,3522.376,"--In all practice, it is a moot point."
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3528.826,3541.152,"On that -- on that point, I just want to make clear: In the present posture of this case, I take it that if the Federal Innocence Protection Act applied, he would not qualify?"
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3541.152,3541.527,No.
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3542.806,3543.57,He would qualify.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3543.57,3550.46,All he would have to do is -- is go back and actually swear out a declaration under penalty of perjury--
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3550.46,3554.426,"No, no -- well, but -- but as the case now stands he does not qualify."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3554.426,3556.348,"--Well, he's never been required to do that or asked to do that."
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3556.348,3558.536,"As the case now stands, he does not qualify."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3558.536,3563.095,"Other than -- other than that, he meets every single other criterion."
2008.08-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3563.095,3564.393,"That's a biggie, though."
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3564.393,3575.215,"So you're -- you're, in effect, asking us -- and you say the -- the Solicitor General appears here -- you're -- you're, in effect, asking us to say that the Federal Witness Protection Act on these facts is unconstitutional."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3575.215,3576.42,"Oh, not at -- not at all, sir."
2008.08-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3592.958,3596.471,I am quite dubious that -- that he would indeed sign it.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3621.493,3622.008,--Your Honor ----
2008.08-6,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3622.601,3624.259,"I mean, you know, what is this?"
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3624.259,3631.301,"Well, first of all, each and every time with his own counsel, Justice Scalia, he was adamant about asserting his innocence."
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3663.086,3664.509,What if there was a videotape?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3667.929,3670.428,"I -- well, you know, given what I now know about--"
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3670.428,3672.144,Or photographs or other evidence that--
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3672.144,3673.849,--I don't think so.
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3679.721,3680.158,--That's a good point.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3686.53,3691.104,Under the Constitution there is no duty under current law to preserve the evidence.
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3691.389,3695.09,Would that be a corollary of the constitutional right you are asking for here?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3695.09,3696.01,--I don't believe so.
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3718.205,3718.611,No.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3726.387,3728.465,No -- no objection.
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3746.973,3748.77,May I -- may I just ask one point?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3748.77,3749.394,Certainly.
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3749.394,3752.455,I take it he is not now in custody for this offense?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3752.455,3758.687,I believe he is in custody--
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3758.687,3759.906,Not for this offense?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3759.906,3767.074,"--Well, I -- I think what happened is -- and I -- and I -- I can't swear to this -- is -- is he was -- he got a conditional release on the other matter."
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3769.559,3772.136,He's being held on other charges.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3772.136,3772.48,That's right.
2008.08-6,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3772.48,3774.292,But he's not now in custody for this offense.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3774.292,3779.116,"He's -- he's not, but I don't think that would make a difference in the outcome."
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3787.3,3791.894,Was he released on parole with respect to this offense?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3791.894,3796.546,I -- I believe he -- he was released on what's called conditional release.
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3796.546,3800.36,And was his confession a necessary predicate to that release?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3800.36,3810.027,"Well, under Alaska law one of the key requirements to get parole is that you accept responsibility for the crime."
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3811.556,3820.179,So a confession that would be perjurious if he claimed actual innocence now was responsible for his release?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3820.179,3831.673,"--I would hope, Mr. Chief Justice, that I would be principled enough that if I was actually innocent and they told me that the only way I could get out was to say I committed a crime, that I might say:"
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3835.467,3836.642,"No, I understand -- I understand that."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3836.642,3837.11,--Yes.
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3837.11,3845.902,"But he's been -- other than other crimes he committed, he's been released on the basis of what you say is an unprincipled confession."
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3848.527,3852.368,"I believe he has been -- he's back in, though, I think, because of the conditional release."
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3870.516,3873.328,--So his parole was revoked because he committed another offense?
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3873.328,3876.342,That's my understanding.
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3876.342,3877.344,Okay.
2008.08-6,2,38186,peter_neufeld,,3878.483,3880.202,Thank you very much.
2008.08-6,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3880.202,3882.433,"Counsel, we'll give you three more minutes."
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,3882.433,3883.279,"Three minutes, Your Honor?"
2008.08-6,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3883.279,3889.699,"May I -- before you start, would you -- I want you to clear up the question that Justice Breyer asked."
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,3907.425,3926.51,"If he were to file a new application for postconviction relief with an affidavit that the civil rules of discovery would apply, and he, I believe, would be -- be able to obtain the evidence that he seeks."
2008.08-6,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3927.041,3927.977,How about--
2008.08-6,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3927.977,3930.459,Would you resist that request?
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,3930.459,3934.429,"--Well, there are -- there are possibilities of procedural default."
2008.08-6,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3937.366,3945.281,You cannot confirm that you would acquiesce and recommend that he get the DNA sample under those conditions?
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,3945.281,3947.407,--I -- yes.
2008.08-6,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3948.686,3959.589,"Well, you would still want to leave yourself open to make the objection that he had a chance to get this at trial and -- and -- and decided not to get it."
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,3959.589,3960.26,As I say--
2008.08-6,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3960.26,3962.448,Wouldn't those objections continue to apply?
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,3962.448,3964.869,--I'm--
2008.08-6,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3964.869,3985.938,"I mean, it -- it seems to me that -- that all -- all that you have to concede is that there is some means for him to get into court, with those -- those exceptions that other States make; and other States do make an exception for gaming the system."
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,3998.12,3999.559,"--That's true, Your Honor."
2008.08-6,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4000.901,4001.852,"Well, why give it away?"
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,4001.852,4002.589,--Well--
2008.08-6,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4002.589,4006.118,--any more than you gave away the fact that this is going to is going to prove his innocence--
2008.08-6,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4006.118,4006.539,Why don't--
2008.08-6,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4006.539,4007.537,We would like to know what you do--
2008.08-6,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4007.537,4008.601,Why don't we do it -- I'm sorry.
2008.08-6,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4009.631,4010.005,--Yes.
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,4015.738,4022.078,"--Well, before you reach the discovery issues there would be the issues of procedural default."
2008.08-6,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4022.078,4022.577,Right.
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,4022.577,4027.078,Once those were cleared away then he would be able to--
2008.08-6,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4027.078,4038.855,"But the net result is that it is perfectly clear to me from the argument that you have not conceded that if he now files the paper, he will definitely get the DNA."
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,4038.855,4040.305,--Not that he would -- that's correct.
2008.08-6,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4041.946,4042.477,Okay.
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,4042.477,4043.038,I want to clear up--
2008.08-6,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4043.038,4058.581,"--But you -- you referred to the civil rules, and in discovery, in criminal cases as in civil cases, it -- ordinarily you have to prove that you have a basis for a claim."
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,4078.761,4091.582,"--Justice Ginsburg, Mr. Osborne, by filing an affidavit that would accompany his application, that would -- I think that would operate to state a claim."
2008.08-6,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4091.582,4110.824,"Would there be instances when you, as the Attorney General of Alaska, would waive procedural defaults, in order to determine if there was guilt or innocence in a case where DNA conclusively proved it, simply because of your interest in not confining innocent people?"
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,4110.824,4122.916,"That -- that's conceivable, Your Honor; but in -- in Mr. Osborne's case, he's had 14 years to step forward and declare his innocence, as any truly innocent--"
2008.08-6,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4122.916,4131.878,"All you can say in answer to my question, as to your particular approach to your duties here, is that that's conceivable?"
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,4131.878,4136.393,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.08-6,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4149.636,4150.029,--Okay.
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,4191.918,4199.319,"I -- I'm not sure I understand your -- your question, Your Honor."
2008.08-6,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4200.243,4203.273,I want to just repeat it.
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,4217.877,4219.405,The--
2008.08-6,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4219.405,4221.156,Wrong procedure.
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,4232.917,4251.237,"--If he -- if he were to do as you say, then with respect to a -- the request for discovery, I believe that our only defense would be the procedural defense of -- you know -- lack of due diligence or -- or something along -- or untimely--"
2008.08-6,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4251.237,4252.314,If the only defense is procedure--
2008.08-6,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4252.314,4252.922,--that defense--
2008.08-6,3,33955,kenneth_m_rosenstein,,4252.922,4253.409,--Pardon me?
