1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,21.913,34.904,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-5691,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,165.391,169.026,"Just where are you reading from, Mr. Campbell?"
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,169.026,172.062,"--I'm in my opening brief at appendix page A-1, Your Honor."
1989.89-5691,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,172.062,173.612,Whereabouts on page A-1?
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,173.612,177.116,Section 3579(a)(1)--
1989.89-5691,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,177.116,177.816,Okay.
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,177.816,187.054,"--order of restitution, provides that the court when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense, and the language pertinent to this case is"
1989.89-5691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,212.786,219.209,3579 doesn't say how much... how much restitution.
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,219.209,220.459,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-5691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,221.659,223.659,"Yeah, but now you have to get the 3580, I guess."
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,223.659,227.813,"--Well, I believe that we would go next to 3579(b)."
1989.89-5691,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,233.717,234.4,Uh-huh.
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,234.4,236.835,--sets out the covered losses and remedies.
1989.89-5691,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,456.258,474.82,"Can't you also derive some comfort from the ejusdem generis rule, or the noscitur a sociis... whatever you want to call it... that the catchall phrase does not... is thought to be limited to the same types of things that the earlier parts of the clause are contained?"
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,474.82,475.986,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-5691,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,541.995,549.618,"Mr. Campbell, what... what if the charge were of a conspiracy or a scheme to defraud?"
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,549.618,561.592,"--Your Honor, that is the rule that the Ninth Circuit seems to have adopted, and throughout this case we have not challenged that rule because we don't believe that it applies to this case."
1989.89-5691,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,561.592,563.878,"Well, I... I... it may not."
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,566.094,566.844,I can... I can--
1989.89-5691,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,566.844,573.431,Then does that broaden the range of possible victims and amounts of restitution?
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,573.431,588.607,"--It certainly would have that practical effect, Justice O'Connor, but I... I see some support to that rule because I can certainly understand that in an offense such as mail fraud, a particular scheme to defraud is an element of that defense."
1989.89-5691,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,601.231,614.074,Do you suppose that a defendant could agree to pay a larger sum of restitution than you would argue for in this case if... if it had been part of a plea agreement?
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,614.074,618.109,"A defendant may certainly agree to do that, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-5691,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.654,635.987,Uh-huh.
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,635.987,638.772,And Respondent alludes to that in their brief.
1989.89-5691,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,666.606,678.231,"Could... could... could the court order a payment for these other counts, maybe even to other banks as a condition of probation?"
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,678.231,690.222,"Your Honor, the courts are not clear over whether the old Federal Probation Act continued in effect after the enactment of the Victim and Witness Protection Act."
1989.89-5691,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,714.07,716.486,"Of course, then there wouldn't be a judgment under this section in the sense of--"
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,716.486,717.438,"No, Your Honor it would not be--"
1989.89-5691,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,717.438,718.572,--It would be a different type of order.
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,718.572,721.39,"--It would not carry the enforcement provisions, for example."
1989.89-5691,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,721.39,725.692,"Mr. Campbell, help me out with one respect."
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,746.455,764.501,"I believe, Justice Blackmun, that it's clear from the statute as a whole that there may be more than one victim of the offense of conviction, even though the statute would limit a recovery to a victim of the offense of conviction that there may be more than one victim."
1989.89-5691,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,764.501,769.137,xxx rather than any.
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,785.147,789.615,If there... that certainly... that's certainly one view Justice--
1989.89-5691,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,789.615,790.215,Treason.
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,792.817,794.336,--That's certainly correct.
1989.89-5691,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1028.538,1034.042,"Now, what is the relevancy of these provisions to the provisions that we're interpreting, Mr. Campbell?"
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,1034.042,1043.815,"The relevance that I see, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the language is functionally identical to what Congress ultimately passed in 1982 in the VWPA."
1989.89-5691,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1193.661,1200.433,"And the language that is in... in effect that governs your client's case is the word ""the"" or the word ""such""?"
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,1200.433,1208.404,The word (b)(1).
1989.89-5691,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1208.404,1212.89,"Yeah, but didn't Congress change in '86... change from ""the"" to ""such""?"
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,1212.89,1213.59,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-5691,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1213.59,1217.359,And does that '86 amendment govern your client's case or not?
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,1217.359,1220.128,"We take the position that it does, Your Honor."
1989.89-5691,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1251.45,1258.937,"And if there is no difference in the meaning... between such and the, then it's immaterial obviously whether it governs your client's case or not."
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,1258.937,1265.941,It... it is only significant if the... if the Court has need to resort to the legislative history accompanying the '86 amendment.
1989.89-5691,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1344.793,1346.595,"Mr. Campbell, may I ask one... one question?"
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,1353.499,1370.877,"--I... I certainly agree with that, Justice Stevens, because the statute contemplates that there are certain covered losses that are not going to be part of the indictment, such as therapy of a victim, such as lost income in the case of bodily injury."
1989.89-5691,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1385.453,1395.892,"But you'd agree, even as strict property law case there was a robbery of a hundred... an alleged robbery of $1,000 and the evidence shows it's really $1,500, they could recover the full $1,500?"
1989.89-5691,0,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,1395.892,1398.927,Provided that it's supported by conviction for that offense.
1989.89-5691,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1496.655,1498.59,"Very well, Mr. Campbell."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1500.04,1509.612,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-5691,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1577.356,1590.682,"Well, Ms. Wax, certainly the language of the statute seems to tie the amount of restitution to the harm resulting from the offense of conviction."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1590.682,1612.029,"Well, we believe that each of the sections that uses that locution, losses resulting from the offense of conviction, of which there are three, that there is a way to interpret each of these provisions which squares with our view of the statute."
1989.89-5691,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1612.029,1622.285,"Well, but, of course, it's a criminal statute, and I suppose the rule of lenity and strict construction comes into play."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1622.285,1633.609,"Well, these three provisions that Petitioner alludes to do not contain an explicit limit on the amount of restitution to the--"
1989.89-5691,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1633.609,1640.496,"No, but it appears to be tied to the harm resulting from the offense of conviction."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1640.496,1659.26,"--Well, let me, if I may, go through each of these provisions one by one and give our version of why these provisions were structured and written as they are written and what Congress was attempting to accomplish with... with... with these sections."
1989.89-5691,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1772.033,1776.218,"Well, you... you... you say it's appropriate that that be... what does that mean?"
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1776.218,1778.568,"--Well, that's the discretionary part."
1989.89-5691,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1800.75,1801.05,May I ask--
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1815.592,1829.417,"Well, actually not because one of the things that we think comes under that phrase is quite parallel to what the court... to what the provision mentions in the very first section."
1989.89-5691,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1850.35,1859.371,"Yes, but... if... if... if you read it as it is, you... you say a court shall consider the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1879.1,1889.308,"Well, that's true, but we don't... we don't see that clause as necessarily just referring to other factors... factors with respect to the defendant."
1989.89-5691,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.941,1898.513,You see it as... as actually broadening the language of... of the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense?
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1898.513,1908.702,"--Well, as pertaining to different acts of the defendant that might cause a loss, depending on the circumstances."
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1927.914,1939.453,"But may I ask you... do you think the judge had discretion to order restitution in an amount less than the amount of the loss if, for example, there... at the showing of the defendant doesn't have any money and he can't raise the money and so forth?"
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1939.453,1940.638,"--Yes, we do."
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1940.638,1945.107,So that you aren't saying the amount of the loss is a minimum that applies in all cases.
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1952.112,1955.481,"Where it says ""shall consider"" so the court--"
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1955.481,1956.581,"--That's right, rather than shall award."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1956.581,1957.497,"--Oh, yes."
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1957.497,1960.699,"See, if it... if it were a minimum, you'd say ""shall order"" that."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1964.42,1965.937,"Well, right."
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.026,1981.096,"But there's nothing else in the statute that refers to other harms unless you read it into ""such other factors"", of course."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1981.096,1996.872,"Well, there are three general provisions of the statute which we think make clear that Congress wanted judges... did not intend for judges to look simply at the technical bounds of the count of conviction."
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2060.01,2060.696,"Well, tell me... you went a little fast for me."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2064.147,2067.182,--On 5(a) of the appendix of our brief--
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2067.182,2067.815,Yeah.
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2067.815,2076.121,"--at the bottom Section 2, 18 U.S.A. 1512 Note, Section 2(b)(2)."
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2076.121,2078.621,2(b)(2).
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2081.573,2083.123,"Yes, at the very bottom."
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2083.123,2085.108,Thank you.
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2085.108,2085.908,You--
1989.89-5691,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2085.908,2103.569,"Ms. Wax, the section you've been talking about, as Mr. Campbell pointed out, is entitled Procedure for Issuing Order of Restitution, and it is really the previous section, 3579, that sets forth what the order of restitution may be."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2166.243,2181.587,"--Well, first of all, Your Honor, Petitioner in a sense cast the first stone in this because he did rely on 3580(a) and (d) as evincing a substantive limit on the amount of restitution."
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2223.265,2229.502,"I know, but today he relied 3579(b) and that does talk about values rather specifically."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2229.502,2247.047,We believe that to rely on 3579(b) as... as... as presenting an ironclad limit on the amount of restitution to the count of conviction is to completely misinterpret both the language of 3579(b) and the--
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2247.047,2247.463,"Well, there's certainly--"
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2247.463,2248.197,--reason why it was put--
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2248.197,2253.801,"--is nothing in 3579(b) that suggests anything larger than the value of the property that was taken, is there?"
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2253.801,2255.217,"--Well, there's--"
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2255.217,2261.305,"There's quite... quite a detailed description of return the property, return its value, return its value less what they got from a third party."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2268.561,2287.622,"--Well, we understand it as... as allowing the court to use the calculus prescribed in (b) for parallel instances of property loss or damage or bodily harm that are caused by other than the conduct of conviction."
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2322.945,2331.467,"Yes, but the puzzling thing about this argument is the easiest case is where you know a specific loss of $1,000, and you don't need a lot of guidelines to say give back the money."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2339.573,2340.739,Except--
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2340.739,2342.608,That's where you have the real problems in deciding how much.
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2348.762,2368.49,"--Well, we... the legislative history reveals that... or at least experience with the previous law I... I would rather say, revealed that the hangup was how... deciding how to calculate the various components of damage and what should be left in and what should be taken out."
1989.89-5691,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.333,2393.874,"Ms. Wax, what... what also suggests to me that 79(b) is... is exclusive and sets forth the only kind of restitution you can get is the fact that it's so comprehensive."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2428.345,2441.403,"Your Honor, I'm... I'm not implying that it is necessarily simply illustrative with regard to the category of the types or components of damages that can go into the award."
1989.89-5691,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2456.746,2456.879,I see.
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2457.446,2459.781,And those are two completely different categories.
1989.89-5691,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2459.781,2460.481,Fair enough.
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2460.481,2460.948,Okay.
1989.89-5691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2496.221,2497.74,What is your... what is the limit?
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2505.609,2507.528,"Well, there are two answers to that."
1989.89-5691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2514.015,2527.09,"It seems to me you'd certainly leave a... a judge... a judge has a duty under (a)(2) that if he doesn't order restitution or orders only partial restitution, he has to give his reasons."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2527.09,2528.357,--Right.
1989.89-5691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2528.357,2534.595,How does... how does he ever know when he's ordering only partial restitution under your theory--
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2534.595,2535.295,Well--
1989.89-5691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.295,2543.034,--which seems to be so... be so open-ended that... you tell me what their limits are?
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2543.034,2543.117,--Right.
1989.89-5691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2557.96,2558.726,"Oh, I understand that."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2558.726,2559.726,--there are certain that are going to be left out.
1989.89-5691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2559.726,2560.059,But you just say--
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2560.059,2560.692,Secondly--
1989.89-5691,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2560.692,2561.809,--it doesn't say how much.
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2561.809,2562.426,--Right.
1989.89-5691,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2662.473,2668.477,"Of course, one of the collateral effects of your argument... there are other banks here."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2700.564,2710.822,"There's no doubt that in the practical application of this statute, as Congress wrote it, there are victims who are going to lose out."
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2822.626,2823.91,Could I just make one... one observation?
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2844.806,2851.662,"--Well, I... I guess we'd... I'd have to say that perhaps can be read is... is not the best way of putting it."
1989.89-5691,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2851.662,2852.562,I don't think it is.
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2852.562,2873.993,We think it must be read because of what Congress was trying to accomplish with this statute and because the reading that Petitioner urges would so eviscerate the efficacy of these restitution provisions that we just can't believe that this is the way Congress meant for them to be interpreted.
1989.89-5691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2892.639,2903.178,"If you lose this case, it seems to me that government can always protect itself against too narrow a restitution order."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2909.416,2911.034,"Your Honor, we don't think so."
1989.89-5691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.034,2912.468,Why not?
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2912.468,2934.049,"First of all, it's true that we could attempt to elicit a promise from the defendant that they pay comprehensive restitution flowing from all the counts that we think they are guilty of in the process of hammering out a plea agreement on a very narrow count."
1989.89-5691,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2939.001,2941.12,"But you couldn't get it in an order, you don't think, if you loss this case?"
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,2941.12,2942.27,"No, we don't think so."
1989.89-5691,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2976.41,2984.899,"Well, Ms. Wax, this looks a case where the government entered into a very poor plea agreement from the standpoint of public policy."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3008.447,3009.981,--That's correct.
1989.89-5691,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3033.494,3038.981,"Well, what does that mean in terms of actual service in incarceration?"
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3040.666,3044.118,"Well, this was before the Sentencing Reform Act."
1989.89-5691,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3141.449,3146.334,"There is another provision of the statute, of course, that makes it easy for the victims to file and win a suit."
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3156.958,3169.533,"Yes, but once... but there, that estoppel provision, 3580(e), does limit estoppel to the acts involved in the narrow offense of conviction."
1989.89-5691,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3172.301,3173.753,It doesn't help your case either.
1989.89-5691,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,3173.753,3191.381,"--We think it does help our case and so did the court below, Your Honor, because in saying the offense involving the acts giving rise to restitution, that provision implies that there might be acts giving rise to restitution that are not part of the offense."
1989.89-5691,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3203.606,3205.641,"Thank you, Ms. Wax."
1989.89-5691,2,34231,lucien_b_campbell,,3207.441,3211.576,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-5691,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3324.665,3327.965,"Thank you, Mr. Campbell."
