1990.90-285,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.248,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-285, Litton Financial Printing Division v. National Labor Relations Board."
1990.90-285,0,35704,mathias_j_diederich,,40.027,43.13,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-285,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,109.214,117.248,"But wasn't it the case, isn't it the case that to the extent that seniority is claimed to be a factor, it does arise under the contract?"
1990.90-285,0,35704,mathias_j_diederich,,117.248,125.513,"In the Board's view, which I think is correct, seniority does not become a factor until ability and aptitude are determined."
1990.90-285,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,146.547,160.315,"Well, were the grievances in this case expressed solely in terms of aptitude and ability as opposed to terms of seniority on the assumption that aptitude and ability were equal?"
1990.90-285,0,35704,mathias_j_diederich,,160.315,164.108,The grievances were expressed in terms of seniority.
1990.90-285,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,164.108,167.582,"Well, then why doesn't that arise under the contract?"
1990.90-285,0,35704,mathias_j_diederich,,167.582,179.58,"Because the contract provides that aptitude and ability are the controlling factors, and seniority never becomes a factor until you prove that, or you are able to demonstrate--"
1990.90-285,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,179.58,182.913,"Excuse me, maybe I don't, still don't understand the grievance."
1990.90-285,0,35704,mathias_j_diederich,,198.79,202.424,"--No, I don't think the grievances mentioned aptitude and ability at all."
1990.90-285,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,202.424,208.888,"Okay, that's maybe where we... so they were simply saying... the grievances were simply claiming that seniority and seniority alone entitled them to some consideration they didn't get?"
1990.90-285,0,35704,mathias_j_diederich,,208.888,210.568,"The exact words were ""out of seniority""."
1990.90-285,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,210.568,211.42,Okay.
1990.90-285,0,35704,mathias_j_diederich,,211.42,235.275,"The court of appeals upheld the Board's determination that there was a violation of section 8(a)(5) because of the repudiation, the refusal to arbitrate, but the court reversed the Board's decision on the... arising under theory that the Board had adopted and said that was unreasonable, and directed the parties to arbitrate."
1990.90-285,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,266.544,277.403,"Well, Mr. Diederich, had this grievance arisen during the life of the collective bargaining agreement would arbitration have been required?"
1990.90-285,0,35704,mathias_j_diederich,,277.403,278.041,Yes.
1990.90-285,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,278.041,294.845,"And there certainly is a good deal of language in this Court's decision in Nolde that suggests that, similarly, arbitration would be required if it occurs after the expiration of the agreement, as here."
1990.90-285,0,35704,mathias_j_diederich,,294.845,308.492,"Yes, that's true, Your Honor, but Nolde was a civil action under section 301, which is a statute, I am sure as you know, which gives unions the right to sue employees and vice-versa."
1990.90-285,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,360.506,372.835,"Well, I guess the Board takes the position that some of these grievances might have to be arbitrated and some not, and in this case this one should."
1990.90-285,0,35704,mathias_j_diederich,,380.24,387.873,"No, I think the Board's position was that there was a violation in the blanket repudiation of the arbitration provision."
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,930.981,958.31,"To address preliminarily a question that has arisen, the period after contract expiration is a period of bargaining prior to agreement on a new contract or the reaching of impasse."
1990.90-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,983.644,996.755,"So you say there's a duty to bargain when the contract expires, even though the employer is no longer bound by the condition, and that Katz holds that during a period of bargaining you cannot make unilateral changes?"
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,996.755,997.694,--Precisely so.
1990.90-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1005.34,1010.251,"But if it were not during a period of bargaining, then, the employer could make unilateral changes?"
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1010.251,1012.112,"After impasse, for example."
1990.90-285,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1012.112,1015.374,And why is Katz not dispositive here?
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1018.667,1019.137,No.
1990.90-285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.197,1078.938,"Well, so are the wages."
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1087.723,1093.646,It's only coincidental that the change would be a change in a contractually prescribed term.
1990.90-285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1109.646,1114.661,"Well, I understand why an arbitration agreement isn't one of the terms and conditions of employment."
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1115.591,1116.742,"It is, it is--"
1990.90-285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1116.742,1119.734,--But you just arbitrarily say we'll change some of them and we won't change other ones.
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1119.734,1130.71,"--It's not arbitrary, Mr. Justice, it... the point is the rationale of Katz is not based on carrying the contract obligations forward."
1990.90-285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.23,1145.971,"I hear you, but I don't understand."
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1148.432,1157.238,The wages are being paid.
1990.90-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1203.37,1208.602,What is the... what did the Board base its reason for doing that on?
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1208.602,1222.38,"Well, the rule is based on the notion that a wholesale refusal to submit grievances to arbitration is a repudiation of the bargain that was reached, and therefore an unfair labor practice."
1990.90-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1222.38,1223.932,"What bargain, if it's expired?"
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1223.932,1230.605,"Well, that is the point of trying to apply Nolde."
1990.90-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1285.322,1289.036,Namely those... did the dispute arise under the contract.
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1289.036,1289.634,That's correct.
1990.90-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1359.852,1361.652,"Mr. Wallace, can I interrupt right there?"
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1382.135,1390.369,--Because Nolde was talking about rights that accrued during the pre-expiration period.
1990.90-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1390.369,1391.822,"Well, when did their seniority accrue here?"
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1391.822,1430.837,"Well, that gets to a question of the application of the Board's rule, whether what was involved in this case was a claim based on seniority, and the Board reasonably determined in applying its rule here to the contract provision, which is set forth at the top of page 9 of our brief, the contract provision says in case of layoffs, length of continuous service will be the determining factor if other things, such as aptitude and ability, are equal."
1990.90-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1483.292,1494.238,"Well, just generally, Mr. Wallace, wouldn't you think that if the question is whether a dispute arises under the contract, isn't that itself a issue for the arbitrator?"
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1494.238,1515.151,"The question of arbitrability under this Court's decision in AT&T Technologies against Communication Workers is a matter for the court, or in this case the Board, the decision-making tribunal to determine."
1990.90-285,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1523.016,1537.946,"But, suppose the argument is that the parties intended by this language in the contract to have a certain clause in the contract carry over past the normal expiration date?"
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1547.843,1560.222,"If there were a provision capable of being interpreted that way under the Board's rule, the case... the question would be arbitrable."
1990.90-285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1573.7,1587.841,"The Board's rule purports to be an application of our decision in Nolde, and we said in Nolde specifically quoting an earlier case, the question of interpretation of the collecting bargaining agreement is a question for the arbitrator."
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1597.185,1623.422,"As we explain in our reply brief, there is overlap in some cases between questions on the merits in interpreting a collective agreement and the question of arbitrability which a court, or in this case the Board, nonetheless has a duty to determine even if that involves construing relevant terms of the collective bargaining agreement."
1990.90-285,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1623.422,1633.029,"--But Mr. Wallace, isn't the critical term of the collective bargaining agreement the term that describes the duty to arbitrate, which says there shall be arbitration if there is an allegation the contract has been breached?"
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1633.029,1634.451,That depends on--
1990.90-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.451,1643.637,"And if you say in this case they have made such an allegation, then the arbitrator could say well, they have alleged it but the contract had expired, so there is no remedy in arbitration."
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1643.637,1644.235,--That--
1990.90-285,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1644.235,1646.218,"But isn't that where we start, with the arbitration clause?"
1990.90-285,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1646.218,1669.853,"--That is dependent on whether the Board's view of how to reconcile Nolde with the act's no compulsory arbitration provision by taking the narrower reading of the category of claims that Nolde makes it appropriate to submit to arbitration during the post-expiration period, whether that view is proper."
1990.90-285,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1680.059,1681.802,"Very well, Mr. Wallace."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,1683.772,1686.664,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1759.591,1765.034,"Well, as I understand the position of the other side, it's that that's not really the issue in this case."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,1779.766,1780.135,That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1780.135,1780.726,And that isn't covered.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,1780.726,1781.537,That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1792.423,1801.99,"Well, it may be, but you can't answer the question before us by simply saying it's clear that seniority was meant to continue after the agreement ended."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,1811.577,1827.235,"We know under Nolde, once we make the contention that that language continues, that is the language governing the dispute continues, that whether in fact it has some effect or whether the contract has been breached is a matter for the arbitrator to determine."
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1827.235,1829.428,But that was a section 301 case.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,1829.428,1830.948,That's correct.
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1837.442,1838.754,It has purported to apply it.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,1838.754,1842.055,"--And more importantly, I think it's, it is in fact compelled to do so."
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.055,1842.816,Why?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,1842.816,1854.844,"Because in Lincoln Mills this Court 35 years ago said that interpretation of collective bargaining agreements is to be left to the usual processes of the law... court, and it later--"
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.844,1859.476,"It didn't, it didn't say it was to be left to unfair labor practice proceedings, which is what you're in here."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,1859.476,1860.087,--That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1919.365,1923.379,And not by the Board in unfair labor practice proceedings.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,1923.379,1924.228,That's correct.
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1925.23,1925.941,Which is what you have here.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,1925.941,1927.49,--And that's what we're trying to resist.
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1943.723,1944.774,"Well, why didn't you?"
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,1947.795,1948.404,--We could have.
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1950.947,1951.637,Why didn't you?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,1951.637,1967.157,"Because at the same time that this was occurring this employer was committing a number of other unfair labor practices in refusing to arbitrate, and we saw it as an efficient method of getting the whole problem resolved of this employer's refusal to bargain by filing an 8(a)(5) charge, which was sustained."
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.121,2124.42,"Well, you don't... you certainly don't, aren't arguing, you don't need to argue that every, an arbitration clause always survives the termination of the contract?"
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2124.42,2125.31,No.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2158.762,2163.386,"If it's, if it's suit was based on the contract."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2163.386,2163.905,--That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.905,2174.824,"Even though the contract formally had expired you would still, to bring a 301 suit you would have to say what we're suing about is nevertheless governed by the expired contract."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2174.824,2175.302,That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2201.561,2203.732,Could you have gone to court to compel arbitration?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2203.732,2204.353,Yes.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2207.265,2213.717,"You probably, certainly could have stated a cause of action in your complaint, but you might not have won."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2213.717,2228.398,"--We could have stated a claim, and I think I could have convinced a district court, had we chosen that route, an alternative route, that the arbitration clause was broad enough, there was no expressed exclusion, and that under Nolde we had at least an entitlement to get to the arbitrator."
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2228.398,2237.213,"But you would have to nevertheless convince the court that your cause of action really goes back to the contract, even though it's expired."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2237.213,2237.723,That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.645,2249.201,"I guess in that respect, Mr. Rosenfeld, you are in a different situation with respect to the arbitration clause than you are with respect to the other continuing terms and conditions."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2263.7,2265.833,"--No, for the following reason."
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2265.833,2266.203,No?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2267.223,2277.03,That in order for us to prevail in court we have to allege that there is some understanding or agreement between the parties that that provision over which we're suing continues.
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.86,2281.123,Are you answering my question about the wages?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2281.123,2281.411,--Yes.
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2281.411,2281.992,Suppose the... all right.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2281.992,2289.749,"For example, if I were to go to court on that theory, and wages is perhaps the most difficult because it doesn't sound like wages accrues."
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.848,2308.23,"Well, you're changing the facts now."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2327.103,2329.954,--We could not sue over the unilateral change there.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.954,2330.755,"Of course not, you couldn't."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2343.463,2344.024,That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2344.024,2345.254,But you couldn't sue on the contract?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2345.254,2347.084,If we could prove that the--
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.084,2351.648,"Well, I know, but you don't have to prove something besides the fact that he unilaterally changed it."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2351.648,2352.179,--Absolutely.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.602,2356.3,Exactly.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2356.3,2359.253,--that that wage rate... some agreement that that wage rate would continue in--
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.253,2361.656,"But you have to prove that for the arbitration clause, too, don't you?"
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2361.656,2362.065,--That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2362.626,2365.427,"I mean, you have to show the arbitration clause would intend to continue."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2374.474,2379.068,"--And it's our preference, of course, to make those arguments to the arbitrator rather than the district court."
1990.90-285,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2381.349,2385.509,"Yes, but it is true, isn't it, let me just get sort of a simple point out of the back of my head."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2410.697,2411.947,--It could happen.
1990.90-285,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2438.486,2440.888,"Of course we don't have to decide that, I don't think, do we?"
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2440.888,2461.141,"Well, not only do you have to not only decide it, I in some sense should not be pressing the argument because I'd be rather making that argument to the arbitrator and letting him hear the bargaining history, letting the arbitrator hear the law of the shop, letting him hear and look at the language of the contract, and apply his special expertise or her special expertise to those questions."
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.305,2476.781,"So what do you do about the notion that courts are to decide the, whether an issue is arbitrable?"
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2476.781,2482.943,"What you do is the process that this Court set in Warrior & Gulf, what this Court said in Nolde and AT&T Tech."
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2491.371,2501.647,"I know, but the court still has to come down and say we looked at this arbitration clause and we... the court has to say either it reaches this dispute or it doesn't."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2501.647,2502.378,--That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.15,2508.481,And did the Board do any more than that in this case?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2514.785,2515.905,What the Board said--
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2515.905,2516.646,Isn't that what it said?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2516.646,2517.347,--Yes.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2517.347,2518.008,Yes.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2528.444,2529.195,That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.562,2543.054,"So there's nothing wrong with what, with the kind of decision the Board made."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2544.206,2544.847,--No.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2554.541,2556.731,You ought to be satisfied if we just said they were wrong.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2557.953,2560.654,"--I'd be satisfied, but... but that's what the Ninth Circuit did."
1990.90-285,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2575.084,2577.425,Do we owe any deference to the Board?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2577.425,2587.792,"We don't in this case because we're dealing with a question of contract interpretation of the right to arbitrate, and those doctrines come from section 301."
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2596.288,2599.21,Those are not questions then even that are primarily for the arbitrator?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2600.142,2602.933,In determining arbitrability they are for the court.
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2602.933,2605.875,The Board works with these contracts all the time.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2625.107,2626.529,No.
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2627.588,2629.42,"No... not even respect, you wouldn't say?"
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2629.42,2632.051,"--Well, actually I think what the D.C.... I suppose some respect."
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2636.624,2638.086,"Well, we shouldn't presume they're wrong, anyway."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2638.086,2638.717,--No.
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2638.717,2641.007,Will you answer me this.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2661.722,2662.252,Yes.
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2662.252,2664.644,Would the Board consider that to be an unfair labor practice?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2664.644,2665.115,Yes.
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2665.796,2666.153,It would?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2666.153,2666.594,--Yes.
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2685.307,2689.468,Even though it... even though there is no contractual requirement at that point that would be enforced?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2689.468,2689.878,--Right.
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2696.914,2698.895,So it is treated like arbitration.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2703.78,2705.22,"That... not anticipated, no."
1990.90-285,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2723.141,2725.031,"So it follows from Katz, but not Nolde?"
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2725.031,2739.363,"The unilateral change doctrine follows from Katz, but it is reinforced by Nolde, because what this Court said in Nolde is that once you have arbitration in the contract there is a presumption that it continues in effect after the contract expired."
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2808.777,2819.415,"You don't say that under Katz you treat the promise to arbitrate as part of the conditions of employment, do you?"
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2819.415,2820.447,"Yes, I do."
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.447,2821.186,You do?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2834.315,2834.866,That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.446,2836.947,"Well, that isn't the Board's theory."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2836.947,2838.807,"The Board, the Board comes--"
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2838.807,2850.425,"That isn't... I thought the, I thought that the labor law says after the contract expires you don't make a unilateral change--"
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2850.425,2851.076,--That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2851.076,2852.468,"--in wages, hours, and working conditions."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2852.468,2853.566,And the Board said--
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.566,2859.641,But labor also... the labor law also says that you don't imply promise to arbitrate.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2863.304,2865.184,--The Board doesn't take that position.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2866.396,2868.848,I'm talking about Katz now.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2868.848,2878.784,--But Katz says that all mandatory subjects of bargaining remain in effect but cannot be unilaterally reputed by the employer or unilaterally changed by the employer.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2880.434,2885.109,"Well, on that basis the case... this case is over, isn't it?"
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2885.109,2886.879,--Yes.
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2888.071,2890.171,Katz covers arbitration in that language?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2890.171,2892.302,Katz was not a case involving arbitration.
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2892.302,2893.023,I know it wasn't.
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2893.023,2893.624,No.
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2915.367,2925.394,"But there are other forces in the labor law besides the idea of no unilateral changes during bargaining, and one of them is no compulsory arbitration."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2925.394,2926.216,--That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2951.362,2957.935,"Well, the... it seems to me the Board in deciding this case has squarely rejected your notion about Katz."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2957.935,2960.399,I don't believe they have.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2960.958,2961.889,"Well, it must have."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2974.909,2981.712,--But the Board has said surely that some disputes are arbitrable once the contract has expired under Katz.
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2981.712,2983.434,"I know, but you say all of them are."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2983.434,2985.114,That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2985.114,2987.974,You say that we should hold either all or none are?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,2987.974,3009.721,"What we say is that you should hold that the obligation to arbitrate, once the contract has expired, is congruent with the obligation to arbitrate during the life of the agreement, unless the parties have agreed to some other system, which the parties under our system of collective bargaining agreement, they're... entitled to do."
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3019.148,3022.34,And for what period of time does this obligation last?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,3022.34,3027.411,It lasts either for the time that the parties have said in their own bargaining process--
1990.90-285,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3027.411,3029.853,"Well, absent... suppose they have said nothing about it, as here?"
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,3029.853,3046.004,"--Or it lasts until the employer takes action, and this is almost exclusively in the employer's control, until the employer takes action to propose that there be no further arbitration, bargains to an impasse, at which point there is no further obligation."
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3047.675,3050.046,"Mr. Rosenfeld, can an employer do the same for wages?"
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,3061.125,3061.593,--Yes.
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3061.593,3065.797,"And then, and then he wouldn't be guilty of an unfair labor practice, if he--"
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,3065.797,3066.398,That's right.
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3092.364,3097.197,--What if it says clearly and unmistakably I can give any wages I want once the contract ends?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,3102.572,3106.924,"The Board says that if that waiver is clear and unmistakable, that if--"
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3106.924,3107.946,No unfair labor practice?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,3107.946,3108.563,--Your Honor?
1990.90-285,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3108.563,3109.655,No unfair labor practice?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,3109.655,3110.396,No unfair labor practice.
1990.90-285,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3188.737,3202.978,"Mr. Rosenfeld, can you argue in this case, does it help your case to say that the Board is inconsistent in ordering steps one and two of the grievance process, but not the arbitration process?"
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,3202.978,3219.518,"It's not only inconsistent, Your Honor, it puts the union at a severe disadvantage because presumably during that period when we have to go through steps 1 and 2, we can't take economic action, while the Board says theoretically we can at some other point, and that process could be dragged out for some period of time."
1990.90-285,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3241.921,3248.226,"I can't see how the Board or the Government can defend the order to go through grievance steps 1 and 2, and not arbitration."
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,3248.226,3254.97,"It also creates another severe anomaly, which is that there are many grievance procedures which provide for joint adjustment boards."
1990.90-285,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.811,3297.908,I take it you would then say that the no-strike clause continues all the way?
1990.90-285,2,21421,david_a_rosenfeld,,3297.908,3301.03,"Yes, and the Board has said that in 1978 in Goya Foods."
1990.90-285,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3363.531,3365.231,"Thank you, Mr. Rosenfeld."
1990.90-285,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3368.323,3382.715,On page 58 in Indiana & Michigan the Board specifically said that it has concluded that Katz should not apply to post-expiration withdrawal from arbitration.
1990.90-285,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3445.364,3448.946,"Well, what's the rationale for implied... for requiring the grievance process then?"
1990.90-285,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3453.39,3483.939,"Because the Board concluded that the requirement... carrying forward the requirement of submitting decision-making authority to an outsider goes beyond a process of bargaining by the employer under the preliminary grievance procedures, and goes to the point of inconsistency with the congressional prohibition of compulsory arbitration, when the arbitration can no longer be called a creature of contract."
1990.90-285,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3485.471,3486.26,Thank you.
