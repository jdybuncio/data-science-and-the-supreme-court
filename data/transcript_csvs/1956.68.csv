1956.68,0,21638,delvaille_h_theard,,1763.735,1768.255,-- say merely this that the Court of Appeal -- I didn't want to fail to mention what the Court of Appeals said.
1956.68,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1768.255,1768.492,Yes.
1956.68,0,21638,delvaille_h_theard,,1768.492,1782.034,"The Court of Appeals said that I'd offered no evidence and that the -- I had offered no evidence and that my arguments were not persuasive, that's all."
1956.68,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1802.039,1803.874,Mr. Hickey.
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,1803.874,1811.827,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1851.552,1858.16,"And their Government stated the opposite, to what these proceedings were on the District Court."
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,1858.16,1859.787,"Yes, sir."
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1869.612,1870.918,(Inaudible)
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,1870.918,1900.598,"Pursuant -- pursuant to Rule 1 (f) of the federal rule of the court rules which are printed on the Government's brief at page 2, which provides that whenever it is made to appear to the Court that a member of the Bar of that Court has been suspended or disbarred, or convicted of a felony in any other court, he shall be forthwith suspended from practice before this Court, the District Court."
1956.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1916.636,1916.919,"Well, do those --"
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,1916.919,1917.388,That was --
1956.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1917.388,1925.967,-- proceedings ordinarily follow the course after either a disbarment or a conviction of -- for the other events named?
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,1925.967,1930.433,"As a matter of -- of cause, the practice is banned."
1956.68,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1962.733,1964.85,He shall do what I -- he shall do what?
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,1964.981,1972.942,He -- he shall give serious consideration to what has occurred and to bring appropriate proceedings before the District Court.
1956.68,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1972.942,1976.691,"It doesn't -- compelling to bring the proceedings, the serious considerations to --"
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,1976.691,1979.475,"No, no, Mr. Chief Justice, it does not."
1956.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1979.475,1981.904,And unless the United States Attorney here who initially --
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,1981.904,1984.732,The United States Attorney here did file this motion in this Court --
1956.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1984.732,1985.884,Can you tell us on --
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,1985.884,1987.49,-- pursuant to that rule.
1956.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1987.49,1990.143,And who brought it to the United States Attorney's attention?
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,1990.143,2001.281,The Committee on Professional Ethics and Grievances of the Louisiana State Bar Association as I understand it brought it to the attention of the United States Attorney.
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2028.179,2036.576,"Before you do that, would you -- you don't have to finish Mr. Hickey, what it plays in the District Court after the District U.S. Attorney moved."
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2036.576,2037.036,"All right, Your Honor."
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2037.036,2039.267,"Did this follow automatically, then?"
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2039.267,2053.005,"No, Your Honor, following the issuance -- following the filing in of that motion and pursuant to the rule of that Court, an order to show cause was issued to petitioner."
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2176.844,2179.877,"You said abnormal condition, do you mean mentally?"
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2179.877,2184.063,"Yes, Justice Black, mentally abnormal condition."
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2191.266,2193.34,(Inaudible) what happened?
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2193.34,2193.854,Yes.
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2206.706,2208.035,An argument of counsel.
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2208.035,2209.226,Argument of counsel.
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2209.226,2210.347,On the motion and --
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2210.347,2212.387,On the motion and the return.
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2228.518,2242.419,"In short then, is it fair to say, Mr. Hickey, that the basis of the order of disbarment in the District Court for the conclusion it moved from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana."
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2242.419,2247.686,It -- there is a fair statement to say in the light of the response of the petitioner.
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2247.686,2251.093,That is attacking -- I'm just trying to undermine their judgment.
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2251.093,2261.056,"In other words, the arguments which were made in the District Court were found as unpersuasive to that Court as the arguments that were made by Mr. Theard."
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2261.056,2264.179,But there was no -- no testimony of Mr. Theard that he didn't stand.
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2269.397,2270.564,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2270.838,2272.286,Can I ask one more thing?
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2285.038,2289.095,"It is, Your Honor, upon also a statement of -- of character."
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2289.095,2289.103,Up here?
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2289.103,2290.413,"Well, yes."
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2341.879,2342.331,The rule of --
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2342.331,2342.748,"So, it's --"
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2342.748,2347.525,(Voice Overlap) go down there as -- as -- and substantially the rule of his bar in relation to the members of his bar.
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2347.525,2348.964,Precisely.
1956.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2348.964,2359.16,"Well, Mr. Hickey, I -- I think you suggested that the factor was an independent redetermination by the District Court of the basis of the Louisiana Court judgment."
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2359.16,2359.353,Yes.
1956.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2362.574,2362.733,No.
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2373.376,2375.621,Let me -- let me put it this way.
1956.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2410.124,2411.09,"Well, that -- that --"
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2411.09,2412.811,"And in that sense, it adopted the rule."
1956.68,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2412.811,2423.276,"Well, except that that might almost say to me, I think, that merely because the Louisiana Court disbarred, that suffice to require disbarment by the District Court."
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2423.509,2431.162,"Their purpose, sir, there wouldn't have been an issuance of an order to show cause.There wouldn't have been a hearing on that order to show cause and --"
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2431.162,2432.117,Let me ask you this.
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2470.191,2480.051,"I think the District Court, as this Court had pointed out in -- in (Inaudible) and Selling and Radford had -- has an independent standard to follow in its bar."
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2564.526,2580.825,"Mr. Hickey, have I read the opinion of the Louisiana Supreme Court correctly in is saying and I adjust my -- my eyes rapidly over the pages of all the opinions, a lot of quotations -- judicial padding?"
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2602.439,2603.805,I think that is a -- correct reading.
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2603.805,2606.72,"They merely go on the historic premise facts, is that right?"
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2606.72,2607.094,Right.
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2666.279,2671.562,"Or -- or any allowable basis for an inference, that the past will continue --"
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2671.562,2672.366,Right.
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2672.366,2672.476,-- for the past is --
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2672.476,2672.824,Right.
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2672.824,2673.728,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2673.728,2675.122,"Right, right Your Honor."
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2675.224,2676.97,May I ask you one question?
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2676.97,2677.037,Excuse me?
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2677.037,2679.307,May I ask you on what you've just said.
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2708.035,2711.215,"Your Honor, that is a correct reading and what happened was this."
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2711.215,2713.933,Do we have to take that as being the basis in the disbarment.
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2713.933,2723.022,"Well, the -- the only qualification I would make to Your Honor's summary is that the Supreme Court did not adopt that finding."
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2735.685,2737.41,In other words -- in other words --
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2737.41,2737.561,Consequent --
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2737.561,2745.168,"-- would you think it that it would have done the same however, if it had approved this finding, I suppose."
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2745.168,2745.93,Well --
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2745.93,2750.245,"Well, because you say that they didn't find it one way or the other and said they didn't need to."
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2750.245,2773.39,"Well, on the contrary, they might very well not have because the Bar Association and I am a bit off the record in this except to suggest that the Bar Association objected -- objected to the finding of the Commissioner that the petitioner was suffering from an abnormally mental state at the time he committed the alleged misconduct."
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2784.404,2784.561,Suppose --
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2784.561,2785.243,-- evidence that was presented.
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2785.243,2786.776,-- suppose they did.
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2786.776,2787.183,But the --
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2787.183,2802.79,Suppose the Supreme Court without repudiating that finding has disbarred him because of the offenses committed at the time the Commissioner said he was insane.
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2802.79,2806.515,"Well, if you suppose -- if you suppose that."
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2806.515,2807.895,"I don't -- not supposed, is that not --"
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2807.895,2811.463,"That is not the fact, Mr. Justice Black, if I may --"
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2811.463,2814.933,"Do you -- did they repudiate that finding, the Supreme Court?"
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2814.933,2816.616,They refused to pass on the finding.
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2816.616,2821.268,"Well then, they neither repudiated it nor affirmed it."
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2821.268,2821.382,That's --
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2821.382,2837.653,"If they worked on the -- isn't this to the fact, Mr. Hickey, that the Supreme Court said, “Here is an admitted external fact that somebody signed his names in checks, and these checks constituted misconduct because the funds weren't there whatever is before us."
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2844.122,2844.557,Right.
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2846.291,2856.999,They went on the -- they went on a finding that he committed forgery and disregarded and refused to pass it all on the finding that he was insane when he did it.
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2856.999,2857.485,Precisely.
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2892.969,2897.984,"Well now, on the District Court, did he allege that he was insane at the time?"
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,2897.984,2906.846,"Now, let -- on that point, he -- he alleged that he was insane at the time and if I may say so, in fairness to the petitioner, he suggests."
1956.68,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3015.197,3018.535,The Supreme Court of Louisiana took it out of the case.
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,3040.373,3041.965,"In substance, that is the case."
1956.68,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3119.912,3122.452,Or -- or whether that's from insanity?
1956.68,1,22414,edward_h_hickey,,3122.452,3145.571,"Or some form of insanity, the -- the fact is that as a result of that particular act, the pubic has been defrauded, clients have been injured and the standard of objectivity as Mr. Justice Frankfurter had noted is the standard that Louisiana has -- has followed in this case."
1956.68,2,21638,delvaille_h_theard,,3463.243,3463.453,I appreciate it.
1956.68,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3463.453,3464.123,-- five minutes.
1956.68,2,21638,delvaille_h_theard,,3464.123,3465.054,"-- very, very much."
1956.68,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3465.054,3467.568,So you won't have to come back another time.
1956.68,2,21638,delvaille_h_theard,,3467.568,3471.734,I want to say this.
1956.68,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3527.045,3527.689,"Mr. Theard, are you --"
1956.68,2,21638,delvaille_h_theard,,3527.689,3528.068,But --
1956.68,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3528.068,3535.158,"Are you -- is it your position that actually, the District Court disbarment was nakedly upon the Louisiana Court judgment --"
1956.68,2,21638,delvaille_h_theard,,3535.158,3535.494,"Well, I --"
1956.68,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3535.494,3539.233,-- without any inquiry into the matters which you raised in response to your adversary?
1956.68,2,21638,delvaille_h_theard,,3539.233,3554.009,"Well, I raised them because they appeared to me to be on the face of the decree of the state court just as I'm raising them now because they were on the face of the decree of the state court."
1956.68,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3557.37,3565.61,"Well, do you think or do you not think that you had a determination in the District Court upon the issues that you raised in your response to the order of disbarment."
1956.68,2,21638,delvaille_h_theard,,3565.61,3568.947,"Oh, I don't know about that, sir."
1956.68,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3604.963,3614.583,"The only -- only thing I'm trying to get at is whether -- if you're telling us that you feel that in the District Courts, you did not get an independent determination of the -- the facts that you've raised."
1956.68,2,21638,delvaille_h_theard,,3614.583,3625.518,"I think I've got, Mr. Justice, I think I've got the only determination that could be given to me, although I think the result was incorrect."
