1990.89-1817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.527,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1817, County of Riverside and Cois Byrd, Sheriff of Riverside County v. Donald Lee McLaughlin, et al.--"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,23.538,24.178,Thank you.
1990.89-1817,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,144.987,148.752,"As to those three plaintiffs, were they in custody at the time they were added to the complaint?"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,148.752,153.595,"They were in... the allegations of the complaint said yes, they were in custody as of the filing of the second amended complaint."
1990.89-1817,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,153.595,157.89,And no hearing had... no probable cause hearing had been held as of the time they were added to the complaint?
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,157.89,158.749,Not no hearing.
1990.89-1817,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.557,174.211,"Well, had any hearing been... had any probable cause hearing been conducted as of that time?"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,174.211,178.6,--We do not know as to those three plaintiffs.
1990.89-1817,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,186.159,190.813,"Well, assuming they had had no probable cause hearing, what's the standing problem?"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,190.813,197.28,"--The standing problem is still that if it is one that is temporally bound, something is either prompt or it is not prompt."
1990.89-1817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,211.197,212.976,But even if you don't get a prompt--
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,216.178,231.281,"Yes, but again, looking at the nature of the injunctive relief sought and the ability of these plaintiffs to obtain that relief, you can't, once... if you're saying you didn't get a prompt hearing and you're asking to be given a prompt hearing, you simply can't benefit from that injunction."
1990.89-1817,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,234.093,235.218,I don't understand that.
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,255.663,261.519,"Well, I think the difficulty is, is that the allegations of the complaint do not say that they have not received a hearing."
1990.89-1817,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,264.191,264.644,You're right there.
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,265.845,266.251,Yes.
1990.89-1817,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,266.251,268.953,"--I guess I should have said, on Justice O'Connor's assumption."
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,277.06,278.481,That they want a hearing.
1990.89-1817,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,278.481,285.604,"They want a hearing, and if you want to know when they should have had it, they will tell you they should have had it after 36 hours."
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,285.604,292.881,"Yes, but again, I think the position that we have taken in the case is there is simply no allegation that these particular people didn't have a hearing, but they didn't have a prompt hearing."
1990.89-1817,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,292.881,293.787,"Well, that's pretty picky, isn't it?"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,317.497,318.247,I read the complaint--
1990.89-1817,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.247,320.12,That's just a ridiculous way to read the complaint.
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,320.12,334.912,"--I'll tell you, I believe that the language of the complaint does support that interpretation, and I find it no more ridiculous in many respects than the fact that when they filed the initial complaint it was extremely clear that the named plaintiff was no longer in custody and would not benefit from the injunctive relief sought."
1990.89-1817,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,347.673,353.404,"Well, I think the Gerstein case sort of answers that and says there's standing."
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,366.539,381.331,"--I can only, as I mentioned, reiterate the argument that we have made below, that if... I think if you hold them to the four-square language of the complaint, there is then no offer to amend at any time, that it shows that these people not necessarily suffer the deprivation of which they are complaining."
1990.89-1817,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,391.406,398.154,"Well, just so I understand your point, suppose a person has been held for 10 days and files a complaint and says I have not been given a prompt hearing."
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,403.291,404.478,--He would be able to--
1990.89-1817,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,404.478,406.884,"I mean, is that your reading of the complaint?"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,406.884,408.117,--Gerstein requires a hearing.
1990.89-1817,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,423.127,425.876,"But in that facts, I put your position is no standing."
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,425.876,426.954,--No.
1990.89-1817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,549.716,552.107,"Mr. Coates, we'll resume there at 1:00."
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,552.107,552.716,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1990.89-1817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,552.716,574.019,"Mr. Coates, you may resume."
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,574.019,577.518,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1817,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,634.261,647.457,Is there a California statute that provides for when the probable cause hearing must be conducted in felony cases?
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,647.457,657.11,"There's no statute as to arrest, but as to an overall probable cause determination, yes, it must be done by preliminary hearing."
1990.89-1817,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,667.31,673.011,So what's the county policy that we're dealing with here exactly for felony cases?
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,676.634,687.441,"--The position we have taken, it was our argument throughout the preliminary injunction hearing that we would be willing to live with, would be to do the probable cause determination for felons at the time of arraignment."
1990.89-1817,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,691.299,695.423,"If the felon requests it, if the person arrested requests it."
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,695.423,695.673,Yes.
1990.89-1817,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,702.592,705.591,"And if requested, it is conducted then and there at the arraignment?"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,705.591,705.888,"Yes, it is."
1990.89-1817,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,705.888,707.465,Not at the preliminary hearing?
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,707.465,712.041,"An additional hearing... there will... he will still get a preliminary hearing, because California law requires it."
1990.89-1817,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,712.041,715.117,"Yes, but the probable cause determination is what we're talking about, I thought."
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,715.117,721.568,"He will get a probable cause determination at arraignment based upon, at that point, probably just the arrest report and the like."
1990.89-1817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,731.221,733.938,"Well, that's a determination of whether he should be held to answer--"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,733.938,734.204,--That's right.
1990.89-1817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,734.204,735.157,--which might be different.
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,735.157,735.61,That's right.
1990.89-1817,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,740.358,746.402,You're saying it recognizes that kind of a hearing is different from what it is requiring for the Constitution?
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,746.402,751.447,It may be more protective; more may occur at that hearing.
1990.89-1817,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,765.848,772.36,"Excuse me, it's not really more protective in the sense that it may well... what's the maximum length of time?"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,776.328,776.936,--On arraignment?
1990.89-1817,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,776.936,777.686,Yeah.
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,777.686,782.263,"On arraignment, with the Thanksgiving holiday, that's essentially what you could get."
1990.89-1817,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,782.263,783.777,You could be held for 7 days?
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,783.777,784.621,Yeah.
1990.89-1817,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.621,790.994,And what happens is you can continue to be held if after 7 days this higher standard is met?
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,819.919,825.808,"Well, in... there's an assumption there that there is no probable cause arrest to begin with."
1990.89-1817,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,827.916,833.492,"I know, that is the assumption, but that's... that's the person I'm worried about, the person who is arrested without any probable cause."
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,833.492,839.474,"Well, the... when you get the hearing, I mean, the hearing can be on the evidence that was before the officers."
1990.89-1817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,862.027,874.148,"Did any of the courts make findings as to what the average length of time was between... under your county's, Riverside County's, practice, between the time of arrest and the time of the arraignment?"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,874.148,878.1,The district court in granting the preliminary injunction said as much as 5 days.
1990.89-1817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,888.222,894.891,"So you're not talking about 5 business days, you're talking about 3 business days plus 2 weekend days?"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,894.891,903.45,"That's essentially what it is, yes, because if the 2-day period expires when courts are not in session, you don't have the hearing until the following court day."
1990.89-1817,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,905.792,909.088,"Or 4 weekend days on the long holiday, such as Thanksgiving."
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,909.088,909.743,Yes.
1990.89-1817,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.118,911.915,So it would be three plus four.
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,911.915,912.929,--during that time period.
1990.89-1817,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,957.443,961.785,Do you think... who started this case?
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,962.582,965.018,"Mr. McLaughlin filed it originally, yes."
1990.89-1817,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,965.018,969.094,And he was in custody at the time?
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,969.094,972.062,At the time he filed the complaint he had been released from custody.
1990.89-1817,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.062,984.822,What business does... what business has a Federal court got entertaining a suit like this which really is... aren't there some Younger considerations in this case?
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,984.822,995.427,"Well, no one is... no one was arguing as to custody or to interfere with their pending proceedings, but yes, the problem is it's a direct injection--"
1990.89-1817,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,995.427,1001.27,This issue could have been raised in the State courts as part of the criminal proceeding.
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1001.27,1001.566,--Yes.
1990.89-1817,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1020.87,1022.588,"You didn't... you didn't argue that, though--"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1022.588,1024.353,--Not argued extensively--
1990.89-1817,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.353,1026.681,--You never raised Younger or anything close to it.
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1026.681,1027.647,"--No, no."
1990.89-1817,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1134.355,1137.666,"If it is, why not just give the defendants the option?"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1153.66,1163.625,"--Well, the difficulty... first of all, at the time you're making that offer to them, they generally are not represented by counsel, and they may not... it may not be in their interest to have the immediate hearing."
1990.89-1817,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.57,1195.096,"So then it's not... it's not much of a burden on the State's system, if most of the people waive it, to give it to those few individuals who feel that there indeed was no probable cause for their arrest, and they think they can get out right away instead of waiting 7 days."
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1195.096,1199.627,"--Well, they waive it at the time of arraignment, knowing that there is another procedure down the line, if they are a felon."
1990.89-1817,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.077,1204.655,I see.
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1204.655,1209.761,"If their counsel looks at it and thinks, gee, there is no probable cause, he is entitled at that time to raise it significantly."
1990.89-1817,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1331.387,1333.979,"They don't contend it must be an ex parte proceeding, do they?"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1333.979,1339.524,"--Well, the Ninth Circuit found it... yeah, that it could be an ex parte proceeding."
1990.89-1817,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1339.524,1344.6,"But I mean the defendants or the plaintiffs in this action aren't asking for an ex parte proceeding, are they?"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1344.6,1351.097,"No, that is true, but that would add still another layer of complexity to transport them to the hearing officer, and at that time they don't have counsel."
1990.89-1817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.59,1379.102,Did... do you think Gerstein contemplated any representation by the defendant at this probable cause hearing?
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1379.102,1379.882,No.
1990.89-1817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1400.811,1404.091,What do you think is the minimum required by Gerstein?
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1411.261,1415.383,"Or the evidence submitted by the police, the police officer."
1990.89-1817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.929,1425.193,"So that... so there would just be the submission of a warrant, or--"
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1425.193,1427.566,Evidence that would support a warrant for arrest.
1990.89-1817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1427.566,1429.113,--To a committing magistrate.
1990.89-1817,0,42553,timothy_t_coates,,1429.113,1430.44,To a committing magistrate.
1990.89-1817,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1519.452,1521.357,"Very well, Mr. Coates."
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1522.279,1526.23,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1817,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1562.668,1564.277,"Mr. Stormer, what are you relying on now?"
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1567.73,1568.168,--Evidence--
1990.89-1817,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1568.168,1569.369,"--statutes, or... evidence in the record?"
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1569.369,1570.759,"--Evidence in the record, Your Honor."
1990.89-1817,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1570.759,1573.227,Of a typical case?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1573.227,1574.352,Yes.
1990.89-1817,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1587.128,1589.829,"That's not... you know, that's not helpful right now."
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1590.984,1599.326,"Okay, I'm sorry, but... I'm relying upon the record and upon the statements made by Grover Trask, District Attorney, in the amicus brief as well."
1990.89-1817,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1599.326,1607.322,"Just as a preface to that, can you tell us as to these class plaintiffs, had they had a hearing as of the time they were added to the complaint?"
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1607.322,1609.165,It was pled that they had not.
1990.89-1817,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1613.648,1616.241,They had not had any hearing?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1616.241,1618.552,They had not had any hearing at all.
1990.89-1817,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1642.761,1644.057,"Now, are these matters in the record?"
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1644.057,1645.322,These matters are in the record.
1990.89-1817,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1723.073,1727.307,"Mr. Stormer, you can't prevent that, no matter... no matter what we say in this case."
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1737.786,1738.332,Nor do I seek--
1990.89-1817,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1738.332,1739.285,He can't avoid that.
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1739.285,1741.034,"--I don't seek to hold that, either."
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1755.17,1761.324,I thought the record showed 36 hours was appropriate in this particular county?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1761.324,1767.508,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, but the, the defendants have conceded that the process can be completed in 24 hours."
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1771.662,1774.786,Do you take issue with that?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1774.786,1775.708,We do not.
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1775.708,1776.052,No.
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1776.052,1785.688,"This booking process that I have discussed takes, as I said, approximately 12... excuse me, approximately 24 hours to complete in full."
1990.89-1817,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.196,1808.18,And why does that happen?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1808.18,1809.383,That happens--
1990.89-1817,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1809.383,1812.022,Because the prosecutor determines that they haven't got enough evidence?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1812.022,1820.19,"--The prosecutor determines that... basically they decline to prosecute, whether it's because of not enough evidence or whatever other reasons they might decline to prosecute on."
1990.89-1817,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1820.19,1823.845,"And some of these had been held, at the time the complaint was filed, were still in custody?"
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1823.845,1826.297,Yes.
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1853.942,1855.099,"Well, what's the policy?"
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1862.44,1863.83,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1864.486,1868.53,"So when you say 7 days, could that only occur on Thanksgiving?"
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1868.53,1878.901,"--7 days will only occur during Thanksgiving week or in certain times at Christmas, and the rest of the time the maximum would be 5 and sometimes 6 days."
1990.89-1817,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1878.901,1880.353,Counting weekends.
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1880.353,1882.244,"Counting weekends, Your Honor, yes."
1990.89-1817,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1987.732,1994.167,"Mr. Stormer, the court of appeals didn't consider this aspect of the case at all, as I understand it."
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,1997.853,2000.211,--They did not go into these specific facts.
1990.89-1817,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2000.211,2000.461,Yes.
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2020.234,2030.684,"The reason is, Mr. Chief Justice, is that each of these segments has a different violation of Gerstein v. Pugh contained within it, a very specific action condemned by this Court."
1990.89-1817,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.684,2039.165,"Yes, but the court of appeals says the State of California, as I understand it, must provide a probable cause hearing within 36 hours."
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2060.094,2074.822,The Constitution permits them... and I apologize to the Court for my incomplete description... but the Constitution permits the County of Riverside to conduct a probable cause review within that time necessary to complete the steps incident to arrest.
1990.89-1817,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2079.772,2087.722,Now you're drawing on language from Gerstein to say they must conduct it as soon as they have completed the booking process?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2087.722,2093.672,The language in Gerstein says those steps incident... those administrative steps incident to the arrest.
1990.89-1817,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2098.812,2100.546,"Well, what are cases from this Court?"
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2100.546,2102.17,--There are no cases from this Court.
1990.89-1817,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2144.638,2150.527,You're saying that would be a possible method of complying with what you view as the requirement of the Constitution?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2150.527,2151.448,That is correct.
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2240.584,2253.548,"Mr. Stormer, do you think that the Constitution allows for a lengthier period of delay before conducting arraignment than the probable cause hearing?"
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2253.548,2255.594,"Yes, because the purpose--"
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2255.594,2256.5,And why is that?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2256.5,2267.777,"--The... the probable cause hearing is a Fourth Amendment analysis of what took place at the arrest, and potentially even what could be gathered within the period incident to arrest."
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2276.773,2283.926,"Well, what has this Court said is constitutionally required in terms of time for conduct of arraignment?"
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2283.926,2291.282,"I, to be frank, don't know whether there is a specific ruling of this Court that has set a time period for arraignment."
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2291.282,2294.0,Just that it has to be conducted promptly?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2294.0,2294.734,That's correct.
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2294.734,2304.667,"And it's not sufficient, in your view, to say that the probable cause hearing must be conducted promptly, and perhaps at the same time as arraignment?"
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2304.667,2305.838,They could be.
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2339.871,2340.262,"Well, it could be, though."
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2343.12,2345.728,"They could be, and there is no reason why they couldn't."
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2345.728,2349.883,And why wouldn't the time limit for each be adequate?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2349.883,2359.536,"If the time period for arraignment was correspondent to the time period for probable cause, then they could."
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2377.84,2379.809,And the defendant needn't be present?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2379.809,2381.417,And the defendant needn't be present.
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2381.417,2383.87,But a judge needs to conduct it--
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2383.87,2384.072,Or a hearing--
1990.89-1817,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2384.072,2384.791,--or a magistrate?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2384.791,2385.088,--I'm sorry.
1990.89-1817,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2406.798,2412.311,"Mr. Stormer, we're dealing with the Riverside City Jail, aren't we?"
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2412.311,2413.654,Yes.
1990.89-1817,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2413.654,2416.434,And the injunction applied only to the city jail?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2416.434,2417.793,That is correct.
1990.89-1817,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2417.793,2423.525,Is this a widespread practice in California throughout the entire State?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2423.525,2427.243,The practice of conducting the arraignments at the same time as a probable cause hearing?
1990.89-1817,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2452.56,2455.512,So we have a case of very narrow application here.
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2455.512,2466.757,"Extremely narrow application, because it simply applies to the facts of this case as they exist within Riverside County, within the Riverside County main jail."
1990.89-1817,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2466.757,2468.866,Should we have taken the case?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2468.866,2472.396,"I don't believe that the case should have been taken, to be frank."
1990.89-1817,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2485.891,2490.56,Do you feel there was any conflict with a Second Circuit case?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2490.56,2503.665,"The only conflict that exists, if we're talking about Williams v. Ward, would be the analysis that goes into whether, in that 2 to 1 decision, it should have reached that result."
1990.89-1817,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2523.345,2526.156,The conflict is pretty shallow.
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2526.156,2527.796,The conflict is extremely shallow.
1990.89-1817,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2534.777,2539.072,Is Gerstein satisfied if there has been an arrest warrant?
1990.89-1817,1,21500,dan_stormer,,2539.072,2540.696,Yes.
1990.89-1817,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2600.642,2603.234,"Thank you, Mr. Stormer."
1990.89-1817,2,42553,timothy_t_coates,,2606.358,2607.889,"Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1817,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2855.054,2856.053,May I just ask a question?
1990.89-1817,2,42553,timothy_t_coates,,2856.053,2856.364,--Certainly.
1990.89-1817,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2856.364,2860.098,Did you say that most arraignments are conducted within 36 hours?
1990.89-1817,2,42553,timothy_t_coates,,2860.098,2861.488,No.
1990.89-1817,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2865.314,2868.158,You said they were conducted within 2 court days.
1990.89-1817,2,42553,timothy_t_coates,,2868.158,2870.782,"Within the 2 court day period, but not within 36 consecutive hours."
1990.89-1817,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2870.782,2871.141,Within the 2 court day--
1990.89-1817,2,42553,timothy_t_coates,,2871.141,2872.108,It happens in some cases.
1990.89-1817,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2879.044,2881.355,--Just looking at the universe of warrantless arrests--
1990.89-1817,2,42553,timothy_t_coates,,2881.355,2881.558,Yes.
1990.89-1817,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2881.558,2886.477,--most of those are not... the arraignment is not normally conducted within 36 hours?
1990.89-1817,2,42553,timothy_t_coates,,2886.477,2887.477,That is correct.
1990.89-1817,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2887.477,2892.209,So they are asking that in most cases the time of the probable cause hearing be delayed beyond 36 hours?
1990.89-1817,2,42553,timothy_t_coates,,2892.209,2893.146,In most of them they are.
1990.89-1817,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2895.505,2898.271,"Thank you, Mr.... excuse me."
