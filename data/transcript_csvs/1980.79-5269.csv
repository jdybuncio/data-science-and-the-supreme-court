1980.79-5269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.326,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Edwards v. Arizona.
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,13.511,16.213,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-5269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,86.264,86.904,How old was he?
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,86.904,91.403,"He was 23 at that time, Your Honor."
1980.79-5269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,115.097,117.487,And he had already been formally charged at that time?
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,117.487,122.265,"He had been formally charged, we contend, and the State had agreed with us in the lower courts."
1980.79-5269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,122.265,126.092,"Well, as I understood their brief, they agree with you here."
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,126.092,131.246,"Well, Your Honor, they did until a week ago today when they filed a supplemental brief."
1980.79-5269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,185.006,189.801,Do you think forever after he would be... that no statement would be admissible?
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,189.801,193.003,Mr. Chief Justice.
1980.79-5269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,193.003,195.097,"Well, that's what I had in mind."
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,195.097,210.588,"I think that 1:30 when he was given a first arraignment, or possibly if he had, of his own, changed his mind and decided that he wanted to talk further with the police; yes, he should not have been interrogated without--"
1980.79-5269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,210.588,218.196,"So your position is, he could change his mind and agree to speak?"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,218.196,224.63,--My position is that under the right circumstances I think he might be able to change his mind.
1980.79-5269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,227.255,228.582,"I'm not talking about this case, now."
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,228.582,228.879,--I understand.
1980.79-5269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,228.879,233.347,I'm talking about trying to discern your position.
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,233.347,254.87,"My position is that in terms of application of Miranda, Mr. Chief Justice, that unless truly the accused himself institutes a change of mind, that there should be no reinterrogation until counsel has a chance to confer with the accused who has asked for it."
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,341.366,363.576,"Well, it could be, Mr. Meehan, that if a crime occurs at 11 o'clock at night, that there aren't many lawyers willing to get out of bed at that hour of night to provide the necessary support for a defendant, that might be during the daytime."
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,363.576,365.498,"That's true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.863,431.33,"When you say the case was solved, was it solved as to Edwards?"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,431.33,431.455,Yes.
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,431.455,435.968,"Well, certainly won't be, if you have your way in this Court."
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,440.248,453.29,"I think that's an assumption that can't be made at this point, because at the trial the evidence included the testimony of the police officers, but also testimony of an accomplice named Cleveland Reed."
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,476.577,498.897,"Would you consider it a solution of the case if the police got incriminating statements from three potential suspects to whom they had not read their Miranda rights, and all of their declarations were excluded and the jury returned verdicts of acquittal?"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,498.897,514.999,"I think I would treat it as having been solved by virtue of what the police felt at the time that they undertook the interrogation, and I think, number one, it would be somewhat unrealistic to have a set of facts in which there were three different statements without Miranda rights having been read to them."
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,644.791,653.04,But doesn't the complaint require that the county attorney take it to the court and file it?
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,653.04,657.352,The complaint is presented to a magistrate and it is in effect filed.
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,657.352,660.491,And isn't that the day of the commencement?
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,660.491,667.426,"That is the day of the commencement, but in this case the complaint was filed on the 19th of January."
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,667.426,679.747,"And if so, the complaint had been filed by the county attorney of Pima County at the time of the interrogation?"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,679.747,682.778,"Yes, Your Honor, it had been filed with the magistrate."
1980.79-5269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,721.793,736.257,"Do you remember, offhand, Mr. Meehan, where in the respondent's original brief there is a concession that your client had been formally charged at the time of this interrogation?"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,736.257,736.507,Yes.
1980.79-5269,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,736.507,738.132,I know I read it but I can't find it.
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,738.132,741.443,It's Footnote 47 on page 24.
1980.79-5269,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,815.709,820.817,"Mr. Meehan, did the proceeding before the magistrate actually begin on the 19th?"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,820.817,822.144,--Yes.
1980.79-5269,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,822.144,824.502,Was it completed that day?
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,824.502,838.044,I cannot tell this Court that there was a proceeding in terms of anything more than the officer preparing the complaint and swearing to it and appearing with the complaint before the magistrate.
1980.79-5269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,838.481,840.621,"This wasn't a hearing where he was present, was it?"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,840.621,842.197,"--Well, he... Edwards?"
1980.79-5269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,842.197,843.104,Before the magistrate.
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,843.104,843.51,No.
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.424,913.06,"Well, has that superseded entirely the old procedure where the defendant after the warrant of arrest had been served on him could demand a preliminary hearing?"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,913.06,921.525,"No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the preliminary hearing still exists for those felony prosecutions that are commenced by complaint."
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,923.29,926.383,And that would be this type of case?
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,926.383,940.643,"--Except that there is now, because of the more common use of grand juries and the desire not to get involved with public preliminary hearings at which the accused is present, a possibility of a complaint beginning a case and then an indictment superseding the complaint."
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,940.643,942.454,But that didn't happen?
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,942.454,944.563,That did happen in this case.
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,944.563,946.391,The indictment did supersede?
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,946.391,947.281,The indictment did supersede.
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,947.281,948.42,And what was the date of the indictment?
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,948.42,957.322,"I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I'm not sure, that it was the 27th or so of January."
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1021.049,1037.917,"Your position is not that the police cannot at the scene of a crime interrogate witnesses whom they think might be guilty, unless each and every one of the witnesses has a lawyer, is it?"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1037.917,1038.166,"No, indeed."
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1042.696,1044.352,So it depends on the motive of the police?
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1044.352,1046.758,Not motive entirely.
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1085.647,1088.803,But will they ever know unless they ask?
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1088.803,1127.771,"Well, I think that the situations themselves are going to be fairly easily divisible into categories and of course one reason I think this situation is fairly easily divisible into the category that I'm describing is the fact of the complaint, and the police believing that, they'd been working on the case for 15 months, they believe now they've got enough, they've gotten two statements, the time between the offense and the arrest, and so forth, I think simply tells them at that time and tells this Court at this time that we're dealing with a post-complaint, a post-indictment... to use a shorthand term... interrogation."
1980.79-5269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1127.771,1130.817,Mr. Meehan: I didn't understand one of your answers to Justice Rehnquist.
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1143.344,1149.45,I would say that if the suspect is in custody it would be a consideration.
1980.79-5269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.45,1151.605,Just the fact that it's at the scene of the crime doesn't mean he isn't in custody.
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1159.697,1161.101,I didn't mean to leave that impression.
1980.79-5269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.982,1188.934,"--But that's based on Miranda, whereas the facts here are Massiah... ah, Sixth Amendment--"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1188.934,1199.149,"--I think that this is more a Sixth Amendment, Massiah... or really, a Brewer type of case than it is a Miranda type of case, although obviously the two really come very close together."
1980.79-5269,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1199.149,1204.928,"--In Miranda, for Miranda to help him, he would have to be in custody, would he not?"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1204.928,1205.536,Yes.
1980.79-5269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1210.457,1225.357,"Under the Arizona practice, at what point after the complaint is presented to the magistrate and presumably filed is the defendant, the person in custody, informed of that fact?"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1225.357,1245.787,"I'm not sure, except I know that at the initial appearance which was the proceeding that was to have taken place on the 20th, one of the functions is to either read to or provide a copy of the complaint which is referred to as the formal charges, and to advise of rights and so forth."
1980.79-5269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1245.787,1247.551,"Well, then, did he get this notice on the 20th?"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1247.551,1263.827,"The record indicates that he was shown a copy of the arrest warrant at the time he was arrested on the 19th, shown in the sense, I am sure, of not handing it to him to read but to support the arrest, because there is an indication that there was a scuffle at the time of the arrest."
1980.79-5269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1520.205,1521.564,"Mr. Meehan, when do you contend that the interrogation started?"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1521.564,1532.967,"I haven't focused on it that clearly, Your Honor, in terms of after Edwards was brought into the interview or interrogation room at the jail."
1980.79-5269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.419,1546.789,"Well, specifically, do you contend that playing him the tape of the other person's confession was the commencement of interrogation under Rhode Island v. Innis?"
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1546.789,1549.117,"Yes, I think it was, because I think it was done--"
1980.79-5269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1549.117,1552.818,It makes a great deal of difference as to whether there was a waiver at that point or later.
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1557.488,1576.745,"--That statement supposes that by listening to the tape and making a judgment as to the efficacy of that tape in being able to convict Edwards that he then was more informed in terms of his need for counsel, and I'm not sure I agree with that."
1980.79-5269,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.368,1587.71,"If you say that, then they have the burden of proving waiver before they started to play the tape."
1980.79-5269,0,36260,michael_j_meehan,,1587.71,1591.114,"--Yes, that's true, that is true."
1980.79-5269,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1602.781,1604.672,"Very well, Mr. Meehan."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,1619.479,1622.806,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-5269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1724.266,1727.546,Where do you find that particular dialogue?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,1728.828,1734.31,That's several pages throughout the record.
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1734.31,1746.478,It's on 71:
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,1748.024,1757.286,"Page 37, down towards the bottom:"
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1797.769,1810.655,"Mr. Attorney General, where did he ever say,"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,1813.075,1815.496,He never specifically said that.
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1891.637,1896.73,But he at no time withdrew his request?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,1896.73,1903.336,"He never said, I will no longer wait until I get an attorney to make a deal."
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1903.336,1906.351,How did we get a waiver without that?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,1906.351,1907.897,They advised him of his rights.
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1913.487,1915.94,That's it.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,1915.94,1921.344,"They said, you have the right to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney."
1980.79-5269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1947.475,1953.598,"Mr. McClennen, I'm a little bit confused about the procedure here."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,1991.66,2001.906,"No, Justice Rehnquist, the proceedings, March 4 and March 7, those are the proceedings at the suppression hearing."
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2114.189,2118.78,Where in the record is it that says that that caused him to confess?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2118.78,2121.544,--Nothing says that that caused him to confess.
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2122.778,2124.168,That's your conclusion?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2124.168,2125.012,--That's my conclusion.
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2129.182,2132.728,Does the record tell us how Edwards knew they had Soto's tape?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2132.728,2135.32,No.
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2157.483,2160.076,"That is, specifically about the tape."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2161.123,2167.525,There is nothing in the record that indicates how he knew that.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.525,2169.275,How who knew that?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2169.275,2171.118,Mr. Edwards knew that there was a tape.
1980.79-5269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2177.022,2182.832,How soon after he heard that tape did he begin to talk and make these statements?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2182.832,2185.332,--According to the record it was immediately after that.
1980.79-5269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2187.549,2196.171,Did he... what statement did he make to introduce his statement after he heard the tape recording of the accomplice?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2196.171,2209.509,"--I'm not sure where in the record it says that after he heard the tape he said, all right, I'll make a statement."
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.774,2220.723,You are defending the judgment of your court and the rationale of it?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2220.723,2228.518,"Yes, insofar as it allows the police to reinterrogate someone who has asked for counsel."
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.518,2230.594,And you agree that your case depends on waiver?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2230.594,2231.719,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.719,2236.357,That there was an indication of the right to counsel and the right to silence?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2236.357,2236.826,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.402,2245.244,And so that you have to find the elements of a waiver thereafter?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2245.244,2245.713,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2245.713,2250.242,And that you have to contend there doesn't have to be an express waiver?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2250.242,2250.71,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2250.71,2253.647,"Or a written waiver, a fortiori?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2253.647,2254.788,Or a written waiver under--
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2254.788,2258.926,Just the mere fact of being willing to answer questions?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2258.926,2267.721,"--In this situation, yes, where he was told he had the right to an attorney, he knew he had the right to an attorney, he knew if he asked for an attorney that they would stop talking--"
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2267.721,2276.483,So suppose a man in custody is given his Miranda warnings and then the officer just asks him some questions and he answers them.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2295.38,2300.878,--I think in your hypothetical you might have a more difficult time finding a waiver than we do have--
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2300.878,2301.081,"Well, why?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2301.581,2303.222,--Well--
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.222,2314.124,Because you're saying that it's easier to find a waiver after you have invoked your right to counsel and after you've invoked your right to silence than it is before?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2314.124,2325.493,"--You can make the argument that once you've invoked it, you know that you have it, that clearly indicates within the person's mind that he has those rights and what will happen if he invokes them."
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2325.493,2329.881,"Well, is that true about... that might be true about silence, but how about the attorney?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2336.707,2337.254,Maybe.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.254,2340.034,"You say, silence; maybe you are."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2340.034,2347.422,"That's the argument that's made, that when a person says, I wish to remain silent, that he is controlling his own destiny."
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.285,2375.848,"Well, what about this case?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2375.848,2383.158,"--In this case he said he'd wait till he had an attorney before he made a deal, and then when he heard the tape--"
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.158,2388.857,"Well, I know but your Supreme Court, and you're defending that, said he invoked his right to counsel--"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2388.857,2390.311,--Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.311,2392.528,--before he was to do anything.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2392.528,2393.435,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2393.435,2394.622,"All right, go ahead."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2397.759,2399.947,"Well, first, they read him his rights."
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2402.446,2414.238,"Yes, but didn't your Supreme Court also recognize that when the officers arrived the next morning and the jailor said to him, the officers are here, he said, I don't want to talk to anyone?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2418.19,2420.471,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.205,2422.844,"Well, that isn't what had happened."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2426.343,2429.373,The Supreme Court may have recognized that but it--
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2429.373,2430.669,And you recognize it?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2430.669,2443.93,"--I don't recognize that; the trial court didn't recognize that, because if that in fact happened, that would indicate it's involuntary and the trial court specifically ruled that it did not believe Mr. Edwards' testimony."
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2446.367,2447.226,How about your Supreme Court?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2447.226,2452.175,"--Well, this court can look at the same facts--"
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2452.175,2453.769,"I just asked you, how about your Supreme Court?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2454.409,2456.269,--The Supreme Court did point out that fact.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.269,2458.752,And... so that he was told that he had to?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2458.752,2460.547,They quoted from the record.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2460.547,2469.153,"Yes, and... but, nevertheless found a waiver simply from his willingness to talk thereafter."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2469.153,2469.856,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2469.856,2476.854,Wouldn't it follow from your logic that every time there's a violation of the protections of Miranda there's a waiver of them?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2476.854,2477.433,No.
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2477.433,2479.463,It sounds to me as though.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2479.463,2482.008,In this case the police--
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2482.008,2488.913,"Whenever he does talk, then he's waived the protections?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2488.913,2489.303,--No.
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2496.111,2500.735,"Well, let's say, in every such case, all right, I'll answer your questions."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2502.733,2503.374,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2503.374,2504.951,Even though--
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2528.379,2531.784,"Well, maybe that's a waiver, but that's not what you have here."
1980.79-5269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2531.784,2536.861,"Let's turn to page 71 of your Appendix, At the bottom of 71 he said,"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2581.516,2586.326,Not for the statement on the 20th.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2595.652,2597.916,"You have to get to that, don't you?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2610.91,2614.549,"--Well, I think that would be a waiver."
1980.79-5269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2617.345,2623.217,But do you suggest it has no relation to what happened on the 20th?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2623.217,2626.967,"Well, it indicates that he understands his rights."
1980.79-5269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2626.967,2630.121,And that he wants to talk to you.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2633.48,2634.339,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2634.339,2638.462,That on the 20th he put the condition that he did not want it recorded?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2638.462,2639.337,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2639.337,2658.781,"So you... essentially you say that if a fellow invokes his right to counsel and then the police then turn on a record and he listens to it and then he says something, that's a waiver?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2658.781,2665.389,I'm not sure whether that would be a waiver but that's not what we have here.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2665.389,2666.637,Why isn't that what happened here?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2666.637,2672.683,"Because what happened here is, he asked for counsel, and he was sent back to the jail."
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.683,2673.823,And your Supreme Court recognized that?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2673.823,2675.884,The next morning the police came.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.884,2676.478,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2676.478,2679.304,The officer introduced himself.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2679.304,2679.741,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2679.741,2680.929,Read him his rights.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.929,2681.569,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2681.569,2687.193,"""He replied that he would talk to me, and tell us anything we wanted to know. """
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2703.872,2708.106,"But didn't he the night before say, if you'll get me a lawyer, I'll talk to you?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2708.106,2713.557,"No, he said I'll wait till I get an attorney before I'll make a deal, before I make a statement."
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2713.557,2717.524,So didn't that apply the next morning too?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2717.524,2722.74,Our position is that he changed his mind.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.74,2725.489,"Well, he changed his mind after the jailor said, you have to talk."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2733.658,2737.735,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2737.735,2738.61,What if we don't?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2738.61,2747.966,"Well, what happens then... of course, Mr. Edwards, when he testified, said he told the detectives he didn't want to talk to them and the detectives said he never said that."
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.682,2756.274,"Well, he may not have but he certainly was told by the jailor."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2756.274,2759.21,"--Yes, but the jailor never conveyed that to the detectives."
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2759.21,2760.632,"Well, what difference does that make?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2766.021,2769.362,The detectives then tell him he has the right to remain silent.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2782.483,2785.732,Then your Supreme Court would have concluded that it was a voluntary waiver?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2785.732,2786.107,--Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2786.107,2788.902,Did the jailor dispute the statement?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2788.902,2790.338,Did what?
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2790.338,2792.87,Did the jailor dispute the statement?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2792.87,2794.603,The jailor was never called to testify.
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2794.603,2797.477,Was there any reason why he couldn't have been called?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2797.477,2799.913,There is no reason in the record indicated.
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2799.913,2808.846,"Mr. McClennen, you indicated a little while ago that the defendant knew what his right was after having requested counsel."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2808.846,2810.081,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2810.081,2814.782,What was his right after having requested counsel?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2814.782,2815.704,He had the right to an attorney.
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2815.704,2818.015,He didn't get it.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2821.295,2827.293,"Because that morning the officers again told him of his rights, specifically told him he had a right to an attorney."
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2827.293,2830.495,"You mean he had a right to an attorney if he ever went to trial, or something like that?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2830.495,2831.15,"No, they told him--"
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2831.15,2832.885,The right to an attorney at any particular point in time?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2832.885,2835.899,--They told him... again they read the rights.
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.614,2843.566,"What happens then, what is his right?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2848.143,2849.533,It's our position--
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2849.533,2852.346,"What duty, if any, does it impose upon the police?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2852.346,2854.422,--If he says--
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2854.422,2856.905,"He said, I want a lawyer."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2859.466,2861.574,--They cannot question him further--
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2861.574,2862.324,But then they did.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2862.324,2864.121,--unless he changes his mind.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2864.121,2873.944,"Well, yes, but all that happened after that... supposing they start interrogating, they give him his Miranda warnings, and he says, I want a lawyer."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2882.364,2884.566,It might be.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2884.566,2889.222,"Well, in this case, they gave him his Miranda warnings and he said, I want a lawyer."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2891.923,2894.657,"And he says, I'll answer your questions."
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2894.657,2895.344,"--He says, I'll talk."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2895.344,2897.155,But first I want to hear the tape.
1980.79-5269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2899.435,2910.93,"Supposing they give him his Miranda warnings and he says, I want a lawyer, but before I get the lawyer, I want to tell you my side of the story?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2910.93,2918.631,Then that would be a selective waiver which would allow him to tell them his side of the story.
1980.79-5269,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2920.52,2927.331,"A request for a lawyer isn't an automatic refusal to talk further, is it?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2927.331,2937.937,"Well, this Court has said in Fare v. Michael C. that the request for an attorney is a per se indication of the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent."
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2978.06,2981.388,But that's not this case.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2987.527,2988.652,Said what?
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2988.652,2990.336,That he could waive his right.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,2990.336,2995.6,"There's nothing where he specifically says, all right, I will talk to you without an attorney."
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2999.615,3011.938,"Well, suppose, the night before, after they stopped questioning him, they took him in another room and this new officer came in and gave him his warnings?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3013.968,3018.841,I guess the man--
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3018.841,3025.011,"I mean, once the man says I want a lawyer, he wants a lawyer."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3025.011,3029.587,--That assumes that he can never again change his mind.
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3029.587,3031.523,I think he can change his mind.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3031.523,3032.554,What if he's--
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3032.554,3035.772,And I think he can express it when he changes it.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3051.531,3052.281,--Right.
1980.79-5269,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3054.015,3057.466,"You don't think those are good regulations, do you?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3061.387,3063.776,"Well, yes."
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3090.577,3113.351,"Mr. McClennen, then, in your primary brief you state in Footnote 47, on page 24, that the Respondent State acknowledges that the petitioner was formally charged by the State on January 19, 1976."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3116.551,3116.91,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3130.062,3131.686,Kirby v. Illinois.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3131.686,3141.386,"Well, in Kirby v. Illinois, there was one point it said, ""adversary judicial proceedings""... and then it said, ""adversary judicial criminal proceedings""."
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3161.97,3163.642,"Well, of course, every State is different."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3178.573,3181.885,"--Well, I conceded that the State had filed a complaint."
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3186.71,3187.71,"Well, you conceded that it did in your brief."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3187.71,3191.147,In our supplemental brief we reconsidered our position.
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3191.147,3194.02,Because you cited a case arising in a New York procedure.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3194.02,3195.598,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3195.598,3202.939,"And you acknowledge, I'm sure you agree with me, that each State is somewhat different in its criminal procedures."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3202.939,3203.547,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3203.547,3208.733,What did the Supreme Court of Arizona indicate about--
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3208.733,3220.899,"It never said anything on that issue, and another matter is that at the motion to suppress it was never argued that the confession should have been suppressed because the Sixth Amendment had started."
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3223.477,3227.834,"--At this point, Mr. McClellan, just so I understand the State procedure."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3230.333,3230.786,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3230.786,3233.16,--but say they had not filed an indictment.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3238.19,3238.955,No.
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3238.955,3240.299,He would not have been able to do that?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3240.299,3240.564,No.
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3275.237,3277.034,"Well, it's your present position."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3278.158,3280.329,"No, it's our position--"
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3280.329,3282.905,"And all through this litigation it hasn't been your position, as I understand it."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3282.905,3283.234,--No.
1980.79-5269,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3287.045,3289.7,"Well, how do we know what the Arizona law is?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3302.976,3304.537,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3304.537,3307.551,Maybe he's entitled to an attorney even if he hasn't been formally charged.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3307.551,3309.738,"Right, under Miranda he's entitled to an attorney."
1980.79-5269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3309.738,3313.206,"Custody is the fulcrum of Miranda, is it not?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3313.206,3313.675,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3313.675,3314.519,Not charge.
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3327.013,3327.606,Yes.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3362.108,3372.933,"Well, even if it were, do you say that... assume that it was, would you say Massiah takes over if an attorney hasn't been appointed yet?"
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3372.933,3377.337,It doesn't matter whether the attorney is appointed.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3377.43,3378.461,What case have you got for that?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3379.617,3381.209,--McLeod v. Ohio.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3386.239,3390.565,Even if he has no lawyer?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3390.565,3391.534,Right.
1980.79-5269,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3391.534,3394.345,And even if he can hire his own lawyer?
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3394.345,3395.297,Right.
1980.79-5269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3462.49,3464.708,"Your time has expired now, Mr. McClennen."
1980.79-5269,1,19604,crane_mcclennen,,3464.708,3467.769,"--He knew he had the right to an attorney, and in this case he waived it."
1980.79-5269,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3471.815,3476.046,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Meehan?"
1980.79-5269,2,36260,michael_j_meehan,,3476.046,3477.905,"One or two items, if I may."
