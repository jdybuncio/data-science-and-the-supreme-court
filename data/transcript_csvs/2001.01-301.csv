2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.545,"We'll hear argument next in No. 01-301, Tom L. Carey v. Tony Eugene Saffold."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,24.315,54.863,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: AEDPA's language, purpose, and legislative history supports the conclusion that the circuit conflict over the meaning of pending in 28 U.S.C., section 2244 (d)(2) can be resolved by reversing the Ninth Circuit for one or more of the following three reasons."
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,96.185,109.781,"Mr. Cross, would you explain to us what it is in California... what is the system and the time within which post-conviction relief can be applied for in California courts?"
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,114.594,118.765,"--It's within a reasonable time, Your Honor, the general rule of timeliness."
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.245,205.988,All right.
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,209.787,210.734,Pardon?
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,210.734,217.217,"Here there was a prompt filing at the trial court level for habeas, State habeas."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,217.217,221.675,"I would... Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree that it was prompt since he waited 5 years--"
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.675,222.335,"Well, all right."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,234.983,239.88,--He filed his claim with 7 days remaining--
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.88,240.456,Okay.
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,240.456,242.935,--in the grace period of the statute of limitations.
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.935,255.4,"Now, after the trial court resolved it and denied relief, then there's no review mechanism other than filing an original writ with the court of appeals?"
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,255.4,255.938,Correct.
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.938,256.72,Is that how it's done?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,256.72,257.834,"Correct, in California."
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,257.834,265.348,And is that again a reasonable time period within which to seek review by that mechanism in the court of appeals?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,267.372,273.521,"As far as the... the time between each original petition, there is no time limit."
2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,285.781,290.157,"Well, that's the traditional rule in habeas corpus, at least in... in England."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,290.157,290.694,Correct.
2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,290.694,291.233,Wasn't it?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,298.701,299.445,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2001.01-301,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,299.445,310.59,"But if he goes... if he's... I take it, under the California system, if he starts in the Supreme Court of California, and there's a fact issue, they're going to say, go back to the trial court and start there."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,313.069,320.954,"In fact, Your Honor, I'd like to correct a misunderstanding that's promoted by the respondent's brief."
2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,336.475,338.333,Whereabouts on page 31?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,338.333,344.027,"--On page 31 at the top paragraph, there's a reference in the third line to In re Hillery."
2001.01-301,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,405.411,407.268,"Well, what happens--"
2001.01-301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.268,409.293,"--So, you... you can begin in a higher court."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,409.293,410.036,Yes.
2001.01-301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.036,410.779,You don't have to begin--
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,410.779,411.355,"Right, correct."
2001.01-301,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,411.355,415.237,--What happens if you do begin in a higher court and... and there are disputed factual issues?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,416.845,421.924,"The... that is explained, Your Honor, in Harris v. Superior Court, the Ninth Circuit opinion--"
2001.01-301,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,421.924,422.667,"Well, I haven't read--"
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,422.667,424.086,--Why don't you tell us?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,424.086,425.351,"--I will tell you, Your Honor."
2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,453.048,461.427,"Did... in the proceedings involved in this particular case, did either of the appellate courts go the... do that?"
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,461.427,462.503,--No.
2001.01-301,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,473.937,475.339,But in this--
2001.01-301,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,475.339,476.538,--What happens just as a practical matter?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,515.63,529.952,"The forms, Your Honor, are in the joint appendix where you are expected to indicate... it's... all three petitions use the same judicial counsel form."
2001.01-301,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,560.872,562.563,"Well, it's just background."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,564.066,567.476,The... that's the extent of it.
2001.01-301,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,592.08,612.058,"Well, getting to the issue in the case, the respondent's brief points out that under the theory you propose, what would happen if it's the... the State that's appealing or filing a new... not appealing, but filing a new action?"
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,624.69,629.603,"That is the most difficult question that is posed, without question, Your Honor."
2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,652.182,657.755,This is the case where the petitioner prevails--
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,657.755,658.126,--Right.
2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,658.126,663.988,"--in superior court, and by statute, now California allows the State to appeal that."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,663.988,664.898,"Correct, Your Honor."
2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,664.898,668.241,"Well, certainly that would be... that would be pending all that time, would it not?"
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,668.241,670.099,If you--
2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.099,671.13,Or would it not?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,671.13,679.22,"--If you take the position that it's not an appellate system in a State like California, I don't think it would be."
2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,679.22,689.047,"Well, but you know, it can... it could be not an appellate system from the point of view of the petitioner who has to have an original petition each... each time he goes again to a new court."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,697.963,701.594,"For California... under California law, Your Honor, absolutely."
2001.01-301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,708.942,710.445,"So, looking at how Federal law--"
2001.01-301,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,710.445,712.574,"--But I... but... if... if I may, just one moment, Justice Breyer."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,734.576,754.062,"I think there is a bigger problem because if there is... it depends on when finality occurs, and if... if you have an original proceeding and the decision is final upon that decision, the clock would, I would assume, start at least under California law."
2001.01-301,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,759.347,763.655,"Well, but the Chief Justice suggests it's not rocket science for us to say it's still pending if there's an appeal."
2001.01-301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.655,766.156,"Well, I... I thought your--"
2001.01-301,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,766.156,766.899,--Or am I missing something?
2001.01-301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.899,767.809,I am confused now.
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,775.239,776.187,--Correct.
2001.01-301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,776.187,776.93,--on the appeal.
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,786.589,787.515,Right.
2001.01-301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,787.515,788.614,There is an appeal?
2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.564,803.103,Superior.
2001.01-301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,803.103,807.561,But almost always they'll go to the superior court and file a petition.
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,893.215,916.166,"What's wrong with what you said, Your Honor, first of all, is that although California may say that it's final at that level, it does not prevent the individual from going to either of the other two next levels or skipping one and going to the other because they are in fact original and in fact not... it's more than just mere semantics because they can go to California with different claims."
2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,918.057,928.427,"Justice Breyer suggests that when you go, say, from the superior court to the district court of appeal, it's... it's like an appeal."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,935.651,937.88,Typically not.
2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,944.773,949.686,Do you have to file a notice of appeal in the superior court to go to the district court of appeal?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,949.686,950.346,"No, Your Honor."
2001.01-301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,950.346,953.956,"In other words, in the... I've never heard of this, and I know a lot of California lawyers."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1000.13,1004.671,"The California case law, in fact, indicates that--"
2001.01-301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1004.671,1006.424,I'm not interested in California case law.
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1010.327,1014.413,--The practice is quite different from the description that you gave.
2001.01-301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1014.413,1015.074,Fine.
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1015.612,1033.194,"In fact, there are... I don't have the exact statistics, but in my 15 years of experience in practicing, I have seen probably around 40 to 50 percent of the cases not go to the trial court, that in fact, very commonly they go directly to the California Supreme Court, and they are denied."
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1037.109,1041.634,Then can they go... start over again and go down to the trial court and the court of appeals?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1041.634,1043.969,"--Not... Your Honor, not on those same claims, they certainly can't."
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1057.715,1064.214,There's no bar in California to going back as many times as you want if you have a new claim each time?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1064.214,1071.09,"--There are escape clauses in California, as well as other States, that... that allow you, if you discover, just like the Federal statute, new claims."
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1071.09,1071.544,All right.
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1107.499,1110.061,AEDPA grants--
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1110.061,1111.669,Is that what a majority of courts are holding?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1111.669,1121.7,--The majority of courts are holding that... and the statute specifically provides for tolling for all the time in which the decision... excuse me... in which the petition is before a court.
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1124.012,1139.078,"Well, yes, but is it... is it the case that most courts are holding, under the scheme I described, that not only while the court is deciding it, but the time allowed to enable them to go to the next higher court is excluded as well?"
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1139.078,1147.251,"The majority of courts are holding that you will get time for the appeal time that's specified by the State, for example, 60 days or 90 days."
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1147.251,1147.789,"Yes, all right."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1165.827,1166.958,One--
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1166.958,1167.718,What do we do?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1167.718,1184.403,"--One suggestion that was made in the amicus briefs by the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation is to adopt the nearest analogous State rule, which in California under rule 2 or 30 through 31 would be 60 days."
2001.01-301,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1192.743,1194.767,Wouldn't that be up to California to do?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1203.701,1227.75,"--I think, Your Honor, the way to determine a reasonable time would be to look at the California rules for their original habeas petitions and determine that under California law, we know that... that you are expected to file no longer than 90 days in a capital case without having a presumption of timeliness--"
2001.01-301,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1227.75,1228.409,May I just interrupt--
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1228.409,1232.579,--And that would be the absolute outside limit for a determination of what would be reasonable.
2001.01-301,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1232.579,1234.27,--But may I just ask this question?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1246.241,1248.016,"No, Your Honor."
2001.01-301,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1266.759,1271.876,"To excuse untimeliness, they're saying in this particular case we think it must have been reasonable."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1274.311,1277.366,"--In this particular case, they said he acted with a lack of diligence."
2001.01-301,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1277.366,1278.648,But that might have been--
2001.01-301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.648,1280.255,"--No, but it didn't excuse untimeliness."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1283.682,1284.879,"In this case, absolutely."
2001.01-301,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1284.879,1289.42,We don't know whether that untimeliness was the 5 years that he took to even get started.
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1360.092,1368.858,"Your Honor, this situation is even more perplexing than what you set forth because there are three possibilities."
2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1387.13,1412.122,"Well, and also I think what is meant by pending because if... if we were... if it were determined that these separate matters, as you say, before three different courts were pending only during the time those particular courts had them for consideration, it might be quite a different result than if you say look at the reasonableness of the whole series of proceedings together."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1412.122,1415.382,"Your Honor, absolutely that is correct."
2001.01-301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1416.191,1419.33,"Mr. Cross, as... as I understand your submission, it doesn't matter."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1431.712,1432.927,--Right.
2001.01-301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1432.927,1433.487,Right?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1433.487,1457.718,"The California Supreme Court holding and the... the problem it presents for the statute is... is that it eviscerates the statute by holding that as long as... as the State Supreme Court addresses the merits, that regardless of the length of the delay, which could be not just 4-and-a-half months in this case, but 4-and-a-half years or 4-and-a-half decades, they will excuse the delay."
2001.01-301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1457.718,1462.631,But isn't the... the answer that... your... your friends on the other side give a... a good answer.
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1493.673,1499.496,"Your Honor, the answer to that is that this is a Federal statute not a State statute."
2001.01-301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1500.832,1520.877,"It is a Federal statute that is keyed to a State statute, and the point of doing this is to preserve the State's interest in... in finality in their own proceedings and to... to protect the State from being forced, in effect, to retry cases years and years in the future after the... the evidence has grown stale."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1520.877,1522.651,--That's--
2001.01-301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1522.651,1534.706,"And if that... if those are the objectives of the statute... and I thought they were... then California, in effect, or any State can control the proceedings simply by its own time schedule."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1534.706,1543.828,"--Your Honor, that is certainly one of the objectives of the statute, but there are a number of policy interests related to the statute of limitations itself which is part of AEDPA."
2001.01-301,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1553.366,1565.005,"Mr. Cross, a State Supreme Court that had that attitude, that didn't care that you were late, would not... would not have dismissed this case on two grounds, one of which is it's untimely."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1580.941,1582.427,"That's absolutely right, Your Honor."
2001.01-301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1582.427,1584.778,Isn't the counter argument equally possible?
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1607.441,1618.753,"I think, Your Honor, this Court has stated before in Coleman v. Thompson that we... that you don't want to direct the State courts how to issue their rulings for whatever State reasons they have for doing it."
2001.01-301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1618.753,1626.555,"No, but when the State says two things and they seem to be in contradiction... if it's untimely, then you don't get to the merits."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1673.488,1678.855,"Your Honor, because it would, in effect, eviscerate the statute of limitations under Federal law."
2001.01-301,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1690.678,1703.476,"What's left is a 1-year Federal statute of limitations after the conclusion of the State proceedings, and if the State proceedings were begun in a timely fashion, I don't know what else the statute is supposed to accomplish."
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1703.476,1716.296,"--Well, Your Honor, the statute... statutory schemes across the country... there's a wide variety, of which there are over 20 States that have no statute of limitations."
2001.01-301,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1716.296,1724.469,"Do you know how the California Supreme Court operates generally with respect to petitions of this kind, post-conviction petitions?"
2001.01-301,0,41159,stanley_a_cross,,1734.872,1737.844,"It's usually a combination, Your Honor."
2001.01-301,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1755.677,1757.33,"Very well, Mr. Cross."
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,1758.938,1794.565,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to go directly to the two most difficult questions that I need to answer this morning and which have been addressed extensively thus far."
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1811.572,1814.105,What happens if it... go on.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,1814.665,1830.352,"--And... and the second point that I'd like to address is that under that rule on the record in this case, there is an insufficient basis to conclude that the filing in the State Supreme Court was late and therefore that the judgment below should be affirmed."
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.352,1835.349,--Are you going to cover the question of whether these various actions were pending and for how long?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,1835.349,1836.175,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.591,1865.647,The text of AEDPA or the text of California's statute?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,1865.647,1868.719,"--Of AEDPA, Your Honor, of... of section 2244(d)(2)."
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1936.624,1941.975,You... you say the... the application is distinct from the claim.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,1945.606,1951.839,The claims are the arguments that support the request for relief in... in a habeas or post-conviction context.
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.606,1972.644,"But, you know, we were confronted with precisely the same argument in Artuz which dealt with what constitutes a properly filed application."
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,1999.682,2000.775,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2056.775,2066.722,"Or presumably you could go back and forth to a number of California courts, if you come up with, you know, a different argument and that sort of thing."
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2066.722,2070.603,"Yes, Your Honor, you could present different claims."
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2135.658,2139.456,What do you mean... what do you mean by a... do you mean the same thing as an original petition?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2139.456,2141.564,--It's called an original writ.
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2141.564,2142.14,Yes.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2144.369,2163.483,"Successive petition is a procedural bar under California law, which if you bring a second petition that contains claims that could have been, but were not, contained in your first petition or that contains the same claims as were contained in your first petition, it's dismissed as a matter of procedural law in California as a successive petition."
2001.01-301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2165.834,2167.691,What does it look like in practice?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2227.135,2230.478,"--Well... well, it's... it is difficult because so much of this turns on California law."
2001.01-301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2231.237,2232.707,"I mean, what does it look like?"
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2234.443,2239.766,"--Well, what... what it looks like, as described in a case called In re Resendez, which is not cited in our brief is--"
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2239.766,2240.471,You didn't--
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2240.471,2243.936,"--19 P. 2d, Pacific Second, 1171."
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2243.936,2245.794,--What's the date of that case?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2245.794,2247.28,"It's 2001, Your Honor."
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2247.28,2248.766,Pacific Second?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2248.766,2252.769,"Pacific Third, 1171 at 1184."
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2270.414,2273.014,"When you say it is then filed, what do you mean by it?"
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2273.014,2278.504,--A petition encompassing the same claims is filed in the court of appeal and then again in the supreme court.
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2311.469,2318.035,"Mr.... Mr. Cross said... and it would be extraordinary if it's record review, but you don't have to file the record."
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2323.441,2326.496,You certainly can file the record and the clerk can request it.
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2326.496,2327.035,Do you have to?
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2327.035,2327.611,Do you have to?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2327.611,2330.683,"I don't know the answer to that, Your Honor, as to whether it's required."
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2330.683,2331.781,Is it ordinarily done?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2331.781,2336.611,I... I think ordinarily there... the record consists of the petition and the decision below.
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2342.1,2344.246,That's not what the... that's not what Mr. Cross said.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2344.246,2344.906,--That's--
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2344.906,2351.016,"What is your... I mean, Mr. Cross apparently has been practicing in California for 15 years."
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2356.506,2357.538,"--No, I don't, Your Honor."
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.538,2358.175,Okay.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2360.964,2369.509,"Well, I... I cite for the proposition that... that the record is part of the... the process in the court of appeal, both the Resendez case--"
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2369.509,2373.225,But you say the record is part of the process in the court of appeal.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2374.794,2375.537,--Well--
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2375.537,2381.481,"What we want to know is typically in an appeal, you'd have a record from the superior court."
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2389.738,2452.73,"--The best I can do, Your Honor, is to refer to these three cases... the Resendez case, the California Supreme Court decision at... which I've given the cite for; In re Wright, which is 78 Cal. App. 3d at 801 to 802; People against Singer, which is 226 Cal. App. 3d at 32... which make clear that the process of reviewing these matters coming from the superior court where there's been a prior petition there and the same claims are brought in the next court is a process of reviewing the record, and where what is presented are findings of fact by the superior court that are based on credibility determinations, great weight is given to those credibility determinations by the reviewing court."
2001.01-301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2463.975,2466.104,You've practiced here a lot.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2489.322,2492.111,"Well, no, Your Honor, they're not permitted to, and I think that's a very important--"
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.111,2499.83,We wouldn't issue habeas when... when you have failed to exhaust all of your State remedies whether it's by appeal or not by appeal.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2505.94,2523.607,"--This... this Court's decision in the O'Sullivan case has been applied by the Ninth Circuit in... in the case called James against Giles, which states that it is a requirement, in order to fully exhaust one's State remedies, that one file and submit one's claims to the California Supreme Court."
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2523.607,2527.655,"Of course, and that applies whether it's an appeal or whether it's an independent action."
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2530.999,2531.659,"Well, I--"
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2531.659,2535.867,"Whichever one it is, you have to exhaust those remedies before you apply for Federal habeas."
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2535.867,2549.325,"--I think it sheds substantial light on it, Your Honor, because as was made clear in Duncan against Walker by this Court, the very purpose of this tolling provision is to facilitate and to, indeed, promote the full and complete exhaustion of State remedies."
2001.01-301,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2549.325,2549.863,Okay.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2578.115,2581.897,I believe the appropriate course for the Federal court in that situation--
2001.01-301,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2581.897,2582.39,What would you do?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2582.39,2587.387,--would be to apply this Court's decision in O'Sullivan against Boerckel and deem the petition to be unexhausted.
2001.01-301,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2591.473,2597.046,And say it is unexhausted and... and the... a Federal statute of limitations hasn't run.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2597.046,2600.473,Because simply it's unknowable.
2001.01-301,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2621.938,2622.681,Okay.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2645.937,2651.204,"That implicates a... a circuit split that's not presented in this case, Your Honor."
2001.01-301,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2663.01,2666.536,What is the position that you urge upon us here in that instance?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2666.536,2679.895,"--Your Honor, I don't believe it's... it is important for my client what the answer to that question is because the second point I want to make this morning is that the submission to the California Supreme Court was not late under California law."
2001.01-301,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2679.895,2685.218,"I'm trying to... I'm trying to interpret the statute, and so I imagined this case and I want to know how it would come out--"
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2685.218,2686.044,I think the most--
2001.01-301,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2686.044,2686.498,--under your view.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2686.498,2687.53,--I'm sorry.
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2705.008,2706.644,Retroactively.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2743.425,2744.455,--Your Honor--
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2744.455,2748.255,None of those problems exist if you... if you say it's pending when it's pending.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2748.255,2758.657,--I think those problems are more complicated in a system like California's or North Carolina's which is an appellate system that involves an unreasonable delay standard than they are in a... in a system that has clear time lines.
2001.01-301,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2765.466,2766.292,Mr. Ogden--
2001.01-301,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2766.292,2768.4,--Just so... just so I understand your answer.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2780.948,2784.413,--I... I believe there are about three different ways that you can--
2001.01-301,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2784.413,2788.295,And what is... what is your submission as to how we ought to interpret the rule in that instance?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2788.295,2805.773,"--My submission would be that until the California Supreme Court indicates how long the time period is that... that he would have had to file, the best thing to do is to look to evidence of other cases that have been decided by California to determine what is an acceptable gap in the process."
2001.01-301,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2816.076,2816.902,How is that?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2835.106,2837.541,"Well, the only evidence in the record is that he did not."
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2916.097,2929.556,Is... is there any... some possibility that those perhaps inconsistent rulings coming from the Supreme Court of California might be based on what Mr. Cross referred to as the division of opinion within that court as to whether they should give any sort of an explanation?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2929.556,2938.844,"--Your Honor, I think anything is possible because, as... as somebody said, we're in a mind-reading mode here, and so certainly that's possible."
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2955.85,2958.368,That's not the basis on which the Ninth Circuit decided the case.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,2974.26,2977.232,"--I think it's somewhat unclear what the Ninth Circuit's basis was, Your Honor."
2001.01-301,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2996.058,3002.457,What would you say to the possibility that we might certify the question to the California Supreme Court whether this case was dismissed because it was untimely?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3002.457,3019.214,The critical question would be whether the case was dismissed based on the gap between the court of appeal and the supreme court as opposed to the... the portion that preceded the original filing in the... in the trial court which obviously could not make the case stop pending once it began to pend.
2001.01-301,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3030.731,3049.185,Have... have any courts considering this AEDPA statute applied it in the way Justice Scalia suggests that we look at pending and place all the emphasis there and exclude all time after a decision by a State court until the next filing?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3049.185,3058.018,"--11 courts of appeals have considered that issue to this point, Your Honor, and all 11 have adopted the view that the entire period of time should be tolled."
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3058.018,3061.362,Were any of them dealing with a system like California's?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3061.362,3067.677,"The Ninth Circuit in this case and in the Nino case previously, but no other... no other... none of the other cases really deal with that--"
2001.01-301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3067.677,3074.199,Can we use Justice Scalia... he just suggested an idea that... that... if this is right factually as to how it works.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3102.806,3103.799,--That's my understanding.
2001.01-301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3103.799,3108.378,"But then if in fact I wait too long, I'm beyond a reasonable time."
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3108.378,3109.493,That's correct.
2001.01-301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3109.493,3124.232,"And so, to put in terms of exhausted, unexhausted as if he did... as he did, you'd say the only unexhausted remedy you have left to you, once you're in the superior court, is to go up, as long as you do it within a reasonable time."
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3127.492,3128.44,That's correct.
2001.01-301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3128.44,3129.062,All right.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3148.686,3156.759,"Well, I think the general description is fine and I think it's true that we don't know whether it was considered unreasonable by the California Supreme Court."
2001.01-301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3156.759,3169.186,"--I mean, I can't see how we can accept the Ninth Circuit's reasoning frankly because they said the very fact that they say both, the very fact that they say we'll consider it on the merits but it's untimely, that that means that it wasn't untimely."
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3174.592,3183.508,"Your Honor, I think that we... it's... while we don't know, I think that a fair reading of this record would lead one to the conclusion that it was not the 4-and-a-half months."
2001.01-301,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3187.678,3190.363,"But it's way beyond what any other State would have, isn't it?"
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3195.192,3198.452,"--Well, North Carolina has an undue delay standard."
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3248.773,3249.971,This was a Federal magistrate?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3249.971,3255.999,"--The Federal magistrate, yes, Your Honor, in... in this case applying the Federal due diligence standard."
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3349.91,3360.972,"Didn't the... didn't the superior court here, or at least the magistrate did, made a specific finding to the effect that the 4-month delay was not excusable, that it was an excessive delay?"
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3362.829,3367.509,--The magistrate did not find that he received notice earlier than he says.
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3373.437,3379.482,But it was a finding that the 4-month period was the... was a period of inexcusable delay.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3379.482,3382.148,He indicated... suggested that he would not--
2001.01-301,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3382.148,3386.606,"So, to say that that couldn't have been what the supreme court was thinking of strikes me as implausible."
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3386.606,3389.224,"--Your Honor, I'm not saying that it couldn't be."
2001.01-301,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3392.096,3394.342,But that wasn't reviewed by the Ninth Circuit.
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3394.342,3395.151,No.
2001.01-301,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3410.589,3419.839,"I do... I do want, if I can, very quickly to get to the question that Mr. Cross said was very difficult and you raise it at pages 24 and 25 of your brief."
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3439.446,3441.508,I believe it's 30 days in California.
2001.01-301,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3441.508,3445.102,"So, then... so, then it seems to me that isn't a problem."
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3458.681,3475.955,"Well, I think it's a very hard question for him because his... his gap theory taken to its literal extreme, taken to... to the application that it would... that... that gaps are not tolled, even in a... an appeals situation, would cause that entire period of time on the State's clock to run."
2001.01-301,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3475.955,3479.503,But why can't we easily say the application is pending so long as the State has an appeal--
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3479.503,3480.685,"Well, that--"
2001.01-301,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3480.685,3481.261,--prevail?
2001.01-301,1,21321,david_w_ogden,,3481.261,3489.806,--That would... that would undermine the so-called gap theory in every State but... but California where typically you do have appeals on both sides.
2001.01-301,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3567.37,3568.485,"Thank you, Mr. Ogden."
2001.01-301,2,41159,stanley_a_cross,,3570.343,3578.887,"I think the answer to Mr. Ogden, Your Honor, is that the reason would be that Congress was concerned about undue delay."
2001.01-301,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3633.008,3634.781,"Thank you, Mr. Cross."
