1965.65,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,36.125,39.07,May it please the Court.
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,3384.257,3388.598,"Yes, Your Honors please."
1965.65,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3935.058,3938.289,You're reading from a brief filed by the Solicitor General?
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,3938.289,3939.991,No sir.
1965.65,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3947.199,3947.421,I see.
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,3947.421,3948.525,-- Solicitor General Cox.
1965.65,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3948.525,3950.034,Thank you.
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,3950.034,3964.463,"Recently, in 1964 this Court has decided the cases of Griffin, Barr, Bouie, Bell and Robinson, all in the 378 U. S."
1965.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5322.294,5333.398,What page is that you're reading from Mr. Bloch in Bell versus Maryland?
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,5333.398,5339.332,"Your Honor, it's in your dissent and I don't know, I've got 370 U. S. 326."
1965.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5349.906,5351.703,Was there any footnote cited to that?
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,5351.703,5352.515,Sir?
1965.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5352.515,5355.645,"Was there any footnote cited to that, you recall?"
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,5355.645,5375.1,"I don't recall, but let me see, I may have it here."
1965.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5383.093,5392.716,"I thought you read the sentence, did you not, that section of the amendment called upon like other sections is a prohibition against certain conduct only when done by the state?"
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,5392.716,5393.764,Yes sir.
1965.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5393.764,5396.628,There was a footnote that I thought there was and I just found it.
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,5396.628,5406.14,"This section is the amendment unlike other sections is the way I read, is a prohibition against certain conduct and only when done by a state that unlike wrong --"
1965.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5406.14,5420.491,"-- unlike other sections and the quote Section 5 in note 11, the Congress shall have power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article."
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,5420.491,5422.681,Did that -- is the unlike wrong here?
1965.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5422.681,5424.197,"Yes, it's unlikely."
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,5424.197,5429.225,It should be like â€“ How does it read?
1965.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5429.225,5446.091,"The Congress -- or unlike other sections and then the note says Section 5, it says if the first section of the amendment applies only to states and state action unlike other sections and that in the footnote."
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,5446.091,5447.144,But this is where we have it.
1965.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5455.324,5461.752,"Yes, and -- on the other section -- it was in the other section referred to with Section 5 or whatever it was."
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,5461.752,5466.278,I understood the other sections to refer the first four sections of the amendment.
1965.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5466.278,5476.439,"Well, it's -- the note says that Section 5 -- Section 5 is the one that gives the Congress the power to enforce by appropriate legislation."
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,5476.439,5481.452,"Like I mean, Section 5 the appropriate legislation section."
1965.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5485.373,5486.355,Yes but --
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,5486.355,5489.145,It turned like the other section it applies only to the state action.
1965.65,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5489.145,5505.427,"In other words what I was pointing out was for whatever maybe it worth, what you read did not say as I read it that Section 5 applied only to the State, state action."
1965.65,1,18419,charles_j_bloch,,5505.427,5509.486,As I read it -- what you --
1965.65,2,31011,james_e_hudson,,5878.217,5895.55,"If the Court pleases, one part here that I think should be brought out relative to the Fourteenth Amendment right that Mr. Bloch, I thought did not cover and that is the holding in the Williams case that the government seem to be relying on so heavily."
1965.65,3,18419,charles_j_bloch,,6781.245,6782.005,Yes.
1965.65,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6782.005,6782.089,You may say it (Voice Overlap)
1965.65,3,18419,charles_j_bloch,,6782.089,6791.151,I would like to call your attention of the Court to the facts that United States versus Wheeler is discussed.
1965.65,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6813.414,6816.064,And the lower court relied upon Wheeler didn't it --
1965.65,3,18419,charles_j_bloch,,6816.064,6816.512,Sir?
1965.65,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6816.512,6821.699,That the lower court here relied upon Wheeler?
1965.65,3,18419,charles_j_bloch,,6821.699,6825.349,I think the lower of court have not denied it upon Wheeler in our case.
1965.65,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6827.101,6828.413,And so do you?
1965.65,3,18419,charles_j_bloch,,6828.413,6840.442,"The District Judge below apparently relied heavily on Wheeler is shown by his frequent citations of it in his opinion, in the transcript pointing it to 33."
1965.65,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6851.749,6853.278,Mr. Solicitor General?
1965.65,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6853.278,6858.976,Unless any questions we will waive the three or four minutes we have and submit.
1965.65,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6858.976,6861.413,Very well.
