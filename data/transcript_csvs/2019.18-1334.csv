2019.18-1334,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.1,11.82,"We'll hear argument today in Case 18-1334, the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico versus Aurelius Investment, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Verrilli."
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,11.82,38.265,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether members of the Financial Oversight Board are officers of the United States who must be selected in the manner that the Appointments Clause prescribes or whether they are instead territorial officers who do not have to be selected in that manner. The Constitution's text, structure, and history, and this Court's precedents all make clear that the proper focus in answering that question is the nature of the authority the Board exercises."
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,142.86,143.1,So how --
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,143.1,144.7,-- not officers of the United States.
2019.18-1334,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,144.7,145.23,Mister --
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,145.23,173.205,"-- how can that be, Mr. Verrilli? It seems to me that your very argument that it's independent is suggesting it can't belong to the territory and that there's a serious problem that the federal government is creating an entity that no one can control. Neither Congress nor the President can remove this entity for anything but cause. Tell me how this differs from a U.S. attorney."
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,196.9,208.275,"So let me make a general point, and then I'll specifically answer the U.S. attorney question. The general point, I think it's important to make clear, we don't say, contrary to our friends on the other side, that the Appointments Clause doesn't apply in Puerto Rico."
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,217.93,218.79,Could you do this -- could you pass --
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,218.79,219.81,-- including the U.S. attorney.
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,219.81,225.205,-- could you pass -- could Congress pass a law that -- like PROMESA for a state?
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,225.205,230.02,"No, I don't think so, because the difference between that situation and this situation is Article IV."
2019.18-1334,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,250.45,250.64,Could you --
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,250.64,251.93,-- its substantive territorial law.
2019.18-1334,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,251.93,253.73,-- could you give at least a quick answer --
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,253.73,253.89,Sure.
2019.18-1334,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,254.01,255.77,-- to the first part of Justice Sotomayor's question?
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,255.77,256.165,Yes.
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,278.32,287.605,"But all laws don't have nationwide application, even federal laws. Some federal laws have local application as opposed to national."
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,293.175,293.545,But --
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,293.545,296.53,This is no different for the U.S. attorney.
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,296.53,300.45,"I do think it's different in a fundamental way, Your Honor."
2019.18-1334,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,311.04,322.56,"Well, Mr. Verrilli, I mean, suppose that Congress looks at Florida and it says that there are a lot of hurricanes there and the waters are rising, and we have a terrible Florida problem."
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,351.015,351.645,Yes.
2019.18-1334,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,353.59,356.97,"No, I was just going to say, what is the difference, Mr. Verrilli? (Laughter.)"
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,356.97,369.39,"And the difference -- and the difference is -- and the difference is that -- that Congress has dual authority with respect to the territories to act under Article I with nation -- laws of nationwide application, which are enforced by federal officials."
2019.18-1334,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,384.99,388.435,"Well, how do we know which -- which authority it's using?"
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,388.435,392.86,"Well, you look -- I -- I think as -- we think Palmore is the relevant precedent there."
2019.18-1334,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,404.26,404.51,What -- what's --
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,404.51,405.46,"-- language of the statute, entity --"
2019.18-1334,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,405.46,412.13,"-- what's the argument, Mr. Verrilli -- you started with this is an -- this is an entity within the Puerto Rico government."
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,421.90999995,426.31,"Yes, and that's -- and that's simply an incorrect characterization."
2019.18-1334,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,460.77,464.51,"Well, wasn't Congress thinking about the broad interests of the United States? I mean, here it was."
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,495.065,516.32,"First, I think what matters is what Congress did, not what the motivations of individual legislatures were in moving forward with what Congress did. Second, the best evidence of what Congress did is the statute itself, where it made a choice to create an entity in Puerto Rico and it instructed it to act on behalf of Puerto Rico."
2019.18-1334,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,533.89,556.71,"Counsel, what if we don't think it's an all or nothing division when you look at the responsibilities of the Board? I mean, certainly much of it has to do with territorial issues, but you can certainly appreciate congressmen viewing this obviously as something with nationwide significance. So, to some extent, it's dealing with territorial issues."
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,562.59,578.49,"I think it's -- I think the answer is the same, because what matters is the power that Congress chose to invoke and the way in which Congress chose to act. And what Congress did here was tell the Board the way to address this problem is by acting in the interests of Puerto Rico."
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,583.7,610.98,"May I ask you, if we had the original act setting up the U.S. Attorney for Puerto Rico and Congress changed only one label of the three Palmore factors, same factual situation as exists now, except that it says we're doing it under the territorial clause. You're suggesting that that's enough reason for why --"
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,610.98,611.86,Absolutely --
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,611.86,611.93,-- our --
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,611.93,612.94,"-- absolutely not, Your Honor."
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,620.09,620.33,All right.
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,620.33,620.51,And they --
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,620.51,648.065,Now let me ask you how you can label this a territorial officer as opposed to a federal officer handling federal issues -- a federal mandate when none of the people of Puerto Rico have voted in any way to -- on any of the directives that this agent has received?
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,648.065,650.15,"I -- I understand that point, Your Honor."
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,666.25,667.48,Certainly. There's no question.
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,667.48,669.49,-- territorial government and to change the substance.
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,669.49,671.225,There's no fight -- there's no fight there.
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,678.755,679.39,And I think --
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,679.39,711.245,"And the issue has to be that when Congress chooses, it's Congress's choice. If the territory chooses, if it elects a governor, if it elects legislature, if it elects its own Attorney General, that those are officers that Puerto Rico have selected. But, if the federal government is making the selection and imposing it on a territory, it has to be a federal officer."
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,711.245,715.58,"I -- that's -- I -- I -- I think that's just not right on numerous levels, Your Honor, and --"
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,715.58,717.26,"No, it's too simplistic for you. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,717.26,717.64,"No, no, no, no."
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,717.82,718.89,That's -- that's the problem that everybody --
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,718.89,741.94,"-- one of the main reasons which it's not right, I think, is that it's not consistent with the history of this country. And if you start with the mayor of Washington in 1802 -- now, admittedly, it's the Enclave Clause, not the Territories Clause, but the Court has said that there are provisions that should be read in the same way -- if -- if you start with that, the mayor of Washington was appointed -- was -- Congress created the position of mayor of Washington under a statute."
2019.18-1334,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,741.94,743.75,"That -- that's one -- I mean, that's one example."
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,766.02,766.59,Two points.
2019.18-1334,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,783.65,783.71,I -- I --
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,783.71,784.73,"-- certainly, we would have heard about that."
2019.18-1334,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,784.73,785.59,-- I agree with you -- I agree with you --
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,785.59,785.8,And now we're --
2019.18-1334,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,785.8,787.76,"-- it's important, but assume the history is still --"
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,787.76,796.31,But -- but with respect -- the history they have essentially is that territorial governors up until the 1950s were appointed with advice and consent.
2019.18-1334,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,796.54,797.47,And judges.
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,797.47,851.23,"And territorial judges. But I actually think that -- let's go right to the judges point because I think that actually proves our position and not theirs, because even though territorial judges were always nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, this Court held starting in Cantor and then also in Englebrecht and McAllister that they weren't judicial officers of the United States, despite the fact that the President nominated them and the Senate confirmed them. And then, to reinforce that, there have been three times in the country's history where a question arose about whether a territorial judge could be impeached by Congress. And in each of those three instances, the political branches concluded that a territorial judge could not be impeached because a territorial judge was not a civil officer of the United States but only an officer of the territory exercising territorial power. Now, with respect to the governors, of course, you know, the -- the Appointments Clause is not an either/or proposition."
2019.18-1334,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,867.7,911.715,"Does it just -- does it strike you as a little strange, Mr. Verrilli, to use the history in this kind of case so extensively? I mean, first, it's a little bit all over the map and you each have your historical examples to point to. But, second, the position of territories currently is so different from the position of territories throughout much or most of our history. So I -- I guess it seems to me more natural, rather than to look to, you know, what the Northwest Ordinance did, is -- is simply to use a kind of functional test and say are these people doing the sorts of things that would be done by state officials in states, or are they doing the sorts of things that would be done by federal officials?"
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,911.715,913.2,So two things.
2019.18-1334,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,950.16,950.26,Well --
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,950.26,961.11,"-- if you're going to use a functional approach, they're very much like a state government, not a federal overlord. And I think this would actually be kind of a crazy system if what you wanted to do was create a federal overlord to say: You're a federal overlord."
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,967.98,968.6,What do we do about the brief --
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,968.6,969.525,-- on territorial interests.
2019.18-1334,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,969.525,984.25,"-- what do we do about the brief of at least there's one amicus that suggests that in one of the litigations that's ongoing, with respect to PROMESA, that there's all sorts of evidence that the Board is taking directives from federal officials?"
2019.18-1334,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,984.25,1019.01,"So I -- you know, that brief, you know, respectfully, Your Honor, I -- I think that shows the perils of relying on an amicus brief that relies on extra-record information. The vast majority of those -- of the -- the documents there have not been disclosed. But, if I may talk about them, because I've been asked about them, the -- the -- the vast majority of those are communications from federal government officials to the Board in the wake of the disasters and the hurricanes saying we need information about what's going on on the ground here. And so it was -- it was informational, the overwhelming majority of them."
2019.18-1334,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1037.02,1048.775,"Thank you, counsel. General Wall."
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1048.775,1057.57,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We know that Congress expressly invoked its authority over the territories and placed the Board within the Puerto Rican government."
2019.18-1334,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1107.0,1111.405,"And what was the position the government took, the D.C. Control Board?"
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1111.405,1132.7,"So they point to a D.C. Circuit brief in the second set of proceedings. We said in that brief, after this Court had held it's exercising federal power with respect to federal property, we said, sure, it's federal, but I -- I'd urge the Court to look at the brief. We said if it had been acting with respect to D.C., it would have been different because that would have been local power."
2019.18-1334,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1148.0,1153.735,"I don't see how. I mean, you say federal power over federal property."
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1163.675,1164.11,So I --
2019.18-1334,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1164.11,1173.09,"Your -- you have to be disposing of federal control over federal property, because that's what a territory is."
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1173.09,1177.11,"So I -- I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor, but I don't know that much turns on that here."
2019.18-1334,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1255.52,1259.37,"Well, that's a question I -- I mean, you're representing the federal government."
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1262.865,1266.23,The President has nominated the same people.
2019.18-1334,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1266.23,1266.34,Okay.
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1278.78000005,1284.19,"So there are two separate things with respect to the -- to the remedy, Justice Breyer."
2019.18-1334,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1304.05,1304.23,Yeah.
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1304.23,1305.945,So you've got to give the Senate time to act.
2019.18-1334,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1310.5,1312.06,But they would be the same people.
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1337.2,1337.46,"Well, I --"
2019.18-1334,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1337.46,1338.32,On that assumption?
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1338.32,1351.225,"I hope we're not in a world where we lose, and I would love to tell you that it won't be a big deal in that world, but it's going to be a little more complicated that. They're almost certain to argue that the nominations have expired and that even though the Senate has confirmed people before to expired terms, it can't do that here."
2019.18-1334,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1372.365,1373.63,The -- the -- the big question on --
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1373.63,1376.29,"So, I mean, we're litigating for years on that view."
2019.18-1334,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1381.52,1394.315,"Mr. -- Mr. Wall, do you have to still litigate that here? You're making an assumption that the de facto doctrine does go as far as you say, which is to deprive a winning party of no remedy whatsoever."
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1394.315,1395.6,That's not true.
2019.18-1334,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1463.28,1474.04,"I thought your argument would be that if you lost, there would also be a lot of legal ramifications in terms of calling into question the status of elected governors, judges, territorial judges, and the like."
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1475.07,1478.7,"Well, I think it depends on which of their four or maybe five tests you pick."
2019.18-1334,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1584.95,1591.3,"That's assuming that the immediate -- that you're looking at the ultimate source, which is a double jeopardy idea."
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1603.12,1611.375,"Oh, yes, I don't disagree that that's kind of an -- an ad hoc limitation that they've thrown on to try to avoid the consequences of their view."
2019.18-1334,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1636.24,1637.63,But you could say that about the states.
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1652.76,1654.075,"Oh, well --"
2019.18-1334,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1654.075,1658.535,"We define it by who passed the law, the state or the federal government."
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1658.535,1668.925,"Well, except that under their test, and I think under Sanchez Valle, you've got to look at where that power flowed from, where did you get that authority."
2019.18-1334,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1706.68,1707.19,I've not even --
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1707.19,1709.13,-- did it do anything under Article I or Article IV that --
2019.18-1334,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1709.13,1725.765,"Why do you bother with the third? If you give the first -- assuming that, as your adversary said, if Congress -- all it has to do is wave a magic wand, Article IV, and that that gives permission? Obviously not."
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1725.765,1731.55,"Oh, it's still got to be -- it's got -- first, you've got to ask where it was trying to put the office."
2019.18-1334,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1778.075,1786.825,"And, Mr. Wall, what is your answer to the question that Justice Sotomayor started off with about the difference between these Board members and a U.S. attorney?"
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1786.825,1797.87,"It's the same one that Mr. Verrilli gave, which is where you have executive officers who are acting under statutes of nationwide application, we think that that's best understood to be exercising federal --"
2019.18-1334,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1797.87,1798.65,How about --
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1798.65,1799.31,-- executive power.
2019.18-1334,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1799.31,1814.97,"-- if PROMESA had, instead of setting it up the way it did, had just -- had amended Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy laws and said Puerto Rico instrumentalities get to use Chapter 9 the way everybody else does, then creates the Board to do that."
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1814.97,1815.275,"Yeah, I --"
2019.18-1334,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1815.275,1816.525,What -- what of that?
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1816.525,1817.96,I -- I don't think the form of that matters.
2019.18-1334,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1819.615,1827.0,"Because there, there is a -- I -- I guess what I was suggesting was that on -- on that there would be a uniform national law."
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1827.0,1829.89,"Oh, I -- I think you'd have to ask the same two questions."
2019.18-1334,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1862.16,1877.01,"Well, then it doesn't seem to have much to do with whether the law is nationwide or not, because my hypothetical was nationwide law, and you're saying it wouldn't matter because Congress said it was using Article IV. But it's got to be more than --"
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1877.01,1877.13,So --
2019.18-1334,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1877.13,1878.35,"-- what Congress said, right?"
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1878.35,1911.45,"-- so I -- I think that is pressing at exactly the tough question, which I'm going to say fortunately is not presented here, because it's a territory-specific statute and it's only acting in the territory. But Palmore does say primarily local. And it's a little tough to figure out exactly what it means. It seems to think that, if you're doing the D.C. code most of the time, rather than federal statutes most of the time, adjudicating, you're local, which seems to point up that you can do a little bit of the nationwide thing without converting into a federal officer. And we know that's true of territorial judges."
2019.18-1334,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1941.39,1941.76,Although this case --
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1941.76,1942.37,-- check both boxes.
2019.18-1334,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1942.37,1949.47,"-- isn't all that different from my hypothetical, right, because essentially what PROMESA does is it replicates all the procedures of Chapter 9."
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1953.26,1972.88,"I mean, it -- it's similar in most respects, but I actually don't think that changes the analysis. I mean, when the Detroit mayor walks in under Chapter 9 and files for municipal bankruptcy, we don't think that simply because he has invoked some power granted to him by federal law that he becomes a federal officer. I mean, here, the Board basically represents the Commonwealth."
2019.18-1334,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2010.45,2037.4,"Suppose Congress invokes Article IV and puts it in the territorial government, as it's done here, but assigns some matters that -- to pick up on Justice Kagan's questions -- are more national than local. Is the remedy for that problem to say that that officer can't perform the more national duties, or is the remedy for that to say that the -- the office is invalid because it's appointed in violation of the Appointments Clause?"
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2037.4,2041.76,"Well, first, Justice Kavanaugh, I don't want to -- to grant that that office would be unconstitutional."
2019.18-1334,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2061.31,2061.85,"Well, I'm asking a --"
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2061.85,2062.0,-- outside --
2019.18-1334,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2062.0,2062.41,-- different question.
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2062.41,2062.83,-- unless it's an adjudicator.
2019.18-1334,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2062.83,2072.67,Wouldn't -- wouldn't the officer still be a valid territorial officer but perhaps exercising some duties that he or she cannot exercise?
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2072.67,2074.75,I think that's a potential remedy.
2019.18-1334,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2084.33,2098.38,"Well, I think it highlights the difficulty, as Justice Kagan said, at the primarily local, because the word ""primarily,"" you were very careful in your brief to have that each time you articulate the test. And I'm not sure how we're supposed to figure that out."
2019.18-1334,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2098.38,2099.78,"Justice Kavanaugh, I think you need it there."
2019.18-1334,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2254.15,2259.945,"Thank you, General. Mr. Olson."
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2259.945,2280.965,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Federalist 48, James Madison anticipated what Congress attempted to do with the PROMESA oversight board, masking under complicated and indirect measures its encroachment on coordinate departments."
2019.18-1334,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2386.56,2391.485,"If the Board were elected, would it be constitutional?"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2391.485,2395.955,"No, it would not be constitutional because -- how -- and -- and --"
2019.18-1334,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2395.955,2400.51,Doesn't that mean the Puerto Rico governor election is unconstitutional as well then?
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2400.51,2410.975,"No, because the Puerto Rican authorities that are given to the Puerto Rican governor and under the Puerto Rican legislature are primarily local activities."
2019.18-1334,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2431.73,2445.07,All on behalf of Puerto Rico and its people and its agencies. The Board is instructed to act not on behalf of the United States but on behalf of Puerto Rico in pressing these claims?
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2445.07,2448.85,"Justice Ginsburg, it is not on behalf of Puerto Rico."
2019.18-1334,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2475.95,2515.55,"Well, but its oversight concerns -- every sentence you just said there, it's of Puerto Rico, of Puerto Rico. Its focus is on Puerto Rico. Yes, the activities, as things in any of the territories often do, has broader impact. I get -- I'll get back to the question I asked your friend, Mr. Verrilli. What if we -- I mean, I think it's very artificial to look at this and say, is this local or is this national? It obviously is some of each, or even the local aspects certainly have national implications. So, again, I mean, where -- where do we -- I know what your answer is, but you could explain it."
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2520.27,2537.7,"Well, it is overwhelmingly a federal problem dealing with a federal issue. In the -- in the Limtiaco case just in 2007, with an issue involving insolvency or potential insolvency of Guam, this Court said this is not a local problem."
2019.18-1334,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2567.13,2589.09,"But I think the response on the other side is that they've taken some of the powers and responsibilities that belonged to the governor and to the legislature and given them to the Board, and the governor, as you acknowledged, is elected, not appointed consistent with the Appointments Clause. So is that wrong that they've taken the powers from the governor and legislature and given them to the Board?"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2589.09,2605.355,"They've taken all of the powers with respect to the financial situation in Puerto Rico and given it to the federal-created Board, which is appointed by the President, removable by the President, and has supervisorial authorities under the -- the very statute --"
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2605.355,2607.14,"But, Mr. Olson, I -- I think the question is --"
2019.18-1334,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2607.14,2607.73,Mr. Olson --

2019.18-1334,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2610.08,2610.675,Right.
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2610.675,2615.22,-- who would -- who would be doing these activities? And if it would be the governor of Puerto Rico --
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2615.22,2615.84,The governor --
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2615.84,2618.39999995,-- then doesn't that tell us something?
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2618.39999995,2623.21,The governor of Puerto Rico does not have the power to do these activities.
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2623.21,2629.37,"I understand that. But for this statute, who would? Wouldn't it be the governor? That's what --"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2629.37,2629.59,No.
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2629.59,2630.19,-- that's what your colleagues --
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2630.19,2632.51,"But for the statute, this authority to do --"
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2632.51,2634.11,That's what your colleagues suggest.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2634.11,2634.44,Well --
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2634.44,2639.68,"And is -- if that's erroneous, could you direct us to what -- who would do it but for the statute?"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2639.68,2664.56000005,"The statute was created because the -- the governor of Puerto Rico -- and there was no authority for officials in Puerto Rico to do these responsibilities, to bring these actions -- these actions against financial institutions in the mainland, to bring -- to overturn the budget, to do these various things, to bring suit against the governor himself."
2019.18-1334,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2664.56000005,2672.725,"Why couldn't they? Why couldn't they? They'd pass a law, a Puerto Rican law, which would give them authority to do it."

2019.18-1334,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2688.8,2691.18,They would -- they would take care of the problem.

2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2788.92,2789.97,And this statute --
2019.18-1334,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2789.97,2790.34,-- so --
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2790.34,2793.35,-- went far beyond the bankruptcy powers.

2019.18-1334,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2799.23,2806.62,"So what you're basically saying is, without this federal law creating the structure, the structure itself couldn't exist under existing law?"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2806.62,2807.3,That's correct.

2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2809.39,2810.3,That's correct.

2019.18-1334,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2884.12,2884.59,"Well, what is it?"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2884.59,2885.15,There's over --
2019.18-1334,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2885.15,2887.4,I'd just like to know what -- this is a real case.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2889.545,2897.04,"Well, there's -- there's over 100 billion dollars of indebtedness being adjudicated in various procedures, a lot of which is --"
2019.18-1334,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2897.04,2901.22,"Right, and your client wants more of it and somebody else you think is getting too much."
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2904.59,2906.67,We can't -- we can't possibly answer that.
2019.18-1334,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2929.13,2933.475,Didn't your client acquiesce in some settlement?

There was a small settlement with respect to a taxing authority where the sales tax went into an agency.

2019.18-1334,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2997.68,2998.36,One thing -- there was one thing that --

2019.18-1334,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3000.325,3028.155,"-- that -- that confuses me about your presentation, because you start out very strongly that the evil here is Congress aggrandizing itself, Congress aggrandizing itself at the executive's expense. How about the member of the Board that's appointed by the President alone? There can't be any question of Congress aggrandizing itself."
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3046.7,3052.695,"They would -- they -- these are principal officers of the United States, not inferior officers."
2019.18-1334,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3059.07,3063.65,But what does that have to do with Congress aggrandizing itself at the executive's expense?
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3063.65,3069.33,"Well, the -- the -- they -- the President appointed one without advice and consent of the Senate."
2019.18-1334,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3073.755,3077.07,"How about the D.C. Control Board, where they're all appointed --"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3077.07,3077.46,"Well, there's --"
2019.18-1334,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3077.46,3077.88,-- by the President?
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3077.88,3079.6,-- that has never been adjudicated.
2019.18-1334,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3107.01,3107.36,They bring up --
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3107.36,3108.26,-- a discussion of --
2019.18-1334,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3108.26,3108.79,Excuse me.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3132.85,3134.8,It would not affect home rule at all.
2019.18-1334,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3162.71,3173.01,"But wouldn't it require that similar officials -- maybe I'm not understanding -- in the territories who exercise territorial power, but also affect national power?"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3173.01,3217.25,"What -- what -- I think the issue might be primarily federal power or versus primarily local. The Palmore case itself, which our opponents rely on repeatedly, says in that opinion those were primarily or exclusively or largely -- there are various different adjectives used in that opinion -- local D.C. criminal proceedings, criminal law under the laws of the District of Columbia. And this Court has repeatedly likened the power that can be exercised in the territories under the territorial clause or under the clause that gives power over the District of Columbia local territorial matters, the type of authority that may be given by a state to a local municipality."
2019.18-1334,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3217.25,3222.72,"Congress enacts the D.C. code, right? The D.C. code is enacted by Congress?"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3222.72,3226.8,"Yes, although -- well, there is -- it's changed over time."
2019.18-1334,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3239.92,3245.39,So -- so that does sound like the test that is being used by Mr. Verrilli and Mr. Wall.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3251.87,3258.78,"The test -- my test is this Court's test, which was articulated in the Buckley case, again in the -- in the --"
2019.18-1334,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3258.78,3260.04,But you know what -- what struck me --
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3260.04,3260.63,-- in the Lucia case.
2019.18-1334,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3260.63,3269.73,"-- what struck me when I read that, when I read your brief, the Buckley test is significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States."
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3298.95,3316.82,"Well, we looked at each of the cases that are cited both in our briefs and our opponents' briefs, including the United States' briefs. The -- it is -- it is -- and it's the test of this Court, not just in the Buckley case, but as -- as recently -- as recently as a couple years ago in the Lucia case."
2019.18-1334,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3317.42,3321.26,"Right, but always -- always to distinguish between officers and employees."
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3335.505,3355.69,"And we acknowledge that, that with respect to the test that this Court articulated, repeatedly, Lucia was just the last time it did, that authority under the laws of the United States has always accepted the -- the purely local authority that's been exercised in the territories."
2019.18-1334,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3355.69,3356.12,So if it's --
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3356.12,3359.29,There's also exceptions for transitional governments.
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3363.56,3365.42,"Mr. Olson, I'm -- I'm confused."
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3373.765,3375.41,The test is --
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3375.41,3376.79,The difference between the two tests.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3376.79,3398.51,"Well, the difference between the two is that we believe, and what -- what this Court has taught us, that if you're exercising significant authority under the laws of the United States, the laws enacted by Congress with respect to the government, affairs of the federal government, as opposed to purely local municipal, the -- the speed limits, the zoning --"
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3398.51,3400.26,I understand -- I understand the test.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3409.03,3409.13,It --
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3409.13,3410.93,What's the difference? What's the delta?
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3410.93,3428.55,"The -- the delta is, is something that is a municipal matter, is it -- have to do with local affairs, speed limits, zoning, and things of that nature, as opposed to federal statutes that deal with a national crisis. This was a national crisis, a national --"
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3428.55,3433.235,Could I rephrase that as asking whether the Board was acting primarily locally or primarily nationally?
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3433.235,3436.24,It is -- the Board is acting primarily nationally.
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3436.24,3436.38,Okay.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3438.03,3438.66,Pardon me?
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3438.66,3443.67,"So then we do agree on the test, right, whether the Board was acting primarily locally or primarily nationally?"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3443.67,3444.97,"Well, that part of it, yes."
2019.18-1334,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3444.97,3445.09,Okay.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3445.09,3461.33,"Because those -- what this Court has said repeatedly is that, where there is local municipal authority, Congress has the power under Article IV to give government and -- and regulate the affairs in municipalities."
2019.18-1334,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3461.33,3462.31,So if it's primarily --
2019.18-1334,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3462.31,3463.0,Mr. Olson --
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3463.0,3464.87000005,As --
2019.18-1334,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3464.87000005,3470.87,-- I don't want you to ignore the de facto officer.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3505.56,3506.25,The -- the test --
2019.18-1334,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3506.25,3507.92,They -- they can obviously correct me if I'm wrong.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3507.92,3508.33,Well --
2019.18-1334,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3508.33,3517.98,But they're saying this Board is dealing with primarily local matters because it's dealing primarily with a budget and with --
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3517.98,3518.93,And that's not --
2019.18-1334,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3518.93,3520.64,That -- that -- that's -- okay.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3520.64,3527.94,"With all due respect, you cannot say that at the same time that you've read the PROMESA statute itself."
2019.18-1334,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3529.33,3541.42,"Well, I -- I've read it, but that doesn't mean I know what you're referring to. Could you succinctly make the -- the difference between how you view primarily dealing with --"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3541.42,3542.12,Well --
2019.18-1334,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3542.12,3544.83,-- in your way and the way the other side does?
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3544.83,3549.975,-- the insolvency of a territory of the United States is not a local matter.
2019.18-1334,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3581.66,3582.15,"So, Mr. Olson --"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3582.15,3582.27,-- Rico.
2019.18-1334,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3582.27,3596.95499995,"Counsel, it's just then -- it -- it's just a question of size. I mean, if the same thing, we're talking about not Puerto Rico, but Ponce -- see, I don't know the pronunciation -- Puerto Rico, your position would be different? Or a county in Puerto Rico?"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3596.95499995,3644.165,"I think that it's possible that you could find a fiscal insolvency situation of a small enough unit of a -- of a portion of Puerto Rico where you wouldn't be talking about this, but Guam, which is what this Court talked about in that case, Limtiaco case, was 1/400th the size of Puerto Rico, involving that tiny fraction of the significance of Puerto Rico. We're talking here about not just the size but the dimension of the problem, the number of citizens that are involved, the number of creditors' claims, over 200 claw-back claims against financial institutions throughout the United States that are being pursued in federal court. This is a --"
2019.18-1334,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3644.165,3672.595,"So would it be right to say, Mr. Olson, that you view this statute as essentially a statute about debt restructuring? I mean, it has other aspects and the Board does other things and oversees Puerto Rican budgets going forward, but you're saying that what we should do is look at the statute and say it's about restructuring a bankrupt territory's debt and that that has to be viewed as national? Is that the theory?"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3672.595,3674.53,"Well, that is part of the theory."
2019.18-1334,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3694.12,3699.51,Did that deputy solicitor general prevail on that position? (Laughter.)
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3699.51,3706.36,"That deputy solicitor general made a beautiful argument, Mr. Chief Justice. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3706.36,3707.61,And -- and fortunately for him --
2019.18-1334,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3707.61,3708.33,A beautiful losing argument.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3708.33,3710.25,-- the Court did not decide that precise case.
2019.18-1334,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3730.96,3742.0899999,"If we conclude that the powers and duties here are primarily local -- and I know you disagree -- but, if we conclude that, do you lose?"

2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3753.79,3754.57,-- like the article --
2019.18-1334,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3754.57,3755.62,-- you keep saying -- I'm sorry to interrupt.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3757.4,3758.5,"Well, primarily, I'll --"
2019.18-1334,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3758.5,3758.63,Okay.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3758.63,3759.39,"-- accept that, primarily."
2019.18-1334,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3759.39,3760.5,There's a big difference between --
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3760.5,3765.55,"Well, there's a big -- it may be a big difference and it may be important in this case."
2019.18-1334,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3807.15,3812.83,"Can I just try the question again? If we conclude it's primarily local, do you have an alternative argument or do you lose?"
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3812.83,3836.045,"Well, I don't -- I don't -- I think that it can't conceivably be thought of as primarily local given the scope of the authority, but I'm imagining a hypothetical situation where you might have a small unit of -- of government, a subdivision of Puerto Rico that was purely a municipal problem, yes, that could be a -- that could not invoke the Appointments Clause, but --"
2019.18-1334,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3836.045,3839.35,"Mr. Olson, don't lose the de facto officer argument."
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3839.35,3839.87,Yes.
2019.18-1334,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3894.115,3899.41,I think that they are making a distinction between adjudicatory and legislative decisions.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3899.41,3899.9,I don't think that --
2019.18-1334,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3899.9,3909.005,"They seem to be saying that when it comes to legislative officers, that we have applied the de facto officer status."
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3920.92,3921.13,Well --
2019.18-1334,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3921.13,3922.74,-- and deal with why that's wrong.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3922.74,3929.99,-- I don't think that there is a valid distinction in -- in a vacuum between an adjudicatory process.
2019.18-1334,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3947.845,3954.1,"But the Ryder case, on which you placed such reliance, it -- it was qualified."
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3968.14,3986.72,"Justice Ginsburg, I would submit that the -- this Board is both adjudicating and enforcing the laws in the same sense, and has many of the same powers that the administrative law judge had in the Lucia case, and so that that distinction simply doesn't hold up."
2019.18-1334,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3986.72,4001.69,It was acting on behalf of the debtor agency in Puerto Rico. They -- it's acting as a kind of a petitioner. It's not an adjudicator.
2019.18-1334,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,4001.69,4006.745,That's one of the -- one small part of what PROMESA does.
2019.18-1334,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4072.605,4083.03,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Mendez-Colberg."
2019.18-1334,3,63170,jessica_e_mendez_colberg,,4083.03,4103.765,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to address the issue of the Insular Cases, the remedy, and also some of the questions -- the questions of the Court. If we stand in front of this building, we will see the words ""equal justice under law."" The Insular Cases stretch that tenet into its breaking point."
2019.18-1334,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4171.77,4172.18,I think here --
2019.18-1334,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4172.18,4172.46,I understood --
2019.18-1334,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4172.46,4180.915,-- everybody was -- everybody was agreeing that the Article I -- Article II does apply.
2019.18-1334,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4273.5,4277.59,I'm just -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- I have a tough problem in my mind on that.
2019.18-1334,3,63170,jessica_e_mendez_colberg,,4283.505,4366.23,"Well, Your Honor, we would forget about it, but the problem here is that, actually, what Congress did was to, yes, say that this -- that this are territorial officers, but it actually gave this -- the oversight board powers that are not necessarily what power -- what the powers of a -- of a territorial officer are considered to be. They -- the oversight board has the authority, and as Mr. Olson mentioned, has the authority to file this bankruptcy proceedings, which is a federal power, on behalf of the government. But, also, we see that they have the authority to impair contracts -- which is something that wasn't mentioned before -- impair contracts even outside of the -- of the scope of the bankruptcy proceedings, which is in the Title II -- II of PROMESA. If the Board understands that a contract may -- that the government -- by the government of Puerto Rico with other parties is inconsistent with the provisions of PROMESA, it can -- it can -- it can even prevent the execution of those -- of those contracts. So that is a very significant power among the other powers that the oversight board has that not even the -- the government, the local government of Puerto Rico, has. Now I do want to -- to -- to -- to stress on the issue of the Insular Cases, because it is important for the people of Puerto Rico and for my clients."
2019.18-1334,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4395.09,4401.315,"Well, but Justice -- as Justice Breyer has pointed out, none of the other parties rely on the Insular Cases in any way."
2019.18-1334,3,63170,jessica_e_mendez_colberg,,4405.265,4409.5,"Well, Your Honor, they relied on the Insular Cases since the beginning of the proceedings."
2019.18-1334,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4455.02,4465.71,"I thought the argument was that the Appointments Clause does apply to Puerto Rico, and the question is simply whether it's implicated on these particular facts with respect to this particular agency?"
2019.18-1334,3,63170,jessica_e_mendez_colberg,,4465.71,4466.685,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1334,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4466.685,4471.17,"So I -- I guess, again, I just don't see the pertinence of the -- of the Insular Cases."
2019.18-1334,3,63170,jessica_e_mendez_colberg,,4471.17,4478.91,"Well, as I -- as I mentioned, and also -- also, last term, this Court went ahead and overruled the Korematsu case."
2019.18-1334,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4505.595,4518.0,Can I ask you a question about the duties of the Board? If the duties of the Board and responsibilities are considered primarily local -- I'll ask the same question I asked Mr. Olson -- do you lose or do you have an alternative argument?
2019.18-1334,3,63170,jessica_e_mendez_colberg,,4518.0,4526.485,"Your Honor, I -- I don't think that we -- that the -- the -- the authority of the Board can -- can -- can be considered purely local."
