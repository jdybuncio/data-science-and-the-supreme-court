1994.93-1612,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.808,"We'll hear argument now in Number 93-1612, NationsBank of North Carolina v. Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company and a consolidated case."
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,14.424,17.176,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1612,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,90.224,100.496,"Well, Mr. DuMont, you rely on the language in the seventh section there of the business of banking."
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,100.496,101.282,That's correct.
1994.93-1612,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,101.282,126.563,"And that phrase is followed by a listing of six specific things that banks can do, and it's been my understanding that most courts have defined the business of banking in terms of those specifically enumerated powers rather than something more broad."
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,133.919,141.657,"I think the courts are certainly well advised to look at those things as exemplary of what is encompassed within the business of banking, the core business of banking."
1994.93-1612,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.657,154.433,But you think any investment instrument of financial investment interest is within the business of banking even though it's not mentioned in any of the six listed things?
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,154.433,164.472,"We think that the language of the first phrase there, 24 Seventh, is broad enough to go beyond just the listed powers, and the courts have so held in a variety of cases, including--"
1994.93-1612,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.472,168.674,Including the selling of insurance policies of any kind.
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,168.674,190.272,"--Well, I think if you wanted to operate a general insurance agency you would be in the province of section 92, but let me point out that the second sentence of section 24 Seventh I think is very important here, if I may, and the second sentence, which was added in the 1930's, says the business of dealing in securities and stock by the association shall be limited to purchasing and selling, and so on."
1994.93-1612,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.628,201.445,You mean the Glass-Steagall--
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,201.445,202.514,--That's the Glass-Steagall provision.
1994.93-1612,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.514,211.103,"--And they wouldn't have had to add it unless the sale of securities and stock had been covered, is your point."
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,211.103,219.958,"Well, my point is that the way that that sentence is phrased indicates that it is not granting a new power but recognizing and limiting one that was already granted."
1994.93-1612,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,226.362,233.349,"Well, could a bank have power to deal in expensive art for investment purposes?"
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,236.384,237.151,I think that that would--
1994.93-1612,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.151,238.836,"Is that within their powers, too?"
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,238.836,243.805,"--Well, that sort of question would be one for the Comptroller in the first instance and, of course, is not involved here."
1994.93-1612,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.24,246.39,"Well, do you think the language would stretch that far?"
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,251.06,274.193,"--I think that if there were a practice, as there is in this case over a long period of years, of banks dealing in that kind of thing as agent for their customers without substantial equity risk, and that that had been recognized by the courts over time, I think it would be reasonable for the Comptroller... and, by the way, I think I should add, if other banks and savings institutions regulated by other entities, such as State banks or Federal thrifts, were engaging in the same activity, I think it would be reasonable--"
1994.93-1612,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,274.193,280.93,And do you say that the sale of annuities is something that has been carried out over a long period of time by national banks?
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,280.93,286.334,"--I say that the sale of investment products, the brokering of investment products is something that has been carried--"
1994.93-1612,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,286.334,286.801,Annuities.
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,286.801,289.018,"--Well, they are different questions."
1994.93-1612,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,292.72,293.536,How about annuities?
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,293.536,299.957,--Annuities have been sold by banks other than those regulated by the Comptroller in the last several years.
1994.93-1612,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.107,327.643,"Where does the term, investment products come from?"
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,330.861,332.161,It is not a statutory term.
1994.93-1612,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,332.161,334.13,Then why do you use it?
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,334.13,337.515,"Well, I think that the... the statutory term is, the business of banking."
1994.93-1612,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.358,357.226,"Did he... in his ruling did he use the term, investment products?"
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,357.226,361.028,"--I believe, financial investment products, yes, or financial investment instruments."
1994.93-1612,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,361.028,362.961,Did he define it?
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,362.961,369.884,"Well, the discussion goes on to talk about exactly why they are investment instruments in the modern context, why annuities are, and I can turn to that."
1994.93-1612,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,379.923,394.149,"Mr. DuMont, before you go on with that, would you just tell us the expression, business of banking, you said that the six specifics are exemplary, not exclusive."
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,410.659,432.524,"--Well, I think it's perfectly fair to look at the text as a good starting point for what is the business of banking, but I think it would be erroneous to take a statute like this, that is really an organic law to govern the development... to govern the existence of the banking industry and to try to freeze at any one time exactly what banks are doing, and say, well, they were doing that in 1864, and unless Congress acts specifically, they can do no other thing from now on."
1994.93-1612,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,487.409,489.461,"Mr. DuMont, may I ask you a related question?"
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,549.229,556.735,"Well, to answer the first question, I don't think it would be particularly appropriate to consider that a central purpose of 92, to protect insurance agents."
1994.93-1612,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,565.091,573.179,"And didn't that letter also... I forget the exact words, but didn't that letter make some such remark as, you know, it's not going to hurt the others too much?"
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,581.617,592.342,"--I think there was certainly recognition of that, but again, I think you need to look at that in the context of what 92 was doing, which was authorizing a national bank operating in a small town to carry on an entire general agency."
1994.93-1612,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,592.342,598.562,"Oh, I realize it was doing that, but that's where it stopped, and why would it have stopped unless it wanted to protect insurance brokers?"
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,598.562,603.3,"Well, we really think that section 92 was limited to granting an additional power."
1994.93-1612,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,603.3,604.916,"Well, I know, but what about the answer to my question?"
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,615.288,616.554,No.
1994.93-1612,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,651.644,653.66,"I grant you that, but I think you're getting a little bit away from my question."
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,663.016,663.333,"--Well, certainly."
1994.93-1612,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,708.561,719.102,"Is it a plausible argument to say that an annuity can be both insurance and a security, or are these mutually exclusive categories?"
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,719.102,741.099,"Well, to begin with, it's importance to distinguish... for instance, the Court's prior cases like Bailey, for one, and United Benefit Life, looked in the securities law context at whether something was a security, on one hand, or an annuity contract or insurance on the other, and that made sense in that statutory context because the specific statutory exception was from securities law for annuity contracts or insurance contracts."
1994.93-1612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,785.31,785.743,How unlike are they--
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,785.743,786.36,--not go under section 92.
1994.93-1612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,786.36,790.595,--How unlike are they to life insurance contracts?
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,797.599,799.701,"Well, I think it depends on what kind of life insurance we're talking about."
1994.93-1612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.717,802.001,No.
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,802.403,803.903,--there are a variety of insurance products--
1994.93-1612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.903,805.755,"--Whole life, right."
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,805.755,812.124,--The insurance industry has shown itself to be very inventive in operating in that medium ground between pure investment and pure insurance.
1994.93-1612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.124,821.964,"It's always been considered... whole life insurance, anyway, has always been considered a medium of saving and investment as well as a medium of life insurance, hasn't it?"
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,821.964,823.73,"I think it has, to the extent that it has always existed, which--"
1994.93-1612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,823.73,837.057,"So your argument would lead to the conclusion that at least insofar as straight life insurance... not term insurance, but investment life insurance is concerned, bank could have been life insurance agents."
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,837.057,853.232,"--The Comptroller has made no determination on that, but our argument would be that the Comptroller could look at a particular set of insurance products, including whole universal life products, and decide that if they have predominantly... predominantly investment characteristics they are within the scope of the banking powers and outside the scope of section 92."
1994.93-1612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.232,858.117,And you think that's faithful to what was sought to be achieved by this amendment regarding insurance.
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,871.358,880.613,"Well, I don't... I don't know what Congress or the Comptroller thought about life insurance and banks in 1916, and I'm not sure that it's really completely relevant."
1994.93-1612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.066,917.22,Who does the business of banking besides... besides the banks that are restricted by this very provision?
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,924.64,937.197,"Well, banking, of course, started out as a State-regulated activity, and still very many banks, including many very important banks, are State-regulated, for instance in New York, and as you know, the New York Court of Appeals has recently said on a case identical to this that New York banks are entitled to--"
1994.93-1612,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,937.197,940.233,What banks are selling annuities now?
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,950.82,957.074,"--The latter part, I don't know, the breakdown between State banks and national banks."
1994.93-1612,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,966.663,968.113,On the order of 20 percent.
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,997.199,998.051,I think you can certainly say that.
1994.93-1612,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1006.907,1011.442,Can you also draw an intelligible line between fixed and variable?
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1011.442,1021.813,"--Well, variable annuities I should say have been held by this Court in the securities context to be securities, and therefore they're clearly covered by the second sentence of 24 Seventh, and there really shouldn't be any issue--"
1994.93-1612,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1021.813,1040.608,"Well, they are if the two terms are interchangeable as between the two statutes, but if we assume they're not necessarily interchangeable, I take it the insurance character, the significance of the actuarial element is much greater in the case of a fixed annuity."
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1040.608,1043.394,"--The fixed annuities are a more difficult case, there's no question about that."
1994.93-1612,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1043.394,1054.519,"I thought you had told me that the distinction between securities on the one hand and insurance on the other is not very helpful to this case, yet I see you're relying on that in your answer to Justice Souter."
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1054.519,1057.903,"No, no, all I'm saying is that in the securities context... and we agree that they're not the same context."
1994.93-1612,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1077.9,1081.269,"In the statute it says, incidental powers, right?"
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1082.871,1083.404,Correct.
1994.93-1612,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1083.404,1083.954,Okay.
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1098.063,1098.48,That's correct.
1994.93-1612,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1098.48,1098.863,All right.
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1109.688,1112.34,I don't know that the Comptroller has a taken a particular position on--
1994.93-1612,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1112.34,1113.873,"Well, can he put anything in under the sun?"
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1125.231,1146.744,"--The basic theory is really two things: one is, you look to the kinds of things that are listed, and to things that might be either convenient or useful to carrying out those listed powers, or a reasonable extrapolation from them, and the second is that you look at banking practices as they have grown up in other banks that are not necessarily regulated by the Comptroller, or even among banks that are in the modern marketplace, and you look to that kind of contemporary practice."
1994.93-1612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1146.744,1153.667,"Is that the proper interpretation to ask under that statute, whether this is an incidental power?"
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1158.202,1158.702,We think the--
1994.93-1612,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.702,1167.641,"Because it doesn't say, colon, to discount and negotiate promissory notes, to loan money, et cetera, which would be an enumeration of the incidental powers."
1994.93-1612,0,22157,edward_c_dumont,,1172.86,1179.365,"--The preferable reading is that this is all part of the business of banking and powers are incidental thereto, but we don't think it makes a lot of difference."
1994.93-1612,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1179.365,1180.115,"Thank you, Mr. DuMont."
1994.93-1612,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1186.602,1189.671,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1612,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1229.798,1236.618,"Does it include all types of annuities, fixed, variable, and those in between?"
1994.93-1612,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1236.618,1243.856,"--Our application, Justice O'Connor, included a request to sell every modern form of annuities, and we are--"
1994.93-1612,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1243.856,1244.974,Including fixed?
1994.93-1612,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1244.974,1260.083,"--Well, our application included fixed and variable, every possible combination that's available in the marketplace, and indeed, we do represent several different insurers and have sold virtually every combination known, so you're talking about the whole panoply here."
1994.93-1612,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1260.083,1268.173,"Are the statistics you recited just before your answer to that question, are they applicable to fixed annuities as well as variable?"
1994.93-1612,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1268.173,1269.006,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1612,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1269.006,1273.708,"That is, two-thirds of all State banks sell fixed annuities?"
1994.93-1612,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1273.708,1277.26,I haven't looked as carefully as I should have on that issue.
1994.93-1612,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1319.422,1323.474,What exactly will NationsBank do if its application is granted?
1994.93-1612,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1327.193,1327.493,--No.
1994.93-1612,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1339.15,1344.987,"So I walk into a NationsBank office, what do I do if I want to buy... buy one of those policies?"
1994.93-1612,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1344.987,1373.239,"--You will go to an account executive at the branch, you will indicate that you are interested in purchasing annuities, the account executive will provide you with material on a wide variety of different policies, you will look at that material and you will decide which of the various features you would like, and then you will write out a check, not to NationsBank, but to the issuer for the amount of the policy, and we will handle the application and arrange for the sale."
1994.93-1612,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1373.239,1374.673,"You get a commission, then, from the--"
1994.93-1612,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1374.673,1376.691,"Yes, we do."
1994.93-1612,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1417.249,1429.909,"--Well, isn't there some negative implication from section 92 that large banks can't sell insurance?"
1994.93-1612,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1429.909,1439.764,"--I think... I think this would be a tougher case, Justice O'Connor, if the Comptroller had approved our right to be a general insurance agent, to sell auto insurance, life insurance--"
1994.93-1612,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1439.764,1452.239,"Well, my question is this: is there some negative implication, from the language of section 92, that suggests that large banks may not sell insurance?"
1994.93-1612,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1452.239,1460.611,"--I do not believe, Your Honor, that section 92 prohibited large banks from selling any insurance product."
1994.93-1612,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1460.611,1462.797,You see no negative implications?

Congress expressly preserved existing banking powers."

1994.93-1612,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1540.38,1564.662,"--No, I'm... I thought what I had answered was that I think there is a negative implication to the extent that, if we were here in a case in which we were seeking... a large bank, NationsBank were seeking to sell auto insurance, life insurance, the full panoply of insurance, then I think the argument about negative implication has more weight, but we're not seeking that here."
1994.93-1612,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1632.557,1638.127,But isn't the sale of a fixed annuity very much like the sale of a life insurance policy?

1994.93-1612,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1646.649,1660.492,"--I think, Justice O'Connor, there is a critical difference, and the critical difference is that an insurance policy, a life insurance policy dealt... deals with an insurable risk, the risk that someone will die prematurely."
1994.93-1612,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1660.492,1664.194,"Well, a fixed annuity does exactly the same thing."
1994.93-1612,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1664.194,1665.011,"No, it doesn't."

1994.93-1612,1,41942,steven_s_rosenthal,,1717.679,1752.086,"I think pooling... the word pooling occurs, but the question is, was there a pooling of insurance risk, and I think what the Comptroller said in his opinion and what I think he was reasonable in concluding was that annuities do not involve a pooling of insurance risk, and we've cited in our briefs, and I think it's hard to disagree that there are lots of authorities out there, lots of academicians, lots of court cases which have held that annuities, fixed annuities do not involve a pooling of insurance risk."
1994.93-1612,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.49,1761.708,"They do involve a pooling, so you're focusing on the word whether there's a risk or not."

1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,1973.106,1980.629,"--I think it does not make a difference, because when you're dealing with the risk of life and death, it is not that the risk may not happen."
1994.93-1612,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1997.255,1997.622,Yes.

1994.93-1612,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2003.809,2014.766,"Yes, and when life insurance is bought, normally people say, when a bad thing happens to me, I don't know when, I'll at least have some money for my children."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2054.592,2072.389,"Well, Your Honor, I think this is an elegant theoretical construct, but I don't think it's the way that the pooling of risk has been viewed in insurance and in fact what Congress had in mind when you look at section 92, for example, which talks specifically only in extending insurance powers for representation of a life insurance company as well as others."
1994.93-1612,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2094.302,2103.991,"So you mean if insurance companies... this is... they're not selling life insurance, they're selling something called an annuity, and I agree that insurance companies also sell annuities."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2122.905,2131.178,"Of course not, because annuity product does involve the pooling of risk, the risk of outliving your income, the risk of a penniless old age."

1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2189.913,2195.301,"--I think if you're protecting against a risk of loss and it involves the pooling and sharing, you do, in fact, have insurance."

1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2227.653,2233.676,"Well, I'm not sure that's true, Your Honor, because the annuity begins to pay at the maturity date."
1994.93-1612,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2242.532,2247.084,"Well, I mean, most people don't assume that they're going to go broke on their retirement date."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2248.284,2250.069,--I think most people assume their income will go down.

1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2275.836,2277.469,"Well, it is a contractual relationship."
1994.93-1612,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2289.561,2319.782,"Well, I grant you that there is a pooling going on, and I grant you that there is an actuarial feature in deciding what you're going to charge for what you do, but I don't think there's such a neat analogy as suggested by the notion that what is being insured against is loss of income from living too long, because the triggering events are simply different from what they are in a casualty circumstance, and I just... I guess that's why I think the analogy is weak rather than strong."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2319.782,2330.888,"Your Honor, I can only refer you to the many insurance treatises which deal with exactly this issue, and agree that that is what people are doing, and if you look, people are buying life contingency annuities."
1994.93-1612,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2340.361,2377.202,"Mr. Stewart, why isn't it appropriate to look at this, as Justice Breyer I think suggested, from the point of view of the bank's customer, the notion that the customer has savings, wants to invest the savings for a return that will be there for a rainy day, for later years, and that an annuity is today a substitute for that, more attractive, but it serves the same customer who has savings and wants to invest the savings for a return."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2395.263,2400.817,"They... the difference is, I think, that what you get depends on how long you live."

1994.93-1612,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2443.513,2462.89,"In the brief for the Federal petitioners at pages 34... 33 and 34, there's a footnote that seems to indicate that, while small, it's not that small, the kind of annuity that doesn't depend on the length of one's life."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2462.89,2478.334,"Well, it is a small part of the market, and my point was simply that the purchaser's annuities are not taking the pure tax-deferred benefit which is being posited by the Court here, but rather, they're choosing the product which provides also this insurance characteristic, the life definition of their benefits."
1994.93-1612,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2478.334,2487.356,"Mr. Stewart, would a purchase by an elderly person of a life estate in a retirement home be insurance within your definition?"
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2487.356,2488.958,"I think not, Your Honor."
1994.93-1612,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.958,2489.558,Why not?
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2489.558,2493.779,Because that is an individualized transaction.

1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2524.263,2534.202,"--If annuities had changed in any material way, that would be possibly true, but we think annuities in their core really are exactly the same as they were 100 years ago or 50 years ago or 80 years ago."
1994.93-1612,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2534.202,2540.457,Were variable annuities sold at the time these laws were passed?

1994.93-1612,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2544.326,2545.742,They were not sold then.
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2546.459,2547.076,They were not sold then.
1994.93-1612,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2563.288,2573.928,"--So as to the variables, do you think that falls within the enumerated powers of banking under the seventh section, to the extent they're securities?"
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2573.928,2574.611,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-1612,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2609.268,2619.224,"Well, I'm curious, though, inasmuch as this Court has said those instruments are securities, whether it wouldn't fall squarely within that provision."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2619.224,2634.967,"We think not, because they're a different kind of security, and here it's necessary to harmonize the provision there with the provision of section 92, which we do think has a powerful negative implication, because variable annuities have both security and insurance characteristics."
1994.93-1612,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2660.432,2692.97,"Mr. Stewart, you may already have alluded to this, but let me ask you, with respect to your argument that in fact the enumerated powers are essentially exclusive, do you agree that the final sentence of the seventh section makes no sense, except on the congressional assumption that the enumeration was not exclusive, because there's nothing in the enumeration that would be taken to refer to stocks and securities, so Congress must have assumed that in fact the so-called powers incident to banking were broader."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2694.256,2703.361,"Well, I think there's some confusion here, because the initial stock and security trading power for national banks was created by the McFadden Act in 1927, and that was an affirmative grant of power."
1994.93-1612,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2732.029,2739.785,So that this was essentially just a kind of... perhaps a misleading and untidy way to deal with what Congress took as a fait accompli?
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2739.785,2740.718,I think that's right.
1994.93-1612,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2740.718,2745.604,Why shouldn't Congress... why shouldn't we deal with a fait accompli in this case?
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2747.806,2760.881,"Well, I think if, in fact, that issue, the bank's ability to sell securities, had come to this Court in 1925, the decision of this Court would have had to be that they lacked the power to do so."
1994.93-1612,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2760.881,2769.451,"Okay, but now we're in the situation in which the 1925 analogue doesn't work with respect to annuities, either."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2769.451,2770.153,"Well, I think it does."
1994.93-1612,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2770.153,2807.51,"In other words, if it was appropriate... I guess my question is, if it was appropriate for Congress to write the final sentence on the assumption that... and I think it makes no logical sense otherwise... on the assumption that the bank's incidental powers could include the power to sell stocks and securities, and Congress did that because the... you know, the cat was out of the bag, then why isn't it equally appropriate for us to construe the first sentence on that same set of assumptions, which I gather would put us in the same interpretive position that the State of New York is in with respect to its statute, which was taken as the model for this?"
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2807.51,2819.901,"Your Honor, I think we're getting this turned upside down, because in fact Congress had to grant that power because the banks didn't have the power, just as, if banks are really to have the power to sell annuities, Congress is going to have--"
1994.93-1612,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2819.901,2827.971,"But if that's all Congress was doing, Congress... all Congress had to say is, they can sell stocks... they can broker stocks and securities, and that isn't what it said."

1994.93-1612,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2866.763,2879.522,"Right, and if all Congress meant to do was to legalize what the Comptroller had been doing, the sensible way to do that would have been to say, it is lawful for banks to sell stocks and securities, but it didn't do that."

1994.93-1612,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2905.222,2914.178,"Are you saying that in the McFadden Act, the text of which is not incorporated here, there was an affirmative grant of authority to sell stocks and bonds?"
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2914.178,2917.897,"--I think that's what this Court found in Clarke v. Securities Industries Association, yes."

1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2926.587,2931.372,"Well, it's first form was enacted in 1927 in the McFadden Act, and then it was amended in the Glass-Steagall Act."
1994.93-1612,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2931.372,2935.776,"The McFadden Act was '27, the Glass-Steagall Act was '33, or--"
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2935.776,2938.143,'33 or '34.
1994.93-1612,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2938.143,2944.882,"--I'm sorry, I don't quite understand, because I have in front of me two sentences from section 24(7)."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2956.607,2956.907,No.
1994.93-1612,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2957.34,2957.69,No.
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2957.69,2958.507,--second sentence was rewritten.
1994.93-1612,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2958.507,2958.957,So the answer's no.
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2965.278,2965.778,Well--
1994.93-1612,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2965.778,2967.728,--I'm just not looking at the legislative history.
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2970.147,2971.366,--I don't think that was a helpful--
1994.93-1612,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2971.366,2971.932,He wants to--
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2974.818,2977.103,--I'm referring to the development of the statute.
1994.93-1612,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2977.103,2979.236,"So you're... I misunderstood you, too."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2988.875,2990.292,"Authorized those activities, yes."
1994.93-1612,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2990.292,2990.675,Yes.
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,2992.341,2996.995,"I did want to talk just a second about the sequence of the statutes here, because it seems to us very important."
1994.93-1612,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3058.652,3060.452,I don't think the argument was all along.
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3081.733,3091.89,"--Well, but this Court in construing section 24(7) has been very careful to tie any extension to those powers to the express powers enumerated in section 24(7)."
1994.93-1612,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3101.079,3108.166,It's not very helpful to limit somebody to the business of banking if the business of banking means anything that banks want to do.
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3108.166,3109.166,Yes.
1994.93-1612,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3110.185,3111.785,And do in sufficient numbers.
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3111.785,3117.505,"Yes, and of course, that's a very fair point, which is, the statute does not say the business of banks."
1994.93-1612,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3121.825,3122.991,Do you take the position... I just want to be sure.
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3127.895,3129.329,--Absolutely not.
1994.93-1612,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3129.329,3132.431,"Well then, you disagree with Justice Scalia's question, I gather."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3132.431,3135.299,Well... I don't think that was the import.
1994.93-1612,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3135.299,3136.333,I think it was the--
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3136.333,3137.101,Perhaps I misread it.
1994.93-1612,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3137.101,3139.135,"--Well, maybe I didn't understand it, then."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3139.135,3148.893,"The... we think that the express powers given to banks, the way those are carried into effect will change over time."
1994.93-1612,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3161.984,3165.686,"Well, for example, there's a power, loaning on personal security."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3180.362,3183.897,"I think it is all part of the extension of credit, which is authorized."
1994.93-1612,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3183.897,3185.447,Any extension of credit is authorized?
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3185.447,3191.151,Yes.
1994.93-1612,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3191.151,3193.836,I don't see that.
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3195.955,3198.573,I think that has been the construction of the statute.
1994.93-1612,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3198.573,3201.525,Which of the five powers?
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3201.525,3202.909,"Your Honor, I don't have it before me."
1994.93-1612,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3202.909,3206.429,"Well, the only loaning is by loaning money on personal security."
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3206.429,3211.131,"That has been read to involve the extension of credit, because personal security wouldn't apply to corporations as well."
1994.93-1612,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3211.131,3215.119,It wouldn't... or... and nobody guarantees the note.
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3219.754,3221.023,It has been read to--
1994.93-1612,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3221.023,3221.306,Yes.
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3221.306,3223.723,"--Extension of credit generally, and we think that is fair."
1994.93-1612,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3225.074,3226.59,Even though it doesn't say so?
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3226.59,3228.442,"I think it does say so, Your Honor."
1994.93-1612,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3249.939,3260.295,"If you can generalize with respect to the extension of credit, why can't you generalize with respect to the investment power, which happens to be receiving deposits?"
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3272.888,3276.34,Because the bank itself is not receiving deposit here.
1994.93-1612,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3279.809,3280.259,"Well, that's--"
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3280.259,3281.025,--in a context where--
1994.93-1612,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3281.025,3285.113,"--that is to say we won't generalize, but my question is, why don't you generalize?"
1994.93-1612,2,21564,david_overlock_stewart,,3285.113,3296.17,"--Well, I think in this instance, section 92 indicates that Congress addressed this and specifically indicated that it did not want banks to participate in this kind of activity."
1994.93-1612,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3297.97,3298.72,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
