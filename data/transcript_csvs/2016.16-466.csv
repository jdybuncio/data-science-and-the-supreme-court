2016.16-466,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.81,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 16-466, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company v. The Superior Court of California. Mr. Katyal."
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,8.81,58.52,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The California Supreme Court ruled that hundreds of plaintiffs who were not prescribed a drug in California, who did not take it in California, who lacked any injury in California, and who had no other connection to California could sue in California. The court reasoned there was a sliding scale whereby the defendant's other conduct with other Californians could establish specific jurisdiction. Those concepts have some footing in the law, but that footing is limited to general jurisdiction, which is lacking here, and this Court has never permitted specific jurisdiction in such circumstances, which is presumably why Respondents don't bother defending the California Supreme Court. Instead, they mint a whole new test, never before seen by any court whereby an ad hoc reasonableness inquiry with any number of undetermined balancing factors will create jurisdiction."
2016.16-466,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,58.52,62.94,You've conceded that there's fair play and substantial justice.
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,72.185,75.415,"Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's actually what we conceded."
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,108.0,108.47,I'm sorry.
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,108.47,109.665,But we absolutely did.
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,109.665,111.95,How is it unreasonable --
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,111.95,112.57,How to --
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,112.57,141.275,"-- to have -- yes. Now, you're not fighting that pending jurisdiction permits a court to take multiple claims of damages nationwide, or even worldwide, and even unrelated causes of action and bring them to a jurisdiction, correct, by one plaintiff? So you're not -- you're not claiming that that offends due process."
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,141.275,146.56,"Pending jurisdiction, at least personal jurisdiction, is only applied in some Federal courts by dint of common law."
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,153.425,163.77,"So how do you deal -- so you're saying that pendent jurisdiction for claims that, in some way, are connected violates due process?"
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,163.77,164.15,We're saying --
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,164.15,165.15,Do you go any further?
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,165.15,169.3,We're saying that there has to be a causation between the underlying cause of action.
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,169.3,171.1,With every single individual action.
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,174.7,175.43,We're not destroying it.
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,185.66,187.31,That's assuming I buy your argument.
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,187.31,187.64,-- is always --
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,187.64,188.49,Let's put it aside.
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,188.49,191.56,"But I'm just saying that that has been the law, and always is --"
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,191.56,203.735,"But your position right now is that in no suit will one court, State court, ever be able to hear the entire controversy between a plaintiff and a defendant."
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,203.735,205.09,"Oh, definitely not."
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,212.64,213.91,Only when that's general jurisdiction.
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,213.91,215.64,"No, not -- again, that's one place."
2016.16-466,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,223.13,223.19,If --
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,223.19,224.66,"-- for example, effective marketing --"
2016.16-466,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,224.66,236.27,"If, for example, the drugs that -- that everyone bought all over the country was manufactured in one place, even though it wasn't the -- the place of business or the place of incorporation?"
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,236.27,236.77,Right.
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,250.22,254.41,What's efficient about having piecemeal litigations across the country?
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,254.41,254.73,Well --
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,254.73,267.18,"For years we've been approving pendent jurisdiction, or at least not taking any case that disturbed it, and there are cases in which we've just assumed it."
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,271.22,273.87,"So -- so first of all, Justice Sotomayor, I disagree with the premise."
2016.16-466,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,316.75,328.21,"If -- if this suit went forward just with the California plaintiffs and Bristol-Myers did not prevail, would there be issue preclusion in other States, assuming that judgment was final?"
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,328.21,329.25,I don't think so.
2016.16-466,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,340.285,354.56,"But if they all -- if they -- if they all allege the same basic flaw in the drug, the -- the drug was defective but cost, and that's determined in suit number 1, I take it that would be issue preclusion."
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,354.56,363.745,"But the -- the problem is there are so many different substantive standards as a matter of actual reality as opposed to, you know, kind of a theory about deceptive marketing or something."
2016.16-466,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,365.64,370.73,"Well, let's -- let's assume that New York and California are basically the same, the facts are basically the same."
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,385.57,392.65,"Absolutely, Justice Kennedy. There's no -- there's no -- you know, we can, of course, waive -- waive that and -- and seek collateral estoppel. But to go back to --"
2016.16-466,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,392.65,410.395,"Mr. Katyal, could we go back to a form of Justice Kennedy's first question, which is, just could you explain what defendant's interests are at stake here? In other words, you know, usually we've looked to fairness for the defendant when we make the due process inquiry."
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,424.81,425.27,Exactly.
2016.16-466,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,430.48,432.02,So could we just start with the fairness?
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,432.02,432.7,Absolutely.
2016.16-466,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,438.13,438.955,You've timed it.
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,438.955,440.56,-- but -- I have. (Laughter.)
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,440.56,462.915,"And -- but our view is to affirm Bristol-Myers in -- to affirm the judgment below or to accept his theory is going to be -- you know, be complex, it's going to be inefficient and unfair, and do something this Court has never blessed before internally that Bristol-Myers didn't open itself up to. So the first thing that would happen in this lawsuit is a determination of choice of laws he acknowledges."
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,549.98,550.28,I'm sorry.
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,554.655,555.32,"Oh, they do."
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,555.32,569.795,"The question is what's the unfairness of coordinating the common questions in one place when there is so much overlap in the essence of the claim, which is false marketing?"
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,569.795,573.49,"So -- so, Justice Sotomayor, first of all, I don't think that they would be coordinated."
2016.16-466,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,582.0,584.1,"But it seems you're conflating two things, Mr. Katyal."
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,611.865,614.35,So -- and the reasons are both procedure and substance.
2016.16-466,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,665.785,678.79,"But you already know because this is a nationwide marketing that you do, nationwide drug, you already know that you're subject to jurisdiction in any of the 50 States and have to be prepared to confront jurisdiction in any of the 50 States."
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,678.79,685.15,"But -- but Justice Kagan, critically, we know that we confronted with respect to each individual State's procedure and substance."
2016.16-466,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,693.42,715.96,"Well, I guess what I'm saying is that I -- the unfairness aspect of this is what I really want to drive at, because predictability just honestly doesn't seem like what's at issue here given that you know it's perfectly predictable to have litigation in any of the 50 States. So the question is, why is it unfair to have more litigation than you would in one of those States rather than another?"
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,715.96,717.61,"Justice Kagan, it's not a numbers game."
2016.16-466,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,743.12,749.55,Could you make this as concrete as you can for me? And I -- I'm assuming that your interests are the flip side to the plaintiffs' interests.
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,761.53,769.545,"Well, I suppose one thing, the plaintiffs only have one thing to think about, which is what's kind of jurisdictionally advantageous for them, either procedurally or substantively."
2016.16-466,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,813.15,828.8,"I guess -- I guess I'm -- I'm feeling a little bit stymied here because I thought you were going to come at me with saying, look, the juries in California are different or there's punitive damages in California when there's not someplace else or the substantive rules might be different."
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,830.2,831.59,"All of the above, Justice Kagan."
2016.16-466,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,833.38,834.865,All of those things.
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,914.14,921.33,"So, Justice Breyer, we -- we think you should write an opinion for us that doesn't deal with multidistrict litigation or class actions, and that's easy to do."
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,930.63,932.64,I have no idea how you draw that line.
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,932.64,933.65,Because there's not rivalrous --
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,933.65,941.61,"If it is due process, then -- and how do you say that it's not due process merely because it's Federal?"
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,941.61,954.21,"For two reasons: Because it's not rivalrous jurisdiction, it's not Ohio versus California and every State in between; and because the whole question in due process is minimal contacts, and people are deemed to have minimal contacts with the Federal government as a sovereign."
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,955.77,962.36,But that is not a Federal claim in -- that is a State law claim that would be brought in -- in Federal court.
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,962.36,962.9,But -- but the --
2016.16-466,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,962.9,964.4,Why would due process be different?
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,964.4,972.21,"The constitutional rule that Justice Breyer was asking would apply differently. That's why this Court's always reserved it. And multidistrict litigation, of course, operates very differently."
2016.16-466,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,976.85,982.96,"But could Congress make it for trial? Right now, the multidistrict litigation panels is only for pretrial."
2016.16-466,0,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1004.95,1015.71,"Justice Ginsburg, I certainly think the Court could write an opinion which says that that is perfectly permissible and still reject Mr. Goldstein's theory 100 percent, which is what this Court has done time and again. May I reserve?"
2016.16-466,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1015.71,1023.845,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kovner."
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1023.845,1064.225,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court in Goodyear and Daimler rejected approaches to general jurisdiction that would allow plaintiff in one State to sue a national company for product liability in all of the other 49 States, calling those approaches exorbitant and unacceptably grasping. The California Supreme Court misunderstood this Court's decisions when it allowed that same result under the label of specific jurisdiction. As this Court explained in Goodyear, specific jurisdiction lets a State exercise authority over activity within its borders, which it has a strong interest in controlling."
2016.16-466,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1071.79,1083.825,"But if this were -- if this were a case where the nonresident plaintiffs were suing Bristol-Myer in California, then everything you say follows."
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1105.575,1106.47,"That's right, Your Honor."
2016.16-466,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1150.66,1154.77,What about McKesson? There -- there are two defendants here.
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1166.44,1169.36,So I think it's not -- it's not clear.
2016.16-466,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1190.3,1198.77,"Could the plaintiffs here have filed against McKesson and then, under California procedure, added Bristol-Myers as a necessary party?"
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1198.77,1202.09,I'm not -- I'm not sure as a matter of California law.
2016.16-466,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1202.36,1204.37,Assume California law will have that.
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1208.12,1208.41,No.
2016.16-466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1233.31,1239.055,Can we go to the logic of your position? Assume a foreign corporation.
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1259.42,1261.61,I think that it might not be in the United States.
2016.16-466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1265.03,1267.13,Products are sold here across the United States.
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1280.99,1282.23,That's true for some.
2016.16-466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1282.23,1305.74,There is an amicus brief here that talked about all of the criminal laws that would be subject to questioning under your theory of -- of constitutional due process. What is your response to them? Is it the same as Mr. Katyal's? We'll face that when we get to it?
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1305.74,1305.91,No.
2016.16-466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1319.51,1341.275,"If due process says that you can't hail someone into a court with which they've had no contacts, how do you justify the many criminal statutes we have -- RICO, CERCLA, there's a whole bunch of them -- that permit the joinder of all of these defendants in one indictment?"
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1341.275,1348.5,"Well, Your Honor, if we're talking about criminal statutes, these are statutes that are based on the idea that this is conduct that exercises some --"
2016.16-466,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1348.5,1350.62,All of them have a civil component.
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1350.62,1351.21,Yes.
2016.16-466,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1372.94,1378.425,"Counsel, one thing we haven't talked about, we've talked a fair amount about fairness and predictability, but we haven't talked about federalism."
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1392.775,1393.25,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.16-466,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1395.82,1396.97,"Or -- or McIntyre, maybe?"
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1396.97,1418.17,"Yes, and continuing through McIntyre, this Court has made clear that specific jurisdiction needs to be defined with -- with an eye to the view that there are 50 different States, and that other States are also going to have an interest in adjudicating conduct that occurs within their borders. So if specific jurisdiction is defined in a very permissive way that allows States that don't have a strong interest in regulating the conduct to --"
2016.16-466,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1418.17,1424.76,"So who -- which State are we worried about here? Are we worried about the plaintiff's State, or are we worried about the defendant's State?"
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1424.76,1431.6,"I think there are two States that have a very strong interest, at least two States that have a very strong interest in providing a forum for the conduct at issue here."
2016.16-466,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1438.2,1449.975,"So on the plaintiff's side, that seems a pretty attenuated interest, if -- because usually when we say that the State has an interest, it's in protecting their own citizens and providing their own citizens with a forum."
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1462.44,1463.29,I don't think so at all.
2016.16-466,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1472.2,1479.785,"And it's also true, it would seem to me, that a State A has a very strong interest in confining State B to State B's territorial --"
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1479.785,1480.53,"That's right, Your Honor."
2016.16-466,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1480.53,1489.685,"Which doesn't -- that's why due process is the same for Federal and State, but there's a different set of criteria to which you apply it."
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1493.495,1494.24,"That's right, Your Honor."
2016.16-466,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1507.975,1510.169,So what -- what is your -- (Laughter.)
2016.16-466,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1510.169,1512.06,Justice Breyer.
2016.16-466,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1512.06,1514.73,What is your solution to mass torts?
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1514.73,1517.5,So we think there are a couple solutions.
2016.16-466,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1544.11,1546.29,"How, if it's constitutional?"
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1546.29,1547.79,I'm sorry?
2016.16-466,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1547.79,1551.09,How? How? How can Congress step in if it's constitutional?
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1551.09,1553.29,Because Congress is acting under the Fifth Amendment.
2016.16-466,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1555.9,1557.345,Fifth is different from the Fourteenth?
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1557.345,1559.16,"Well, it's the -- it's different in the following sense --"
2016.16-466,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1559.16,1559.64,Isn't that what you write?
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1559.64,1567.765,"It's different in the sense that the sovereign is different, and so the kind of contexts that you're talking about in the Fifth Amendment are contexts with the national sovereign."
2016.16-466,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1574.025,1578.915,So it's context with the United States as opposed to an individual State.
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1587.67,1597.77,"That's right, Your Honor, and the court -- courts of appeals have agreed on this. There are, you know, nationwide service of process provisions in which Congress has exercised that kind of authority."
2016.16-466,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1606.895,1610.925,Could you say how you would phrase the rule that you would like us to apply in this situation?
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1610.925,1611.67,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.16-466,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1630.84,1632.34,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.16-466,1,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1632.34,1634.7,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2016.16-466,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1634.7,1636.625,Mr. Goldstein.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1636.625,1647.49,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We believe that four facts make -- are sufficient to establish specific personal jurisdiction in this case."
2016.16-466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1703.8,1705.36,The States or the State?
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1705.36,1723.72,"That would be atomized across the States. My point is that, you know, we have a large number of cases about Plavix, and what's happening here for the benefit of the States, this is discussed in Keeton, is to bring the cases together so that the multistate judicial process can operate more efficiently."
2016.16-466,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1723.72,1725.26,But that's really not possible.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1761.27,1765.03,"Yeah, Justice Ginsburg, if I can come back that -- in one second, I -- I think it's a fair point."
2016.16-466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1768.08,1769.59,And could we have the fourth of -- I interrupted --
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1769.59,1770.17,"Yeah, exactly right."
2016.16-466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1770.59,1771.73,I interrupted you at first --
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1771.73,1771.97,"No, no --"
2016.16-466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1771.97,1772.76,But what was the fourth?
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1772.76,1773.035,Right.
2016.16-466,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1804.7,1806.92,But not necessarily to all the plaintiffs here.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1806.92,1807.275,Okay.
2016.16-466,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1840.57,1844.275,"Counsel, I -- I think Justice Ginsburg's question is still pending."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1844.275,1844.8,Excellent.
2016.16-466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1870.8,1873.37,But that's a very patronizing view of federalism.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1883.795,1891.27,"Sir, let me just analogize this case to Keeton, if I might, because there you have a very similar situation."
2016.16-466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1896.43,1900.585,There was an injury in New Hampshire to that plaintiff.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1900.585,1900.815,That's --
2016.16-466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1900.815,1902.43,And that's not present here.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1902.43,1916.95,"That is absolutely correct. But what the Court said was that that wasn't the special feature of it, and that was that that claim would otherwise be litigated in the 50 States, and that the States had an interest in centralizing it. If I could just make the final point about McKesson --"
2016.16-466,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1916.95,1919.44,That's peculiar to -- to libel claims.
2016.16-466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1919.44,1919.635,Right.
2016.16-466,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1919.635,1922.955,"I mean, they -- what are they called, the single --"
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1922.955,1923.72,Publication.
2016.16-466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1923.72,1924.6,Single publication.
2016.16-466,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1924.6,1924.95,"Yes, yes."
2016.16-466,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1924.95,1925.21,Exactly.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1961.96,1962.17,Okay.
2016.16-466,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2010.65,2024.835,"Well, how about the interest of the State that Bristol-Myers resides in? In other words, they might have an interest in not having their citizens hailed into court against their will in another part of the country."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2024.835,2025.1,Yeah.
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2056.32,2058.66,The obvious is that this is your home State.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2058.66,2059.46,"It isn't, though."
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2059.46,2064.21,"But let's imagine it's a home or whatever, and you say that a business is in that State."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2101.755,2118.84,"Well, all I can say is that in New -- the example of New Jersey and specific jurisdiction, they would be adjudicating the claim of somebody who was harmed in Ohio, even though it's not their home. But I did really want to focus on the -- the special interest that California has here because of the role of McKesson."
2016.16-466,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2120.4,2123.93,"Well, but, Mr. Goldstein, that's a very fact-specific argument."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2172.255,2189.115,If I could give you a narrower answer and then a bigger picture answer. The -- the narrow answer is that our view of the relatedness inquiry that is articulated in International Shoe does require that they engage in what Keeton and International Shoe refer to as the continuous and systematic exploitation of the market.
2016.16-466,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2196.605,2204.47,"But that's like saying, Mr. Goldstein, that the claim relates to another claim that relates to contacts with the forum."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2217.98,2235.555,"Well, here is how we understand that it would operate, and that is, the California court is providing a forum to adjudicate a claim about the lawfulness of BMS's design and manufacturing and distribution of this drug Plavix. That is activity that didn't occur in California."
2016.16-466,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2250.86,2252.38,"No, I understand that that's your point."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2285.86,2290.36,It does because the relevant contact is the nationwide activity.
2016.16-466,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2316.98,2325.295,"Let me see if I understand that, because you're saying -- usually we say how does the claim relate to the contacts in a particular State, say in California."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2335.68,2337.81,It arises from those same nationwide contacts.
2016.16-466,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2338.85,2345.42,"Those nationwide contacts being a nationwide advertising campaign, a nationwide marketing campaign, and so forth."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2345.42,2345.51,Right.
2016.16-466,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2371.585,2377.03,"What's confusing, though, about simply saying here's the correct test, reverse, remand, go apply the correct test?"
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2377.03,2383.77,"Well, you're going to have to say something about McKesson is all I'm saying. The -- the other side really wants to put it entirely to the side."
2016.16-466,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2410.92,2418.355,Could one of these Plavix -- could the Plavix claim have been brought as a class action?
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2418.355,2424.75,"The Plavix claim could have -- it depends on who we're talking about, but yes, there could have been a class action."
2016.16-466,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2427.55,2431.245,"And where -- if -- if so, where could it be brought?"
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2431.245,2443.045,"The -- it could be brought -- depending on whether you think McKesson plays a significant role, it would have been brought, I think, in California is the place where the class action would have been brought."
2016.16-466,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2470.45,2471.73,Special master is where?
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2471.73,2472.89,In New York.
2016.16-466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2477.81,2479.23,In the State court or the Southern District?
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2479.23,2480.54,It is -- I think it's --
2016.16-466,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2480.54,2482.24,Is it a Federal or State master?
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2482.24,2484.58,I don't think it is actually regarded that way.
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2526.74,2535.325,"Why isn't the answer to this, to my question, your question, which you raise a lot, this is going to be a terrible problem for mass torts."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2546.19,2548.38,"Well, I -- it would depend on things --"
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2548.38,2549.335,Not all can.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2549.945,2550.4,Right.
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2550.4,2552.03,But -- but a very large --
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2552.03,2552.16,Right.
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2552.16,2552.775,-- number.
2016.16-466,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2581.37,2582.77,Here that's not possible --
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2582.77,2584.795,So what is the response to that?
2016.16-466,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2584.795,2590.385,This -- the -- this case couldn't be in Federal court because there's no complete diversity.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2590.385,2591.0,That's what --
2016.16-466,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2591.0,2592.1,McKesson is California.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2592.1,2592.5,That's what --
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2592.5,2592.96,"Well, what you do is --"
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2592.96,2594.52,Justice Breyer says you could redesign the case.
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2594.52,2594.64,Yeah.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2594.94,2595.165,Okay.
2016.16-466,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2611.22,2613.15,"But in MDL litigation, you're in Federal court."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2617.28,2618.68,Well -- but remember --
2016.16-466,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2618.68,2620.12,Maybe more in theory than in practice.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2620.12,2620.66,Maybe so.
2016.16-466,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2655.77,2662.07,"Counsel, we're dealing with the jurisdictional rule, and when we do that, we want the rules to be as simple as possible."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2662.07,2662.365,Yes.
2016.16-466,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2662.365,2665.59,And you have -- you started out with the four different factors and all that.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2678.675,2679.07,Yes.
2016.16-466,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2679.44,2679.54,Okay.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2695.76,2696.04,Right.
2016.16-466,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2697.95,2702.63,"But that's right. You say handful in California, hundreds Tennessee and Texas, no good."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2705.665,2705.91,Right.
2016.16-466,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2756.79,2766.4,"I know, but you're articulating a rule that requires businesses trying to figure out where to do business and plaintiffs where to sue and courts whether it's real."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2773.245,2775.36,It -- there -- there is no precise number.
2016.16-466,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2775.88,2780.485,"If there were 20 in California and 575, would that satisfy due process?"
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2780.485,2783.47,"I think that it is -- I cannot answer that question, because --"
2016.16-466,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2783.47,2785.07,But it's your case. You ought to be able to at least answer --
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2785.07,2787.45,"Well, I know my case is Constitutional, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.16-466,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2815.5,2821.96,"Mr. Goldstein, it seems to me, on your theory, it could be zero California plaintiffs, because here's what you told me."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2840.66,2840.75,Right.
2016.16-466,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2840.75,2849.27,"So if that's your theory, it doesn't matter whether there are 86 or 20 or zero, because the contacts arise out of the nationwide/California contacts."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2849.27,2850.92,That's not correct.
2016.16-466,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2850.92,2852.66,The claim arises out of that.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2852.66,2857.165,"That's not correct, because your test that you've articulated has two core parts to it."
2016.16-466,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2869.51,2869.58,Yeah.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2889.19,2889.47,I agree.
2016.16-466,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2906.57,2906.74,Mr.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2908.82,2909.25,Yes.
2016.16-466,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2909.25,2911.79,"What is your definition of ""related to""?"
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2911.79,2919.745,That is -- it is -- it is the claim that is the same legal claim arising from the same operative facts.
2016.16-466,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2927.57,2936.82,So is that a yes to Justice Kagan's question about it wouldn't matter if there were no California plaintiffs?
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2936.82,2942.395,"It would relate to, but it would not be constitutional because it would not be reasonable under the second part of the test."
2016.16-466,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2954.76,2972.11,"Well, if you don't -- sorry, Mr. Goldstein -- but if you don't need a single plaintiff to satisfy the first prong of the due process inquiry, again, what function does that first prong have left to do? Why doesn't it all just run into the second fundamental fairness test?"
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2972.11,2972.33,Well --
2016.16-466,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2972.33,2973.02,What's left?
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2973.02,2981.51,"Well, because it gives the State the power, the territorial power, because it does have the power to adjudicate with respect to that conduct."
2016.16-466,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3032.84,3033.735,Great question.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3034.655,3035.7,"Yes, it is."
2016.16-466,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3053.83,3062.205,What you're suggesting is that the Court was wrong in -- in Daimler and in the one before it --
2016.16-466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3062.205,3062.68,Goodyear.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3062.68,3063.49,Goodyear and Daimler.
2016.16-466,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3063.49,3069.115,-- Goodyear in confining general jurisdiction.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3080.845,3081.405,Yes.
2016.16-466,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3081.405,3098.23,"So one comment that -- that you, no doubt, know has been made about this case, is that it is an attempt to reintroduce general jurisdiction, which was lost in Daimler, by the backdoor."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3098.23,3098.99,The backdoor.
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3141.02,3142.64,Can you -- this is answer this in a sense -- all right.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3167.98,3168.76,"Specific, yes."
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3168.76,3182.9,"But why am I here in respect to Smith? Because, you see, Smith isn't a citizen of our State. So where that answer sounded -- this is logic, and what's bothering about the whole case is its logic, and I don't know the practicalities."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3187.905,3188.12,Right.
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3188.12,3193.08,"I cannot say, because you are a citizen of Texas, because that cuts no ice in California."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3199.41,3211.58,"You're already here on this claim, and there is nothing unfair about having you have it with respect to another plaintiff, because that plaintiff could quite clearly get you estopped on the basis of --"
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3211.58,3214.57,"I was here for that purpose, not --"
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3214.57,3215.59,You're here.
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3215.59,3217.43,"So once I'm here, I can now sue him."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3218.02,3218.81,On the exact same.
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3218.81,3220.06,-- that's when lines -- all right.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3220.06,3220.97,"Well, Justice Breyer, all --"
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3220.97,3221.84,I'm not disagreeing with you.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3221.84,3222.03,Thank you.
2016.16-466,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3222.03,3223.0,I'm trying to get the answer in.
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3223.49,3223.87,All right.
2016.16-466,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3239.81,3240.25,Can I take you back?
2016.16-466,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3240.25,3242.89,"Well, that's the same thing applies, just completely flipped."
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3253.815,3263.84,"Oh, well, sir, remember, the -- the -- an important part of our analysis is that there is the governmental interest in that the litigation in this forum does consolidate things and make it simpler."
2016.16-466,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3294.85,3297.85,Can I take you back to Justice Breyer's question about Federal courts --
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3297.85,3297.91,Yeah.
2016.16-466,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3297.91,3320.55,"-- and multidistrict litigation? Because you didn't say something that makes me think, if you didn't say it, I don't understand. Assuming that there was subject matter jurisdiction, that there's diversity, it still it seems to me that the way -- there's no nationwide service of process here. So the Federal courts have to mimic the State courts; isn't that correct?"
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3320.55,3320.78,Right.
2016.16-466,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3418.89,3422.915,"If -- if I heard you correctly, you said something about overruling cases; is that right?"
2016.16-466,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3422.915,3424.55,If it were necessary to.
2016.16-466,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3441.68,3443.8,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Katyal."
2016.16-466,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3443.8,3448.685,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.16-466,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3448.685,3459.56,"Mr. Katyal, assume a set of facts that I know have not been proven. Bristol-Myers sells the drugs to McKesson."
2016.16-466,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3474.345,3480.69,"Well, they might or might not. That's a purposeful availment stream-of-commerce theory, which we're not trying to, you know, push here."
2016.16-466,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3481.95,3482.25,Articulate --
2016.16-466,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3482.25,3483.13,But I definitely --
2016.16-466,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3483.13,3486.945,-- your theory in a way that it wouldn't implicate -- articulate your --
2016.16-466,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3486.945,3487.22,So my --
2016.16-466,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3487.22,3490.36,-- proximate cause and your causation theories --
2016.16-466,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3490.36,3490.89,Justice --
2016.16-466,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3490.89,3493.58,-- in a way that wouldn't preclude that suit.
2016.16-466,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3493.58,3505.31,"So, Justice Sotomayor, my theory is exactly what this Court said in Rush, which is why his argument in McKesson doesn't work. It's, quote, plainly unconstitutional to exert jurisdiction over one defendant based on the activities of another."
2016.16-466,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3552.5,3561.59,"But -- but my real problem is that -- following your theory, I'm not sure what Bristol-Myers is doing there in the California case."
2016.16-466,3,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3569.955,3577.82,"But I think that when -- when they make an arrangement with the distributor to -- to launch drugs in a particular location, they're liable for that."
2016.16-466,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3647.18,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
