1972.71-6042,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.469,"We’ll hear arguments next in 71-6042, Wardius against Oregon."
1972.71-6042,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,33.632,36.324,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-6042,1,29010,justice_bernnan,,140.159,144.118,"If it had, would you be here?"
1972.71-6042,2,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,144.118,148.956,"If it had, I believe he would have been here, Your Honor perhaps not on that issue but on the other side."
1972.71-6042,3,29010,justice_bernnan,,150.489,154.438,But not on the attack on the alibi statute?
1972.71-6042,4,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,154.438,156.112,"On the alibi statute, yes."
1972.71-6042,5,29010,justice_bernnan,,162.174,166.077,"What would be left, if this provided reciprocity?"
1972.71-6042,6,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,166.077,183.89,"I believe that what would be left in this particular case, Your Honor, is the fact that the Oregon statute applies to the defendant’s testimony and that the requirements that he file a written notice as to his whereabouts prior to trial as a condition of his taking the stand would get us here."
1972.71-6042,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,183.89,188.288,Did you ask for any disclosure that you didn’t get?
1972.71-6042,6,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,188.288,189.711,I was not the trial attorney but --
1972.71-6042,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,189.711,190.53,Oh!
1972.71-6042,6,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,191.314,195.407,From the record there was no request.
1972.71-6042,8,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,207.429,217.389,"Yes, Your Honor, the Court of Appeals held that they would not reach this issue because the State did not offer any rebuttal evidence."
1972.71-6042,10,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,371.474,372.859,It may have Your Honor.
1972.71-6042,11,29010,justice_bernnan,,444.987,446.603,I might clear Mr. Kuhn.
1972.71-6042,12,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,454.834,456.155,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,13,29010,justice_bernnan,,456.155,472.703,"Well, and yet your Court of Appeals says as you said that Mr. Justice Rehnquist earlier refuse to reach the question since there’d been know demand for reciprocity by trial counsel, is that right?"
1972.71-6042,14,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,472.703,481.512,Not because there was no demand of that may have been included in that they said specifically because the State had not offered any rebuttal testimony in the instant case.
1972.71-6042,15,29010,justice_bernnan,,481.512,483.59,"Well, were you in the Court of Appeals?"
1972.71-6042,16,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,483.59,485.229,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,17,29010,justice_bernnan,,485.229,488.802,"Well, did you make the argument of the face of the statute?"
1972.71-6042,18,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,488.802,490.583,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,19,29010,justice_bernnan,,490.583,496.744,But I don’t quite understand how the basis upon which your Court of Appeals refuse to consider.
1972.71-6042,20,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,496.744,499.086,"Neither do I, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,21,29010,justice_bernnan,,500.486,506.8,But you are telling as you did in the Court of Appeals make the argument on the face of the statute?
1972.71-6042,22,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,506.8,512.465,"Yes, Your Honor that the statute was unconstitutional because it -- there was no reciprocity on the face of the statute."
1972.71-6042,24,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,530.684,530.849,Oh!
1972.71-6042,26,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,544.656,545.131,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,27,29010,justice_bernnan,,557.341,559.54,How far they full insured?
1972.71-6042,28,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,559.54,577.359,"Well, a long way I believe they have as I indicated as of now the defendant does not have to comply with the statute and if the State gives him specific time and place of the date the crime was alleged to have been committed."
1972.71-6042,28,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,579.257,580.422,I don’t follow you on that.
1972.71-6042,28,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,581.756,583.159,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,28,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,583.159,587.153,In the respondent’s supplemental brief filed today here or filed this week?
1972.71-6042,28,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,587.153,588.266,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,28,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,588.266,589.018,Is that available?
1972.71-6042,28,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,592.308,593.634,A specific report.
1972.71-6042,28,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,593.634,593.859,Right.
1972.71-6042,28,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,595.134,600.793,In Oregon without that statute don’t you have a right to find that out by bill of particulars?
1972.71-6042,28,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,600.793,601.587,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,28,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,601.587,603.308,You don’t have a bill of particulars in Oregon?
1972.71-6042,28,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,603.308,606.148,"No, we don’t."
1972.71-6042,28,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,610.957,611.72,I thought so.
1972.71-6042,28,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,611.72,614.2,What about the indictment?
1972.71-6042,28,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,614.2,615.495,The indictment.
1972.71-6042,28,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,615.495,616.581,What does that tell?
1972.71-6042,28,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,616.581,624.161,The indictment up until the Kelsaw decision gives the date and the county in which the crime was committed.
1972.71-6042,28,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,624.161,626.944,And what more now?
1972.71-6042,28,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,626.944,630.068,The State must now tell them the specific time.
1972.71-6042,28,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,631.503,633.897,"In any hour of the day, (Inaudible)."
1972.71-6042,28,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,633.897,635.269,Approximately the date.
1972.71-6042,29,29010,justice_bernnan,,653.983,659.247,And then the State will have a burden of proving that date and that place?
1972.71-6042,30,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,659.247,675.403,The law in Oregon is and under Kelsaw remains to be that the State is not bound by the date alleged in the indictment and that the defendant by filing a notice of alibi or by claiming alibi cannot make time material.
1972.71-6042,31,29010,justice_bernnan,,675.916,684.112,"Well, I don’t -- I don’t frankly understand what you say is a small step of the Supreme Court of Oregon was taking."
1972.71-6042,32,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,684.112,684.526,"Well, that is it."
1972.71-6042,33,29010,justice_bernnan,,684.526,685.743,The rights of discovery.
1972.71-6042,34,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,685.743,687.357,"That is it, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,35,29010,justice_bernnan,,687.357,691.419,"Well, that didn’t sound to me as they put anything which stated it."
1972.71-6042,36,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,691.419,699.735,I don’t feel that it aids the defendant or assist in this problem very much at all because it’s easy for the State to give this information to the defendant.
1972.71-6042,36,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,703.602,706.078,"Mr. Kuhn, I share this confusion."
1972.71-6042,36,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,713.293,723.561,The Kelsaw case held that the defendant in Oregon does not have to comply with the terms of the Oregon alibi statute.
1972.71-6042,36,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,738.748,741.663,That the defendant has to comply only if --
1972.71-6042,36,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,741.663,742.468,If that information --
1972.71-6042,36,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,742.468,747.109,-- and that he doesn’t have to comply unless the prosecutor does for any said information.
1972.71-6042,36,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,747.109,747.907,"Correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,37,29010,justice_bernnan,,747.907,755.009,Well then why isn’t that -- why is that not complete reciprocity?
1972.71-6042,38,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,770.889,771.156,"Yes, Your Honor correct."
1972.71-6042,39,29010,justice_bernnan,,771.156,772.943,Is that right?
1972.71-6042,40,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,779.978,785.966,"Well, without the reciprocity provision which there still would not be under the terms of the Kelsaw --"
1972.71-6042,41,29010,justice_bernnan,,785.966,792.144,What more if there were a reciprocity provision would be in --would he be entitled to the names of the State witnesses?
1972.71-6042,42,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,792.144,795.712,"Yes, Your Honor specifically the names and addresses of the state witnesses."
1972.71-6042,43,29010,justice_bernnan,,795.712,797.502,Anything else?
1972.71-6042,44,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,797.502,806.525,That would be -- that is what we believe the Florida statute indicated what was fair.
1972.71-6042,44,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,806.525,810.615,But since the whole focus of your case is on the alibi statute.
1972.71-6042,44,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,810.615,811.49,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,44,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,811.49,822.526,"And the Kelsaw case now takes care of the disclosure with respect to that subject, why are these other matters relevant in the abstract?"
1972.71-6042,44,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,822.526,825.584,"Well, because if as I read the Kelsaw case."
1972.71-6042,45,29010,justice_bernnan,,839.286,841.938,As to name the witnesses but the State does not?
1972.71-6042,46,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,841.938,844.66,"Yes, Your Honor correct."
1972.71-6042,47,29010,justice_bernnan,,844.66,854.481,But the Kelsaw went on and say also that the state must in addition give the names of the State witnesses and support of those allegations of indictment?
1972.71-6042,48,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,857.34,860.105,Then I wouldn’t have a case on the reciprocity issue.
1972.71-6042,48,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,860.105,860.649,Yes.
1972.71-6042,48,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,861.854,864.908,"Yes, Your Honor, on the reciprocity issue."
1972.71-6042,49,29010,justice_bernnan,,893.722,895.895,Do you say that’s an unconstitutional condition?
1972.71-6042,50,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,895.895,897.804,I believe that that is unconstitutional.
1972.71-6042,51,29010,justice_bernnan,,897.804,899.337,Under what provision of the constitution?
1972.71-6042,52,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,899.337,899.899,"Condition, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,54,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,935.349,946.201,"I believe so with the theory of it perhaps as to Williams I believe that Williams, the defendant actually as a matter of fact did testify."
1972.71-6042,54,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,946.761,953.255,But should Florida -- but Williams against Florida wasn’t -- isn’t the defendant exempt from the requirement?
1972.71-6042,54,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,953.255,953.543,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,54,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,953.543,954.149,[Voice Overlap] by statute?
1972.71-6042,54,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,954.149,966.399,The defendant in Florida is exempt specifically under the terms of the Florida statute and that the failure to file notice under Florida Statute does not affect his right to take the stand and give testimony.
1972.71-6042,56,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,1149.098,1151.868,"He does not have to take the stand, Your Honor however, and the issue hasn’t come up."
1972.71-6042,56,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1163.298,1164.854,Because you have no law of that thing?
1972.71-6042,56,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,1164.854,1165.498,There is no law.
1972.71-6042,56,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1231.541,1234.389,The statute talks about a good cause --
1972.71-6042,56,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,1234.389,1234.817,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,56,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1234.817,1236.102,-- excusing him from the requirement.
1972.71-6042,56,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,1240.186,1242.259,There has been only one and that’s the Kelsaw decision.
1972.71-6042,56,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1242.259,1242.832,That’s all?
1972.71-6042,56,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,1242.832,1244.812,They ruled there that there was not good cause.
1972.71-6042,56,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1244.812,1247.105,And in this case of course they ruled there was a not a good cause.
1972.71-6042,56,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,1247.105,1247.773,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,56,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1256.499,1258.349,But your state court --
1972.71-6042,56,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,1258.349,1258.718,Yes.
1972.71-6042,56,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1258.718,1260.552,-- could in terms of whether or not there was good cause.
1972.71-6042,56,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,1260.552,1261.222,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,56,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1266.601,1271.293,"But there is except for Kelsaw on this case, there is no -- there is no case law on what is or is not."
1972.71-6042,56,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,1271.293,1277.013,"No, You Honor, those are the only the two cases in State versus Blake, however, it doesn’t indicate and adds nothing new."
1972.71-6042,56,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1277.013,1288.996,Thank you.
1972.71-6042,56,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1288.996,1290.339,Mr. Gillette.
1972.71-6042,57,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1290.339,1293.786,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-6042,58,29010,justice_bernnan,,1376.597,1379.106,No discussion at all of the names of witnesses.
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1379.106,1380.436,"No sir, there was not."
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1432.156,1439.66,And has there been any request for a bill of particulars in any case before the Oregon Supreme Court as of now?
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1439.66,1440.538,"Yes, sir it has, and it’s been denied."
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1440.538,1441.969,And they turned it down?
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1441.969,1443.211,"Yes, they have."
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1443.881,1447.709,So how do we get all this great hopes about wha they got and do?
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1447.709,1454.691,Those cases were decided prior to Williams and I am speaking only with respect to what is meant to happen under notice of alibi case.
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1460.023,1467.435,Do you think that Oregon could pass a statute requirement defendant to advise the State of what its defense will be?
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1467.435,1469.307,No.
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1469.307,1472.301,Well what’s the difference between that statute and this one?
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1472.301,1485.671,"Well, the rational of alibi statute, as I understand them and as I believe they are explained in the Williams case, is that the alibi defense is a peculiar kind of defense it offers opportunities for surprise that the general defense does not."
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1490.089,1495.059,"Well, assuming that applies to other witnesses that doesn’t apply to the defendant, does it?"
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1495.059,1498.647,An alibi is just as surprising when the defendant raises it by himself as when he calls --
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1498.647,1501.956,"Well, what could the state do to counteract it?"
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1501.956,1511.488,Call witnesses to show that either the defendant was somewhere else or call witnesses who were at this place where the defendant claims to have been to show that he wasn’t there.
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1511.488,1515.068,It’s almost unbelievable.
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1546.942,1548.878,I think you’re right.
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1548.878,1552.366,But this is one instance where he can’t.
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1552.366,1552.678,"No, sir."
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1558.01,1561.199,You mean he can testify as an alibi?
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1561.199,1561.395,No.
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1561.395,1562.488,The defendant here?
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1562.488,1564.54,"No, I am sorry perhaps I miss understand your question."
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1571.965,1574.111,"No, I didn’t say that."
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1577.612,1577.957,Oh!
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1579.852,1595.022,"He might of when he went to trial, he might have said I am not going take the witness stand which he has a right to do and during the trial he changes his mind and says I want to take the stand and I want to put my alibi in."
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1596.968,1597.957,He is not.
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1597.957,1602.819,Don’t you agree that interferes with his right to testify?
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1602.819,1614.781,"I don’t think it interferes with his right to testify if during the time limit provided by the statute prior to trial he was aware on it, informed his counsel of the fact that he had alibi testimony to offer."
1972.71-6042,59,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1641.379,1642.691,But is no longer that affecting?
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1642.691,1643.436,"No, there’s not."
1972.71-6042,59,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1644.808,1646.064,Right.
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1646.064,1653.721,And you’re dealing with the constitutionally protected right to testify or not to testify?
1972.71-6042,59,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1653.721,1660.224,"Well, if you’re saying that we’re dealing with an absolute right to testify, then I don’t think this Court has said that."
1972.71-6042,59,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1663.991,1671.57,You don’t believe that the defendant has an absolute right to testify to save his neck?
1972.71-6042,61,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1677.568,1680.127,"That’s right, we wouldn’t."
1972.71-6042,61,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1680.127,1686.096,"Well, doesn’t Williams – didn’t the Williams’ holdings settled some of these questions, Mr. Gillette?"
1972.71-6042,61,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1686.096,1692.222,"Well, I think the Williams’ holdings settled the question of whether or not the notice of alibi is constitutional."
1972.71-6042,61,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1693.217,1695.315,And against the Fifth Amendment?
1972.71-6042,61,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1695.315,1695.917,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-6042,61,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1696.805,1699.297,"And as applicable only to third party witnesses, right?"
1972.71-6042,61,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1699.297,1700.199,That’s right.
1972.71-6042,61,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1700.716,1701.67,Not the defendant.
1972.71-6042,61,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1701.67,1703.718,Neither the two parties.
1972.71-6042,61,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1710.137,1716.053,Will settle whether or not giving notice of the alibi violated the defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights against itself.
1972.71-6042,61,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1716.863,1719.943,"If that’s the way I understood the case, yes sir."
1972.71-6042,62,29010,justice_bernnan,,1767.506,1777.966,"Tell me Mr. Gillette, do you agree with your brother that the question of constitutionality of the statute on its face was raised before your Court of Appeals?"
1972.71-6042,63,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1777.966,1778.938,"No, sir I really don’t."
1972.71-6042,64,29010,justice_bernnan,,1778.938,1779.931,I see.
1972.71-6042,65,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1779.931,1790.923,I feel the entire context to that argument which Mr. Kuhn and I made was the question of whether the statute was constitutional as applied in that case and there was no real issue on constitutionality on the face of the statute.
1972.71-6042,66,29010,justice_bernnan,,1790.923,1795.269,Then do you suggest that question is not before us in consequence?
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1795.269,1796.22,I really don’t think it is.
1972.71-6042,67,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.365,1808.248,Could you just tell me what the State’s interest is in having this alibi statute?
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1808.248,1812.432,"Yes, it is the same interest that’s referred to in the Williams case."
1972.71-6042,67,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1841.561,1865.554,"And what interest of Florida is lost if at the time an alibi witness is offered that hasn’t been previously been disclosed, that the trial is adjourned until -- so that the state may accomplish its aims of investigation and avoidance of surprise then of fraud and perjury?"
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1865.554,1867.617,I think the concern their shifts.
1972.71-6042,67,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1948.92,1955.552,What do you suppose the State will do if we disagree with you to sustain your position?
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1958.263,1958.58,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-6042,67,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1959.507,1959.919,I think.
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1970.658,1972.083,"Yes, I think that’s what would be done."
1972.71-6042,67,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1972.083,1979.434,Mr. -- how long as a practice the matter can you adjourn the criminal trial?
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1979.434,1984.354,"Well, the Ellsberg case [Voice Overlap] a long time."
1972.71-6042,67,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1985.497,1989.516,They tried and it didn’t work.
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1989.516,1997.285,I can only suggest to the Court based upon my own limited experience that it is impractical to adjourn matters like that for any extended length of time.
1972.71-6042,67,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.285,1998.926,Like what?
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,1999.439,2001.254,I think it’s impossible to identify the period of time.
1972.71-6042,67,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2004.161,2006.865,When does the defendant have to give notice of alibi under the --
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2006.865,2008.263,Five days prior to trial.
1972.71-6042,67,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2008.263,2010.442,So that’s all the State may need is five days.
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2010.442,2012.306,That’s what the statute apparently it arises.
1972.71-6042,67,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.306,2016.169,"Well, would need anymore in that jury trial, would it?"
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2016.169,2020.85,"No, unless they find witnesses they have to give notice to the defendant to who in which case I assume he is entitled longer."
1972.71-6042,67,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2020.85,2027.313,"In Oregon, do you know if -- is it customary to adjourn a trial criminal trial more than 24-48 hours?"
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2027.313,2029.468,"No, it’s not."
1972.71-6042,67,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2029.468,2032.5,Because most states do not have an alibi statute.
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2032.5,2034.959,16 States have them.
1972.71-6042,67,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2035.74,2036.171,So the other 34 --
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2036.171,2037.316,Just less --
1972.71-6042,67,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2037.316,2039.31,-- get along without it and --
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2039.31,2039.524,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-6042,67,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2039.524,2040.665,Take their risk on the journey.
1972.71-6042,67,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2040.665,2043.301,"16 States, they have some kind of an alibi statute."
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2048.005,2050.34,I am not sure the exact number I think five or six.
1972.71-6042,67,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2050.34,2061.286,"Most of them or at least some of them are large percentage only prevent third party witnesses from testifying, is that correct?"
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2061.286,2062.038,That is right.
1972.71-6042,67,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2064.857,2065.704,Himself?
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2065.704,2069.489,Some of them do not provide for exclusion in any case the statute --
1972.71-6042,67,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2069.489,2071.476,What sanction do they impose?
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2071.476,2076.251,"Sometimes the continuants, in fact I think the continuance is usually the sanction imposed."
1972.71-6042,67,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2076.251,2076.63,Yes.
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2076.63,2082.545,The statutes are a classic example of various states experimenting with the procedures.
1972.71-6042,67,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2085.639,2086.804,When was this enacted?
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2086.804,2092.112,It is not the 1969 makes it for more recent in the majority of them which were enacted during the 30’s.
1972.71-6042,67,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2092.112,2095.005,Did you have anything akin to this before 1969?
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2095.005,2095.882,"No, we didn’t?"
1972.71-6042,67,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2095.882,2096.391,Nothing.
1972.71-6042,67,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2096.391,2099.763,No.
1972.71-6042,68,29010,justice_bernnan,,2099.763,2118.563,"Mr. Gillette, may I get back again to this quest ion of whether the constitutionality of the statutes on its face is before us, what is the argument procedure by which you raise a question in the trial Court is this by a point raise in the brief or do you have some assignment of it or something?"
1972.71-6042,69,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2118.563,2129.96,Oregon law requires that the issue the constitutionality of the statute either on its face or as implied be raise in the Trial Court and that the record be made of that and it is becomes the designated matters on field.
1972.71-6042,69,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2129.96,2132.603,Did you say -- Excuse me.
1972.71-6042,69,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2138.62,2144.902,The matter in which this whole question came up is set out at length in the appendix and I think it’s of some significance.
1972.71-6042,70,29010,justice_bernnan,,2229.815,2242.706,"And yet when you got to the Court of Appeals I think you told me earlier, your Court of Appeals did determine a question of the constitutionality of the statute as applied, isn’t that right?"
1972.71-6042,71,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2242.706,2249.203,"Well, it is difficult for me to describe any particular posture that opinion quite frankly."
1972.71-6042,72,29010,justice_bernnan,,2249.203,2254.446,"You mean, you can’t say whether the Court of Appeals decided any constitutional question of that statute?"
1972.71-6042,73,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2254.446,2262.504,"They decided that with respect to the Fifth Amendment issue with respect to whether requiring the disclosure of this constitutional that, that was proper under this Court’s decision in Williams."
1972.71-6042,73,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2262.504,2269.871,"But the trial court did consider the constitutional point and did consider Williams, right?"
1972.71-6042,73,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2269.871,2271.637,"It had Williams v. Florida, yes."
1972.71-6042,73,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2271.637,2282.102,Didn’t it consider it and did it write it on page 15?
1972.71-6042,73,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2309.628,2311.902,Is that the trial court’s memo or the Court of Appeals?
1972.71-6042,73,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2311.902,2312.711,That’s the Courts of Appeals’ decision.
1972.71-6042,73,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2312.711,2313.644,Is that 12 (b)?
1972.71-6042,73,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2313.644,2316.2,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-6042,73,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2316.2,2318.415,"And so they did consider it, didn’t they?"
1972.71-6042,73,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2318.415,2320.655,"They considered the Fifth Amendment issue, yes."
1972.71-6042,73,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2332.849,2348.494,"Your position is that he was banking on the point that has changed in date, excused him from complying with the statute and that was his only complaint, is that what you’re saying?"
1972.71-6042,73,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2348.494,2351.13,"No, because he says one other thing in that transcript."
1972.71-6042,73,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.604,2375.367,He was really trying to get under the good cause form.
1972.71-6042,73,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2375.367,2376.774,"No, I don’t think so."
1972.71-6042,73,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2387.216,2389.803,Inapplicable or unconstitutional?
1972.71-6042,73,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2389.803,2392.245,"Well, unconstitutional."
1972.71-6042,73,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2393.024,2396.142,Right.
1972.71-6042,74,29010,justice_bernnan,,2396.142,2397.805,"Well, just so I’m clear."
1972.71-6042,75,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2402.512,2408.033,"No, sir."
1972.71-6042,75,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2408.033,2426.112,"What would you suppose the interest of the defendant would be in not notifying of an alibi if he was reasonably confident that -- if he didn’t notify and still -- and nevertheless offered alibi witnesses during the trial, the trial would be adjourned?"
1972.71-6042,75,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2437.099,2444.118,"Well, I think the adjournment procedure makes available to the defendant that is a close to the states case a period of time in which he can figure out what to do."
1972.71-6042,75,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2460.974,2463.478,If he plans to offer alibi?
1972.71-6042,75,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2463.478,2464.712,"Well, but he doesn’t have to."
1972.71-6042,75,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.62,2477.706,"I know but if he gave notice ahead of time before trial in complying with the statute, there would be any adjournment during the trial?"
1972.71-6042,75,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2477.706,2478.654,"No, there wouldn’t."
1972.71-6042,75,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2478.654,2483.294,"But if he doesn’t give notice, he doesn’t give notice and then offers."
1972.71-6042,75,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2505.813,2515.599,"I think the answer is the same, the fact that he is called a witness where in fact, I don’t think he have to do that I think it’s simply after advice the Court of this time in which t o serve notice of alibi."
1972.71-6042,75,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.4,2525.036,Nobody is going to have -- he is not just going to have to give notice.
1972.71-6042,75,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2526.668,2527.571,That’s right and --
1972.71-6042,75,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.571,2528.251,[Voice Overlap] So you as witnesses are --.
1972.71-6042,75,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2528.251,2528.308,That’s right.
1972.71-6042,75,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2528.308,2529.268,There’s always a name of it.
1972.71-6042,75,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2529.268,2530.799,That’s right.
1972.71-6042,75,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2530.799,2542.545,"Could you -- under Oregon law could he, the prosecutor, properly argue the belated disclosure of alibi?"
1972.71-6042,75,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2542.545,2543.173,To the jury?
1972.71-6042,75,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2543.173,2543.515,Yes.
1972.71-6042,75,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2543.515,2545.531,Oh!
1972.71-6042,75,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2547.273,2552.744,And do you think that would be precluded by Oregon law or by some provision of the Federal Constitution?
1972.71-6042,75,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2552.744,2556.053,"Well, I think it would be precluded by Oregon law."
1972.71-6042,75,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2565.975,2566.113,Oh!
1972.71-6042,75,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2584.071,2588.006,"Yes, I think so."
1972.71-6042,75,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2588.006,2598.123,"Would -- then I take it too that if the prosecutor got up and objected on the grounds that it was a belated tender, he’d be in the same trouble?"
1972.71-6042,75,44764,w_michael_gillette,,2598.123,2606.725,He’d be riding the same difficulty I think it might well service grounds for mistrial at that point if he did it in the presence of the jury.
1972.71-6042,75,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2675.814,2680.362,"Thank you, Mr. Gillette."
1972.71-6042,76,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,2685.867,2686.179,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,76,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.179,2687.906,Could I ask you Mr. Kuhn?
1972.71-6042,76,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,2687.906,2690.96,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,76,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2690.96,2692.691,You are representing a defendant.
1972.71-6042,76,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,2692.691,2693.209,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,76,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.209,2700.55,"You know ahead of trial that if you offer surprise alibi witness, he is going to be on adjournment."
1972.71-6042,76,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,2704.386,2706.104,"Yes, that’s correct."
1972.71-6042,76,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2706.104,2714.601,And you know that that’s going to happen if you do not comply with the statute and rather than comply for the witness unannounced.
1972.71-6042,76,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,2722.91,2730.0,I think that I would probably tell the district attorney that I was going to have an alibi.
1972.71-6042,76,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2730.0,2732.118,And why would you do that?
1972.71-6042,76,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,2738.03,2740.375,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,76,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2743.295,2746.164,"Well, I know but assume there would be, assume there would be, assume that the Court --"
1972.71-6042,76,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,2746.164,2758.265,"If there would be, although I would probably offer no more then the fact that there would be an alibi defense and not complying with the remaining terms of the statute assuming we had a statute."
1972.71-6042,76,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2758.265,2759.947,Or you wouldn’t give the names of the witness?
1972.71-6042,76,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,2759.947,2761.8,"No, Your Honor."
1972.71-6042,76,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2761.8,2766.373,But you would have to name them -- you have to call them sooner or later to their call.
1972.71-6042,76,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,2766.373,2767.245,Yes.
1972.71-6042,76,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2767.245,2772.444,"And as soon as you called them, the State would ask for them and would get an adjournment?"
1972.71-6042,76,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,2772.444,2780.191,"Yes, in that case I would see no reason not to give the names and addresses of the witnesses."
1972.71-6042,76,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.191,2781.144,Ahead of time.
1972.71-6042,76,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,2781.144,2785.068,If I could obtain an agreement to get them back.
1972.71-6042,76,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2792.244,2792.892,Thank you gentlemen.
