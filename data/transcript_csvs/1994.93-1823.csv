1994.93-1823,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.206,"We'll hear argument now in Number 93-1823, Missouri v. Jenkins."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,9.587,11.848,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1823,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.106,127.305,"Mr. Munich, there was an order entered by the district court, I take it, requiring improved student achievement?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,127.305,128.955,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1823,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.955,142.714,And I take it from the questions presented in the petition for certiorari in this case that we are not asked to review the propriety of that order?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,142.714,145.448,"What we are asking the Court to do, Justice O'Connor--"
1994.93-1823,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.448,146.698,Isn't that right?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,152.592,154.332,"--At the outset, that's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-1823,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,172.193,184.432,"You know, I thought we were here to review whether the State, as opposed to the school district, should have partial unitary status."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,196.45,198.74,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor, and we--"
1994.93-1823,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.74,207.428,Because much in your brief seemed to go quite beyond that and reach back to the validity of the order that was initially entered.
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,207.428,213.42,"--I think the posture of this case, Justice O'Connor, is very similar to what the Court confronted in Spangler."
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,261.796,269.35,Do you take the position that the measurement of student achievement is irrelevant in determining whether the goals have been met?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,269.35,271.002,"We do, Your Honor."
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,275.784,278.266,There is no question that it is irrelevant?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,278.266,281.368,"--We don't think it is relevant, Your Honor, for these reasons."
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,288.494,294.007,"Well, the Green... you... I take it you would accept the proposition that the Green factors are not exclusive?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,294.007,298.572,"--Your Honor, we think that they may not be completely exclusive."
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,299.559,302.211,"Well, that means they're not exclusive."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,302.211,303.823,"--That's correct, Your Honor--"
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,303.823,304.384,Okay.
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,304.384,310.476,"--but we do think they focus on allocation of resources and not what you get after you do that, and we think the reason--"
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,310.476,310.806,That's right.
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,330.542,332.151,"--We think for this reason, Justice Souter."
1994.93-1823,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,391.24,410.982,"Even if it happened, then, even if there were a remarkable increase in achievement level, that, too, would be irrelevant, that it doesn't matter, even if you could show a remarkable improvement, that would not qualify you in any way to be released?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,410.982,412.495,"--We think that's right, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.93-1823,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,426.202,441.993,"I'm glad that you've clarified that, that it's irrelevant either way, and I would also be helped if you could point to the precise part of the district court's order that you're challenging, because there seems to be some confusion."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,478.448,489.525,"One of the problems here, of course, Justice Ginsburg, is the fact that the district court did not directly address the State's partial unitary status in the order that it issued on June 17, 1992."
1994.93-1823,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,516.251,534.315,"But why shouldn't we take it as the law of the case that nothing in the district court's opinion so required, that what was said with regard to test scores is that there a factor in the equation?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,534.315,558.368,"Well, Your Honor, we would... it's certainly unclear, as you point out, whether it is a... whether the panel meant it is a factor or a controlling factor, but we think that the State's view is that either way it should not be considered on the question of whether unitary status is at hand, that the whole point of looking at whether unitary status is at hand is a question of whether, again, the resources within the district have been allocated properly."
1994.93-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,565.473,576.781,"You say it is not a relevant factor, and that if all other factors have been satisfied but this one hasn't, and therefore that's the sole basis why you're denied the unitary status, that's wrong?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,576.781,578.293,"We think that's wrong, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,578.293,581.085,Aren't you retreating from your answer to me a moment ago?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,596.045,599.865,"Justice Souter, let me make sure that I'm... that my answer on that is clear."
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,637.461,656.463,"Do we somehow blind ourselves to the forest for the trees, here, because the forest is the elimination of the vestiges of the prior de jure discrimination, and it seems to me that the argument you're making is that we ignore the forest for the trees, and by and large the trees are the Green trees?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,656.463,660.257,"--I don't think that would be the result, Justice Souter."
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,660.257,666.871,"Where, then, in your analysis, is there room to consider the... sort of the ultimate question of the elimination of vestiges?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,666.871,675.266,"We think that the elimination of vestiges, to the extent practical, comes about by the allocation, by... first by the allocation of equal resources, and--"
1994.93-1823,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,675.266,684.001,"Well, isn't one of the original evils of a segregated system substandard academic performance?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,684.001,691.127,"--If that has been found in a proper case, Justice Kennedy, that is correct, and that gets us to what--"
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,691.127,694.838,"And you would not challenge that finding in this case, as I understand it."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,694.838,697.843,--We're not saying that that's a clearly erroneous finding.
1994.93-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,755.169,772.529,"I assume that if you have nondiscriminatory input, teachers and textbooks and so forth, for a certain period of time, for long enough, that every student who is currently in the school system has not been subjected to lower input."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,780.085,781.456,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,781.456,789.571,And for how long has that compliance with the equal input requirement existed in this school system?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,789.571,799.158,"In this case the initial Milliken II, the compen... what the parties refer to here as the Milliken II components were implemented in the beginning of 1985, '86."
1994.93-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.158,800.308,"'85, '86?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,800.308,801.548,"That's right, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.548,811.886,"So at least at the grammar school level, through eighth grade, there's nobody in that system that hasn't had equal input?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,811.886,812.907,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-1823,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,846.999,878.348,"Mr. Munich, then you're saying that the Government was inaccurate in telling us, as they did in their brief, that in 1985 you joined... the State joined in urging the district court to order programs that would increase student level achievements at the both elementary and secondary level, so apparently in 1985 you thought that there was not the required upgrading of the system."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,878.348,891.327,"After liability was ordered... found here, Justice Ginsburg, the court ordered the parties to come forward with plans, and the court made it very clear that what it wanted was plans that would be addressed to student achievement."
1994.93-1823,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,909.039,933.075,"But there is no... I'm trying to determine the basis for your saying that everything was up to snuff in 1985, because it seems the district court didn't think so, and from what the Government represents about the State's position, even the State didn't think that in 1985 you were in full compliance."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,933.075,940.309,"--Our position is not, Justice Ginsburg, that we were... that the district was fully equalized as of 1985."
1994.93-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,951.996,970.909,"I thought in '85 the district court was not trying to equalize all of the schools in the district, but was rather trying to have a level of input, and of accomplishment, that made that district better than all the surrounding districts."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,970.909,972.769,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1994.93-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.769,985.429,"Wasn't that the purpose for the additional upgrading that you agreed to, not necessarily assume that all these schools within the district were equal, but rather, to make this district better than the ones around it so it would attract new students?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,985.429,988.381,"That's correct, Justice Scalia, and that's where we parted ways with the district court."
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1011.144,1023.854,"Yes, but your complaint is with the remedy, but your... we do not have the question before us whether that goal, whether that underlying theory to which the remedy relates, was legally erroneous or not."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1028.738,1030.79,"I... that is correct, Justice Souter, it was denied."
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1030.79,1042.039,"So the only question we come back to is, assuming that to be, as it were, the standard of the case, is it legally irrelevant that the test scores are up, down, or unchanged?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1042.039,1047.983,"Justice Souter, I would disagree with you on the question of whether that question... whether those goals are correctly before the Court or not."
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1049.144,1054.0,What's the significance of the denial of cert in '89 if they are?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1054.0,1055.62,"--I think it has no significance, Your Honor."
1994.93-1823,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1056.819,1060.462,What's the significance of your not repeating the questions you brought up then?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1099.498,1127.357,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think the difference is exactly the type of situation that occurred in Spangler, where we are not saying today... back in '88, when we did raise the issue of the scope, that was as an initial matter of whether these remedies should go forward as of this day, and the Court denied cert on that issue, but we do not think today in 1995 that the Court can properly examine the question of unitary status in this case without looking at those underlying goals."
1994.93-1823,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1171.235,1179.901,"Well, what specific decision of the court of appeals do you want us to reverse here?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1185.755,1188.977,"--There are two decisions, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-1823,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1207.71,1226.941,"Well, excuse me, because you state in your reply brief that you do not seek a declaration of partial unitary status, so please tell us, as simply as you can, precisely what it is you are saying, you are asking us to do with regard to the court of appeals decision."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1226.941,1228.273,"--First, to reverse the orders."
1994.93-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1258.593,1262.156,Why do we have to instruct the lower courts to that effect?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1297.589,1301.54,"That may suffice, Justice Scalia, but the thing that I need--"
1994.93-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1301.54,1304.472,"Unless you do that, it seems to me you're going beyond the questions presented."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1325.156,1327.908,"--That would probably do the trick, Justice Scalia, but--"
1994.93-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.908,1330.02,It's the most you'll get from me.
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1357.677,1361.53,"--We have not... my office, Your Honor, has not defended any such claims."
1994.93-1823,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.896,1375.48,What is the difference between per-student spending in this district versus per-student spending in Missouri districts as a whole?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1375.48,1383.075,"--On the general level the average State-wide is somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 per student, Justice... Chief Justice... Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-1823,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1398.705,1400.545,"As opposed to 4,000 State-wide?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1400.545,1401.487,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.93-1823,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1401.487,1404.85,"I have two questions, if I may ask you very briefly."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1412.034,1421.269,"I think, Justice Stevens, that it certainly occurred at the court of appeals level."
1994.93-1823,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1421.269,1422.601,"No, no, I said in the district court."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1422.601,1433.42,One of the... the reason I answer that way is that the district court did not tell us when the State moved for partial unitary status that that was the standard it would be holding the State to.
1994.93-1823,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1434.989,1435.41,Really?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1445.156,1446.517,--On the--
1994.93-1823,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.517,1451.451,And I'm just wondering when you told the district court for the first time that you felt it was totally irrelevant.
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1451.451,1465.571,"--On the Milliken II side, Justice Stevens, we did, when the court ordered us to, propose compensatory programs that were remedial in nature, aimed at helping students out with extraordinary educational programs."
1994.93-1823,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1474.607,1480.601,But you never asked the district court to rule squarely one way or the other as to whether or not this was a factor that it was permissible for it to consider?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1480.601,1481.64,"--That's correct, Justice Stevens."
1994.93-1823,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1482.08,1482.941,You did not ever ask--
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1482.941,1483.733,"--Again, that first surfaced in the court of appeals."
1994.93-1823,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1483.733,1487.455,"--My second question is, throughout your brief, you use the phrase, the dedicated panel."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1492.257,1494.449,It didn't occur to me until--
1994.93-1823,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1494.449,1495.19,What did you mean by that?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1495.19,1498.192,--It didn't occur to me until after we wrote that that that could be misconstrued.
1994.93-1823,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1498.192,1501.824,"It was misconstrued by me, and I thought it was a most unfortunate phrase."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1501.824,1510.53,The Eighth Circuit in the case is referred to as a dedicated panel because the same three judges sit on every appeal.
1994.93-1823,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1510.53,1514.762,Is every panel that has the same judges over and over again a dedicated panel?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1514.762,1515.433,Yes.
1994.93-1823,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1518.455,1521.598,I do actually have a... I want to go back to your initial statement.
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1540.39,1544.05,"--For a couple of reasons, Justice Breyer."
1994.93-1823,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1544.05,1546.564,Are you honestly saying you can't look to see if they can read now?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1546.564,1569.198,"We think that that is... if the question is whether the State has done what it can do, we think that it's inherently impractical to ask more than that the State put into place the programs that the experts say are the appropriate ones to monitor them, to make sure that they're funded properly, and to allow the students to proceed through their academic careers in those programs."
1994.93-1823,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1569.198,1582.886,"Well, I suppose it's always a matter of argument as to how long you keep having to dedicate the court's efforts to see that the school system is functioning properly, and in trying to answer that question, are we still okay?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1589.822,1598.177,"We don't think, Justice Breyer, that that should be the analysis that the court undertakes, for this reason."
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1625.205,1627.275,Let me ask you a related question.
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1672.256,1676.927,"We don't think that that's a proper consideration, Justice Souter, because we think that--"
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1676.927,1682.662,"I take it you accept it as a fact, then, and you're just saying it should not be a legally relevant fact?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1682.662,1689.256,"--It's possible, and the Court's opinions have certainly held that there's discrimination out there in society that... that is unfortunate--"
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1689.256,1701.975,"Well, we're not talking about discrimination in society here, we're talking about, sort of expectations about what can be achieved in school which just get passed on from parents to children, and from one group of kids to another group of kids."
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1720.628,1722.449,"--That may happen, and we think that that--"
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1722.449,1729.154,But you are saying that it's legally irrelevant and shouldn't be considered in assessing compliance with a plan like this?
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1729.154,1731.494,"--We think that's right, Justice Souter."
1994.93-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1732.633,1737.778,"Why should it be irrelevant if it's a fact, and if the object is to eliminate the vestiges, why should that be irrelevant?"
1994.93-1823,0,31729,john_r_munich,,1737.778,1743.952,"--It's one of those things, we think, Justice Souter, that is just beyond, as Swann pointed out, the capacity of the schools to deal with."
1994.93-1823,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1743.952,1746.785,"Thank you, Mr. Munich."
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,1747.593,1760.022,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1811.607,1819.851,"Do you think those vestiges include what Justice Souter was asking about, or the fact that that attitudes in one generation get passed on to another generation?"
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,1819.851,1824.143,"--Justice Scalia, I think that they do."
1994.93-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.406,1828.047,And that... those were included in the vestiges?
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,1828.047,1831.289,"--They may be included in the vestiges, but I realize--"
1994.93-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1831.289,1834.151,That the State has to prove that they are no longer there?
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,1834.151,1838.973,"--No, I... Justice Scalia, I think it depends on the findings of the district court."
1994.93-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.994,1855.885,That's the only defense?
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,1877.218,1883.843,My argument and my position is simply that Swann controls.
1994.93-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.891,1900.625,"I'd hate to have to try to prove that, either that it no longer existed, or that there was nothing that could be done about it."
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,1901.664,1904.767,"In any event, Justice Scalia, I believe that's beyond what's presented before this Court."
1994.93-1823,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1920.139,1930.725,So you don't argue here that the lingering consequences of attitude on the part of the people who were in segregated schools is a factor in this particular case?
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,1930.725,1932.906,The findings here... no.
1994.93-1823,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1955.352,1961.016,"Mr. Shaw, who has the management authority over the schools in this district?"
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,1964.048,1968.951,The school board certainly still has the management responsibilities over the district.
1994.93-1823,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1968.951,1985.941,"Are there... as a result, are there any differences in... for the district court to consider in an application for partial unitary status made by the State as opposed to the school district itself?"
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,1993.457,2010.406,"I think, Justice O'Connor, that because the State has been found guilty of the constitutional violation which precipitated the conditions in the Kansas City School District, its responsibility is to see that that... that the effects of that violation are remedied to the extent practicable."
1994.93-1823,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2025.347,2026.389,"Yes, I thought there--"
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2026.389,2026.9,But that's a factual matter.
1994.93-1823,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2026.9,2041.657,"--actually might be, that the State might be responsible more for the provision of facilities but not for the day-to-day teaching and that sort of thing that goes on, and I just wondered whether that has to be taken into account."
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2041.657,2049.754,"I think, Justice O'Connor, that no question with respect to what is practicable and what the State can accomplish has been foreclosed by the district court."
1994.93-1823,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2052.565,2075.57,"Well, except that if the lower courts here think that the State has to be maintained under its jurisdiction here until certain student test scores reach a certain level, then there may be a problem."
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2075.57,2078.502,"--Well, perhaps it's time for me to speak to that point, then."
1994.93-1823,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2078.502,2078.871,Yes.
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2078.871,2090.751,"It is not the position of the plaintiffs or the Kansas City, Missouri School District and the district court that this is an outcome-based measure."
1994.93-1823,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2129.777,2135.039,But you agree that no particular level of achievement could be the sole determining factor?
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2135.039,2137.851,I agree that... that's right.
1994.93-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.175,2162.528,"Mr. Shaw, as I understand the law, a State can have different districts that have a different level of educational input, and districts that have a different level of achievement, so long as there's not discrimination within each of those districts between majority and minority students."
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2189.644,2200.632,"Justice Scalia, the district court made a finding that there has been a system-wide reduction in academic achievement in consequence of the constitutional violation... that is, the segregation."
1994.93-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2216.471,2224.568,"But that would be an interdistrict violation, and I thought there had been no finding of an interdistrict... in fact, a finding that there was no interdistrict violation."
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2245.861,2247.794,--Let me... let me answer that question--
1994.93-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2247.794,2257.26,"--Now, I do see how it's relevant what the test score of the whole district is if you're trying to attract students from other districts, but that's an interdistrict problem and an interdistrict remedy."
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2260.059,2263.033,--Let me answer that question in two ways.
1994.93-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2353.982,2361.757,"I understand that explanation, but I don't see why it isn't an explanation that rests on a presumption of an interdistrict violation."
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2361.757,2383.311,"--Let me, then, address the second part, which I think may... I hope it will answer that question, Justice Scalia, and that's that the interdistrict violation was not found by the district court, but however, there are findings that white students left the system and went to public schools."
1994.93-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2439.098,2450.895,Has the district court made any determinations or given any guidance as to when it is feasible or practical... practicable to end its supervision?
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2450.895,2462.012,"That question, Justice Kennedy, the court began to take up in the April 16, 1993 order, which the Eighth Circuit relied upon."
1994.93-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2484.716,2488.039,"Well, it must think about that under Freeman and Pitts, must it not--"
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2488.039,2488.519,--That's right.
1994.93-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2488.519,2495.265,"--that the principal objective of the court must be to return control of this district to the civic authorities, not the judicial authorities?"
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2495.265,2496.504,That's correct.
1994.93-1823,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2504.55,2516.478,"Mr. Shaw, could you be more specific about what those plans that were called for were, because they seemed to in years go from 3 years to 10 years."
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2527.316,2542.995,I think that the court was attempting to get before it an array of alternative plans under which it could consider what the best transition was going to be.
1994.93-1823,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2592.448,2593.129,Would you--
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2612.541,2620.127,"Justice Rehnquist, that is exactly the kind of concern that I think the district court contemplated addressing in asking for these plans."
1994.93-1823,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2620.127,2622.667,"Well, what sort of plan would solve that problem?"
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2622.667,2648.264,"Well, I think in part the answer is that if the plan as it is working now continues to succeed in attracting white patients back into the district, that would undercut the stigma that has been attached to the school district in which whites were not enrolled and as a consequence they wouldn't fund the district, and it may be possible to get on a better footing with respect to local funding for the school system."
1994.93-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2665.926,2681.106,"But it seems to me that what's happening here is that the greater the intrusion into the local domain, the easier it is for the court to justify its continued supervision, and I should think the calculus ought to be just the other way around."
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2694.105,2695.115,"--Oh, well, it--"
1994.93-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2695.115,2705.532,"--And I fear, based on your answer to the Chief Justice's question, that the only way for you to continue this funding is to continue the judicial supervision--"
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2705.532,2706.641,--Justice Kennedy--
1994.93-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2706.641,2708.324,--which is contrary to Freeman and Pitts.
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2708.324,2723.054,"--I have no doubt that there will be an end to this remedy, and certainly this Court's teachings make it clear to all of the parties that the Court will not countenance perpetual jurisdiction."
1994.93-1823,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2762.948,2771.394,"Mr. Shaw, do you support even the district court's order increasing salaries of noninstructional employees--"
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2771.394,2772.926,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1994.93-1823,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2772.926,2774.676,--as within he scope of the remedy?
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2774.676,2781.041,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, although it is certainly a question of discretion, and I understand the concerns of the Court."
1994.93-1823,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2781.041,2784.763,I just wonder whether it might not be an abuse of discretion to go that far.
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2788.516,2790.717,"No, Justice O'Connor, but--"
1994.93-1823,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2790.717,2792.517,I'm just quite amazed.
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2792.517,2803.604,"--it does have something to do with the day-to-day operations of the district, and the day-to-day operations of the district with respect to its ability to carry out the desegregation plan."
1994.93-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2828.892,2840.339,What is there in this record that shows the inability of the school district to make its own determinations as to how to allocate its existing revenues for salaries?
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2840.339,2841.511,Justice Kennedy--
1994.93-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2841.511,2843.612,Why does it need supervision for that?
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2843.612,2858.702,"--As you phrase the question, I believe, that is to say, as I understand your question, it's what is that says that the court must be involved in the school district's decisions as to how to allocate salary--"
1994.93-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2858.702,2859.862,Yes.
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2859.862,2860.703,--a budget for salary?
1994.93-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2893.675,2896.797,Why are funds limited as a result of the violation?
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2896.797,2898.276,Because--
1994.93-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2898.276,2899.378,Because they've all been spent?
1994.93-1823,1,43348,theodore_m_shaw,,2899.378,2922.052,"--Because the State has insisted, understandably, that the school district fund its share of the remedy, and it has not always been able to do that, so the court has applied principles of joint and several liability, but the fact is that there's just been limited ability of the school district at this point to fund the remedy."
1994.93-1823,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2922.052,2924.205,"Thank you, Mr. Shaw."
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,2924.726,2935.432,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1823,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2991.748,2994.781,"Hypothetically the students should now be, what, high school seniors?"
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,2994.781,2996.701,--They could be in tenth grade.
1994.93-1823,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3025.412,3026.08,In a different school.
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3033.026,3034.325,"I don't think that they do, right."
1994.93-1823,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3059.484,3074.192,"Is all of this funding just directed at those upper grades so that it sort of follows this hypothetical student from the fifth grade, where she was when the disparities were eliminated, up to the sixth grade?"
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3076.964,3077.895,Right.
1994.93-1823,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3077.895,3081.198,--including those people who have never been under a segregated--
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3081.198,3101.992,"I believe that that's true, and certainly the State can bring before the district court an effort, a claim to have some or all of those remedies reduced or eliminated in some of the lower grades, but there's a procedure that this Court has set out in which the State should do that, and the State has not followed that procedure in this case."
1994.93-1823,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3120.922,3122.124,--How does it make that showing?
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3122.124,3124.856,There are lots of different ways to make that showing.
1994.93-1823,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3181.852,3202.227,"That sounds to me like a fascinating sociological inquiry, but I submit that it is highly questionable as to whether or not it is a practicable measure for the court to use to determine how quickly it can return the control of this district to the elected and democratically responsible authorities."
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3202.227,3206.338,"It seems to me that it could be quite practical, Justice Kennedy."
1994.93-1823,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3228.304,3229.713,Is that the comparison that was made?
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3232.344,3235.108,"You mean originally, when the district court--"
1994.93-1823,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3235.108,3235.697,Right.
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3238.409,3242.392,--I think the district court compared originally in 1985--
1994.93-1823,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3242.392,3248.386,"Below national norms, is what the district court... below national norms at many grade levels."
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3251.17,3253.661,--National norms would not be... right.
1994.93-1823,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3273.203,3277.957,But jurisdiction does not remain until the results of segregation are gone.
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3284.76,3295.758,"--Well, one way you could show that, for example, is after the remedies were started you would look at test scores, or other indicia like attendance rates, for the next 2 years, and see what happened to them."
1994.93-1823,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3332.562,3337.114,Don't you think the amount of money spent is one element of practicability?
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3337.114,3337.915,Absolutely.
1994.93-1823,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3337.915,3339.838,At 1.3 billion here already.
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3339.838,3348.153,"A lot of that was spent on capital improvements which are not repetitive expenses, but I agree with you completely that the level of expenditure necessary is relevant."
1994.93-1823,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3348.153,3353.696,And what about the length of time that you withhold this school district from democratic control--
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3353.696,3354.966,Also relevant.
1994.93-1823,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3354.966,3355.877,--when it's managed by a Federal district judge?
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3355.877,3370.146,"All of those things are relevant, but those things are exactly what the district court should be asked to consider, and those are the issues on which the State has the burden of proof in showing that it has done whatever it is practicable to do."
1994.93-1823,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3374.26,3381.356,"Well, don't you think those things were before the district court, the amount of money that had been spent and the length of time?"
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3384.575,3385.036,No.
1994.93-1823,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3404.54,3405.562,--So you say it must present--
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3405.562,3406.431,That's where the thing starts.
1994.93-1823,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3406.431,3412.985,--You say it must present this evidence in order to resist an order requiring it to increase teacher salaries?
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3415.036,3421.0,"We... the Government has not taken a position on the teacher salary issue, which does not have national importance."
1994.93-1823,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3449.59,3462.426,"But on the salary issue it seemed like it was just a very convenient way for the school district and the labor union to get what they wanted without going through collective bargaining, and there are some very unattractive features--"
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3462.426,3463.148,I agree--
1994.93-1823,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3463.148,3474.585,"--to what the district court did here, and the State is just left holding the bag because the school district and the labor union make a deal with the court that the court's going to set the salaries."
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3474.585,3475.646,"--But I think, Justice--"
1994.93-1823,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3475.646,3476.718,It can't be relevant.
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3476.718,3492.067,"--O'Connor, it's very important for this Court to make clear that you have to follow an orderly procedure in withdrawing from those remedies, that you don't do that by making factual assertions in an appellate court or in the Supreme Court that you... you don't do that by making assertions that you don't back up with proof."
1994.93-1823,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3503.046,3504.247,"Thank you, Mr. Bender."
1994.93-1823,2,37685,paul_bender,,3504.247,3504.978,Thank you.
1994.93-1823,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3504.978,3506.728,The case is submitted.
