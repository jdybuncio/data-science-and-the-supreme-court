2015.14-1209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.655,"We'll hear argument next in Case 14-1209, Sturgeon v. Frost. Mr. Findley."
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,6.655,39.575,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: ANILCA was the result of a grand bargain. Congress enacted ANILCA to finally resolve land ownership in Alaska, a process that began with the Statehood Act and continued with the Native Claims Settlement Act, both statutes that granted land to the State and native corporations to further economic development and self-sufficiency for Alaska and its people. ANILCA very carefully balanced conservation with those important goals."
2015.14-1209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,39.575,40.53,Mr. -- Mr.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,60.11,65.9,"If a navigable river is surrounded by the outer boundaries of the park, yes, that's covered by Section 103(c)."
2015.14-1209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,65.9,83.29,"And is there any information in the record about whether your client actually was running his boat on the portions which were -- are within the federally owned parts, or instead it's the inholdings? Is that what you called them?"
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,83.29,84.26,That is one word for it.
2015.14-1209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,84.26,84.35,Yes.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,84.35,86.17,He was within the shore.
2015.14-1209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,89.725,90.595,Was Federal --
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,90.595,91.075,Yes.
2015.14-1209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,91.075,92.26,Was Federal public land?
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,92.26,92.66,"Yes, exactly."
2015.14-1209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,92.66,92.79,Okay.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,93.315,94.365,"Oh, sure."
2015.14-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,94.365,96.595,"Just, again, a preliminary question."
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,96.595,96.945,Sure.
2015.14-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,96.945,102.07,Is it conceded by all or is it not that this is navigable -- that these are navigable waters?
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,102.07,102.46,Yes.
2015.14-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,109.18,110.57,And that's not contested here?
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,110.57,111.69,"No, it is not contested here."
2015.14-1209,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,111.69,120.14,So you're claiming a right not merely to use the hovercraft in the nonpublic lands.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,128.18,141.25,What Mr. Sturgeon is arguing -- we've been very specific about that -- is that the Park Service does not have authority to issue its Park Management Regulations to cover State navigable waters that run through the ANILCA parks.
2015.14-1209,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,141.25,156.665,"So what do you do about the ANILCA provision that says that boating and other water activities within public lands, within Federal public lands can be regulated?"
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,156.665,157.09,Yes.
2015.14-1209,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,163.42,168.08,That's not what it says. It says any waters in the jurisdiction of the United States.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,168.08,170.445,It doesn't say navigable waters.
2015.14-1209,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,171.3,173.4,"Well, it could apply to both, is what I'm saying."
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,176.35,186.3,"You turn back to the definition of public lands in the statute, which makes clear for anything to be public lands, the United States must hold title. And there really is no dispute."
2015.14-1209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,201.635,210.64,"I wasn't sure, but I -- I thought maybe they were suggesting that the navigational servitude and its reserved rights were -- were title."
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,210.64,214.75,They are not title interests. They are both nonpossessory use rights.
2015.14-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,231.84,249.56,"So it -- it -- it may well be, you think, that the Federal government would have authority to do this in the exercise of its navigational servitude even though it doesn't have authority to do it, as you assert, under the Park Service?"
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,249.56,255.04,Our objection is to the Park Service asserting its regulation on these navigable waters.
2015.14-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,260.17,260.26,Okay.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,267.645,270.125,You don't have to resolve that further question.
2015.14-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,308.61,314.81,Suppose you have a regulation or a statute that's applicable to all United States parks.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,316.705,319.7,If it's a regulation that the Park Service --
2015.14-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,319.7,323.445,"No, let's say -- let's say first it's a statute, suppose a Federal statute."
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,330.255,334.98,You have to look at whether this is a regulation that was solely enacted to manage park land.
2015.14-1209,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,377.765,382.78,What was the basis for Ninth Circuit's decision? Was it limited to navigable waters?
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,382.78,386.11,The Ninth Circuit did not reach unnavigable waters issues at all.
2015.14-1209,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,386.11,387.575,What was the basis for the decision?
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,387.575,397.61,"The Ninth Circuit took a very strained, improper reading of the statute and looked at Section 103(c) and said, well, it only applies to Alaska-specific regulations."
2015.14-1209,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,441.039,456.195,Your reading on a practical basis with respect to the navigable waters makes almost no sense to me. I'm looking at a map attached to the petition of the State of Alaska.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,487.91,492.87,We're not claiming that Section 103(c) trumps the navigable -- navigational servitude.
2015.14-1209,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,502.3,510.48,So you're saying that the U.S. can't control the navigable servitude in any part of that coast.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,510.48,510.74,No.
2015.14-1209,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,512.34,512.61,Can.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,512.61,515.14,The Park Service hasn't been delegated that authority.
2015.14-1209,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,518.62,539.07,"And so what do you take the words in -- in 103(c) to mean, the boating exception, when it says ""in the jurisdiction of the United States""? ""Waters in the jurisdiction""? You don't think navigable waters are within the jurisdiction of the United States in Federal lands?"
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,539.07,558.535,"That's within the regulation that the Park Service promulgated nationwide, saying we're going in -- the hovercraft is one of many regulations that they assert to apply within the jurisdiction of the Park Service. Section 103(c), which is the -- which is the specific park-enabling statute, denied the Park Service jurisdiction over nonpublic land which includes these navigable waters."
2015.14-1209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,558.535,576.82,"So if the -- as it often does elsewhere, if the Army Corps of Engineers have issues with respect to things that the State is doing on the navigable waters or, you know, other people are building a -- a -- a damn or a fish -- I forget what they are called -- the Corps of Engineers can come in and say, you can't do that."
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,576.82,577.59,Exactly.
2015.14-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.07,591.59,"Let's -- and EPA might -- might be able to prohibit boating, no?"
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,591.59,592.69,Whether the EPA --
2015.14-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,592.69,593.35,Or environmental --
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,593.35,596.3,"-- can prohibit boating, that may be an extension of their authority."
2015.14-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,610.24,613.799,But it says in the regulation -- look at the regulation.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,642.825,645.15,It is within the outer boundaries of the park.
2015.14-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,647.0,668.56,"Well, now, you look at what they say about that, and you get, when they're defining the Yukon-Charley River's National Preserve, it says that that national preserve -- which is the whole thing, which includes the section of the river that we're talking about -- contains public lands."
2015.14-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,688.68,690.36,What are -- what are you quoting from? I'm --
2015.14-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,690.36,700.13,"I'm quoting from regulations which are 54 U.S.C. -- I don't know. I'll -- I'll have to show you later, because I'm quoting -- (Laughter.)"
2015.14-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,700.13,707.23,"We're going to get into numbers, and I -- I just thought this case is too complicated to ask anything, but you've tempted me. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,707.23,711.1,And so -- so you see -- have you got in your mind what I just quoted?
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,711.1,711.37,Yes.
2015.14-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,711.37,724.83,"And then once you have that, you have this regulation applying to this portion of the river. So now we look to the statute to see if anything there takes away what the regulations seem to give."
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,780.845,781.86,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,785.74,786.11,Yes.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,786.11,789.33,And -- and this is a dispute that's why -- it's what has brought us here together today.
2015.14-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,789.33,789.895,Uh-huh.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,789.895,796.44,"But prior to 1996, the Park Service did not apply this regulation to navigable waters."
2015.14-1209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,811.23,811.96,"Well, Mr. Findley, I mean --"
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,811.96,812.38,-- you can't do that.
2015.14-1209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,812.38,815.97,"-- whether or not that's true, agencies can change their mind about things."
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,839.7,844.195,Because the regulation never should have been allowed to reach out to the public land.
2015.14-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,866.57,871.71,"I -- I don't understand why the statute that Justice Breyer is focusing on, that part of the statute."
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,886.1,890.545,Because that would not be a regulation solely enacted to manage park land.
2015.14-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,894.01,900.215,But it -- it -- it -- but it -- it talks about regulations applicable solely to public lands.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,912.215,933.52,"Forest Service regulations are also solely enacted to manage those public lands. To answer your question, if you take the word ""solely"" out of the statute, you've inadvertently created a statute which says none of these private lands within the ANILCA parks are subject to any regulations applicable to public lands. Now surely, Congress is not trying to exempt these lands from Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act --"
2015.14-1209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,933.52,933.74,Maybe --
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,933.74,935.7,"That's what the word ""solely"" is there to do."
2015.14-1209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,935.7,938.11,I guess maybe -- maybe you can explain that to me.
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,967.475,968.105,Right.
2015.14-1209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,983.34,991.71,"So you're saying that the word ""solely"" distinguishes between statutes like the Clean Air Act and park land statutes?"
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,991.71,992.32,Yes.
2015.14-1209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,994.34,1002.04,"Because I understand why Congress might have wanted to distinguish between, like, the Clean Air Act and park statutes."
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,1009.33,1012.47,"It may not have been the perfect way for Congress to go about and do it, but that's --"
2015.14-1209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1012.47,1014.27,"Well, tell me the imperfect way."
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,1014.27,1016.065,"Well, ""solely."" (Laughter.)"
2015.14-1209,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1016.065,1016.3,"Well, no."
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,1035.45,1073.23,"Read that sentence in context with both the first sentence of Section 103(c) and the third sentence, and then read it in context with the purpose of the statute. The first sentence says these lands are not part of the park. The second sentence is doing its best to make clear these lands won't be regulated as though they were. And the third sentence makes clear that if the Federal government -- or the Park Service, excuse me -- wants to regulate these lands, wants them to be part of the park, they have to go out and acquire them. There wouldn't be any purpose for that third sentence if the Federal government -- or, excuse me -- the Park Service already had authority of those nonpublic lands. And if you take a step back and you look at the overall purpose of the statute -- and again 101(d) of the statute makes clear that this is a balancing statute."
2015.14-1209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1092.65,1093.72,"Thank you, counsel."
2015.14-1209,0,62648,matthew_t_findley,,1093.72,1097.635,Thank you.
2015.14-1209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1097.635,1109.17,Miss Botstein.
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1109.17,1129.375,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about honoring Congress's mandate to protect Alaska's sovereignty in the face of the Park Service's rapidly-expanding interpretation of its own jurisdiction under ANILCA. Congress provided in ANILCA that Alaska would lose over 100 million acres of land."
2015.14-1209,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1219.46,1227.6,"By ""inholdings,"" you include the submerged lands that were conveyed to the State upon statehood?"
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1227.6,1228.59,"We do, Your Honor."
2015.14-1209,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1231.26,1231.75,Right.
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1245.299,1257.105,I understand the Park Service's argument to be that the -- the submerged -- the waters and the submerged lands have somehow become public lands.
2015.14-1209,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1277.59,1287.095,"What does that do to Federal right to control, whether it's titled or not, all navigable waters?"
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1287.095,1292.955,"Congress possesses a right to control the navigational servitude, and that's not an issue here."
2015.14-1209,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1309.14,1310.03,Repeat what you said.
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1313.245,1320.77,"Your Honor, Congress has the power to control navigation in these waters through exercise of the navigational servitude."
2015.14-1209,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1331.53,1338.395,"Well, suppose there were a Coast Guard regulation that -- applicable to all throughout the United States."
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1340.155,1340.965,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-1209,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1342.71,1354.26,"Well, why is the -- so you're -- you're just saying that the Park Service lacks authority to promulgate this regulation quite without regard to this statute, which doesn't help me very much."
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1354.26,1355.1,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-1209,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1362.87,1364.54,So you're not -- I'm sorry.
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1373.115,1378.77,The Coast Guard could enact regulations to regulate navigation in the water.
2015.14-1209,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1381.87,1392.51,"How about if they wanted to say, in this alcove, the Coast Guard, not the Park Service, says you can't have hovercrafts, that would be okay?"
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1392.51,1393.19,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-1209,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1394.89,1413.595,"If I understand what you're saying, you're saying with respect to a river that's smack in the middle of federally owned lands, okay, a river that's in the middle of federally owned lands, what cannot happen is that the EPA can't come in and say there's some terrible pollution in this river, and we need to address it."
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1415.505,1416.43,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-1209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1439.63,1440.47,Why? I mean --
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1440.47,1443.16,The EPA is separate.
2015.14-1209,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1443.16,1445.35,The Coast Guard can do it. The EPA can do.
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1448.855,1458.935,Or another Land Management agency that is regulating -- is attempting to regulate the lands and waters that are not part of the park as though they were part of the park.
2015.14-1209,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1471.23,1485.705,"And I guess part of my question about this is, I look at that map, you know, and that map of this area has all this green land, which green represents real Federal park land, and there's a river that runs through it."
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1524.795,1533.92,"The rivers are an important part of the park, but the control over the rivers is Alaska's, is Alaska's by sovereign right."
2015.14-1209,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1542.24,1544.52,But that's not true as to navigable waters.
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1547.23,1549.805,"It can, but it has not done so in this case."
2015.14-1209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1636.4,1649.3,"As I read it -- as I read it, it's complicated, but in a sense it's simple. Yosemite has some private land within it and a lot of public."
2015.14-1209,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1719.31,1722.05,The -- the rest of us are interested in your answer to Justice Breyer.
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1722.05,1729.75,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I don't actually think it's all that complicated, Your Honor."
2015.14-1209,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1759.95,1760.94,"Thank you, counsel."
2015.14-1209,1,62649,ruth_botstein,,1760.94,1765.199,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2015.14-1209,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1765.199,1769.435,Ms. Kovner.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1769.435,1791.155,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress created new park units in Alaska for the express purpose of protecting their waters, their free-flowing rivers and their fish, it didn't simultaneously strip the Park Service of preexisting authorities to achieve those goals by regulating navigable waters."
2015.14-1209,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1799.11,1837.01,"Well, before you get to that, could we begin with what the Ninth Circuit decided? You're entitled to defend the judgment on any ground that you like, but -- that was presented below, but the only issue we have to -- we have to reach is the correctness of the Ninth Circuit's decision. Now, I understand what the Ninth Circuit to have held, to be this, that the hovercraft rule is not barred by the second sentence of Section 103(c) of ANILCA, because the hovercraft rule does not apply only in Alaska, because it applies throughout the country. Is that -- that's a correct understanding of what they held?"
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1837.01,1838.99,I actually think they were saying two things.
2015.14-1209,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1874.09,1874.42,"Well, no."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1907.025,1913.42,"We think we have two much stronger arguments than that, and we focused on those. And if I could go to the --"
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1913.42,1914.465,It's wrong.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1935.895,1938.91,We think public lands are slightly more expansive than that.
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1939.55,1940.72,How? Read the statute --
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1940.72,1940.81,Sure.
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1940.81,1942.12,-- and -- and -- and tell me how --
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1942.12,1942.21,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1942.21,1943.25,-- in the statute --
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1943.25,1943.805,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1943.805,1946.0,-- you can read it more broadly.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1946.0,1946.35,Sure.
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1947.12,1948.63,I'm going -- I'm in the definition section.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1948.63,1948.82,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1981.87,1984.95,"Well, in other words, the interests aren't the title."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,1996.21,1998.32,We agree the U.S. has to hold title to the interest.
2015.14-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1999.34,2000.6,It has to hold title to the interest.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2000.6,2001.05,"That's right, Your Honor."
2015.14-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2001.05,2006.82,"Well, that's where I kind of stumbled in your argument, because you're not claiming title to the submerged land."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2008.23,2008.5,That's right.
2015.14-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2008.5,2019.005,"-- right? You're -- you -- you rely on the reserved water right. Is that ever expressed as ""title,"" as opposed to a -- the words -- ""usufructuary right""?"
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2019.005,2023.6,"Usufructuary right is a property interest, so it is something you can hold title to."
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2025.95,2029.5,"Yes, but holding title to that is different from holding title to the water."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2029.5,2030.65,That's right.
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2030.65,2034.88,"And you're -- you're telling us that the river, that the government holds title to the river."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2038.445,2039.45,No.
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.655,2048.99,That's different from holding title to the water.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2048.99,2049.52,I agree.
2015.14-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2069.59,2082.945,"Well, it's just a -- I'm sorry to pause -- pause there. I understood with reserve water doctrine is usually, you know, we need water to do this, so we get -- we have a reserve right to 40 percent of the water, or the initial flow, or whatever."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2087.08,2091.46,"So I think that move is made by ANILCA, the statute."
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2103.82,2127.73,"I'm with you so far. That gets you to regulating the waters in Federal -- in -- in -- in Federal units, because the U.S. under ANILCA only controls lands within the conservation units that are public lands."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2127.73,2128.2,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2128.2,2129.645,In the United States.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2129.645,2130.27,Right.
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2138.45,2150.265,"So -- and does the no-hovercraft rule apply to the nonpublic lands? Is that the position you're taking, that you have the right to regulate that as well?"
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2150.265,2150.89,No.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.885,2159.46,Then -- then -- then I'm completely wrong.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2166.82,2167.31,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2167.31,2176.065,"-- that the hovercraft rule was like a rule that applies to all of Yosemite, say a campfire rule that applies even to John Jones's house."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2176.065,2178.39,So it's written to apply in two places.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2178.39,2180.15,"I mean, it could be the navigable waters."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2184.255,2185.285,No.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2192.37,2194.39,I thought the navigable waters are not.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2202.95,2203.32,That's right.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2204.03,2206.52,Is that right? Because you just seemed to say the opposite a minute ago.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2206.52,2206.94,No.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.13,2223.41,"Now, navigable waters that are within the boundaries of the National Park Service."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2223.41,2223.63,That's right.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2223.94,2226.805,That's like John Jones's house in Yosemite.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2226.805,2227.195,That's right.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2227.195,2235.13,"The fireplace reg applies to him, even though his is a private house, because it's within the boundary of Yosemite."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2235.13,2235.66,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.66,2236.645,Am I right or not?
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2236.645,2242.205,"Well, I think the -- the difficulty is, Your Honor, we think that the navigable waters are not like John Jones's house."
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2244.86,2246.595,"Either way, you say you win."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2266.62,2267.275,That is right.
2015.14-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2270.13,2276.425,"Well, but if that's right, I mean, it -- it -- it's right because the question is do these things apply solely to public lands."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2285.98,2287.02,I -- I think it is.
2015.14-1209,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2300.46,2336.96,"Well, you -- you want to talk about waters, and -- and after this question I won't say anything more on this, but is the Ninth Circuit's holding limited to waters? The -- the State of Alaska on page 20 and 21 of their brief cite a notice in the Federal Register by the Park Service in which they defend the regulation of nonfederal oil and gas activities on the basis of Sturgeon, on the ground that Section 103(c) of ANILCA applies only to Alaska-specific regulations."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2345.87,2346.31,That's right.
2015.14-1209,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2360.58,2362.495,It's solely to apply to Alaska --
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2362.495,2363.22,That's the whole --
2015.14-1209,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2363.22,2364.535,-- within such unit?
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2364.535,2365.56,We just --
2015.14-1209,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2365.56,2368.57,Solely to apply to nonpublic units to lands in Alaska.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2368.57,2384.895,"That -- if that's how Your Honor understands the Ninth Circuit's ruling. The regulation, the 20-year regulation I'm alluding to, says if it's a rule that applies to both public and private lands, then it's not covered by this provision. And just to be clear, we have very limited authority to regulate private lands."
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2390.06,2391.46,Let's -- let's talk about your authority.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2466.485,2472.325,So if I could walk through that authority that Your Honor is discussing and show why it allows us to enact the regulation here.
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2486.73,2491.89,Why? You're -- you're conceding that the waters are outside of that?
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2491.89,2497.145,"I'm conceding -- well, we haven't -- our first argument, Your Honor, is that no, these are public lands."
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2534.51,2539.825,"I read that first sentence. It's very interesting, because the tone of voice is the only way I can deal with this case."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2576.045,2577.25,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2577.68,2580.48,Is that what it -- I thought it must mean something like that.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2591.445,2592.425,So I think the --
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2592.425,2594.09,Do you see what I -- are you following it?
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2594.09,2596.485,I think -- I think I am following.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2604.09,2613.57,If it makes clear -- if it makes clear that private lands like Joe Jones' house are a part of the unit?
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2613.57,2616.71,"I think they're within the boundaries of the unit, not part of the unit."
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2616.71,2617.31,Within the boundaries of it.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2621.46,2625.98,"Just -- so this -- this authority, indeed, has always been -- yes."
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2625.98,2628.1,You say this grant of authority in (b)
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2630.02,2630.2,No.
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.2,2631.01,-- right from the statute.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2631.01,2631.38,No.
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2631.38,2632.34,What are you quoting from?
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2632.34,2635.645,"From -- so on 7a of our appendix, it's a statute."
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2647.91,2654.505,Can you tell me whether that statute violates this statute?
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2654.505,2660.65,I think that's -- I think it's whether this provision prohibits the Park Service from exercising that authority or whether --
2015.14-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2660.65,2661.065,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2661.705,2661.95,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.52,2680.71,7a? You're saying it's on page 7a?
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2680.71,2681.53,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2681.53,2686.85,That's 54 U.S.C. 107 -- 100751.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2688.22,2688.415,No.
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.53,2700.2,"It's not the numbering. It's -- it says regulations -- oh, I see. (Laughter.)"
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2700.2,2701.57,It's about the authority to enact --
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.57,2703.77,The statute is addressing regulations.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2703.77,2703.89,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2703.89,2705.315,That's the subtitle in the statute.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2705.315,2705.42,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2765.68,2801.02,"And if I'm looking at the right section, I mean, I would have thought that that was key to your argument, because it says in these management plans what you need is a -- is a ""description of privately owned areas which are within such unit."" So it's clearly contemplating that there are these private areas that are within the unit. And then as you say, it goes on and says we want in these plans some idea of what regulations are going to be applying on those private lands within the unit."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2801.02,2801.98,"That's right, Your Honor."
2015.14-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2873.61,2888.585,"What does -- you -- on page 24, and I think you have mentioned this several times, so -- you talk about this isn't a problem because your authority is circumscribed and you have the inholdings are -- have substantial protections against Park Service regulation."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2890.15,2890.55,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2899.68,2911.625,"Do you -- do you think the statute that authorizes you to regulate is the one that says ""the Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as the Secretary considers necessary or proper""? Would you --"
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2911.625,2914.475,"We're principally relying on the one right below that, (b)."
2015.14-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2914.475,2920.25,"Well, but do you rely on that one? Because if you rely on that one, I don't see that it provides any protections at all."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2920.25,2925.555,So let me tell you how -- how that first one interpreted and why it does provide protections.
2015.14-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2946.32,2954.405,"So danger -- danger or harm, is that what it's limited to? Or could it be limited to scenic, environmental, noise impacts?"
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2954.405,2960.25,We think it's clear that the Park Service can't simply treat inholdings as though they were public lands.
2015.14-1209,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2971.495,2978.515,But is that true even if it's a -- the regulation is nation -- applicable nationwide?
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2978.515,2985.41,"We think that nationwide, yes, the Park Service's authority to regulate inholdings is quite limited."
2015.14-1209,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2985.41,2997.355,"So -- so if -- because if that's true, then I don't know what -- then you disagree with the Ninth Circuit on the meaning that it gave -- gives to the ""solely"" phrase?"
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2997.355,3009.975,"I think that we think -- and we've said for 20 years in a regulation that's entitled the Chevron difference that what the ""solely"" phrase does is it carves out the rules that are applicable solely to public lands."
2015.14-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3018.22,3032.48,"No, but your authority is not limited if you get Chevron deference. If you get Chevron deference on determining what you think is necessary or proper, the idea that that's a substantial circumscription of your authority doesn't seem to me to be a valid one."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3032.48,3033.31,I don't think so.
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3054.23,3066.83,More broadly? Interpret necessary or proper -- necessary or proper to mean necessary or proper? You think it's beyond belief that you're going to do that?
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3066.83,3067.81,I -- I do.
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3072.46,3086.38,"Some might argue that your proposed regulations on oil contravene the intent of this provision. So assuming we do, how do you deal with that? Assuming some people do."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3087.5,3088.105,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3109.6,3110.16,What --
2015.14-1209,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3110.16,3140.26,"What can you do about why this provision that you -- you reproduce on 7a gets around the first section of 103(c)? This -- that provision allows regulation of waters within Service units, but the first section, as I read it, says that nonpublic land within the boundaries of -- of a CSU is not part of the CSU."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3140.26,3140.71,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3176.94,3181.34,"100751 is a general statute; it applies everywhere, right?"
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3181.34,3181.77,Yeah.
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3181.77,3187.38,"And -- and Section 3101, Section 103 is specific to Alaska, isn't it?"
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3187.38,3187.775,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3187.775,3190.91,Isn't there a general rule that the specific governs the general?
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3190.91,3191.44,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.97,3197.23,So this general provision is limited by what Congress has said about Alaska.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3206.115,3206.65,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3206.65,3214.795,"And if you read that back into 100751, it seems to me the Park Service doesn't have jurisdiction."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3214.795,3215.52,No.
2015.14-1209,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3243.95,3244.01,Go --
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3244.01,3259.68,"The regulation itself says, it says water -- ""Hovercraft regulation applies to, quote, 'waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States within the boundaries of the National Park Service.'"""
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3259.68,3260.135,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3260.135,3267.13,And then the National Park Service somewhere has a definition that equates it with the unit.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3289.81,3290.175,That's --
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3290.175,3296.53,-- and then the Hovercraft Regulation applies only to the unit.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3296.53,3298.26,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3298.26,3299.87,And that's -- that -- isn't that the point? Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3300.19,3300.27,No --
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3300.27,3300.65,-- the point.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3300.65,3301.19,"No, your Honor."
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3301.19,3302.36,What's the response to that?
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3302.36,3306.45,So I think Your Honor's suggesting that the regulations themselves say they don't apply --
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3306.45,3306.56,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3306.56,3307.35,-- unless it's part of a unit.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3307.35,3307.69,Exactly.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3307.69,3316.05,And I think that's not correct. There's this distinction between what's within the boundaries of the park and what is park lands.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3324.98,3325.36,Ah.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3325.36,3326.1,-- versus being within the park.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3326.1,3334.79,"So you're saying it applies within -- it is within the boundaries of the unit, although the unit consists of just the public land."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3336.37,3343.32,"And to be clear, there's never been any -- to be clear, there's never been any dispute that the regulations are written to apply to these lands."
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3348.87,3351.23,"Well, the specific would overcome the general."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3358.2,3358.54,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3383.06,3386.74,Let's say that part of a river is within a CSU.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3400.96,3407.01,The Park Service has -- has consistently understood its authority to be regulating the park's -- within the park's boundaries.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3416.16,3433.11,"Are you satisfied with this holding -- imaginary -- but the Ninth Circuit's wrong. Two, the second sentence does not bar this regulation. Three, there are other possible arguments; we send it back for reconsideration as to whether those arguments are good or bad."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3433.11,3435.97,I'm -- I'm not sure I understand the second sentence of the whole -- so --
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3435.97,3442.69,"They -- they -- we're saying that the second sentence, which is what they're talking about primarily in the briefs, the second sentence of (c) --"
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3442.69,3442.995,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3442.995,3446.43,"-- ""no lands which,"" et cetera, you're right about that."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3446.43,3446.775,Right.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3446.775,3448.44,You're right about -- I mean I imagine --
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3448.44,3448.65,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3448.65,3454.8,"Then as to this first sentence, which I -- I don't think I focused on, particularly, we say go back and argue that."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3454.8,3462.305,"Your Honor, this case could be sent back to address both that and to address the question of what is public lands, which is a question that wasn't addressed below."
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3482.35,3482.56,No.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3491.59,3491.945,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3491.945,3499.24,What do you think the Ninth Circuit meant? And do you agree with its interpretation? As he pointed out --
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3499.24,3499.33,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3499.33,3503.535,-- you spent 49 pages of your brief arguing other things --
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3503.535,3503.92,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3503.92,3505.21,-- putting you to the test.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3505.21,3505.83,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3505.83,3506.55,All right.
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3508.345,3520.62,"So we think there are -- we have two stronger arguments, but we think part of what the Ninth Circuit said was the second sentence only limits rules that are specific to conservation system units."
2015.14-1209,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3531.79,3533.505,Do you think the Ninth Circuit was right?
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3533.505,3534.2,Yes.
2015.14-1209,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3534.2,3555.11,"So if there's a rule that applies to conservation -- it applies to Alaska, and it applies to the National Mall, that would be that you can't have a Hovercraft in Alaska or in the title basin. Under the Ninth Circuit's -- the Ninth Circuit's rationale, that would be 107 -- 103 -- 103(c) wouldn't buy that."
2015.14-1209,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3555.11,3558.235,I don't think there's any dispute that's what the plain text says.
2015.14-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3583.965,3587.605,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Findley, you have two minutes remaining."
2015.14-1209,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3587.605,3591.765,"Just in the two minutes, can you address the very last point the Solicitor General made?"
