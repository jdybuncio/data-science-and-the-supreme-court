1999.98-1170,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.825,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 98-1170, Leonard Portuondo v Ray Agard."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,11.6,13.912,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,48.304,64.855,"Mr. Zwerling, would the prosecutor have been entitled to a jury instruction that the jury could draw an adverse inference by virtue of the fact...  as to guilt by virtue of the fact that the defendant had sat in the courtroom the whole time?"
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,64.855,77.654,"The prosecutor would be entitled to a jury instruction that as for impeachment purposes the jury could consider the effects, if any, of the defendant's status as a nonsequestered witness."
1999.98-1170,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,84.424,87.313,May I just interrupt?
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,99.368,109.605,"The short answer is no, Your Honor, the prosecutor would not be entitled to an instruction that as to guilt the jury could consider the effects, if any, of the defendant's nonsequestered status."
1999.98-1170,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,112.288,128.346,"Could the prosecutor make that remark without correction from the district...  from the trial judge if the defendant's testimony on the stand was in all respects consistent with the testimony...  with his previous statements that he'd given to the police, et cetera?"
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,128.346,131.607,Could the prosecutor still make that remark?
1999.98-1170,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,131.607,132.229,Yes.
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,149.44,164.179,"The prosecutor in the first instance, judge, would not be able to stand up without any factual predicate whatsoever, make the argument to the jury that the defendant's testimony is in some way tailored, simply by virtue of the..."
1999.98-1170,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,164.179,165.581,It has to be a factual predicate?
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,165.581,191.382,"To make an affirmative claim of tailoring, Your Honor, but I just want to state as a threshold principle that just, much in the way that a jury can consider a defendant's interest in the outcome, you do not need a factual predicate, other than the defendant's exposure to the testimony of the witnesses, to throw out that question to the jury for its consideration as the trier of fact to determine what, if any, impact that exposure had."
1999.98-1170,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,191.382,196.955,The prosecutor wouldn't have much incentive in the case proposed by Justice Kennedy.
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,209.299,211.649,"It simply wouldn't be a rational argument, Your Honor."
1999.98-1170,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,211.649,215.159,"What if it is...  I'm going to give you a really hard one, Mr. Zwerling."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,228.822,241.537,"If the prosecutor, under those circumstances, stood up and said to the jury that a statement, or...  well, this is assuming that the prosecutor relied upon that confession at trial."
1999.98-1170,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,241.537,244.054,"No, I'm saying it was excluded and..."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,244.054,258.422,"If it's excluded, Your Honor, and the prosecutor stood up as an officer of the court and told the jury that the testimony at trial was the first time that the defendant has stood up to give this particular version, then it would be error."
1999.98-1170,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,262.797,265.359,"But that wasn't the question, Mr. Zwerling."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,298.274,299.456,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,326.577,333.097,"Mr. Zwerling, in New York I take it there's a statute that requires the defendant to be present at his trial."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,333.097,333.84,"That is true, Your Honor."
1999.98-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,333.84,336.691,"That isn't true in every State, I assume."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,336.691,339.43,"I can't speak for every State, but it's certainly true in Your Honor..."
1999.98-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,339.43,343.788,"Well, then, how do you deal with the Doyle case?"
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,343.788,345.812,"A couple of ways, Your Honor."
1999.98-1170,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,362.53,363.812,It's not a different issue.
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,371.28,380.196,"Well, in New York, Your Honor, a defendant can waive his presence at trial upon application to the court."
1999.98-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,403.025,429.942,"But your argument is a little extreme in the situation where, by State law, the defendant has to be there, and any time the defendant testifies, even if it's totally consistent with his prior but excluded confession, you say the prosecutor can nonetheless get up in summation and try to use his presence at the trial against him."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,429.942,430.806,Well...
1999.98-1170,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,430.806,434.233,"I mean, that's...  how do you justify..."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,434.233,443.854,"Your Honor, for the reason that it's not possible to detect how a witness' testimony might have been affected by the nonsequestered status."
1999.98-1170,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,466.638,481.416,"You say it's pretty much like...  I think you've already said, like the trial judge's charge, you may take into consideration the interest of every witness in the outcome of the proceedings, and that would apply to the defendant as well as to any other witness."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,481.416,488.929,"In the interested witness context, Your Honor, there may very well be defendants whose testimony is unaffected by their interest in the outcome."
1999.98-1170,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,500.695,504.866,"Mr. Zwerling, there was an interested witness charge in this case, wasn't there?"
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,504.866,505.442,"Yes, there was, Your Honor."
1999.98-1170,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,505.442,511.758,"So this is doubling, underscoring, or putting it in bold face, for one witness only."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,517.619,519.931,"They cover different subjects, Your Honor."
1999.98-1170,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,534.52,543.231,"Yes, but in answer to the Chief's question you equated the two, and now you're telling us, well, they are indeed different, and you are entitled, rightly, to both."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,543.231,548.416,"I'm not...  I'm saying, Your Honor, I'm using the interested witness charge scenario by analogy."
1999.98-1170,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,565.978,570.557,Were there witnesses other than the defendant in fact sequestered in this case?
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,570.557,573.613,"In this case, all of the other witnesses was sequestered, Your Honor."
1999.98-1170,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,573.613,574.894,"Were sequestered, yes."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,574.894,585.047,"But again, similar to an interested witness scenario, in most cases, or in many cases the defendant is the only witness who has an interest in the outcome."
1999.98-1170,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,608.907,614.275,"Well, with respect to the exposure to the others, I'd like you just to go back to Doyle for a minute."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,689.072,695.759,"It's two-pronged, Your Honor, one specifically dealing with the facts in Doyle, and then a more general response."
1999.98-1170,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,734.852,745.914,"Well, that's true, but whether we're dealing with something that goes to impeachment or whether we're dealing with something that goes to guilt, there is the problem of ambiguity, and it's the ambiguity that's bothering me."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,745.914,746.907,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1170,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,760.986,769.281,"I don't understand why...  maybe I've got the assumption wrong, but are you conceding that there was no cause on the part of the prosecutor to mention this?"
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,814.79,819.315,"If Your Honor is referring to the specifics of this case, the..."
1999.98-1170,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,819.315,824.062,"I mean, am I not supposed to look at the specifics of the case when I decide the legal question?"
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,824.062,830.172,"In terms of the particular facts of this case, the prosecutor's remarks were entirely proper."
1999.98-1170,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,830.172,830.461,All right.
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,832.501,835.912,"They're proper for two reasons, Your Honor."
1999.98-1170,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,874.261,884.581,"But on that point the Second Circuit disagreed with you and said, if there had been in this case an attempt to show that particular pieces of information were tailored, so be it."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,911.58,924.954,"Your Honor, to make myself clear, for the prosecutor to make the generic argument, to throw the question of fact out to the jury you should consider the effects of the defendant's exposure to testimony."
1999.98-1170,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,931.066,932.673,"He doesn't have to be invited, you're saying."
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,932.673,933.333,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1170,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,956.45,966.664,Am I right that in New York a defendant has no right to bring out on rebuttal prior consistent statements that the defendant made before he heard the witnesses?
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,966.664,969.825,If they are made after the motive to lie arose.
1999.98-1170,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,969.825,971.848,"Well, when would that be in a case like this?"
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,971.848,977.421,"In this particular case, the defendant could not have brought out his prior consistent statements, Your Honor."
1999.98-1170,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,977.421,986.422,"Well, is there any reason why the constitutional doctrine here should follow the niceties of the law of evidence on when you can impeach witnesses?"
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,986.422,987.286,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1170,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1003.156,1004.42,This is not a rule of evidence.
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,1011.935,1031.625,"But the question is whether or not Griffin penalty analysis is implicated by virtue of such comments, and the answer is no, because the prosecutor's comments in no way created the suggestion that the jury should take those comments and rely upon them as proof of guilt in this particular case."
1999.98-1170,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.625,1034.597,I'm not sure.
1999.98-1170,0,17299,andrew_zwerling,,1034.597,1038.107,I see the white light has gone on.
1999.98-1170,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1041.384,1042.77,"Very well, Mr. Zwerling."
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1049.912,1051.11,"It's Nuechterlein, that's correct."
1999.98-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1051.11,1051.77,"Nuechterlein, okay."
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1051.77,1054.454,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1170,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1087.147,1098.664,"Well, Mr. Nuechterlein, do you take the position that there's just a per se rule, that in every case where a defendant testifies, that it's all right for the prosecutor to make this kind of comment?"
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1098.664,1103.123,I think as a general matter this kind of comment is appropriate.
1999.98-1170,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1107.952,1110.553,"Well, is there a...  but you take the position that it would be proper in every case."
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1116.747,1120.617,The issue has come up in a handful of Federal cases.
1999.98-1170,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1133.298,1138.007,Do you think that an instruction to the jury would be appropriate...
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1138.007,1138.788,I...
1999.98-1170,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1138.788,1141.76,reinforcing this statement?
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1141.76,1155.756,"Probably yes, but that would be a closer case, because there are many contexts in which we permit prosecutors to make arguments to the jury in their role as advocates that we do not permit judges to make to the jury in their role as neutral arbiter of the proceedings."
1999.98-1170,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1155.756,1171.526,"My concern is, is that if we adopt your position, which is not without some strong reasons to recommend it, that although that's...  this comment is not usually made now, a year hence it will be standard."
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1193.545,1198.852,"Actually, this comment, Justice Kennedy, is made in a number...  has been made in a number of cases."
1999.98-1170,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.365,1227.709,"Well, excuse me, I don't understand the defendant here to be asserting what those...  that judge's instruction would have told the jury, that you therefore can't take it into account."
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1227.709,1231.546,I had understood Justice Kennedy's question to relate to arguments the prosecutor...
1999.98-1170,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.546,1233.653,"I mean, that's not at issue in this case."
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1233.653,1234.312,That's correct.
1999.98-1170,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.312,1241.165,Isn't it agreed by both sides that the jury can take account of the fact that he's been sitting in court during the entire argument?
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1241.165,1242.734,That's certainly correct.
1999.98-1170,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.734,1250.99,"And the jury is not entitled to an instruction, as it is with regard to the right, of the Fifth Amendment right of nonincrimination."
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1261.599,1263.168,That's correct.
1999.98-1170,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1263.168,1271.341,"Well, I suppose a trial judge could go on and say, if you find he altered his testimony by reason of his presence you can take that..."
1999.98-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1271.341,1272.167,"Well, but..."
1999.98-1170,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1272.167,1272.744,into account.
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1279.969,1281.911,"Justice Kennedy, this is not a new area."
1999.98-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1296.4,1305.688,"Well, when you get into the area of instructions by the trial court, you also get into the question of whether a defendant would request a particular instruction."
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1342.097,1366.783,"That is correct, and again I just want to reemphasize the point that I believe that a trial judge would have the discretion to give that kind of instruction, but you don't have to agree with me on that in order to reverse the judgment below, because there really are a variety of contexts in which we want to give prosecutors leeway to make effective arguments where we would not permit a judge to make an analogous comment."
1999.98-1170,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1366.783,1370.498,Don't you think the Doyle case cuts against your position somewhat?
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1370.498,1371.985,"I do not, for two reasons."
1999.98-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1408.765,1427.795,"On the other hand, in the Doyle facts there is some inconsistency as a practical matter between the silence at the time of questioning and the contrived story at the time of trial, but here there's no inconsistency, there's just an opportunity, so it seems to me this case is a fortiori from Doyle, and I didn't agree with Doyle, as you may know."
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1427.795,1433.74,"What do you mean, Justice Stevens, when you say it's a fortiori..."
1999.98-1170,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1433.74,1450.791,"Well, here the prosecutor can make this comment even though there's no...  nothing in the record that would imply that there's some inconsistency between the testimony and the actual fact, whereas in Doyle, the fact that he was silent is in itself somewhat inconsistent with his having come up with a story later."
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1450.791,1456.047,There are a variety of reasons why a lawyer should have discretion to make comments about the credibility of the witness.
1999.98-1170,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1470.315,1470.686,Well...
1999.98-1170,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.686,1482.492,"Mr. Nuechterlein, if we applied Doyle here, we would again have to instruct the jury not to take account of the fact that he has heard all the testimony."
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1500.779,1511.636,"If Doyle were the basis of an opinion affirming the judgment below, I imagine there would be arguments analogous to Carter v. Kentucky in which defendants would claim a right to a jury instruction of that kind."
1999.98-1170,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1511.636,1512.629,Mr. Nuechterlein...
1999.98-1170,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1512.629,1513.948,May I ask one other verify brief question?
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1521.024,1522.982,"No, that is incorrect, Justice Stevens."
1999.98-1170,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1522.982,1522.982,They didn't.
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1522.982,1528.145,At least four of them cited in the court of appeals opinion upheld the comments as fair comment.
1999.98-1170,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1528.145,1528.299,I see.
1999.98-1170,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1528.299,1535.78,"Mr. Nuechterlein, you mentioned in distinguishing Doyle the risk there of the jury's confusing impeachment with proof of guilt."
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1537.926,1539.579,I don't think so.
1999.98-1170,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1555.182,1560.921,"No, but the jury is going to go from mere presence to a suspicion of tailoring."
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1573.115,1582.636,"Justice Souter, I think that reasoning proves too much, because it would eviscerate the line this Court has always drawn between impeachment that goes to credibility and evidence that goes to guilt."
1999.98-1170,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1582.636,1586.146,"Well maybe it would, but does it also eviscerate the line between Doyle and this case?"
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1586.146,1592.917,"No, I don't think it does, because the primary basis for this Court's holding in Doyle, as the Court stressed later in Fletcher..."
1999.98-1170,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1592.917,1593.743,Is the estoppel point.
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1593.743,1596.427,"and Jenkins is the estoppel point, and there is no analogous problem here."
1999.98-1170,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1596.427,1615.913,"Mr. Nuechterlein, may I ask a question about your position on brief that Chief Judge Winters' distinction was unworkable, because it seemed to me the Second Circuit worked it out very well in U.S. v. Chako the next time the issue came before them, when they said, look, it's different here."
1999.98-1170,1,32215,jonathan_nuechterlein,,1622.161,1648.895,"Well, I'm not sure whether in Chako there was any actual proof of tailoring, and it's extremely difficult ever to prove tailoring, and I guess our central point is that just as the common law doesn't require a lawyer in other settings to give evidence that a particular witness would have given different testimony had he not been exposed to the testimony of other witnesses, so, too, is it inappropriate here to require the prosecutor to make that sort of showing about a defendant."
1999.98-1170,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.895,1650.381,"Thank you, Mr. Nuechterlein."
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1652.898,1658.737,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1170,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1693.892,1697.441,"I don't understand them to concede that, Ms. Van Ness."
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1697.441,1701.528,"Your Honor, I think that on pages 2 and 3 of their reply brief..."
1999.98-1170,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1701.528,1703.386,Yes.
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1703.386,1727.246,"If I may, they say, nor has petitioner alleged that a tailoring argument may be predicated merely on an accused's presence during the testimony of other witnesses, and on page 3 on the first full paragraph, at no time has petitioner argued that a tailoring argument may be built on nothing more than a defendant's mere presence at trial during the taking of testimony."
1999.98-1170,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1727.246,1732.447,"Well, I should add, we don't decide cases on the basis of concessions by the parties."
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1732.447,1733.645,"I understand that, Your Honor, but I..."
1999.98-1170,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1733.645,1735.398,"Ms....  more than that, Ms. Van Ness."
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1767.37,1770.88,"Well, regrettably, Your Honor, I did not put that in my..."
1999.98-1170,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1770.88,1773.397,"Well, it's a little late to put it now."
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1773.397,1777.567,"But it is an alternate ground for affirmance, Your Honor, and I think these concessions are..."
1999.98-1170,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.567,1791.108,"We rarely go off on alternate grounds for affirmance unless there's some very obvious reason why we can't decide the issue that is presented in the question presented, which is whether Griffin should be applied to this case."
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1791.108,1813.316,"Your Honor, going to the opportunity to tailor argument, I would like to make a particular point on that, which is that the opportunity to tailor argument, the quote, mere opportunity to consider the defendant's ability to do this, is really an invitation to the jury to speculate."
1999.98-1170,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1831.437,1846.548,"But you're always speculating as to whether the witness is telling the truth or not, and you speculate on the basis of various considerations, and you're usually allowed to call those considerations to the jury's...  what if the witness' eyes are shifting all around the courtroom during the testimony."
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1850.313,1851.211,"Certainly, Your Honor, but..."
1999.98-1170,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1851.211,1851.765,Of course he can.
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1851.765,1853.44,you're calling attention to evidence.
1999.98-1170,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1861.713,1863.554,"Well, but it's an important possible explanation."
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1886.588,1895.671,"My...  the answer to that would be, if you find that there's evidence of tailoring in the record, jury, you are free to consider that evidence, but not that you are free to consider..."
1999.98-1170,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1895.671,1898.371,"Well, I'm not sure why the prosecutor really argued anything different here."
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1898.371,1904.316,Because the prosecutor was using...  the only evidence was that the defendant was there.
1999.98-1170,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.94,1936.267,"So your position is really...  is really, I was erroneous when I said I didn't think either side, that you were making...  you are making the contention that the jury...  not only may the prosecutor not call the jury's attention to it, the jury may not consider it, and presumably you would be entitled to an instruction, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you should take no account of the fact that the defendant has been sitting here listening to all the testimony, because I don't see any other evidence of tailoring."
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1936.267,1951.599,"I do think there's a danger in asking the jury to speculate, because the State has the burden of proof, but if a line is to be crossed here, Your Honor, then at the very least this subject must be raised during the defendant's cross-examination to give him the chance to address it."
1999.98-1170,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1951.599,1962.273,"You're saying in effect that a juror cannot sit in the jury room and say, you know, this guy was very smooth, and the reason he was is because he was there, and that's the way I think."
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1964.214,1966.898,"Well, I don't think it would be..."
1999.98-1170,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1966.898,1967.115,That's astounding.
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1967.115,1972.266,"I don't think it would be appropriate for them to do it, Your Honor, because I don't think they have any proof that that's what happened."
1999.98-1170,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1972.266,1982.751,"No, but isn't the point, when the question...  when Justice Kennedy's question says, this guy was very smooth, wouldn't that be, in fact, an evidentiary basis?"
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,1995.893,2001.344,"Well, Your Honor, I just...  I believe that that's in the nature of an adjective."
1999.98-1170,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2003.118,2014.923,"So you're in effect saying that if the testimony is, shall we say, unrealistically smooth, that that may not be considered?"
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,2020.413,2021.778,I think it's...
1999.98-1170,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2021.982,2029.784,"That...  I really don't think that facing that issue is what you necessarily have to do in this case, but maybe I misunderstand you."
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,2029.784,2040.27,"Well, but going back to the Doyle point, Your Honor, the...  another explanation for why a defendant's story is consistent and he can't be shaken is that he's telling the truth, and that's why this..."
1999.98-1170,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2040.27,2041.096,"Oh, that..."
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,2041.096,2042.16,That's why...
1999.98-1170,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2042.16,2063.757,"You know, that goes to the, you know, the insoluble ambiguity point, but when you start talking about sort of unusual smoothness, I think we are outside...  or at least as I'm using the term, I think we're outside of the kind of testimony which is insolubly ambiguous, and don't you...  isn't that a distinction that can be drawn?"
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,2067.101,2086.338,"Maybe I'm misunderstanding Your Honor, but certainly if the...  the prosecutor is free to use anything in the evidence to ask the jury to make...  to draw reasonable inferences from, but what they can't do, what I'm arguing they can't do is to ask the jury to speculate, so if you want to use the..."
1999.98-1170,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2086.338,2089.493,"All right, so all you're saying I think is that it would be...  put it this way."
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,2118.637,2120.412,"No, I'm certainly not advocating that position."
1999.98-1170,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2120.412,2120.85,Okay.
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,2139.814,2141.046,"Well, certainly, I..."
1999.98-1170,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2141.046,2142.665,You would say that was a wrong instruction.
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,2142.665,2143.158,"Yes, I would."
1999.98-1170,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2143.158,2155.873,"And you would say it was a wrong instruction because, as I've given the hypothesis, there's no particularized basis in any evidence for applying that rule of devaluation, isn't that your point?"
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,2155.873,2156.45,That's correct.
1999.98-1170,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2156.45,2156.45,All right.
1999.98-1170,2,17904,beverly_van_ness,,2174.533,2176.884,"Oh, I...  yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-1170,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.884,2191.91,"Certainly, and the court of appeals would decide whether the Constitution has been violated or not presumably, under what you've accepted, by deciding whether, in fact, the defendant was smooth or too smooth."
1999.98-1170,3,17299,andrew_zwerling,,3460.123,3488.73,"Addressing the issue of the insoluble ambiguity, or that in the absence of a particularized showing of actual tailoring, that that gives rise to an invitation to speculate, if the witness in question who was not sequestered is not a defendant, the court can give a jury instruction that they can consider that fact, and to consider the effects, if any, that that nonsequestration had on that particular witness."
1999.98-1170,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3522.25,3525.222,"Mr. Zwerling, we're going so far beyond what the Second Circuit decided."
1999.98-1170,3,17299,andrew_zwerling,,3536.822,3542.023,"Addressing particularly summation comment, the same parallel holds true."
1999.98-1170,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3573.852,3574.345,"Well, I'm not..."
1999.98-1170,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3574.345,3574.9,"Well, do you..."
1999.98-1170,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3574.9,3590.404,"I'm not sure that that's right, given the Second Circuit's follow-up decision, in which they pointed out that when that happened the judge repeatedly offered to give a curative instruction simply informing the jury that the defendant had not only a right but an obligation to be there."
1999.98-1170,3,17299,andrew_zwerling,,3613.233,3628.01,"But so long as the jury is informed that they can consider that fact as it bears upon the defendant's credibility, clearly, you know, additional language in an instruction alerting to the jury that the defendant must be there, for example, under New York law..."
