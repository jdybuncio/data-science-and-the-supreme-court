1991.118_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.157,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 118 Original, United States against Alaska."
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,10.689,16.573,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1991.118_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,213.331,230.502,"Mr. Minear, can I ask, what is the Government's position under section 10 and under this waiver or for that matter, under all waivers, with respect to a natural accretion that is caused by the construction of the artificial structure?"
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,230.502,251.607,"That is a factor that would be taken into account in building the structure, and I think that is a very relevant point in this sense, the structure might cause downstream erosion, shoreline accretion, which could result in actually bringing the boundary landward and would affect the State's grant of submerged lands."
1991.118_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,256.64,262.132,I am not talking about whether the Army will take it into account in determining whether to issue the permit.
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,282.025,284.727,"Yes, I think this disclaimer would in fact cover that."
1991.118_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.782,302.237,You have to go and figure out how much natural accretion along the shoreline is caused by the construction of a jetty that was subject to a waiver like this?
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,304.159,310.714,"With all respect, Your Honor, this is only going to arise in most cases with respect to the leasing of mineral rights."
1991.118_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,325.793,352.002,"No, but it is the case that I just can't look at the shoreline and say, well, except for natural structures, I know that the 3-mile is measured from the shoreline and you are telling me that if some of that shoreline may be up-current or down-current, I don't know how accretion works, has been altered by reason of the artificial structure, I cannot count that part of the shoreline for determining the 3-mile limit."
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,352.002,356.955,"Well, Your Honor, that is a practical consequence of the way this particular disclaimer is worded."
1991.118_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,394.029,398.521,Does the Corps exact similar waivers in connection with structures on a river?
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,398.521,405.217,--In those cases it is likely not to because it does not affect offshore mineral rights.
1991.118_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,405.217,409.118,That could very much affect the boundary between one State and another on a river.
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,409.118,413.722,"That's right, and that is a factor that the Corps could take into account."
1991.118_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,414.882,418.254,"What do you mean when you say the factor, a factor the Corps could take into account?"
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,419.867,424.518,--In determining whether to issue the permit or not and what are the appropriate conditions for issuance of the permit.
1991.118_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,424.518,435.966,But you say that the Corps does not generally exact waivers in connection with streams or rivers within the United States.
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,435.966,439.849,"Well, frankly, I am just not certain about that practice."
1991.118_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,450.986,473.08,"But supposing that a State applies to build a dam on a river and the river is on an interstate boundary and the prospectus or study says there is a chance that there will be some erosion on one side of the river, accretion on the other and it might alter the boundary of the State some, how would the Court take that into consideration?"
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,475.522,480.174,"As a general matter, the Corps attempts to preserve the status quo, exactly as in this case."
1991.118_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.025,519.39,"So the structure... the point of my earlier question, Mr. Minear, is that I am inclined to agree with the Government that section 10 allows you to take into account whether it will alter the ownership of submerged lands, but to say that you can take it into account is not to say that can condition the permission upon this kind of waiver."
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,550.28,559.746,"Well, with all respect, Your Honor, the Corps, what the Corps is attempting to do here is to stabilize and provide definiteness with respect to title."
1991.118_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,583.374,594.242,"Now, Mr. Minear, I take it that if there is accretion or erosion through natural causes, the boundary is ambulatory?"
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,594.242,601.265,"That is generally true, although this is a matter that is changing, as this Court issues particular decrees with respect to--"
1991.118_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,601.265,606.029,"But absent the decree, the Government agrees that the land would be ambulatory in that case?"
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,606.029,613.373,--The land would be ambulatory except that where disclaimers are in effect or where this Court has entered a decree fixing a boundary.
1991.118_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,619.197,634.548,"Would you have authority, would the Government have authority to tell Alaska that it's going to condition the permit for construction of this structure on making the entire boundary of Alaska fixed as of this time?"
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,634.548,639.59,"I think that might run into problems, two types of problems at the outset."
1991.118_orig,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,650.81,653.943,But I thought you said you had a governmental interest in having stable boundaries.
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,653.943,660.357,"--Oh, we do, we do, and we exercise that on a case-by-case basis with respect to these individual projects."
1991.118_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,690.587,705.838,"Mr. Minear, the Submerged Land Act expressly states that it is in the public interest for the States to have title to submerged lands within 3 miles of their coastline."
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,715.664,724.11,"We think as a general matter that is a policy that is also of interest to the Army, but what the Army does here is that it looks to the consequences of the building of the structure."
1991.118_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,756.11,760.103,"The Government doesn't end up with any net loss, right?"
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,766.676,769.067,"No, with all respect, Your Honor, it does not."
1991.118_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,993.807,1001.019,"As a matter of curiosity, Mr. Minear, what kind of minerals are possible there?"
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1001.019,1016.16,"The mineral... the leasing program that is ongoing at this point, and in fact, request for leases were submitted, no bids were received, but the primary mineral of interest in the case of those leases was gold."
1991.118_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1107.81,1109.68,Upholding a what kind of--
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1109.68,1111.412,--A single coastline.
1991.118_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1111.412,1113.773,"--As opposed to what, a double coastline?"
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1113.773,1122.649,"Alaska's theory here is that there should be, the same coastline should be used for measuring both the Federal/State boundary and international boundaries."
1991.118_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1145.735,1148.828,What are the divergences that occur anyway?
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1148.828,1150.598,They occur in several respects.
1991.118_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1237.964,1246.63,"The problem is that if you don't have the power to condition, that you wouldn't have the power to refuse this permit?"
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1246.63,1249.124,I don't think it would necessarily follow.
1991.118_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1261.921,1264.973,"If you don't have the power to condition, you don't have the power to refuse it--"
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1264.973,1266.135,"--Yes, that would be--"
1991.118_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1266.135,1278.473,"--if it otherwise satisfies the... if the only objection you would have is because it extends the coastline, you couldn't refuse it under your theory?"
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1278.473,1284.868,"--I believe that is a last... maybe I am getting confused here, but our theory is that we can deny the permit based on its coastline--"
1991.118_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1284.868,1285.736,"I know, I know."
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1286.728,1293.112,"--And if we can't, then I believe that the logic of our position would be that we would have to grant the permit."
1991.118_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1293.112,1294.384,Yes.
1991.118_orig,0,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1300.028,1301.608,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.118_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1304.85,1306.451,"Very well, Mr. Minear."
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,1308.253,1314.938,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.118_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1369.001,1389.966,"I thought your position went farther than that, that whether or not it extends the coastline or extends a State line, the boundary, whether or not it does it not a proper consideration in determining whether to issue the permit or not."
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,1389.966,1391.107,This is correct.
1991.118_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.888,1395.119,All right.
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,1395.369,1411.56,"But we start with the coastline and I also want to emphasize that Alaska, although we were not a State when the Submerged Lands Act was passed, under our statehood compact we did become a State, specifically that compact provides us the benefits of the Submerged Lands Act."
1991.118_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1494.054,1512.737,"Mr. Gissberg, could the Corps of Engineers have said when you applied for a permit, it looks to us as if this is going to extend the State's seaward boundary, therefore we are going to turn it down."
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,1514.156,1517.239,"Mr. Chief Justice, absolutely not."
1991.118_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1533.069,1548.45,"So it isn't... let's assume you are correct about the formula, why can't the United States or the Corps of Engineers simply say, we don't want to risk any changes in the outer boundary, we are not going to let you build it?"
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,1548.45,1552.201,"Because the Army Corps is a creature of Congress, Mr. Chief Justice--"
1991.118_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1552.201,1554.262,"Well, of course it is, but that doesn't answer it."
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,1554.262,1560.389,--My answer is that they only have the power that Congress gave them and that power starts from the Rivers and Harbors Act.
1991.118_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1560.389,1571.275,But the Rivers and Harbors Act says you can't build any structure in navigable waters except on plans recommended by the Chief of Engineers and authorized by the Secretary of the Army.
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,1571.275,1594.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Government compares section 10, which the Court has just read, to section 13, which they reference in Pennsylvania Chemical case, and we think... and Pennsylvania Chemical said that regarding putting pollutants into navigable waters, the Army Corps had discretion to say no, they will not allow those pollutants to go in."
1991.118_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1665.236,1674.272,What factors can the Secretary take into consideration in refusing to authorize a construction project?
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,1674.272,1691.333,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, from 1899 until 1968, the Army Corps of Engineers, by their own admission in the Federal Register cite that the Government has put in, took into account one factor, and that was navigation, enhancing navigation."
1991.118_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.749,1752.684,You don't think that preserving the property of the United States is one of the public interests of the United States?
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,1770.595,1774.727,"Justice Scalia, I think it would be if it were not for the Submerged Lands Act."
1991.118_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.594,1789.517,But the Submerged Lands Act doesn't say that the effect of structures can be to decrease the territory owned by the United States.
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,1789.517,1798.035,"The Submerged Lands Act, Justice Scalia, says that the States will own the lands to 3 miles from the coastline, that coastline is ambulatory."
1991.118_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1800.034,1803.177,We are not talking now about the waiver.
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,1833.278,1851.829,"--The problem with that, Justice Scalia, is that Congress addressed those Federal interests in the outer continental shelf in May of 1953 when they enacted the Submerged Lands Act and then in August when they enacted the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and they realized there would be some changes in that baseline."
1991.118_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1877.807,1895.628,"I just find it hard to believe that once you acknowledge that all interests, all governmental interests and not just the interest in navigation can be taken into account in determining whether to deny the permit, I cannot imagine that one of those interests cannot be whether the Federal Government will lose territory."
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,1898.109,1910.627,"Justice Scalia, it somehow isn't as obvious to me because I have looked exactly at what Congress has said, and in our briefs we have gone through, there are probably 20 different laws of Congress that have been enacted that the Army Corps of Engineers has to look at."
1991.118_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.615,1955.0,"No one is disputing that, I don't think, Mr. Gissberg."
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,1960.123,1973.589,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that in the 1968 cite to the Federal Register, the Corps admits there that we are now going to take into account more factors than just navigation."
1991.118_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2016.048,2031.149,"Suppose we don't agree with you in that regard, Mr. Attorney General; suppose the Government just turns you down?"
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,2060.628,2061.878,"No, I don't."
1991.118_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.98,2087.643,"I know, but we say that they have authority to turn... say that they have the authority to turn the permit down and you think then that there is no way that the State and the Federal Government could make an agreement that would permit the building of the pier without extending the coastline."
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,2087.643,2088.235,--I see.
1991.118_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.837,2131.693,You don't question then the authority of Congress to explicitly adopt a regime such as the Corps has adopted in this case?
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,2131.693,2135.486,"This is, Mr. Chief Justice, the job of Congress to do--"
1991.118_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2135.486,2140.899,"And you concede that Congress does have that authority had it chosen to do so, you say it has."
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,2140.899,2158.694,"--Absolutely, and in fact, we interpret the Court's suggestion that is being taken as a mandatory direction now because this is happening on every single causeway and every single beach project... we only could find 17 through 1991, but every one that is coming up now, the Corps requires these disclaimers."
1991.118_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2172.811,2184.419,You think that that statement in one of the California cases that the United States could protect itself was just misguided?
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,2184.419,2187.111,"Not at all, I think that it has to be read--"
1991.118_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2187.111,2190.133,How can it protect itself if it must issue the permit?
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,2190.133,2201.28,"--Justice White, that statement in the California case specifically says it can protect itself through its authority... powers over navigation."
1991.118_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2211.487,2234.753,"But the logic of your position, Mr. Gissberg, is that assuming a particular project does not interfere with navigation, that the Federal Government is powerless to prevent a State from artificially extending its coastline for the very purpose of gaining title to submerged lands in some valuable area."
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,2237.955,2258.026,"--This Court has actually said, I have been looking at the second half of that sentence in California II, but this Court in California II said that... they directly addressed that to unwarranted structures, and an unwarranted structure would be one that doesn't have any navigational benefit or any other benefit under the laws of Congress."
1991.118_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2258.026,2259.278,"Yes, but may I interrupt there."
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,2282.912,2288.067,"Well, I think actually under what this Court may have said, that they can do that."
1991.118_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2288.067,2290.828,That is a correct summary of your theory?
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,2292.038,2302.176,"Let me clarify that, Justice Stevens, because this Court has said that unwarranted structures may be suspect, and unwarranted though in terms of navigation."
1991.118_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2319.788,2324.242,"Well, this particular jetty could have been twice as long."
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,2324.242,2326.333,"--It was supposed to be, but it took too long to finish."
1991.118_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.655,2333.787,And you would say that the Federal Government would have to issue the permit.
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,2333.787,2341.222,I would say that the Federal Government would not be able to deny the permit on the basis of changes in the ambulatory boundary.
1991.118_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2355.972,2375.894,"But my hypothetical is that it is neutral on navigation, it is either high enough so the ships can go under or something, but assuming my hypothetical has absolutely no impact on either navigation or environment, it is just a way of acquiring territory, sticking a 10-mile jetty out into the ocean, that you could do, I think under your theory because Congress hasn't thought about the problem and--"
1991.118_orig,1,30431,john_g_gissberg,,2375.894,2376.095,They haven't--
1991.118_orig,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3044.849,3047.73,"Yes, Your Honor, there are a few points I would like to make."
1991.118_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3089.381,3096.652,"But if stability isn't the law of the boundary, I don't really see much to that point, Mr. Minear."
1991.118_orig,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3111.353,3118.498,"Your Honor, first, with respect to the notion, the questions concerning the ambulatory nature of the boundary."
