1983.82-15,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.25,We'll hear arguments next in Oliver against United States and the consolidated case.
1983.82-15,0,24116,frank_e_haddad_jr,,75.109,79.243,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-15,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,330.509,332.5,That is they could not see.
1983.82-15,0,24116,frank_e_haddad_jr,,334.903,336.593,"Yes, they could."
1983.82-15,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,407.693,411.132,So you are not asking us to overrule the Hester case then?
1983.82-15,0,24116,frank_e_haddad_jr,,411.132,412.524,"--No, sir."
1983.82-15,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,429.908,433.417,"Do we know that much about the facts in Hester, Mr. Haddad?"
1983.82-15,0,24116,frank_e_haddad_jr,,438.472,439.512,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-15,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,671.585,685.904,"Mr. Haddad, perhaps this varies from place to place in the country, but wouldn't you agree that putting a Nc Hunting sign on premises does not necessarily mean that the owner wishes to exclude people who do not intend to hunt?"
1983.82-15,0,24116,frank_e_haddad_jr,,685.904,689.687,--This was a No Trespassing signs throughout here.
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1033.805,1036.955,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-15,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1155.276,1171.839,Then let me take you back to the questions we were putting to your colleague about a helicopter or a light plane flying over the area taking pictures and then presenting the pictures to a magistrate with enlargements showing that there were marijuana plants and getting a warrant.
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1173.378,1173.989,Yes.
1983.82-15,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1273.333,1282.72,"You are not suggesting, Ms. Zeegler, that the Maine Supreme Judicial Court decided this case wholly on a state law ground."
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1282.72,1312.161,"--Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I do feel that there is adequate and independent state grounds for this decision, and the reason that I am saying that is because the State of Maine had to talk about federal cases because they had to correct the erroneous assumptions of Petitioner in the case regarding the application of Katz and Hester to this case."
1983.82-15,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1312.161,1333.022,"If you would look at pages A-12, A-13, A-14 in the Petition where you set out the opinion of the Supreme Court of Maine, when they are talking about expectation of privacy they first talk about Hester and Katz and then they go on and say the Maine cases are in accord."
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1339.536,1357.879,"Well, again, Your Honor, it is my position that the court had to discuss Hester and Katz because those were the cases that were raised by the Petitioner on appeal so they had to discuss them, but then they said we are in accord in determining whether or not there was a search."
1983.82-15,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1378.365,1383.727,Weren't the Maine cases in turn relying on federal law?
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1383.727,1400.81,"--It is my position that some of the cases did cite Katz but not all of them, and it is very clear from the face of the opinion that the court did adopt its own version of a search and did--"
1983.82-15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1400.81,1404.47,"Well, of course, all we can do here is decide the federal question."
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1404.47,1405.531,--That is right.
1983.82-15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.531,1413.008,"If you are correct that the decision below rested as well on Maine, the ground rule would still prevail."
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1413.008,1414.417,That is correct.
1983.82-15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1414.417,1415.078,On remand.
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1415.078,1416.608,"Yes, sure."
1983.82-15,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1452.603,1456.216,How may trees do you need to get rid of the open field?
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1456.216,1462.62,"--Well, I think certainly in this case we had no field at all."
1983.82-15,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1489.778,1494.32,So you do not want it to apply to anybody but a field of this type?
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1494.32,1496.14,I am sorry.
1983.82-15,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1497.021,1499.272,I still do not know what field this is.
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1500.965,1503.156,How many trees are there?
1983.82-15,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1505.827,1508.389,How close are the trees?
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1508.389,1510.412,They were right next to the trees.
1983.82-15,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1515.074,1516.366,But you could see them.
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1516.366,1519.688,You could see them only when you got onto the land.
1983.82-15,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1521.73,1523.59,Not with good binoculars.
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1523.59,1525.81,Not with good binoculars even.
1983.82-15,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1525.81,1528.611,Is that agreed by both sides?
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1528.611,1533.726,That particular issue has not really been addressed.
1983.82-15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.583,1621.095,Can I put the same question I put to your friend in the other case?
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1643.08,1647.421,"Well, I think the threshold question there would be whether or not there was a search."
1983.82-15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.774,1649.772,"Well, that is what I am asking."
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1649.772,1650.173,--Yes.
1983.82-15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.736,1656.718,"Well, suppose it wasn't."
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1656.718,1659.94,--Suppose it was not?
1983.82-15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1669.127,1674.67,"Well, why could the officers nevertheless enter the property?"
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1674.67,1676.501,--They could not enter the property.
1983.82-15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1680.174,1691.44,"Well, I am asking you could the officers at the edge of the property when they received the information from the helicopter could the officers then enter the property without a warrant?"
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1691.44,1692.532,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-15,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.818,1709.313,I thought that what privacy there is has already disappeared.
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1718.488,1725.053,"Because the... Well, number one, the area was not an open field."
1983.82-15,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1727.184,1735.578,But it is an open field when a helicopter takes a picture or observes it and concludes that that is marijuana.
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1737.621,1753.621,"Well, in terms of what the... The openness of course, has to be the key here, and in Maine they say that the area has to be open and because they see it does not mean that it is open."
1983.82-15,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1753.621,1756.753,That pretty well leaves out the whole State of Maine doesn't it?
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1757.384,1758.886,That is right.
1983.82-15,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1766.611,1769.112,Very well.
1983.82-15,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1769.112,1774.465,"Before you sit down, could I ask you are you familiar with Mr. Haddad's case in Kentucky?"
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1774.465,1775.596,Yes.
1983.82-15,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1775.596,1780.319,Do you think your facts are a little weaker than his facts?
1983.82-15,1,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,1780.319,1788.534,"Well, I think that our facts are a little bit different in terms of our area being a completely wooded area."
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1823.906,1828.34,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-15,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1854.951,1856.261,Do you really believe that?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1856.261,1857.663,"Yes, I do."
1983.82-15,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1857.663,1859.613,"Of course, the court said it."
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1859.613,1873.061,"Yes, we do believe that that the Fourth Amendment protects persons, houses, papers and effects from unreasonable governmental searches and seizures."
1983.82-15,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1873.061,1875.274,"Well, that sounds like some property to me."
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1880.646,1896.027,But the intent here is to protect an underlying core zone of privacy which is essential for the individual to enjoy some fundamental level of freedom in our society.
1983.82-15,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1896.027,1907.755,But don't you think that there is substantial property law involved in determining whether there is this expectation of privacy or not?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1907.755,1911.355,There can be property law involved.
1983.82-15,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1957.037,1968.573,But no yard or other adjacent area could in your view ever be made so as to invoke Fourth Amendment concerns?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1968.573,1986.846,"--There could be a buffer zone around the house, and in suburban and urban areas there very well may be a buffer zone around the house to which Fourth Amendment protections would apply in order to preserve the integrity and security of people within the house itself."
1983.82-15,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1986.846,1994.079,But no other part of a field or a farm or a piece of property in your view?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,1994.079,1994.68,Yes.
1983.82-15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.211,2000.003,You say that the entry is legal?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2000.003,2003.406,--The entry here in this case?
1983.82-15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2017.207,2038.511,"What if the owner of the property is there at the gate, and the officers say this is an open field and we have probable cause to believe there is marijuana down at the end of that path and the owner says awfully sorry but you can't come on?"
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2041.142,2050.489,--At that particular point as a matter of constitutional law they can enter.
1983.82-15,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2059.125,2061.596,They would just be in trouble with Maine but not with the federal government.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2063.018,2076.078,That is exactly what we are saying that... Even in Katz itself this Court recognized that the Fourth Amendment cannot be translated into a general constitutional right of privacy.
1983.82-15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.078,2090.176,So that in your view there is just nothing a land owner can do outside the house to invoke Fourth Amendment protections which I take it is the answer you gave Justice O'Connor a minute ago.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2102.174,2105.577,That is our position and I would like to explain that.
1983.82-15,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2105.577,2109.928,May I just ask also that doesn't even require probable cause as I understand you.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2109.928,2112.33,"Correct, yes."
1983.82-15,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2112.33,2114.092,It wouldn't even require reasonable suspicion.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2120.544,2121.545,Yes.
1983.82-15,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2124.287,2134.705,Is your position consistent do you think with some of the administrative search cases from this Court?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2134.705,2138.456,Which cases do you have in mind?
1983.82-15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.497,2207.502,I take it that your position doesn't go as far as to say that an officer could... The land owner is standing at the gate.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2227.976,2230.637,"--Yes, he may seize in the sense of--"
1983.82-15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.637,2236.702,"Well, there certainly is an interest in what is being seized different from the interest in the land."
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2236.702,2238.214,"--Yes, that is correct."
1983.82-15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.214,2245.707,Except that then if you are legally there as far as the Constitution is concerned the items are in plain sight then I take it.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2245.707,2246.488,Yes.
1983.82-15,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2259.956,2266.05,Supposing the items were buried so there is a gun buried in the field somewhere and they suspect and they go out and they dig for it.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2266.941,2268.301,"Yes, they could."
1983.82-15,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2268.301,2271.413,As soon as they saw it they would have their probable cause and they could seize it.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2271.413,2273.156,"Yes, that is correct."
1983.82-15,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2283.731,2284.272,I understand.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2292.928,2293.789,Yes.
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2295.559,2296.51,Your position--
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2304.656,2313.532,"Effects are personal effects, but they do not actually reach as far as real estate or property."
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2313.532,2314.944,I didn't say personal.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2316.844,2321.405,"Well, they said their effects which suggests personal effects."
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2321.405,2323.028,"No, it doesn't to me."
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2325.078,2331.643,"Well, it does not say... In the Fifth Amendment they did use the word ""property"" but in the Fourth Amendment they did not."
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2331.643,2335.667,You only apply it to the personal property but not the real property.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2338.349,2338.889,Yes.
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2341.14,2348.606,Give me any case that says that.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2348.606,2349.758,I am sorry.
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2351.128,2361.863,Give me a case that says that effects means personal property and does not mean real property.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2361.863,2367.219,--I think Hester is such a case.
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2367.219,2378.315,Hester did not say one... All it said was in one sentence that it applies to the house and does not apply to open fields.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2380.446,2395.487,"Hester said that the... and if I remember it correctly the exact sentence was something like the special protections of the Fourth Amendment extended to the people and their persons, houses and papers and effects do not extend to the open fields."
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2402.272,2404.251,I would like for you to show me that.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2404.251,2405.033,--Pardon?
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2405.033,2407.644,It is not in the opinion.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2407.644,2409.347,"Yes, it is in the opinion."
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2424.014,2427.818,Fifty-seven is the page--
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2427.818,2431.131,--It is on page 59.
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2431.131,2433.024,--That is the last paragraph.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2433.024,2433.823,Right.
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2442.0,2443.339,Period.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2443.339,2444.381,--Yes.
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2444.381,2446.992,It does not say anything about what an open field is.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2446.992,2449.903,That is true.
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2449.903,2454.475,"Well, that is what I was trying to say that that does not help you."
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2482.745,2483.496,Yes.
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2486.259,2494.222,"Name me something in the opinion that gives you the idea that he meant something larger, the word ""larger""."
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2511.193,2511.964,--Yes.
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2515.047,2520.861,So you could apply this only to an open field.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2520.861,2529.977,"No, because we are saying that the Fourth Amendment itself is protecting only a core zone of privacy and once one is outside that core zone--"
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2529.977,2531.726,Are you saying it applies only to a house?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2531.726,2532.507,--No.
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2533.749,2535.408,What further than the house?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2535.408,2536.56,--Pardon?
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2536.56,2538.491,What more than the house?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2538.491,2542.394,It could also include a buffer zone that might be around the house.
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2542.394,2543.825,What else?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2543.825,2549.578,It could also include areas outside the house which a person would personalize.
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2551.561,2553.04,Like a telephone booth--
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2553.04,2554.342,--It could be a telephone booth--
1983.82-15,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2554.342,2555.472,--A barn?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2555.472,2556.894,--It could be a barn.
1983.82-15,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2563.827,2567.21,The common law lumped together is the curtilage?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2567.21,2570.762,"Yes, although we are not actually using a curtilage analysis."
1983.82-15,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2575.754,2578.749,Would the barn's location be relevant?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2578.749,2583.561,It could be if--
1983.82-15,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2583.561,2590.364,"If it were within the curtilage arguably it could, but suppose it were a mile away from the home?"
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2590.364,2597.971,"--Yes, but we are agreeing though that Fourth Amendment protection would apply to a barn."
1983.82-15,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2597.971,2600.102,Wherever located?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2600.102,2603.985,"Yes, wherever the barn itself is located because that would be the type of--"
1983.82-15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2603.985,2605.117,Personalized?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2605.117,2606.166,"--Yes, and that would be--"
1983.82-15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2606.166,2607.678,Personalized barn?
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2607.678,2610.51,"--Yes, in the sense that a person--"
1983.82-15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.51,2612.009,I mean a barn is personalized.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2612.009,2623.856,"--Yes, by construction and use in a way that fields and woods even fenced and posted ones are not."
1983.82-15,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.481,2665.684,"People can buy houses and conduct illegal activity in them, too."
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2665.684,2669.986,"Yes, but the house is a core zone of privacy."
1983.82-15,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2669.986,2680.945,"I mean, your argument that they could use it illegally I do not know that that advances the inquiry, does it, because every area protected by the Fourth Amendment could be used for illegal purposes."
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2680.945,2682.255,"Yes, but--"
1983.82-15,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.255,2684.897,"A yard house, a barn, a stable, whatever it might be."
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2684.897,2685.628,--Yes.
1983.82-15,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2690.57,2699.816,"Of course, as the Chief Justice suggests in the question in the earlier case if enough illegal activities are conducted in the house it may turn into a place of business."
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2699.816,2707.022,"Yes, it could, but we are not in any way saying that the Fourth Amendment would not apply to a place of business."
1983.82-15,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2732.38,2735.248,The pine trees look much the same.
1983.82-15,2,45666,wayne_s_moss,,2735.248,2738.321,The pine trees lock much the same.
1983.82-15,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2774.985,2796.001,Mr. Horowitz.
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2796.001,2798.191,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-15,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2850.194,2851.336,"Mr. Horowitz, can I ask you just one question?"
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2860.792,2863.774,"--Well, to the extent that--"
1983.82-15,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2863.774,2865.004,As a matter of constitutional law.
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2865.004,2866.105,--Yes.
1983.82-15,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2884.798,2887.9,Either there is total expectation of privacy... You say that is not to be considered in this case.
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2887.9,2890.112,"Well, total subjective expectation of privacy."
1983.82-15,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2890.112,2890.633,That is right.
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2890.633,2891.133,"Well,--"
1983.82-15,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2891.133,2892.924,Total objective or subjective?
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2896.035,2904.81,"--Well, I do not think you can ever have a total subjective or objective expectation of privacy in an area like a field."
1983.82-15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.634,2916.348,You build a very high fence around and electrify it.
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2920.181,2921.501,It would still open--
1983.82-15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2921.501,2922.813,--It is still open to the--
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2922.813,2928.016,--It is still open because it still does not have walls and it still does not have a roof so it is still open to view from the air.
1983.82-15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2928.016,2937.762,"--That is enough, just the fact that it is open to visual inspection from the air is enough to destroy whatever other expectation of privacy there might be."
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2937.762,2940.744,I think that is the state of law as it is now.
1983.82-15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.275,2941.794,That is your position.
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2941.794,2943.446,--We have two positions.
1983.82-15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2949.52,2960.497,"So would you disagree with your colleague from Maine that... Say the owner is there at the gate and says,"
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2973.36,2975.06,"Well, the--"
1983.82-15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2975.06,2977.251,As far as the Constitution is concerned?
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2977.251,2980.373,"--Well, certainly if they had reasonable suspicion they could enter."
1983.82-15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2987.888,2989.098,"Well, he did."
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,2994.593,2998.015,--Again I get back to that we have two positions.
1983.82-15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3005.269,3007.43,With or without an expectation of privacy?
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3009.874,3012.583,"Yes, but certainly with reasonable suspicious."
1983.82-15,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3014.235,3019.028,It is terribly important because as soon as you say that you are acknowledging the Fourth Amendment has some application.
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3021.78,3024.313,"--Well, again as I say I think we have two positions."
1983.82-15,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3034.318,3037.63,Your primary submission is that you need reasonable suspicion--
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3037.63,3039.19,That is our primary submission.
1983.82-15,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3039.19,3041.103,--Like Maine's submission.
1983.82-15,3,16154,alan_i_horowitz,,3041.103,3042.172,Yes.
1983.82-15,4,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,3757.862,3761.955,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-15,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3836.895,3841.992,This Court has never extended that to open fields.
1983.82-15,4,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,3842.591,3876.061,"Well, in terms of the per se exception this Court, of course, has never extended that to open fields, but if you look at the reasons for the exception to the warrant requirement that this Court has upheld we have seen that they have been in the context to preserve the safety of police officers, to prevent the loss or destruction of evidence or in the special nature of a government interest such as inventory searches."
1983.82-15,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3957.876,3961.579,Let me ask you one question.
1983.82-15,4,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,3990.976,4000.103,That would be one factor which might be enough to establish probable cause.
1983.82-15,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4011.3,4012.331,Assume all that.
1983.82-15,4,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,4027.17,4038.948,--Certainly the case law has said that and I have not heard any constitutional arguments that have said that that is not the correct analysis.
1983.82-15,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4038.948,4047.944,There is another proposition announced in a good many opinions that the knowledge of one officer involved in an operation is the knowledge of all.
1983.82-15,4,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,4047.944,4048.665,Yes.
1983.82-15,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4048.665,4050.916,I take Justice White's hypothetical.
1983.82-15,4,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,4070.989,4072.391,No.
1983.82-15,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4073.449,4074.03,I see.
1983.82-15,4,21738,donna_l_zeegers,,4075.692,4076.121,Right.
1983.82-15,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4076.121,4076.772,"Thank you, counsel."
