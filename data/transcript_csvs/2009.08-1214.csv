2009.08-1214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.621,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 08-1214, Granite Rock Company v. the International Brotherhood of Teamsters."
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,8.915,13.958,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves two questions."
2009.08-1214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,52.364,53.428,"It's a tort action, right?"
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,53.428,62.939,--It is a tort action by being structured as inducement and interference.
2009.08-1214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,73.713,75.444,I suppose -- grounded in contract.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,88.473,110.696,"--Your Honor, 301(a) provides jurisdiction if there's a suit for a breach -- if there's a suit for violation of a contract, and that can be between a nonparty and a party, and then the contract is between the union and the employer."
2009.08-1214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,110.696,115.914,I don't see how somebody who is not a party to the contract can violate the contract.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,121.599,129.972,"Mr. Chief Justice, the concept that we are advancing is the plain language of the statute."
2009.08-1214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,144.746,147.807,I suppose you can have tortious interference with the contract.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,155.677,159.659,--I can't imagine how you would.
2009.08-1214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,160.797,161.873,"Yes, I suppose that's--"
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,161.873,162.279,--kind of tort.
2009.08-1214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,162.279,169.587,"--tortious interference with -- what is it, the ability to enter into a contract, I think, is recognized in some jurisdictions."
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,169.587,170.819,That's -- that's cognizable.
2009.08-1214,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,209.884,212.614,"Well, then you could have sued on an agency claim, couldn't you?"
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,212.614,215.726,We did originally look at an agency claim.
2009.08-1214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,227.767,234.623,"Well, but I mean -- if you're coming up and saying, well, we have a principal-agent here, I could understand that, but that's I didn't think the question we are here to decide."
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,234.623,238.355,--The question to decide is whether there's a cause of action.
2009.08-1214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,238.355,240.745,On -- on the tortious interference as to whether or not that's under 301.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,245.354,250.256,"Your Honor, that argument really isn't new at all."
2009.08-1214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,251.036,251.489,Is it your briefs?
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,252.565,253.704,--It is in our briefs.
2009.08-1214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,260.703,268.246,"Well, but the -- the basic question is -- the Chief Justice began with it -- isn't this -- isn't this a tort action?"
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,286.733,296.322,--We take the position that the contract has within it the protection of the contract.
2009.08-1214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,318.42,324.793,So suddenly it's all a lot of things that would have been pre-empted to go to the board.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,360.025,360.948,--Your Honor--
2009.08-1214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,360.948,366.993,It would reproduce the situation that led all the Congresses and Presidents in the 1930s to stop it.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,366.993,375.377,"--Your Honor, the very essence of section 301 was to deal with midterm contract strikes."
2009.08-1214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,375.377,377.861,"Yes, that's right, and they said: Here's how we'll deal with that."
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,402.369,409.583,"Your Honor, what you have just described in terms of the impact on labor relations is exactly what we are focused on here."
2009.08-1214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,420.985,428.076,You are not arguing us creating Federal common law for tortious interference.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,434.026,444.445,"--We originally made the argument that they were -- they were the moving party, the undisclosed principal, that actually caused the contract to come into existence."
2009.08-1214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,450.131,451.113,So you've given up the agency argument?
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,451.113,455.142,We abandoned it only with regard to formation.
2009.08-1214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,475.852,482.677,"Well, it seems to me the strongest argument you have is that this tortious interference is pre-empted under State law."
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,502.135,504.056,This Court would--
2009.08-1214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,504.056,506.15,"The circuits have said that, but we haven't said that."
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,507.227,515.178,"--Your Honor, with all due respect, I think this cause of action would clearly be pre-empted under Allis-Chalmers and subsequent decisions."
2009.08-1214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,515.178,515.365,"No, no."
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,523.55,533.14,"In Allis-Chalmers, the Court did address the pre-emption doctrine and indicated that it would extend to torts."
2009.08-1214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,533.14,539.901,But -- but it did not -- it did not include interference with a -- with a contractual relation.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,545.193,547.022,"No, Your Honor, I think you're correct, but--"
2009.08-1214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,547.022,554.911,"Allis-Chalmers involved the two parties to the contract, a tort claim by one party to the contract against the other party to the contract, right?"
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,554.911,556.065,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1214,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.065,560.86,And this involves a tort claim by one party to the contract against a third party.
2009.08-1214,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,564.296,572.072,It -- it would seem to me that one of your strongest points is that this is pre empted by State law.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,580.71,588.52,"Your Honor, we have taken the strong position that it is pre-empted by 301."
2009.08-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,606.962,609.586,"Well, what is -- what is the contractual issue?"
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,615.879,624.735,The issue would be whether the action of engaging in the strike violates the nostrike clause of the collective bargaining agreement.
2009.08-1214,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,624.735,625.811,Is there any dispute about that?
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,625.811,628.826,I think there is a dispute about that.
2009.08-1214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,636.18,640.505,How is that issue still alive?
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,652.738,653.986,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,653.986,656.767,Did anybody appeal that order or challenge it?
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,656.767,657.047,Yes.
2009.08-1214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,670.917,688.052,"So did -- but how -- if you lost in your appeal to the Ninth Circuit and the contract is effective July 2nd, what issue remains for anybody to decide with respect to contract formation?"
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,688.052,688.847,We--
2009.08-1214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,688.847,696.186,Because there has been a final adjudication of the question of the effective date of the contract.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,696.186,696.86,--That's our position.
2009.08-1214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,700.732,710.883,So now the only question that appears to be extant in my mind is whether or not there was a breach of the no-strike clause.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,716.335,722.862,"We agree that that would go to arbitration, and it's scheduled to go to arbitration between the local and the company."
2009.08-1214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,734.124,738.952,"Yes, but what -- there is no doubt about the formation, just as Justice Sotomayor said."
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,776.029,776.407,--Your Honor--
2009.08-1214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,776.407,782.902,--to decide whether it does cover that event of July 2nd.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,788.433,796.364,"--Your Honor, the critical issue isn't the NLRB ruling, although that's going to have to be drawn upon."
2009.08-1214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,814.746,822.089,"But why is there -- is there anything, any question about formation, given that there is a contract?"
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,838.174,850.918,"--You're -- Justice Ginsburg, this is right at the center of the analysis in that we contend, the company, that there was a formation on July 2nd."
2009.08-1214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,861.041,861.338,--But why does it matter?
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,870.506,885.686,"--It's of critical importance which contract was formed, because there's a quid pro quo in labor law that's critical, and that is that you agree to arbitration in exchange for a no-strike clause."
2009.08-1214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,900.164,900.742,"So, why isn't--"
2009.08-1214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,900.742,915.658,"I suppose it's a question for your friends on the other side whether they think the ratification or the contract that was entered into in December that's effective in May -- if that makes them liable for violating the no-strike clause, right?"
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,915.658,927.402,"Mr. Chief Justice, there's a critical issue in labor relations, and that is clearly when it's ratified brings into effect the no-strike clause."
2009.08-1214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,928.935,931.759,So what happens if it's ratified retroactively?
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,934.165,935.338,--The no--
2009.08-1214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,935.338,937.069,"You want to say yes, right?"
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,937.069,944.21,"--Well, it would be -- it would be completely imprudent for to us say that in May the no-strike clause was in effect."
2009.08-1214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,953.424,955.612,--I think people are not communicating.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,1003.499,1012.947,"Your Honor, what's really central is the fact that when we signed in December, we signed the agreement of July 2nd."
2009.08-1214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1036.126,1036.953,Why is that a difficult issue?
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,1082.761,1082.761,Yes--
2009.08-1214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1082.761,1088.536,--anywhere that says it isn't -- I can't -- I can't even know what authority-what reasoning it would be.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,1088.536,1099.424,"--Justice Breyer, the second contract, if it's the contract as proposed by the other side, never would have had a clause with that much money in it because we would have had to absorb for the strike."
2009.08-1214,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1105.531,1116.243,"Am I correct that neither you, neither Granite Rock nor the local, thinks that the December collective bargaining agreement really was fully retroactive?"
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,1117.163,1117.537,--That's correct.
2009.08-1214,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1117.537,1131.923,"--it meant that the nostrike clause was in effect on the day when the old collective bargaining agreement expired, and you don't think that the new arbitration clause was in effect on the day when the old collective bargaining agreement expired, or do I not understand your positions?"
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,1131.923,1133.233,"Justice Alito, that's exactly right."
2009.08-1214,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1175.559,1180.714,But I keep going back to: That issue was decided.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,1211.388,1223.445,"--Justice Sotomayor, we take the position, much like you've indicated in your hypothetical or actual description, that the NLRB decision is definitive."
2009.08-1214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1274.997,1284.668,"If the contract had read, not simply ""claims arising under this contract"", but in addition said"
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,1297.926,1299.069,There would be no--
2009.08-1214,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1299.069,1299.896,It would go to the arbitrator.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,1299.896,1307.674,"--Justice Ginsburg, there's no question that the parties could agree to have formation arbitrated if they do so in a clear and unmistakable way."
2009.08-1214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1325.667,1329.008,I thought of another way of putting this because I am having a hard time with it.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,1372.067,1372.706,If--
2009.08-1214,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1372.706,1373.128,Okay.
2009.08-1214,0,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,1377.827,1393.804,"--Your Honor, if that had been, let's say, 4 years later, and we entered into a new contract willingly and getting the exchange, the no-strike clause for the arbitration, and that new contract said, this is going to deal with all past disputes, including prior contracts, fine."
2009.08-1214,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1522.892,1523.828,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,1529.124,1539.247,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: I'd like to turn to some questions that were just raised."
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1601.034,1607.672,"So, if there was a contract beginning May 22nd, then that included the no-strike clause?"
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,1607.672,1632.255,"The issue, Your -- Mr. Chief Justice, would be whether the parties when they entered into that agreement and made that entire agreement retroactive to May 1st of 2004, whether the parties intended that the retroactivity clause would apply for all purposes to any disputes arising to the parties."
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1632.801,1636.35,So -- so you don't think -- I guess this is following up on Justice Alito's question.
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,1638.83,1640.08,--Well--
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1640.08,1642.314,--for -- that would apply to July 2nd?
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,1642.314,1645.267,"--We contend that it would not, and here's the reason why."
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1646.858,1648.215,"Well, if it doesn't -- I'm sorry to interrupt you."
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,1658.163,1661.806,"--Well, I think that it's important for two reasons."
2009.08-1214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1725.698,1731.946,"And you say no, but what do you say about the -- but you say that the arbitration clause was intended to be retroactive."
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,1731.946,1733.007,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
2009.08-1214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1733.007,1735.85,But you say that the arbitration clause -- or do you?
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,1740.83,1741.192,"No, I think--"
2009.08-1214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1741.192,1742.861,Neither one is retroactive?
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,1742.861,1755.074,"--On July 2nd, as counsel has indicated, there is a real dispute, a continuing dispute, between the parties whether the contract was ratified on July 2nd."
2009.08-1214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1755.074,1755.78,"No, I understand that."
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,1776.144,1780.581,"We think that the -- there is only one contract, Your Honor."
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1790.17,1792.233,"Well -- I'm sorry, but that's the central issue."
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,1800.542,1816.394,"--Well, the fact that counsel has reiterated over and over again that this is a question of contract formation -- in fact there is no formation issue when the Court is being asked to decide whether there is an arbitral issue."
2009.08-1214,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1846.1,1855.392,"I thought that the union's initial position was that there was no agreement, and it refused to arbitrate."
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,1860.045,1862.513,"That is not correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1214,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1922.706,1927.595,I thought that at that time the union refused to arbitrate.
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,1927.595,1928.016,--No.
2009.08-1214,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1972.764,1986.038,"But, at least now that we have had the NLRB's -- the NLRB has weighed in and said that there was a contract as of July 2nd, why isn't that conclusive?"
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,1986.038,2008.265,"--We think that there's still an issue that is being sent to the arbitrator, the breach of contract and damages, but as a precursor to that, we contend that the issue never should have been litigated at all by the trial court about whether there was formation, because there was no question of formation at that time."
2009.08-1214,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2019.168,2026.803,"I thought you answered Justice Alito ""no"", but I thought his question was a very simple one."
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2037.051,2037.457,--Correct.
2009.08-1214,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2037.457,2042.359,It was made retroactive to a date before July.
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2043.766,2044.39,Yes.
2009.08-1214,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2044.39,2045.7,--and it covers a time frame.
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2045.7,2046.371,Uh-huh.
2009.08-1214,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2046.371,2055.601,The dispute between the parties is what that retroactivity under the contract means and which provisions are in effect or not.
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2068.13,2069.768,"Absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1214,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2089.184,2104.396,"So your answer to Justice Alito should have been: We are arguing that the no-strike clause was not in effect, but we do take the position that the arbitration clause was--"
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2104.396,2105.239,--That's--
2009.08-1214,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2105.239,2106.861,--made retroactive.
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2106.861,2108.191,"--That's exactly correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2108.581,2111.393,And what do you expect the arbitrator to do?
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2116.248,2116.575,--Yes.
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2116.575,2120.592,--the arbitrator is not going to decide whether the contract is there or not.
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2120.592,2121.294,He will not.
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2121.294,2124.09,And the contract has a no-strike clause.
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2124.09,2125.401,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2125.401,2139.722,"So you expect the arbitrator to say you get the benefit of the contract that lets me decide something, and even though there's a no-strike clause in the contract, you want the arbitrator to say that no-strike clause is not operative on July 2nd?"
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2139.722,2157.668,"We expect the arbitrator to take a look at the facts that existed on July 2nd and make a determination whether in fact at that point in time the union has a meritorious claim that the contract was not ratified, and therefore the no-strike clause--"
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2157.668,2158.884,Even though -- I'm sorry to interrupt you.
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2161.993,2162.851,--Absolutely.
2009.08-1214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2184.765,2190.545,"So in substance, you -- you think that the arbitrator would decide the issue of contract formation, whether--"
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2190.545,2190.872,No.
2009.08-1214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2190.872,2196.308,"--Well, I thought you just said that the arbitrator would decide whether there was an agreement on July the 2nd."
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2196.308,2199.385,The arbitrator would not be deciding contract formation.
2009.08-1214,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2230.105,2233.369,"Well, perhaps you can clarify one thing for me."
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2242.771,2243.336,Yes.
2009.08-1214,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2243.336,2266.92,"And you are trying to uncouple them, and so, even though one is quid pro quo for the other, you would say the union wants to keep what favors it, that is the arbitration clause, but reject what favors the employer, that is the no-strike clause."
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2276.993,2283.848,"Yes, I -- I think this Court has addressed that very issue, Justice Ginsburg, in Drake Bakeries."
2009.08-1214,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2314.69,2317.298,"Well, they're not in all circumstances, but will you respond to your opponent's argument?"
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2323.861,2328.763,"When they signed the agreement, Your Honor, they absolutely did get the benefit of it."
2009.08-1214,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.638,2334.621,If they had the benefit of the no-strike clause--
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2334.621,2334.949,--in violation of the collective bargaining agreement.
2009.08-1214,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2334.949,2337.885,--then any subsequent strike would have violated the contract?
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2337.885,2338.337,Absolutely.
2009.08-1214,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.242,2342.931,"Well, there was a subsequent strike."
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2342.931,2344.6,"--There was not, Your Honor."
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2345.852,2347.49,Is that an issue for the arbitrator?
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2354.925,2359.11,--I'm not sure that I understand your question.
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2360.844,2365.559,"Well, you say there was no strike, and I -- I thought the other side said there was."
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2365.559,2368.133,--There absolutely was a strike.
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2370.68,2371.257,Right.
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2371.257,2376.739,"And it continued, actually, through September 22nd of 2004."
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2379.91,2385.813,"Right, but their position is that there was a contract on July 2nd that included a no-strike clause--"
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2385.813,2386.471,Yes.
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2386.471,2387.251,--that you violated.
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2387.251,2387.939,That's correct.
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2387.939,2388.686,Okay.
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2392.407,2413.476,"Our defense to the allegation of the no-strike clause before the arbitrator would be that at that time the parties had not ratified the agreement, and that ratification did not occur until August 22nd, which also appears as a concession by the employer in paragraph 27 of their third amended complaint."
2009.08-1214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2417.365,2423.799,"But that would be an issue for the -- you think that that would be an issue for the arbitrator to decide, whether there was a contract ratified on July the 2nd?"
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2423.799,2425.94,"Or August 22nd, yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-1214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2425.94,2430.404,"And if the arbitrator thought that it was in existence on July 2nd, then--"
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2430.404,2431.219,Then--
2009.08-1214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2431.219,2432.17,--you would lose?
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2432.17,2433.827,"--I think that's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1214,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2433.827,2436.214,So that's an issue of contract formation; is it not?
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2438.792,2440.118,If I may finish?
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2440.118,2440.68,"Oh, sure."
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2440.68,2450.597,In substance it's contract formation if you can place yourself back in time on July 2nd or August 22nd.
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2467.511,2475.838,"And that -- and that position depends upon your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, that you are severing arbitration and the no-strike obligation?"
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2475.838,2478.649,"Under Drake Bakeries, we do not believe that we are severing at all."
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2495.296,2496.673,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1214,1,38780,robert_bonsall,,2496.673,2497.126,Thank you.
2009.08-1214,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2497.126,2520.07,Mr. Nussbaum.
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2520.07,2531.593,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three basic points that I would like to discuss with the Court this morning with regard to the section 301 issue."
2009.08-1214,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2573.155,2582.997,Do you take the position that the cause of action for interference with a contract has been pre-empted insofar as State law is concerned?
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2582.997,2586.899,"That's, of course, not an issue in this case because it was never attempted--"
2009.08-1214,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2586.899,2587.835,What is your position on that point?
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2587.835,2599.678,--The law in most of the circuits is that any case which involves the interpretation of a contract is pre-empted.
2009.08-1214,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2601.456,2615.015,"Do you -- do you -- does your client take the position that that law is correct, that the Federal law has pre-empted State law actions for interference with -- with contract relations?"
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2615.015,2615.561,--Yes.
2009.08-1214,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2615.561,2616.419,All right.
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2634.505,2636.333,"No, that is not what I believe happened."
2009.08-1214,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2636.333,2638.599,"Well, isn't that the effect of your argument here?"
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2638.599,2639.894,"No, I do not believe it is."
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2679.298,2680.908,Not against the international?
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2680.908,2682.375,--Not against the international.
2009.08-1214,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2682.862,2706.243,"If it's true -- if it's true, which we can take for purposes -- for the current purpose, that the international really did induce the local to continue the strike, you said there's no action in State court because that's preempted."
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2734.933,2735.759,"No, I disagree."
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2780.961,2788.894,"Counsel, I'd like your broader perspective as a representative of the international, because I think it's an important issue of labor policy."
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2805.842,2807.792,I'm not -- I'm sorry -- I'm not sure I understand the question.
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2807.792,2817.006,I think 301 -- I think whatever -- I don't think there should be a noman's land between you can bring your action under 301 and it's pre-empted by 301.
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2829.613,2834.64,"Let me -- let me try to answer your question, as I'm -- as I'm understanding it."
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2863.442,2867.112,"So it was pre-empted by 301, and they cannot bring it under 301?"
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2867.112,2870.987,--Not a Federal court claim under 301.
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2870.987,2871.455,Right.
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2871.455,2877.031,"A State claim, a State tort action under 301, would be pre-empted."
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2913.484,2921.17,"And so if Granite Rock brought this claim in State court, you would say it's pre-empted by 301?"
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2921.17,2923.354,"Yes, but we'd be in exactly the same position."
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2923.354,2929.102,"And then, if they turned around and brought it in Federal court under 301, you would say, no, there is no cause of action under 301?"
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2929.102,2930.572,"Yes, you would get to the--"
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2930.572,2930.884,Okay.
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2930.884,2933.695,"--You would get to the same result, and the process is exactly the same."
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2933.695,2935.754,So it is in a noman's land.
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2939.33,2956.106,"It -- it -- for tortious interference, no, you cannot -- you cannot bring that claim, but what I was saying before is, it doesn't leave them remediless, even with regard to a claim against the international because a charge could be filed--"
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2956.106,2957.903,They could always go to the NLRB--
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,2957.903,2971.427,"--under 8(b)(3), and the board would decide, the -- the conduct in this context, and the board is always looking at the context of it, is this something which is prohibited, something which is protected, something which is unregulated?"
2009.08-1214,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2975.16,2976.177,What remedies -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-1214,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2976.177,2977.332,What is the remedy--
2009.08-1214,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2977.332,2987.548,"Just before you finish, Chief, is it all right if you -- I'm not quite clear on how this pre-emption works, and I perhaps didn't have it right."
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3025.47,3028.205,I -- I think perhaps we are saying the same thing--
2009.08-1214,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3028.205,3046.446,"No, no, because I think that your response to the Chief Justice's question, which is why I became uncertain, is that it is the LMRA -- not the LMRA at all that pre-empts tort actions and State activities that interfere with labor relations, as this might."
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3057.973,3061.377,--Let me try because I think I understand why I confused you.
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3071.761,3074.027,--In State court or in Federal court?
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3074.027,3075.56,In -- in State court.
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3075.56,3076.964,But you bring it in Federal court?
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3076.964,3082.181,"No -- well, no, it would have been -- it would have been pre-empted in Federal court also."
2009.08-1214,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3109.029,3114.512,"--May I ask you, what is the remedy for an unfair labor practice?"
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3115.869,3116.555,Yes.
2009.08-1214,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3119.008,3119.694,Right.
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3119.694,3120.755,And then a make-whole remedy.
2009.08-1214,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3120.755,3122.112,A make-whole remedy--
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3122.112,3122.443,Yes.
2009.08-1214,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3122.443,3123.395,--for -- okay.
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3123.395,3124.003,Yes.
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3124.003,3133.063,"What would the makewhole -- I gather a cease-and-desist wouldn't make any sense because this is over, but what would the makewhole remedy entail?"
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3133.063,3148.527,"It would have to be a proof of damages that resulted from the unfair labor practice, from the unfair conduct, which, in this situation, would have been the interference into the bargaining process."
2009.08-1214,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3163.646,3181.544,"So you -- while saying that there's no cause of action for this tort claim, you nonetheless say that the tort claim can be considered an unfair labor practice by the labor board."
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3183.416,3200.784,"Because what Congress -- what Congress did in 301 was to create limited jurisdiction for one type of claim and one type of claim only, violation of contract, breach of contract, an action against the party that has the obligations under it."
2009.08-1214,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3215.061,3218.778,"But if it's outside 301, where does pre-emption come from, Garmon?"
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3218.778,3223.557,"The pre-emption -- well, in this case--"
2009.08-1214,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3223.557,3225.741,If I could interrupt just for a moment?
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3239.066,3242.61,"--Well, both of them end up pre-empting a State law tort."
2009.08-1214,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3243.437,3246.639,"But if you say both of them, then we're back where we started."
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3254.152,3265.462,"--No, it pre-empts exactly for the purpose that this is an issue that should be decided by the regulatory agency, which Congress entrusted with making exactly these decisions."
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3289.559,3292.527,"Well, but that applies in 301."
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3299.601,3309.163,"It's -- well, again, the claim that they brought in Federal court was not preempted."
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3317.61,3318.736,I understand that.
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3318.736,3319.251,End of it.
2009.08-1214,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3338.211,3348.537,"Has -- has the board, in fact, declared a party who is not a party to the labor contract guilty of an unfair labor practice in prior cases?"
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3348.537,3355.112,The Paperworkers case that we cite -- the answer to your question is: I'm not aware of a case.
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3436.405,3437.653,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1214,2,38187,peter_d_nussbaum,,3437.653,3438.542,Thank you.
2009.08-1214,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3438.542,3441.307,"Mr. Mathiason, you have 5 minutes remaining."
2009.08-1214,3,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,3441.307,3452.238,"Categorically, Your Honor, the NLRB has no jurisdiction over this case."
2009.08-1214,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3467.621,3468.015,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1214,3,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,3469.684,3477.432,"It's footnote 18 of our reply brief, and we recount the history that was litigated both at the Ninth Circuit and beyond."
2009.08-1214,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3481.351,3484.942,"Well, that may be, but then you might have -- then you'd have a remedy in State court."
2009.08-1214,3,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,3543.077,3553.901,"--Justice Breyer, there is a fundamental aspect of that that's just not right, and that is that the conduct involved here was causing a violation of a contract."
2009.08-1214,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3602.614,3619.515,"Do you seriously think that if that becomes a problem, that the NLRB won't declare it an unfair labor practice, or if they don't, that they won't go to Congress and say: There is a no-man's land; now give a remedy like you did in 301?"
2009.08-1214,3,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,3658.607,3667.369,"Your -- Your Honor, I think it's well-established this is not an unfair labor practice, because you don't have jurisdiction under section 8(b)(3)."
2009.08-1214,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3692.923,3694.405,Why -- why isn't it under 8(b)(3)?
2009.08-1214,3,25707,garry_g_mathiason,,3701.073,3702.668,"Well, it is not an exclusive representative."
2009.08-1214,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3768.344,3769.233,"Thank you, counsel."
