2010.09-834,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.246,"We will hear argument next in Case 09-834, Kasten v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation."
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,10.447,13.773,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-834,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,71.751,76.107,Let me give you this example.
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,116.669,118.904,"I think it would, Your Honor."
2010.09-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,129.994,149.874,"So you mean that if the Government says you've got to file a complaint with us by either calling us or submitting something in writing, and at a cocktail party a worker goes up to a Government employee in that agency, and says, you know, my company is violating the law."
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,151.672,164.805,"I don't -- you know, I don't believe that that's -- in the context of a non-work environment, Your Honor, I would note that, I don't know exactly the answer to the Court's question, to be honest."
2010.09-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,164.805,174.164,"The reason I'm asking that question is related to Justice Alito's question, which is, what does filing a complaint mean?"
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,180.474,184.392,Filing means directing it to somebody who can do something about it.
2010.09-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,186.689,193.981,"Well, at a cocktail party that employee may be there on personal time, but when he goes back to work the next morning he could do something."
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,194.858,195.95,"Well, it may be."
2010.09-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,204.276,211.553,"So what you are doing is he is estopping the Government from saying, the only way that you can file a complaint with us is to do it in writing."
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,223.372,234.821,"--If the person is directing the complaint to the Government and communicates that to the responsible party who can do something about it, I think that they are filing a complaint, Your Honor."
2010.09-834,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,234.821,244.815,"It's one thing to say that filing doesn't necessarily mean that something is written, although that's usually what the word means, isn't it?"
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,244.815,247.861,It can often mean a written communication.
2010.09-834,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,247.861,249.066,Are you filing your comments right now?
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,249.066,250.704,"I think I am, Your Honor."
2010.09-834,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,250.704,251.016,You are?
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,252.174,253.063,I am directing them to the Court.
2010.09-834,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,253.063,254.717,That's the ordinary usage of the word.
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,260.949,267.683,"Well, Your Honor, I would say there are no formal requirements for the filing."
2010.09-834,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,267.683,280.628,"If that's the law and the employee gets fired and the employee says, well, this was done in retaliation for my having filed an FSLA complaint three weeks ago, and the employer says what complaint?"
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,295.778,299.576,"You might have a trial, Your Honor, depending on the circumstances."
2010.09-834,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,328.842,329.782,With whom?
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,329.782,335.936,With the responsible party who can do something about it.
2010.09-834,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.248,338.716,Well--
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,338.716,341.356,--that Kevin Kasten doesn't have an office.
2010.09-834,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,354.988,363.111,"Why do you feel the need to go beyond, say, what the AFL-CIO identifies as a normal oral failing -- filing?"
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,412.826,420.449,"The grievance process, Your Honor, a grievance process is a formal process, and so I wouldn't compare the average workplace--"
2010.09-834,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,420.449,420.87,All right.
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,435.364,449.388,"--Your Honor, in the general proposition we would be accepting of the Scrivener rule that the Court adopted in the '70s, that is that the filing of a charge includes those things that happened orally prior to and around the time of the filing of the charge."
2010.09-834,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,451.419,452.936,"Yes, we are talking about a filing."
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,482.89,486.813,"In terms of the formality of requirements, the Court may adopt formal requirements."
2010.09-834,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,493.917,498.011,"There is a word ""filing"" in the AFL-CIO statute as well."
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,507.444,513.599,"--In terms of the procedure that they adopt, Your Honor, that may be an acceptable procedure."
2010.09-834,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,517.316,520.002,And there wasn't -- he didn't invoke the grievance procedure.
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,520.002,520.954,He didn't--
2010.09-834,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.954,523.516,"In this case, he didn't invoke the grievance procedure."
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,523.516,524.28,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-834,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,524.28,532.808,"So that would keep you out, if that were the test, that you have to formally invoke the grievance procedure."
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,556.579,561.579,"I don't think I am doing that, Your Honor, with all due respect."
2010.09-834,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,561.579,565.139,Is there another provision where the word file is used to mean something other than a writing.
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,565.139,571.776,"It means, according to the first enforcement action back in 1961, it means submit or lodge, Your Honor."
2010.09-834,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.389,602.746,--That's -- that's the problem.
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,692.431,697.317,"--Your Honor, I'm just looking at the statutory language -- file ""any complaint""."
2010.09-834,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,701.926,705.034,"What does file -- what is the meaning of ""filed""?"
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,705.034,707.332,"--It means to submit or lodge, Your Honor."
2010.09-834,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.332,711.125,So you are filing your argument right now.
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,713.452,714.451,I think--
2010.09-834,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.451,716.249,That -- that -- that is absurd.
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,720.963,728.774,"--If I submit or lodge, that is the -- and it's directed at a particular -- I have to be asserting a statutory right."
2010.09-834,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,728.774,729.82,"Well, I'd like to go back to the question--"
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,729.82,730.666,I am not asserting--
2010.09-834,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,730.666,733.445,--I would like to go back to the question Justice Scalia filed just earlier.
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,766.962,768.709,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-834,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,779.223,780.818,All have said that intracompany complaints--
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,780.818,785.423,--Intracompany complaints; that is true as well in the Sixth Circuit.
2010.09-834,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,834.651,837.306,I'm not sure that's true.
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,859.562,869.435,"Well, Your Honor, if you have made the phone call and started the process I think you have instituted a proceeding."
2010.09-834,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.396,886.397,Not if it's never instituted.
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,891.955,892.613,--There's a--
2010.09-834,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.613,896.282,"So if you make an informal complaint and it doesn't go any further, and they ask --"
2010.09-834,0,31260,james_h_kaster,,915.897,919.77,"--Well, Your Honor, I'm going to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal."
2010.09-834,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,919.77,921.521,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,941.357,943.276,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-834,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,979.182,980.684,"This is one of the oldest, though, isn't it."
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,980.684,981.495,--Yes.
2010.09-834,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,981.979,983.714,Is it the very oldest?
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,989.961,991.384,"--Justice Scalia, it's not the older."
2010.09-834,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1010.969,1013.218,What -- what is the language in those statutes?
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1016.2,1019.668,"The language in the NLRA is ""file charges"" or ""give testimony""."
2010.09-834,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1031.849,1036.412,"Are you -- you -- are you urging that if you just tell a coworker, that that's enough?"
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1047.393,1050.876,"--It wouldn't under this particular statute, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1081.627,1081.783,Yes.
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1118.563,1122.669,"--Justice Breyer, I don't think the Government has any objection to that standard."
2010.09-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1123.827,1124.965,But I would like more than that.
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1139.679,1150.675,--I -- I think the kind of indicia or formality you are talking about are signs that the employer has submitted to his employer an assertion of statutory rights under the FLSA.
2010.09-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1166.308,1166.636,All right.
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1176.069,1185.018,"--That the employer has -- the employee has indicated to his employer, someone in supervisory authority, that he is asserting statutory rights under the FLSA."
2010.09-834,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1185.018,1188.672,"So if he just says to the employer,"
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1196.713,1199.041,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's a difficult question."
2010.09-834,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1201.947,1230.545,"Yes, I know, but the idea -- one of the objections to your position is that it's going to be very hard to figure out in any particular case what is a filing an oral complaint under the FLSA, because one, it's got to be reconstructed, unlike the situation where you had have a government agency that's doing it, or you have a written complaint; and second of all, it's -- it's unclear perhaps for the employer to know that he's being charged with a violation of the FLSA."
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1230.545,1235.654,"But that question comes up in every case, whether the complaint is written or oral to the Government or an employer."
2010.09-834,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1236.621,1246.834,"Well, if it's written -- if it's written, you have got a document that people can look like -- look at, whether it's the NLRB or a court, that -- that they can look at and say, yes, this is a -- an assertion of a violation."
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1246.834,1254.097,--If I write down on a form promulgated by my employer I don't like where the time clocks are or I think the time--
2010.09-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1254.097,1254.909,--But it's on a form.
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1299.89,1316.4,"--Justice Breyer, I'm sorry if -- if -- if it the formulation I have given you is not helpful, but in -- in these statutes where either by expressed language or regulation, so for instance, the Surface Transportation Assistance Act, and ADA or OSHA, the -- the language varies from regulation to regulation."
2010.09-834,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1320.616,1329.222,"Let me see if I can look, because in about 2 minutes you are going to hear, I suspect and the other side, say see, see, we told you, that's why you have to have it in writing."
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1329.222,1337.329,"--Again -- and agencies have put these in writing, so at footnote 6 on page, I think it's 16 of the Government's brief, we have the OSHA regulations."
2010.09-834,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1341.767,1345.562,It would really be helpful if you could just give us the rule that you think should apply.
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1355.665,1355.993,--I think--
2010.09-834,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1355.993,1357.79,Let me go back to the example I started out with.
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1372.5,1386.944,"--I think the test, Justice Alito, is whether the employee has submitted a complaint to his employer that has put the employer on notice that that employee is asserting statutory rights under the FLSA, claiming that he is legally entitled to something he is not receiving."
2010.09-834,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1402.015,1407.779,"Well, what if he goes to the boss and says, boss, you ought to do something, that railing is -- is pretty dangerous over there."
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1407.779,1408.61,Again--
2010.09-834,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1408.61,1413.121,"Is the boss supposed to know, well, he is asserting statutory rights under the FLSA?"
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1413.121,1415.18,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I think there probably not."
2010.09-834,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1416.385,1417.477,That would not be filing a complaint?
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1417.477,1422.523,"--I mean, I think as a content case, which it is not, it's unlikely that that is."
2010.09-834,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1445.027,1445.635,What did he do?
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1458.18,1469.645,"If you credit his allegations, which you have to at this point, because the district court granted summary judgment on a legal ground, what Petitioner says he did is he went to his supervisor."
2010.09-834,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1503.068,1505.988,"Mr. Wall, I -- this is just a factual."
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1512.61,1521.574,"I think what the lower courts have said, and I think this makes sense, is that the question of whether a reasonable, objective person would have understood the employee to have submitted a claim complaint."
2010.09-834,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1528.804,1539.314,"In those circuits where they allow intercompany complaints that are oral, can you give me any sense of how often this leads to claim for retaliation?"
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1541.86,1544.734,"I can't, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-834,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1551.328,1552.108,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-834,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1552.108,1553.341,--Thank you.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1558.996,1560.526,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1574.393,1582.828,So why is it inherently unworkable here in any greater extent that it is unworkable in all of the other statutes where oral complaints are permitted?
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1592.967,1596.824,--I don't know that it is necessarily any worse in this particular context.
2010.09-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1614.286,1621.359,--This is the -- this was the Lochner era where they weren't even sure they could do this.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1630.667,1659.22,"--Well, I think you have to read their language as the way it was written and as the way they would have understood it at the time, which was to file any complaint, which as it would have been understood in '38 and frankly after that, when you file a complaint that usually entails some notion of formality and when you put it in the context of a specific provision where it is not only filing a complaint, but institute any proceeding, caused any proceeding to be instituted, justify any proceeding."
2010.09-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1659.22,1671.948,"What grievance -- would the bringing of a grievance, the example that Justice Breyer suggested, an employee goes to his union and says, they are violating the statute."
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1691.8,1699.907,"No, because a proceeding is understood and it's used consistently in the FLSA as an official action by a government agency."
2010.09-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1702.547,1704.625,"Then we have to address your second question, not the first."
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1709.465,1709.59,Right.
2010.09-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1711.527,1718.149,Would it work if they instituted a proceeding orally and the proceeding required itself to start orally?
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1718.149,1731.55,"I don't -- the truth is, if the employer envisions in its mind that it is instituting a proceeding, that's still not a proceeding within the meaning of what Congress meant in 1938."
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1757.148,1764.678,"But there is a protection built in, Mr. Phillips, it says it's criminal liability only if it's willful."
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1773.564,1786.745,"--Right, but the reality is that this Court held in the CIT case that the Court would not construe this statute broadly in order to expose people to potential criminal liabilities."
2010.09-834,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.745,1790.258,Wouldn't any retaliatory action be willful?
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1797.227,1800.694,The question is whether the violation is willful.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1814.236,1814.641,Right.
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1814.641,1816.232,Nothing to do with retaliation.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1816.232,1822.765,"No, I -- well, it does have something to do with retaliation, but, Justice Ginsburg, it seems to me it's all of a piece, though."
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1848.596,1857.076,"Do you know, how common is it to have criminal prosecutions under this section of the Fair Labor Standards Act?"
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1857.076,1865.121,"I don't believe -- I mean, it's not a null set, but I don't believe it's a particularly, I don't think it's a large number of proceedings."
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1883.395,1919.785,"I thought that the whole idea of this statute is to protect the workers, and I would like you to address particularly the amici's point, that this statute in 1938 affected people -- many were illiterate, they couldn't write a complaint, many were immigrants who weren't familiar with the language, for that universe of people, wouldn't Congress have meant that all complaints are okay?"
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1919.785,1939.886,"Let me start by saying, first of all, even if the FLSA has broadly a pro employee protective purpose, it's still important to recognize that the retaliation provision we are talking about here specifically did not provide a cause of action, a private cause of action until 1977."
2010.09-834,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.218,1986.899,"Your case would be a lot easier if you didn't try to have it both ways, to say, number one, it only applies to filing a complaint with the Government."
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1995.427,1997.209,"I will take the former argument, Your Honor."
2010.09-834,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.209,2002.095,--Why don't you give a break to the illiterate and let them file oral complaints with the Government?
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2002.095,2019.464,"Well, my guess is the truth is they will be able to file oral complaints with the Government because, the only thing that is left open is the precise hypothetical you gave, Justice Scalia, where you make an oral complaint and nothing gets instituted in those circumstances."
2010.09-834,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.848,2040.33,"Suppose it says we won't necessarily institute a proceeding, but we will regard it as a complaint?"
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2040.33,2048.859,"I -- I mean, my own view is the better way of reading -- that is a much closer case, I will concede that, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-834,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2059.168,2063.992,"Justice Scalia's hypothetical, unless I am misremembering, I think, is very common."
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2072.786,2073.301,Right.
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2107.21,2111.348,How does it work with respect to the more recent statutes?
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2117.299,2121.128,"In terms of retaliation, Justice Ginsburg?"
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2121.128,2121.393,Yes.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2130.592,2145.538,"No, the vast majority of those statutes talk about any action that -- opposing a practice, and therefore they deal with a lot of intracorporate activities, and obviously at some point there is an issue as to sort of what the employer's intent is and how far it got up the ladder--"
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2145.538,2156.079,"But is it -- so in those cases I think you are quite right, intracorporate complaints count as opposing any practice."
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2166.764,2183.863,"--Well, I suspect that issue comes up almost every day, and it is a problem; but it's a problem that Congress made a judgment that we would rather go ahead and allow those matters to be litigated; and language that is very expansive in protecting employees from retaliation."
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2220.783,2223.252,What about Justice Ginsburg's question?
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2223.252,2224.332,I'm sorry?
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2224.332,2225.237,What about her question?
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2228.859,2232.014,"And Congress must have recognized that fact, and--"
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2232.014,2238.855,"Well, if they did, isn't it reasonable to think that they would have included in filing, in such circumstances, oral filing?"
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2238.855,2245.055,"--No, because if under those circumstances when you're going to impose criminal sanctions on somebody, you're going to say we are not going to do that."
2010.09-834,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2245.055,2246.49,"But your easier answer is,"
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2250.663,2253.159,"I mean, I am perfectly comfortable with that."
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2253.159,2257.596,"No, that -- your problem is -- that in front of us, do we have to decide that now?"
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2261.671,2263.203,"The -- I mean, the truth is--"
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2263.203,2264.404,--You may not want to give up your first point.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2264.404,2266.623,"--Well, I don't want to give up either of the points, actually."
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.196,2274.586,Right.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2302.057,2307.271,"--Well, I don't know that there's 50 or 60 years of allowing oral complaints--"
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2307.271,2308.004,Maybe it's 30 years.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2308.117,2308.882,--to be in the -- in the private context.
2010.09-834,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2321.516,2324.374,Do we owe any deference to the Government's position on this point?
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2324.374,2327.341,--I would not give any deference to the Government's position.
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.952,2332.933,"Well, Chevron deference would depend on an intent."
2010.09-834,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2341.711,2349.721,"Well, I mean, regardless of whether we do, why -- why don't you think we -- we have to give any deference, Chevron -- Chevron deference."
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2349.721,2350.832,"--Well, I mean I -- yes."
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2351.425,2351.924,--Why?
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2351.924,2359.642,--because this is not a matter that has been allocated to either the EEOC or the Secretary of Labor to administer and to adopt regulations.
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2359.642,2360.391,How do we know?
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2380.585,2397.093,"But Justice Breyer, that would strike me as a more persuasive argument if Congress hadn't -- hadn't delegated to the Secretary of Labor specific rulemaking authority with respect to specific provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and does not have a similar provision in connection with section 215(a)."
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.093,2399.936,But not everything has to be done through formal rules.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2403.323,2403.652,Right.
2010.09-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2426.939,2430.421,So we should give it no weight at all?
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2430.421,2432.172,--I would give it no weight at all.
2010.09-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2434.095,2434.657,Not even Skidmore?
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2434.657,2438.528,"--its persuasive weight, its persuasive weight as applied on a private side is nonexistent."
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2442.23,2442.404,Why?
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2464.519,2465.018,"--Well, it might be--"
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2465.018,2466.503,--and get that to work out all right--
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2466.503,2467.533,"--Right, but we don't have--"
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2467.533,2478.624,"--in which case you would be left, if you are going to say that might work, then -- the you are left with the simple argument that you don't think that this statute means to apply to complaints to an employer, written or oral?"
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2478.624,2488.976,"--Well, I -- I think the answer to that question is you don't have anywhere near the 50 years of practice dealing with the specific hypothetical you posed, Justice Breyer."
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2488.976,2492.334,Would you accept -- you think -- that a tenable interpretation?
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2507.596,2509.468,"I mean, I don't think that's the most natural way--"
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2509.468,2509.971,"No, it isn't."
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2509.971,2510.533,--to read this statute.
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2513.064,2514.327,"Yes, I agree with you."
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2514.327,2520.09,"--that a -- that an oral complaint is -- is not sufficient, but if -- but I don't think you have to decide that issue."
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2530.727,2534.459,"That isn't even brought up in the brief in opposition, right?"
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2536.097,2539.533,--It wasn't brought up specifically in the brief in opposition.
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2556.809,2562.213,"On the ground itself, is there anything in the legislative history of the statute that says it's limited to the government?"
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2562.213,2584.221,"--Well, the -- yes -- if you go back to the legislative history there is a colloquy between the two Senators, and I recognize some members of the Court are unenthusiastic -- but -- but you know, in that colloquy, they talk about malicious complaints, and it seems to me malicious in that context is talking about where you have essentially defamed your employer through a government agency."
2010.09-834,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2584.221,2584.611,That could be.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2598.525,2608.273,"Well, I think if you are going back and trying to figure out what the Congress of 1938 had in mind, the best way to do that is to look at the language chosen and the company that that language keeps."
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2635.747,2640.918,"How would it -- how would it relate to, say, an equal pay complaint?"
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2644.01,2644.525,--Right.
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2645.164,2647.476,--Labor Standards Act.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2654.861,2654.986,Right.
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2654.986,2664.014,So a -- a worker just complains about the denial of equal pay to the supervisor.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2668.748,2681.617,I have no doubt that an employee under those circumstances if -- if discharged would be able to make a claim under Title VII of retaliation for that particular conduct.
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2681.617,2703.204,"--And there's been -- you said there was no evidence of the government for 60 years -- but there has been some 30 years or more experience under Title VII of the statutes, with oral complaints to the employer as being sufficient to ground a retaliation claim."
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2703.204,2704.062,Right.
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2718.011,2719.368,But it really -- it starts in 1970.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2719.368,2719.992,--I'm sorry?
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2719.992,2722.788,It starts in the 1970s.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2722.788,2736.502,"To be sure, Justice Ginsburg, but the -- but the -- this statute was enacted in 1938, and it was enacted as fairly radical and made an -- an initial incursion from protecting people from rehabilitation."
2010.09-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2743.232,2747.152,How long have collective bargaining arbitration agreements been in existence.
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2747.152,2751.542,"Since the Federal Arbitration Act -- well, it actually probably predates the Federal Arbitration Act."
2010.09-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2751.542,2752.338,How old?
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2752.338,2755.789,"Oh, it would have been back around the same period of time, in the 1930s."
2010.09-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2755.789,2774.03,"Do you think that when Congress wrote or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter, that they intended to exclude that proceeding and intended to exclude people who testified in that proceeding about a violation of the statute?"
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2774.03,2774.408,Yes.

2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2795.791,2811.704,"Well, I mean, that -- in the brief we identified a number of places where Congress uses the word ""proceedings"", and every place where they use the word ""proceedings"" they have in mind an official Government activity."
2010.09-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2830.995,2834.571,"Then we're back to if Congress meant filing any complaints, either oral or in writing."

2010.09-834,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2837.554,2853.218,"--That Congress's intent was not to protect a worker who publicly took an oath in front of an arbitrator and testified about a violation of law, that they would not have considered that retaliatory under the statute."
2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2853.218,2863.014,--I do not believe they would have regarded that as retaliatory under the statute because of the fact that the way this is all set up is the -- and the -- it's just the narrowness of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2954.477,2954.789,Sure.
2010.09-834,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2954.789,2961.863,It seems to me you are saying the only complaint that counts is the one to the Government.

2010.09-834,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3037.162,3043.253,"I mean, part of it depends on whether the Fair Labor Standards Act applies to Federal employees."
2010.09-834,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3054.561,3055.747,Okay.
