1961.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,576.691,578.879,Is it a more serious crime Miss Motley?
1961.32,0,19529,constance_b_motley,,578.879,578.939,Well --
1961.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,578.939,579.662,Under state law?
1961.32,0,19529,constance_b_motley,,579.662,580.064,That is --
1961.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,580.064,581.475,It's a more --
1961.32,0,19529,constance_b_motley,,581.475,583.15,"Well, more reprehensible --"
1961.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,583.15,583.279,-- (Voice Overlap) perhaps with --
1961.32,0,19529,constance_b_motley,,583.279,584.817,-- sort of a crime.
1961.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,584.817,585.746,No more serious penalty --
1961.32,0,19529,constance_b_motley,,585.746,586.435,That's right.
1961.32,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,586.435,587.487,-- at least theoretically as to both.
1961.32,0,19529,constance_b_motley,,587.487,589.23,That's right.
1961.32,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,589.23,592.766,Do they have the death penalty for burglary with intent to steal?
1961.32,0,19529,constance_b_motley,,592.766,595.935,"Yes, sir, that's right."
1961.32,1,25793,george_d_mentz,,2398.258,2405.468,"Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Members of the Court."
1961.32,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2495.696,2496.518,General Mentz.
1961.32,1,25793,george_d_mentz,,2496.518,2496.537,Yes.
1961.32,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2496.537,2497.356,Before you leave that.
1961.32,1,25793,george_d_mentz,,2503.016,2503.613,That's correct sir.
1961.32,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2503.613,2510.418,And that was breaking and entering an inhabited dwelling in the night time for the -- to ravish.
1961.32,1,25793,george_d_mentz,,2510.418,2511.475,That's correct sir.
1961.32,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2511.475,2519.071,"Well now, is ravish -- to ravish a felony under your Alabama law?"
1961.32,1,25793,george_d_mentz,,2519.071,2520.692,"Rape is, sir -- yes sir."
1961.32,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2520.692,2522.505,But --
1961.32,1,25793,george_d_mentz,,2522.505,2522.692,And our statute (Voice Overlap) --
1961.32,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2522.692,2525.845,Your statute says -- to steal or to commit a felony.
1961.32,1,25793,george_d_mentz,,2525.845,2526.711,Commit a felony.
1961.32,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2527.263,2529.173,"Ravish is not a felony, is it?"
1961.32,1,25793,george_d_mentz,,2529.173,2531.724,"Well, rape is a felony, Your Honor."
1961.32,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2531.724,2540.555,"I suppose there's good many other felonies too, but is ravish mentioned as a felony?"
1961.32,1,25793,george_d_mentz,,2540.555,2542.572,"In that time, no sir."
1961.32,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2542.572,2549.253,"So it's arguable that this indictment was technically defective, isn't it at least?"
1961.32,1,25793,george_d_mentz,,2549.253,2562.394,"Sir, our indictments to have been -- that has been accepted by the Supreme Court as an acceptable indictment under the statute."
1961.32,2,19529,constance_b_motley,,6190.298,6191.447,May it please the Court.
1961.32,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6200.547,6201.343,Thank you.
1961.32,2,19529,constance_b_motley,,6201.343,6201.512,And --
1961.32,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6201.512,6201.553,We will get it.
1961.32,2,19529,constance_b_motley,,6201.553,6209.132,"-- I just like to point to one page of that testimony, which is page 78, I guess (Voice Overlap) --"
