1984.84-277,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,92.01,"I think you may proceed whenever you are ready, Mr. Frankel."
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,92.01,95.712,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.43,182.401,"Mr. Frankel, I am concerned about your interpretation of the Court of Appeals' opinion."
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,213.455,220.543,"Your Honor, I think there are various ways the municipality could approach this problem."
1984.84-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.543,227.43,"Well, do you think that that opinion would permit the city to adopt the regulation that I suggest?"
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,227.43,230.113,"Very possibly, Your Honor."
1984.84-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,230.113,241.004,It isn't true that the Court of Appeals has required the city to permit unattended displays such as a creche.
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,241.004,252.895,"Your Honor, it is as true that there is such a requirement here as it was in Widmar against Vincent which has been applied by the Circuit to this case."
1984.84-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,303.744,313.369,Do you think that the display of a creche or a cross or something symbolic of that kind is symbolic speech?
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,313.369,314.436,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,367.921,376.192,"Well, I suppose if it is speech, we don't normally suppress it on the grounds that some people find it offensive, do we?"
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,376.192,389.184,"We don't normally, Your Honor, provided that you are dealing with a public forum where people are allowed to express themselves in the manner in question."
1984.84-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,389.184,391.452,"Well, is the city park a public forum?"
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,397.606,398.606,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,412.449,418.769,Why doesn't the city just say that and say we have a rule against unattended symbols?
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,418.769,426.923,"--Your Honor, the city has said it in the first case that raised the problem in a controversial fashion."
1984.84-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,506.375,520.818,"Well, if the city rules, as you described it, one that says we will not allow unattended displays if they are controversial or if the engender confronters."
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,520.818,531.859,"Your Honor, as of today I think the fair answer to Your Honor's question is yes as the rule is evidence by practice."
1984.84-277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,618.548,626.404,"May I ask, Mr. Frankel... I think you perhaps read the judge... Judge Pierce's opinion somewhat more broadly than I do."
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,661.057,665.093,"Your Honor, I want to say two or three things in response to that question."
1984.84-277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,735.37,744.243,"But, might not that depend on the reason you give for turning down the request for an unattended symbol?"
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,744.243,758.736,"Your Honor, we have given the reason first, of course, in our brief, but if you look through the record of this case you will find the reasons and they are not stated in the form of legal brief."
1984.84-277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.224,801.229,Do you defend the right of the village to refuse to place the creche for two weeks on the grounds that it would violate the establishment clause?
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,801.229,820.31,"We do, Your Honor, but we say that without that defense we win any way because just as we argue that the village does not have to allow a display like the one that was held ""protective"" in Brannenberg and Ohio."
1984.84-277,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,861.718,867.872,But what if the village in the past has allowed other uses of the park?
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,867.872,887.102,"Your Honor, we have to look at those and I might say if I had to take one case of this Court's precedence to rely on I think I would take Perry Education Association, both the majority and the dissent, and I think we would win on either one."
1984.84-277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1080.16,1088.933,"But, you do insist that leaving these unattended symbols in the park would be an establishment of religion, is that your position?"
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1088.933,1095.17,We do take that position and let me say that I will try to reach it and I will reach it in a few minutes.
1984.84-277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.17,1106.978,Because that seems to me to be the heart of the Second Circuit's decision which was that the city shouldn't be able to rely on the establishment clause to keep--
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1106.978,1112.549,"It is, Your Honor, but the Second Circuit, with all deference--"
1984.84-277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.549,1114.015,"--I understand your other argument, but--"
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1114.015,1116.667,"--Well, it skipped point one."
1984.84-277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.189,1140.032,"--I am not sure what the... If the city isn't relying on... is forbidden to rely on the establishment clause, I just don't know what the Second Circuit would do about refusals to allow this creche on other grounds."
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1140.032,1142.501,"--Your Honor, the other ground that I am giving--"
1984.84-277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.501,1144.551,They might agree with you completely.
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1144.551,1151.257,"--Well, they might, but the argument was made to them, Your Honor, and they skipped it."
1984.84-277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.789,1182.793,They certainly disagreed with your argument that this unattended creche is an establishment.
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1182.793,1183.159,They did.
1984.84-277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1183.159,1185.661,They certainly disagreed with your position on that.
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1185.661,1187.244,"Yes, Your Honor, and I will come to that--"
1984.84-277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1187.244,1188.077,What else did they disagree with you on?
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1188.077,1217.113,"--I will come directly to that, but I want to preserve the important argument that you won't find a word in the Circuit's opinion about a subject in our view, rather eloquently treated by Judge Stewart in the District Court, about the difference between an unattended symbol setting on the land giving its message when its owners aren't there, called the Scarsdale Creche Committee, though the majority of its proponents don't even live in Scarsdale."
1984.84-277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.113,1218.982,That is the way you avoid Widmar.
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1218.982,1220.265,That is the way--
1984.84-277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1220.265,1225.286,At least you say Widmar doesn't cover a situation like that.
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1225.286,1226.252,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-277,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1252.769,1260.125,"Before you get to that, Mr. Frankel, I am not sure I track your emphasis on unattended."
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1267.446,1268.481,"Yes, Your Honor, it would."
1984.84-277,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1280.706,1283.575,Then you think it would be all right?
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1283.575,1291.328,"I think it would be all right, because then it becomes clear that it is that speaker's message that is being delivered."
1984.84-277,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1292.43,1297.315,"How about once the speech is finished, he leaves."
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1298.684,1308.273,"--He takes the symbol with him, exactly, and that has been touched upon in more than one of this Court's cases, most recently Taxpayers against Vincent."
1984.84-277,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1343.796,1345.981,Is that critical to your position?
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1345.981,1347.348,--It is quite important.
1984.84-277,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1347.348,1348.267,Who the sponsors are?
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1348.267,1349.9,"No, Your Honor."
1984.84-277,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1349.9,1351.25,Or the residence of the sponsors?
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1351.25,1351.966,"No, Your Honor."
1984.84-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1365.993,1368.176,"Well, there is a sign, is there not--"
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1368.176,1368.592,Pardon?
1984.84-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1368.592,1377.198,--There is a sign presumably with the display that says that it is sponsored by the Committee.
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1377.198,1384.769,"It says it is placed there by the Scarsdale Creche Committee, the Scarsdale Creche Committee, a private organization."
1984.84-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1386.821,1393.891,"So, it is a little hard if you look at the sign to attribute the sponsorship to the city, isn't it?"
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1393.891,1395.826,"--No, it is not hard at all, Your Honor."
1984.84-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1412.169,1425.763,"Well, do you think if the city allowed a speaker on the subject of christianity to speak at the park that the people would attribute that sponsorship to the city?"
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1425.763,1433.451,"No, Your Honor, they would attribute it to that speaker, but, you know, in this case again we have to use the facts of the case."
1984.84-277,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1584.397,1602.208,"I do object to that characterization of the opinion of the court below which again appeared at least to say the city could have a neutral restriction, for example, banning all unattended displays."
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1610.631,1626.491,"Your Honor, until the Solicitor General made that suggestion... and this doesn't bind the court... let me say none of the parties have felt that this could go back and the Second Circuit could look at it again and the Scarsdale board could debate it some more."
1984.84-277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1649.089,1652.725,That would depend a good deal on what the opinion of this Court would say.
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1652.725,1655.177,"--Oh, I guess so, Your Honor, I think so."
1984.84-277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.177,1656.01,I think it would.
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1656.01,1658.295,I am referring to just the way the Circuit wrote it.
1984.84-277,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1659.395,1663.099,"Well, we probably won't use just a one-word affirmance."
1984.84-277,0,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,1664.549,1667.468,"--I feel I have accomplished something, Your Honor."
1984.84-277,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1787.345,1792.282,Mr. Schwartz?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,1792.282,1795.234,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1910.775,1913.977,"May I ask, Mr. Schwartz, your view?"
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,1927.785,1933.355,"That would depend, sir, upon several circumstances."
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1940.092,1941.377,"Well, that is my restriction."
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,1942.877,1945.512,But it would first of all have to be content neutral.
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.512,1946.448,It is.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,1946.448,1951.5,"And, secondly, it would have to justify a significant governmental interest."
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1951.5,1952.435,"Well, does it."
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,1955.804,1959.589,What could the village do if this Court affirm?
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1959.589,1960.622,No.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,1963.541,1975.282,"I doubt very much, sir, that this village could deny access to all of its parks for symbols and signs of all kinds."
1984.84-277,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1982.787,1999.583,Wouldn't there be something like a governmental interest if the recital... the preamble said that in order to minimize vandalism with respect to unattended symbols that no unattended symbols would be allowed?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,1999.583,2050.682,"In a village which has a history for more than 25 years of freely permitted year after year the banners of the Red Cross, a symbol of the Red Cross, the banners of the American Field Service, the signs of the United Fund, and when the village itself displays Christmas lights and ornaments on its own lampposts, village employees decorate Christmas trees in the lobby of Village Hall, village employees ornament a living tree in Boniface Circle where this creche sat for 24 years, it seems difficult to me, though it is certainly conceivable, and one would have to wait and see what justification the village advanced, to determine if it advanced a significant governmental interest."
1984.84-277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2065.375,2075.814,"Well, why can't the... Supposing it had pursued the kind of policy you say for the last 25 years and it has resulted in having the creche up."
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2093.526,2107.102,"Boniface Circle... I believe the village probably could say that there was a substantial governmental interest to be served by banning all unattended displays, but that isn't the issue in this case, Your Honor."
1984.84-277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2107.102,2107.702,I realize that isn't.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2109.202,2133.75,"But, bear this in mind, Your Honor, the village manager testified in this case by deposition and his testimony is that in the 24 years the creche was displayed at Boniface Circle there was never a complaint that it was aesthetically displeasing, there was never a complaint that it constituted visual clutter, never a complaint that it interfered with traffic."
1984.84-277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2168.591,2181.398,"Why can't it say we just don't want any content oriented messages in Boniface Park, it just causes too much hassle, one side is yelling, the other side is yelling?"
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2182.35,2186.652,That may well be permissible but it doesn't solve the issue in this case.
1984.84-277,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2188.92,2202.328,Would you figure it would be consistent with the Second Circuit's opinion and judgment if there was an injunction entered on remand ordering the city to allow this creche?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2202.328,2206.631,"I don't think the District Court would enter such an order, Justice White."
1984.84-277,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2206.631,2207.331,Not under this?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2207.331,2208.247,I don't think so.
1984.84-277,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.437,2221.722,The Second Circuit has not mandated that the creche be in the park?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2221.722,2227.19,It has not passed upon regulations which were not before it nor could it.
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2247.437,2261.763,"May I ask, the statement that is quoted at the end of your opponent's reply brief says that the reason was it is inappropriate to use public property for religious expression which is not necessarily saying it would violate the establishment clause."
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2269.203,2271.186,"I don't think the Constitution would permit it, sir."
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2271.186,2273.405,That would not be a sufficient reason?
1984.84-277,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.405,2278.492,"Widmar would read on that, wouldn't it?"
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2278.492,2278.959,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.427,2282.777,Let me change the question a little bit.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2297.186,2301.155,"--I think that is impermissible, Your Honor, for two reasons among others."
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2319.719,2328.658,"So your response to your opponent is his horrible examples about the swastikas and all that, those parade of horrors, yes, that is exactly what might be done."
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2328.658,2329.241,Not necessarily.
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2347.552,2353.02,"Assuming he doesn't go that far, it just upsets a lot of people."
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2353.02,2354.206,--Religion is the opiate of the people.
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2360.443,2364.162,You don't see a distinction between the Red Cross and symbols of that kind?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2364.162,2367.947,"I don't think the Constitution can admit such a distinction, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2397.449,2404.472,"So, your view is that this decision means that Planned Parenthood has a right to put up the kind of sign you describe in this park?"
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2404.472,2429.087,"I would assume, Your Honor, no matter what this Court decides in this case, no municipality may inhibit speech on the basis of content unless it presents a clear and present danger of disorder, unless it interferes with other uses or unless, in the case of the explicit sexual statuary which my friend envisions, it is unsuitable for viewing by children."
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2479.0,2484.321,Could they put up a sign that says we don't think the people of Scarsdale?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2484.321,2492.094,"--If you are going to permit the Red Cross, if you are going to permit the United Fund... Yes, sir."
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2492.094,2494.227,I don't see where the Red Cross has ever said anything about Scarsdale.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2494.227,2496.546,The banner--
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2496.546,2500.498,Suppose it said we don't like the Jews who live in Scarsdale.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2500.498,2514.924,"--Unless that presented a clear and present danger of breach of the peace which the Scarsdale police were unable to deal with, I think there is a constitutional right to put it up so long as other banners are there."
1984.84-277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2542.175,2561.321,"What if Scarsdale said in Boniface Circle or the railroad station or wherever they now have Red Cross banners in support of fund raising, we will let any fund raising group that is active for Scarsdale put up a banner but we are not going to have anything else?"
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2561.321,2565.023,I think that is an unconstitutional distinction.
1984.84-277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2565.023,2566.023,Why?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2566.023,2571.427,"I don't think... Let me put it another way, in an affirmative way."
1984.84-277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2582.533,2592.822,"But the city's response here would be we haven't opened a place for expression of all views, all we have opened is a place for signs supporting fund raising drives."
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2592.822,2610.45,"That, to me, is an expression of a view and I think it is constitutionally impermissible to say that I may ask for funds for the Red Cross, I may ask for funds for the PTA, but I may not express my views about a non-fund raising function."
1984.84-277,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2629.847,2643.988,"I take it from what you have said that if only the creche as a symbol were allowed, but all other faiths and religious symbols were prohibited that that would not stand."
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2643.988,2645.588,"I agree with that, Chief Justice."
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2741.05,2754.559,Would you agree before you go on to the establishment clause that there is at least theoretically a basis for distinction between saying everything offensive shall be banned and saying I will ban it because I disagree with what you say?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2754.559,2757.077,--There is a difference--
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.077,2765.683,"As I read the reason here, it wasn't necessarily that they disagreed with the message of the creche, they just thought this was an inappropriate use of the religious symbol."
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2765.683,2793.584,"--I think the total effect of reading the appendix is that it was rejected because some were offended by its display, that it was not considered neighborly to manifest a point of view which others did not share or which made them uncomfortable, and that it was thought to breach a wall which was thought erroneously we now know to exist between church and state."
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2807.86,2815.2,"You don't think, for example, a Catholic priest who would be clearly sympathetic with the message could ever oppose having the creche in the village square?"
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2815.2,2832.392,I can conceive of a priest saying that I am so firmly devoted to the principle of non-intermingling of church and state that I don't believe religious symbols should be displayed on public property.
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2868.315,2872.619,You say the Constitution requires that all unattended symbols be treated as fungible?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2872.619,2875.987,"--Yes, sir, unless there is a compelling governmental--"
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2875.987,2883.408,"You allow solicitation for the Red Cross, you must allow solicitation for legal advocacy groups and others like that?"
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,2883.408,2887.879,"--Yes, sir, no matter how hateful, no matter how hateful."
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3016.645,3020.716,Do you see any difference between the creche and Christmas ornaments?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3020.716,3027.219,"I think there is a difference, but I don't think it is a constitutional dimension."
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3049.485,3051.251,What makes a creche a creche?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3051.251,3056.305,--The Infant Jesus.
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3056.305,3057.305,Thank you.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3057.305,3061.857,And Mary and Joseph and the sheep and the--
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3061.857,3063.459,"You don't have them on the lamp posts, do you?"
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3063.459,3065.244,--Pardon me?
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3065.244,3067.627,"You don't have those up on the lamp posts, do you?"
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3067.627,3071.231,"I have never seen one, Your Honor, but conceivably they could be--"
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3071.231,3074.183,"Well, if you say the same thing goes on--"
1984.84-277,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3074.183,3081.003,"--I suppose those symbols are intended to convey the same general message, are they not?"
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3081.003,3092.477,"--I would have to concede, Mr. Chief Justice, that the message of the creche is far more religious than a string of Christmas lights or a wreath."
1984.84-277,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3092.477,3094.61,Or is it just more specific?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3094.61,3111.456,"It is more specific, but the significant thing to me is that it is in the context of observance of a national holiday; that the holiday is celebrated by people of all religious persuasions."
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3141.375,3148.897,May I take you back to your argument about the history in Scarsdale which I think you rely on rather heavily that there has been a history of symbols in the park.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3148.897,3149.564,I think it is important.
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3149.564,3151.933,And they can't deviate from that.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3161.455,3181.885,"If a village had never allowed an unattended symbol because no one had ever requested permission to display it, then the question would be, when permission was denied, was this a reasonable time, place and manner restriction which supported a significant governmental interest?"
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3195.443,3205.584,"I understand, but I was wondering if you were willing to concede, and I guess you are really not quite willing to, that if there had been a total absence of symbols in the past, then they could continue that policy."
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3215.606,3217.641,Which history would you look to?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3217.641,3232.484,"I think that history, Your Honor, is important principally to show that this could not really be offensive, this really could not be a fighting symbol."
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3232.484,3234.351,You have a lawsuit here.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3234.351,3253.398,"Well, we have a lawsuit, Your Honor, because beginning in 1976 a lawyer who was associated with the New York Civil Liberties Union moved into Scarsdale and he brought a lawsuit and the matter has been in turmoil ever since that time regrettably so."
1984.84-277,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3265.455,3269.924,Your clients didn't want it to be settled locally.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3269.924,3271.693,"Not so, Your Honor, not so."
1984.84-277,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3313.103,3320.94,All I was suggesting is that a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit isn't ordinarily thought of as settling something locally.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3320.94,3325.078,"--My clients had no option, Your Honor."
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3326.861,3328.78,They could have put it on private property.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3328.78,3332.481,"I don't think that is the answer, Justice Marshall."
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3332.481,3335.599,But the answer is yes.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3335.599,3338.551,"Oh, they could have, but that isn't the answer."
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3338.551,3341.67,"It wouldn't have had the same effect on private property, would it?"
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3341.67,3342.453,"No, it would not, sir."
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3342.453,3346.972,You want it to get the imprimatur of the state.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3346.972,3349.757,I don't believe the record would support that conclusion.
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3349.757,3353.144,I am asking you.
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3355.694,3356.429,"No, sir."
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3399.356,3400.439,What about the front yard?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3400.439,3409.962,The record here shows that only one church was centrally located and met that minimal requirement.
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3409.962,3415.449,"Well, do any of the contributors to this creche fund own property?"
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3415.449,3419.568,The record doesn't show that.
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3420.769,3422.485,Can't we assume they do?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3422.485,3423.987,--I assume so.
1984.84-277,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3423.987,3427.022,Can't we assume we can put it on their property?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3427.022,3438.311,"Nobody lives, Justice Marshall, in Boniface Circle or in a centrally located place where shoppers and pedestrians would see the creche throughout the season."
1984.84-277,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3438.311,3440.163,Do they all live in Scarsdale?
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3440.163,3452.737,"Five of the seven do, but all of the seven have Scarsdale post offices and all seven of the churches are either in Scarsdale or in the immediate surrounding area with Scarsdale post office addresses."
1984.84-277,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3460.576,3464.962,"Well, I think it ties into your comment about having it settled locally."
1984.84-277,1,36691,marvin_schwartz,,3464.962,3468.266,--I meant within the forum of the Board of Trustees.
1984.84-277,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3484.176,3486.477,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Frankel?"
1984.84-277,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,3486.477,3489.679,"I think I have about a minute and a half, Your Honor."
1984.84-277,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3489.679,3491.545,You have two minutes.
1984.84-277,2,35822,marvin_e_frankel,,3491.545,3502.487,I think it is clear that Mr. Schwartz's clients and another group brought this lawsuit after the village Board had settled locally its view on this subject.
1984.84-277,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3632.772,3634.205,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
