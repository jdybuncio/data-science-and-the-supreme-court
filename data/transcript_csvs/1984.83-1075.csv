1984.83-1075,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,31.369,"Mr. Williard, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1984.83-1075,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,31.369,112.506,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,549.141,555.628,How about the requirement that requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a tanner as to leave no discretion on the issue?
1984.83-1075,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,559.347,568.62,"It is not clear, Justice Rehnquist, but if that is their contention, it is clearly wrong because Exemption 3 has two subparts, Subpart A and Subpart B."
1984.83-1075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,598.305,599.824,A and B are disjunctive.
1984.83-1075,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,599.824,601.891,"That is correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-1075,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,616.601,630.777,"Mr. Willard, if your view is correct, do we need still to give some objective definition for what is an intelligence source?"
1984.83-1075,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,634.412,650.024,"Justice O'Connor, I don't think that is really an issue presented in this case because as I stated at the outset, the first part of the two-part test, that is, whether the source provides information that relates to CIA's intelligence functions, is a part of the test that we met in this case."
1984.83-1075,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,664.517,675.889,And you think the decision of the Director to authorize disclosure carries with it no component of reasonableness in making the determination?
1984.83-1075,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,675.889,692.417,"We believe the determination, once it is decided that a source is an intelligence source, to disclose or not to disclose that source is a determination which was given by Congress in the 1947 Act to the Director of Central Intelligence and is not a decision which is subject to judicial review."
1984.83-1075,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,708.277,717.918,But you don't want us to attempt to give any framework or description of the content of intelligence source in this particular case.
1984.83-1075,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,717.918,730.959,"I don't believe that is necessary, Justice O'Connor, because the definition, the first part of the two-part test applied by the Court of Appeals was applied in this case, properly in our view, and held that these sources were intelligence sources."
1984.83-1075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,730.959,740.332,"Well, your position is a source is a source is a source, and if the thing was in fact a source, we don't need any four-part test to decide whether or not the source gave information."
1984.83-1075,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,740.332,742.184,"That is exactly right, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-1075,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,756.609,762.863,"Is there a difference, in your view, between intelligence and information?"
1984.83-1075,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,762.863,765.132,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, there is."
1984.83-1075,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,765.132,766.115,What do you think it would be?
1984.83-1075,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,766.115,771.119,"Intelligence, within the meaning of the National Security Act, pertains to CIA's functions."
1984.83-1075,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,790.181,799.436,"Well, I can understand it better if you said that all information is not intelligence, but all intelligence is information."
1984.83-1075,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,799.436,800.638,Well--
1984.83-1075,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,800.638,803.507,"It is merely a special kind of information, isn't it?"
1984.83-1075,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,803.507,806.459,"--That is correct in part, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-1075,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,816.398,822.402,What does that... you categorize that as intelligence?
1984.83-1075,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,822.402,825.604,"--Well, we believe it can be categorized as intelligence, but--"
1984.83-1075,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,825.604,827.89,Overt activities of some kind?
1984.83-1075,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,827.89,835.728,"--Those activities are intelligence activities under the National Security Act, in our view."
1984.83-1075,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,835.728,850.838,"But you do agree that information is the broader term of... intelligence in the sense of securing information, really makes the two of them synonymous up to that point, does it not?"
1984.83-1075,0,40682,richard_k_willard,,850.838,856.309,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, especially where it deals with CIA's national security mission."
1984.83-1075,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,937.011,939.896,Very well.
1984.83-1075,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,941.665,944.617,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1050.184,1055.004,"May I ask, Mr. Levy, would Exemption 1 protect open sources?"
1984.83-1075,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1055.004,1081.755,"--Exemption 1 could protect open sources if disclosure of those open sources would show the CIA's interest in the particular subject, would lead... would show that the CIA is using that particular open source and therefore cause the people who put information into that open source to withhold the information that the CIA really wants."
1984.83-1075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1081.755,1085.207,I thought you described it as protecting classified information.
1984.83-1075,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1093.829,1110.758,"And on that basis, the CIA could make a claim under the relevant Executive Order that disclosure of the source would lead to damage to the national security and could therefore classify the name."
1984.83-1075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1110.758,1115.143,"I see, but what about just the plain language of intelligence source?"
1984.83-1075,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1123.082,1125.434,I will try to reach that point.
1984.83-1075,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1188.905,1197.611,"Where is that exact language found, Mr. Levy, in the statute, protecting... is it 403 (d)(3)?"
1984.83-1075,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1197.611,1200.729,--It is 403(d)(3).
1984.83-1075,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1209.835,1213.822,Thank you.
1984.83-1075,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1213.822,1231.101,"The construction the CIA would put on that statute is that any person who supplies the CIA with any information that is useful to its task, whether or not that information is intelligence, is an intelligence source."
1984.83-1075,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1261.303,1265.821,"You mean it would not be available, then, or it would be available, which?"
1984.83-1075,1,38080,paul_alan_levy,,1267.29,1275.277,"The CIA, under the CIA's construction of the statute, the reporter would be an intelligence source--"
1984.83-1075,2,40682,richard_k_willard,,2683.241,2686.442,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-1075,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3081.094,3081.76,"Thank you, gentlemen."
