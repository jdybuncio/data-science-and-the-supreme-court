1959.451,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,24.017,"Number 451, Pennsylvania Railroad Company, Petitioner, versus United States."
1959.451,0,26750,hugh_b_cox,,26.012,29.035,May it please the Court.
1959.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,87.886,91.487,Were the shipping -- were the shipping documents changed after they couldn't --
1959.451,0,26750,hugh_b_cox,,91.487,95.838,"They were changed afterwards, Mr. Justice Frankfurter."
1959.451,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,273.402,288.432,"I take it that the question of whether export rate of parts, the rates couldn't be higher -- the reasonable rates couldn't be, or a rate higher than the export rates would be unreasonable, was itself a subject matter for the so-called family jurisdiction."
1959.451,0,26750,hugh_b_cox,,288.432,292.036,As I think there's no doubt about that.
1959.451,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,373.589,374.989,"May I ask you, Mr. Cox?"
1959.451,0,26750,hugh_b_cox,,384.47,385.84,"No, we think not."
1959.451,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,385.84,386.078,You think not.
1959.451,0,26750,hugh_b_cox,,386.078,388.066,"Yes, from what I could get."
1959.451,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,388.066,389.146,The Government agrees?
1959.451,0,26750,hugh_b_cox,,389.146,391.88,"The Government agrees with us, yes."
1959.451,1,25167,george_cochran_doub,,646.108,650.127,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please."
1959.451,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,650.699,654.616,"Tell us what you're going to argue, Mr. Doub."
1959.451,1,25167,george_cochran_doub,,654.616,662.006,"We acquiesced, if the Court please, in the petition for certiorari."
1959.451,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,721.828,722.551,May I ask --
1959.451,1,25167,george_cochran_doub,,722.551,724.223,-- and I have been able to give.
1959.451,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,724.223,750.192,"I think that that -- I gather from the facts you (Inaudible) and it might be, another question would arise or the views (Inaudible)"
1959.451,1,25167,george_cochran_doub,,750.192,760.544,"It's not before you, but it -- but it's very difficult, Mr. Justice Brennan to -- to follow the precise issue here without seeing the whole picture."
1959.451,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,787.337,795.689,But we certainly have to determine what we are -- we certainly have to decide in this case what to do with the Court of Claims' judgment.
1959.451,1,25167,george_cochran_doub,,795.735,796.81,No question about that.
1959.451,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,796.81,797.698,"So, that --"
1959.451,1,25167,george_cochran_doub,,797.698,798.092,But that --
1959.451,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,798.092,810.299,"That involves, I take it, determining whether the Court of Claims could and if it could, should have reviewed -- could have reviewed the order of the Commission."
1959.451,1,25167,george_cochran_doub,,819.896,820.556,That's right.
