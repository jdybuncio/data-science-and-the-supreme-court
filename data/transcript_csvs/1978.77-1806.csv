1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,49.838,We'll hear arguments next in Ford Motor Company against the National Labor Relations Board.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,53.355,57.456,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1978.77-1806,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,81.179,83.921,"Well, it's just the last of those phrases that --"
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,83.921,84.173,Or --
1978.77-1806,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,84.173,87.016,"-- conceitedly is not -- well there is a claim as much as wage, is it not?"
1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,87.016,87.393,"Oh, subsidy."
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,87.393,88.496,Yes.
1978.77-1806,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,88.496,90.38,Concededly it's not hours.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,90.38,91.988,Or it may be wages.
1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,94.582,100.448,"Well, specially if the Union demanded in a subsidy that would be in effect (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,100.448,101.063,That would be in the area of wages.
1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,101.063,102.87,-- addition of compensation.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,102.87,104.668,Yes.
1978.77-1806,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,168.554,173.325,"Mr. Kammholz, would your position here be any different if Ford itself were operating this cafeterias?"
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,173.325,175.529,"No, it would be identical Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1978.77-1806,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,175.529,179.486,You would take the position that they are not subject to collective bargaining.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,179.486,181.38,"Precisely, precisely."
1978.77-1806,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,181.38,183.624,Even though you could fix all the prices?
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,183.624,185.555,Exactly.
1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,185.555,200.866,Would you take the view that permitting or not permitting food dispensing establishments was subject to collective bargaining mandatory?
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,200.866,203.352,Not in the context of this case.
1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,211.847,212.783,Lumberjacks up in the mountains.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,212.783,214.646,"Lumberjacks, exactly."
1978.77-1806,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,254.833,257.113,Didn't they just get 30 minutes for lunch?
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,257.113,261.375,30 minutes for lunch Your Honor and two twenty -- two minute rest periods.
1978.77-1806,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,261.375,263.246,They couldn't have gone very far.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,263.246,267.936,The nearest restaurant is 1.6 tenths miles away.
1978.77-1806,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,267.936,270.278,Well then they're really captive.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,270.278,271.574,"No, I would not concede that they're captive."
1978.77-1806,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,271.574,277.028,Which I wonder why you made reference to the presence of restaurants in the area.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,277.028,280.75,Because some employees utilize the restaurants as the record indicates.
1978.77-1806,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,280.75,282.078,Even with a mile --
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,282.078,282.392,Yes.
1978.77-1806,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,282.392,284.055,-- plus and 30 minutes?
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,284.055,284.737,Yes.
1978.77-1806,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,284.737,287.589,They're faster than we are here?
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,287.589,287.709,Well --
1978.77-1806,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,287.709,289.267,Much better.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,289.267,292.569,Or they could bring their lunch which very many did.
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,614.909,629.005,"Mr. Kammholz supposing a company or an employer had a rule requiring employees to eat in the company cafeteria, would the existence or nonexistence of such a rule be mandatory subject to bargaining?"
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,629.005,632.537,"No, I think not."
1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,642.933,657.867,"But if you really thought to the Weyerhaeuser case, if the lumberjacks didn't eat the very hearty food which lumber companies normally provide for them, the productivity would probably go down."
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,657.867,663.166,"Ultimately, but that's not our case."
1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,664.535,666.356,But I was pursuing Mr. Justice Stevens' --
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,666.356,668.257,Yes.
1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,668.257,673.145,-- suggestion in some circumstances a you've -- as you are aware with the Weyerhaeuser case.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,693.981,699.445,"Yes, I think the theory Mr. Chief Justice Burger goes one step beyond."
1978.77-1806,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,721.676,728.556,"Is the period of times lunch, the bargaining point?"
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,728.556,730.825,A period of time for lunch is --
1978.77-1806,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,730.825,730.854,So --
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,730.854,733.626,-- this is within the context of hours of employment.
1978.77-1806,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,733.626,735.9,"So lunch is not trivial, is it?"
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,735.9,737.48,"No, I didn't say it was trivial."
1978.77-1806,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,737.783,739.122,"I thought you did, I misunderstood you."
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,739.122,740.641,The Fourth Circuit did.
1978.77-1806,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,740.641,743.049,And I misunderstood you.
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,743.049,751.777,Imagine if you had told someone in the Army or the Navy that the kind of food they had to eat was the trivial condition of the employment they might not agree.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,751.777,756.197,"Probably so, but that same person wouldn't have much choice and whether he or she wanted --"
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,756.197,757.502,That there would be a bargain of what?
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,757.502,759.828,-- or not be there.
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.782,830.802,"Well, it might be if Ford supplied them and insisted that their supplies be used that wouldn't shock me."
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,830.802,831.616,Uniforms?
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,831.616,833.997,Yes.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,833.997,845.971,This then might well become a matter of wages but it does not mean that it's a compulsory subject to bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act Your Honor.
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.38,899.693,"Mr. Kammholz, would you help me a little bit on the practical aspect of this."
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,908.0,909.787,And they would have a right to bargain.
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,911.372,911.424,Just --
1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,911.424,914.178,Unless they lowered the price?
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,914.178,922.06,"Yes, an unlikely possibility Your Honor."
1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,965.273,966.657,For how long?
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,966.657,969.95,From early February until June.
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,969.95,972.033,"You can do it during the summer, I gather."
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,972.033,975.948,"Well Your Honor, our Chicago summers aren't much different from winters currently."
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.948,979.152,"Well, they're pretty hot for leaving food in the locker, aren't they?"
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,979.152,991.785,"Well, may I address this point, there is provision in the locker room area, ventilated area for the storing of lunches."
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.775,1003.902,Is the storage area a refrigerator?
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1003.902,1006.221,The storage area is not.
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.609,1010.774,"Storage for -- for the milk or something, you couldn't do it, end of summer."
1978.77-1806,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1010.774,1011.817,Or many?
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1011.817,1031.21,"Well Your Honors, we address this in our reply brief and I think it's a significant point under modern practices there is a laundry list of food, this is the appendix to our reply brief of food, no refrigeration needed."
1978.77-1806,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1031.21,1032.748,Right.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1032.748,1037.067,"Indeed, the venerable --"
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1037.067,1040.681,I suppose you don't even have to eat if you're really want to (Inaudible).
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1040.681,1048.607,And many did not during the boycott and it is probably better for them on occasion not to.
1978.77-1806,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1087.596,1090.057,Think for yourself.
1978.77-1806,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1090.057,1100.344,"You can also get them for find and tells you, if you let mayonnaised food sit out over four and a half hours, you're in trouble."
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1107.752,1120.421,"Well, Your Honor I must confess you spread it out that way I have no real response."
1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1163.784,1172.395,Does the company -- was Ford supply the space to the franchised restaurant operator --
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1172.395,1172.562,Yes.
1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1172.562,1173.943,-- at no cost?
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1173.943,1175.811,At no cost.
1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1175.811,1177.826,Anything else beside the space?
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1177.826,1179.291,Most of the equipment.
1978.77-1806,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1188.271,1190.082,(Inaudible)
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1190.082,1190.703,That's --
1978.77-1806,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1190.703,1191.322,-- by Ford.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1191.322,1195.467,"All belongs to Ford, yes."
1978.77-1806,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1231.417,1234.155,May I ask just this question.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1243.958,1244.925,Yes.
1978.77-1806,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1244.925,1250.632,"The questions are stated in the briefs for all of the counsel, applied is here."
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1277.778,1291.573,The question here is posited on the Board's finding that this case is within the factual and the legal context of the earlier decisions.
1978.77-1806,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1302.471,1318.516,"Well, the argument it seems to me to be addressed to whether or not on any and all circumstances whatever they may be that the prizes of food in an in-company -- in-house cafeteria are the subject of mandatory bargaining."
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1319.617,1319.968,That is --
1978.77-1806,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1319.968,1322.242,-- regardless of the facts and circumstances.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1322.242,1329.352,"Yes, because the facts and circumstances in the thesis that have come up earlier are no different than this case."
1978.77-1806,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1329.797,1329.849,Well --
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1329.849,1331.667,-- the situation --
1978.77-1806,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1331.667,1331.9,Why?
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1331.9,1333.085,-- to which the Chief Justice --
1978.77-1806,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1333.085,1340.765,I would've thought that the facts and circumstances could very considerably and apparently the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit thought so.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1353.615,1365.368,I respectfully suggest that the Seventh Circuit arrived at its decision and then wrote an opinion to have followed the result.
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1387.482,1387.635,Mr. Kammholz --
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1387.635,1388.488,Well --
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1388.488,1402.279,I share Justice Powell's inquiry and I -- perhaps I should ask Mr. Come this question but I gather that the -- your opponents are not here defending the Seventh Circuit opinion.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1402.496,1405.456,I think they're defending it on the very broad base.
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.456,1407.255,They're defending the result but I certainly --
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1407.255,1407.551,Yes.
1978.77-1806,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1407.551,1413.68,-- don't read their brief to go along with the theory expressed by the Seventh Circuit in its opinion.
1978.77-1806,0,42933,theophil_c_kammholz,,1413.68,1415.162,"No, Your Honor, they do not."
1978.77-1806,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1447.929,1449.869,Very well Mr. Kammholz.
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1462.693,1470.203,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1806,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1491.917,1496.126,"The Board's or the Court of Appeals, I'm not --"
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1496.126,1505.12,The Court of Appeals' decision rest on the second alternative of the Board's decision.
1978.77-1806,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1598.907,1610.865,"Although, death sentence are broader -- it's a broader generic question that was sent down as a question presented in the company's certiorari petition."
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1610.865,1612.844,"That is correct, if the Court will --"
1978.77-1806,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1612.844,1620.423,"And maybe -- but maybe the -- but maybe the answer to it as suggested in the questions of my Brothers Blackmun and Powell is, sometimes yes, sometimes no."
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1620.423,1636.363,"Well, that may well be and I call the Court's attention to the fact that the Board opposed certiorari on the ground that on the facts of this case, it was not necessary to reach the broader question."
1978.77-1806,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1661.718,1678.426,Is it the Board's position Mr. Come that if a com -- if a plant has no eating facilities in it but the union wants the plant to put in eating facilities that is a subject of mandatory bargaining?
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1678.426,1704.311,I think the logic of the Board's position would carry you there although the Board has not had occasioned to address that question and that might present questions of capital investment that might get into the reservation expressed in the concurring opinion in Fibreboard.
1978.77-1806,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1716.086,1719.705,"That is -- that's an indirect subsidy in itself, isn't it?"
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1719.705,1720.897,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1806,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1720.897,1742.827,"What if -- if your position is correct, the Board's position is correct, the Union then could make a demand not only for all the subsidy indirectly involved in providing the space and the -- all the equipment but in addition 50% of the cost."
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1755.022,1756.692,"Well, I --"
1978.77-1806,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1756.692,1758.208,Any doubt about that?
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1758.208,1762.478,I think we have to take this on a step by step basis.
1978.77-1806,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1809.845,1815.363,Even though they do effect clearly anybody's definition of conditions of employment.
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1815.363,1822.745,"That is correct, but we submit that we're a long way from that in this case because --"
1978.77-1806,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1822.745,1832.777,But don't you think we have an obligation when this kind of an issue is presented to see where the proposals on one side of the other will carry us.
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1832.777,1841.731,"Well, I think that you do Your Honor and I like to show you that you're not carried that far on what we have in this case."
1978.77-1806,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1841.731,1848.728,"Yes, we haven't -- at least I didn't hear you yet answer my question."
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1869.394,1878.682,"Well, I think it's difficult for me to tell you how the Board is going to answer that question because they haven't had it."
1978.77-1806,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1886.635,1898.849,But if you can bar -- if they must bargain the price of the lunch it can -- is there any escape from bargaining the -- exactly what I've hypothesized to you?
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1898.849,1915.337,"Well, look at -- I think that there's no question that everyone will agree that the physical dimensions of the employees' working environment are mandatory bargaining subject."
1978.77-1806,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1962.886,1967.02,"Mr. Come, let me go back to the Board's basic position."
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1985.066,1986.968,"Well, I think there is a de minimis concept."
1978.77-1806,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2047.574,2049.967,"Now you're arguing the facts of it, and I'm trying to --"
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2049.967,2050.233,Yes.
1978.77-1806,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2050.233,2051.489,-- stay with the Board's --
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2051.489,2051.949,What?
1978.77-1806,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2051.949,2055.487,-- basic broad initial position.
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2055.487,2058.456,"Well, what I think -- I think that --"
1978.77-1806,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2058.456,2062.543,Maybe you're suggesting we should do as the Seventh Circuit did and decide this case on the facts?
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2062.543,2090.322,"Well, I think that the facts are important in showing that in the -- of a -- that a -- as a matter of industrial experience it would not be a radical thing to hold that this type of arrangement is a bargainable matter."
1978.77-1806,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2114.823,2115.53,That's no --
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2115.53,2116.465,-- such as the --
1978.77-1806,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2116.465,2120.975,Has no conclusive evidence however that that was a mandatory subject to bargaining.
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2120.975,2139.236,"Now, I agree with you that that is not what again accepting my premise that food availability is part of the physical conditions of the working environment."
1978.77-1806,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2139.236,2143.232,"Well, assume that so, is this price part of availability --"
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2143.232,2143.433,Well --
1978.77-1806,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2143.433,2146.085,-- in your view?
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2146.085,2150.842,We submit that price is an integral part of the subject to food services.
1978.77-1806,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2150.842,2153.667,"Well, it comes very close to wages, there's a fringe benefit."
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2174.441,2176.047,"Yes, it would Your Honor."
1978.77-1806,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2305.678,2308.789,How did they manage during the boycott?
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2311.039,2313.316,They either carry their food --
1978.77-1806,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2313.316,2313.524,Or they went out.
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2313.524,2315.446,-- or they did not eat.
1978.77-1806,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2315.446,2317.288,"Or they went out, isn't that what the --"
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2317.288,2330.437,"Well, according to the record the finding is the 12 out of 3600 employees left the plant at lunch."
1978.77-1806,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2389.15,2406.001,"Well, I take it, I thought you would say that if a plant has no food facilities at all and just relies on the restaurants in the area, that if the Union wants to bargain about putting in a facility to -- it would be a bargainable subject."
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2406.001,2418.973,I think it would be subject of course to the question as to how much of a capital investment that would require and whether that would then bring you --
1978.77-1806,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.973,2426.684,"That's just part of the bargaining that you would take that the employer could not refuse to talk about it, is that it?"
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2426.684,2433.749,"Well, if it is a mandatory bargaining, well, if it's a mandatory bargaining subject you cannot refuse to talk about it."
1978.77-1806,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.749,2442.912,"Well under your position, I -- what's your -- your position is, that under your position I take it, it would be -- he would have to bargain about it."
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2442.912,2450.096,I think that the logic of the position that I am urging would lead to that result --
1978.77-1806,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.096,2458.834,Surely you'd have to bargain about it if there wasn't a facility and the employer decided that it was a real bummer and wanted to close it down.
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2458.834,2459.566,I think so.
1978.77-1806,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.566,2465.48,"Mr. Come, does the IBM have to negotiate on the country club it has up in Connecticut?"
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2465.48,2467.03,IBM on the country club?
1978.77-1806,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2467.03,2471.576,"Yes, their average employees up in -- upstate New York and Connecticut."
1978.77-1806,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2471.576,2475.861,They're not organizing.
1978.77-1806,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2475.861,2477.87,That's the answer I guess.
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2477.87,2482.474,"Well, we have had cases where hunting lodge privileges have been --"
1978.77-1806,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2482.474,2484.11,"Yes, that's right."
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2484.11,2501.275,-- accorded to employees and if it has been accorded over -- enough years so that it has become part of the monuments of the employment relationship bargaining obligation has been found.
1978.77-1806,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2501.604,2502.734,I must --
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2502.734,2508.174,"-- I think that the further you get away from the plant though, the more tenuous it becomes and --"
1978.77-1806,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2508.174,2510.928,"Well, what about in the plant?"
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2518.138,2518.589,Yes.
1978.77-1806,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2518.589,2520.583,How do you stop that from being a --
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2520.583,2521.285,Well --
1978.77-1806,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2521.285,2522.441,-- a grievance?
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2522.441,2526.521,"Well, the Board's order here --"
1978.77-1806,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2526.521,2530.268,"Well, you -- don't you agree that you couldn't cover the whole working of it?"
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2530.268,2531.427,"No, no."
1978.77-1806,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2531.888,2533.805,"Well, how could you restrict it, that's what I want to --"
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2533.805,2550.122,"Well, the first one -- the first of all the Board's order here unlike the typical order, it is entered in one of these bargaining cases, does not require on the company to bargain before the price increase is made effective."
1978.77-1806,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2591.258,2592.46,What if you had more than one Union?
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2594.063,2608.542,"Well, if you have more than one Union Your Honor the problem is no different than the problem that you have with respect to a lot of other benefits like pensions, the Seventh Circuit dealt with that problem in the Inland Steel case."
1978.77-1806,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2662.037,2676.865,"Mr. -- Mr. Come, I take it before you sit down, I take that the board doesn't put you -- it doesn't rest his position on the relationship of food prices to wages, it -- its working conditions, right?"
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2676.865,2679.792,It is where -- it is conditions of employment --
1978.77-1806,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2679.792,2690.517,"And as -- so we're not -- we -- even if we thought it really was part of wages or sort of a fringe benefit we -- we couldn't affirm on that basis, we'd either have to agree with the Board or not."
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2690.517,2700.127,"Well, in the Weyerhaeuser case which was the --"
1978.77-1806,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2700.127,2706.539,"I know, but wouldn't you -- shouldn't we have a little chainier problem on the --?"
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2706.539,2707.101,I don't --
1978.77-1806,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2707.101,2709.664,Or an enlarged chainier problem.
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2709.664,2726.232,"Well, you might have a small chainier problem because if you read the Board decisions in this area beginning with Weyerhaeuser where they squarely put it on both conditions of employment and wages."
1978.77-1806,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2757.883,2761.245,But not here?
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2761.245,2766.31,"Well, they relied on all the other cases as their basis for the decision here."
1978.77-1806,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.974,2782.175,And the Court -- but the Court of Appeals didn't?
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2782.175,2786.332,The Court of Appeals relied on the conditions of employment.
1978.77-1806,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2813.085,2816.247,"Well, there are wages in hours are condition of employment by this --"
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2816.247,2816.864,That is correct.
1978.77-1806,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2816.864,2819.62,"-- as they use with other, it makes clear."
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2819.62,2821.033,That is correct.
1978.77-1806,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2869.674,2871.127,You're a little over your time now Mr. Come.
1978.77-1806,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2871.127,2872.619,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1978.77-1806,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2882.07,2883.02,Mr. Fillion?
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,2883.02,2886.234,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-1806,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2967.393,2971.099,"Well, except for subject matter areas."
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,2971.099,2971.756,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1978.77-1806,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2971.756,2973.173,"Well, that's what this case is about."
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,2978.763,2979.445,Right.
1978.77-1806,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2980.347,2982.221,-- are subject to compulsory collective bargaining.
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,2982.221,2982.935,Right.
1978.77-1806,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3024.456,3029.035,"-- that concurring opinion was a concurring opinion, it wasn't the Court laying down anything."
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,3032.675,3034.852,Correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1806,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3114.229,3131.844,"Well, do you agree with Mr. Come that although he was not willing to respond that 50% subsidy for the food was bargainable, he quickly ceased on the idea that free food would be bargainable."
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,3134.292,3136.081,I think free food is bargainable.
1978.77-1806,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3153.326,3156.583,You don't have to worry about it if the employer pays all of it.
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,3156.583,3157.065,"Well, that's --"
1978.77-1806,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3157.065,3158.005,There's no bargaining problem.
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,3158.005,3167.995,"One thing we may do at the bargaining table would be to say we proposed that if there are price increases in the future, the employer will pay half the price increase."
1978.77-1806,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3167.995,3170.195,But you also --
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,3170.195,3170.558,Pardon me?
1978.77-1806,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3170.558,3173.445,You also going to want to bargain about what's going into the menu.
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,3173.445,3175.874,That's something that fluctuates radically too but there are a lot of things --
1978.77-1806,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3175.874,3179.437,"It won't be any good to keep the price the same, let them -- give you half a scoop of ice cream."
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,3179.437,3184.013,"Well, then maybe what we'll want to do is what we do in practically every collective bargain agreement we have."
1978.77-1806,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3191.891,3193.012,In all seriousness.
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,3197.589,3197.922,Yes.
1978.77-1806,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3198.05,3198.163,Yes.
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,3198.163,3199.515,-- quite correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1806,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3228.442,3242.65,"Well, I take it the Board's orders in these areas anyway if they were ever upheld which they haven't been until now, I suppose they say that the employer doesn't have to bargain before he puts in any changes."
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,3245.871,3246.376,That's correct.
1978.77-1806,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3246.376,3251.249,That's in a -- that's -- that in -- that is sort of like a grievance procedure?
1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,3251.249,3257.791,"Exactly, a grievance procedure classically is the company acts, the union reacts and that's exactly the way this would be."
1978.77-1806,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3257.791,3262.041,But the claim is always that there has been a violation of the bargaining agreement.

1978.77-1806,2,30240,john_a_fillion,,3307.713,3308.48,Absolutely right.

1978.77-1806,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.655,3321.164,"Well, it's already been raised?"
