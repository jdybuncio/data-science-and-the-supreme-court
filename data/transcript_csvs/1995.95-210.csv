1995.95-210,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.509,"We'll hear argument next in Number 95-210, Holly Farms Corporation v. National Labor Relations Board."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,24.896,27.518,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-210,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,112.523,117.459,Suggesting that common sense and Congress' statutes are mutually exclusive?
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,117.689,118.688,"No, Your Honor."
1995.95-210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,145.505,146.236,How about the truck driver?
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,149.108,152.191,"Well, I think the truck drivers are a much more difficult question."
1995.95-210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,179.029,189.444,But can we see them... can we solve this case by just thinking of chicken catchers without knowing the employer involved?
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,218.984,231.151,"And if those were the facts, the chicken catchers and forklift operators would still be agricultural laborers, but the live haul drivers would not be agricultural laborers in our opinion, under the facts that you have posed."
1995.95-210,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,237.066,245.831,"Well, you rely on the fact that the chicken catchers and the people who put them in cages are doing the work on the farm."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,245.831,247.453,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-210,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,247.834,252.977,And therefore under the secondary agriculture prong of that statute.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,252.977,255.588,"--That's our position, is that at a minimum, while we contend--"
1995.95-210,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.588,265.136,"And you take the position that Bayside, that Bayside case did not deal with that aspect of the statute, where the work was done on the farm."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,265.136,266.634,"--That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-210,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,281.845,292.692,"Okay, and so as far as the driver is concerned, we would have to conclude that Holly Farms has regained its status as a farmer for you to prevail as to them."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,292.692,319.129,"We believe that that's the correct analysis, Your Honor, but if we take the chicken catchers and the forklift operators and we look at the statute, which is on page 3 of the blue brief, it says agriculture includes, among other things, the raising of poultry, and any practices performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations, including preparation for market."
1995.95-210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,388.564,403.695,"Mr. Roberts, one could accept that that's a perfectly reasonable reading of the statute, but isn't there some respect that we owe to the contrary interpretation of the NLRB and its ruling in this case?"
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,403.695,417.544,"We don't believe that in this case the board's opinion is entitled to any deference on the chicken catchers and forklift operators, because the issue in our view is that that's the only reasonable interpretation of section 3(f)."
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,466.277,474.861,"Yes, and would you be able to say the same thing with respect to the line haul drivers, that that is your interpretation is the only reasonable one?"
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,474.861,476.081,We don't--
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.081,476.732,"It's hard to say that, isn't it?"
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,476.732,496.985,"--Our position on the live haul drivers is that the statute is not specifically ambiguous but it does require interpretation and, had the board made a choice in this case between Holly and the independent grower, that choice might have been entitled to reference... I mean, to deference."
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.573,527.827,"But of course you... but they want to have it both ways, but so do you."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,542.136,543.625,"--Well, we think that their--"
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.625,545.418,And therefore your argument on the line haul--
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,545.418,552.912,"--Not necessarily, because Holly, even with the chicken catchers and the forklift operators, they can be covered in one of two ways."
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,564.439,568.152,--Or they can be acting incidentally to Holly's slaughtering operations.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,568.152,573.155,"That is the position that the board takes, and we think that--"
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,573.155,576.207,"No, but I mean, that is a logical possibility here, isn't it?"
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,576.207,579.299,"--Not... the chicken catchers, we think that that's not a logical--"
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,579.299,581.87,"No, no, I'm just talking about the... I thought you were talking about--"
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,581.87,582.041,--The drivers?
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,582.041,582.501,--The drivers.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,582.501,589.668,"We think that that is one possibility that, you know, could be argued, but the problem is--"
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,589.668,594.358,"Well, why isn't that same possibility open to the chicken catchers?"
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,594.358,606.627,"--Because the statute, Your Honor, specifically defines preparation for market of agricultural commodities raised on that farm as being incidental."
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,607.739,612.852,"No question about that, but this... doesn't this go to the point of incidental to such farming?"
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,612.852,613.593,--It--
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,613.593,641.169,"And I mean, there is at least a reasonable position, isn't there, to the effect that if the chicken catcher is hired by a slaughterer as opposed to being hired by the farmer, the one who literally owns the henhouse with the chickens in it, that that would be a reason for saying it is not incidental to such farming, it is incidental to slaughtering?"
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,642.921,656.88,"--We don't think that under any reasonable interpretation, because what that... if you adopt that interpretation, then it leads to the conclusion that there is no farmer in this case, that it's not incidental to anyone's farming operation--"
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,656.88,667.687,"Well, it may lead to the conclusion that at the precise mathematical moment in question the chickens are owned by somebody who is neither a farmer nor a nonfarmer."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,670.639,671.1,--But if they're--
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,671.1,672.4,Slaughterers can own chickens.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,672.4,673.791,--But the Congress is--
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,673.791,674.842,"I mean, can't they, and--"
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,674.842,675.132,--Certainly.
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,700.037,720.062,"--And that leaves... that certainly leaves open the possibility, and I suppose the certainty, that if the farmer hired an independent chicken catcher, like the thresher of the wheat in the example from the 1930's, that that person would be an agricultural worker so long as the work was done on the farm."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,756.374,761.967,"We don't think that that's a reasonable interpretation, Your Honor, that Congress... we don't think that was Congress' intent."
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,761.967,763.249,Because what?
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,763.249,769.144,"Well, because the language specifically was added to exempt somebody who was not a farmer, and if you accept--"
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,769.144,781.933,"Well, it was added to exempt the independent thresher, and people in the thresher's position, but these chicken catchers are not like the independent threshers who were referred to in the Senate back in the thirties."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,806.858,834.136,"--Well, the interpretation that you pose is one posed in the board's brief, but it was not posed by the board in its decision, and it's directly contrary to the board's decision in Produce Magic, where the board held that an independent harvester who went from farm to farm providing services for lettuce growers was not an agricultural laborer, even though the work was performed on a farm, because he wasn't a farmer."
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,841.91,848.324,"But the point is, the statute can be read in a way that does not have that effect and still lead to the board's conclusion here."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,848.324,859.632,"Only by adopting a logic that is specifically contrary to what the board has held in another case, and we don't think that that would be a reasonable method for doing it."
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,859.632,867.589,"Well, and you also have to accept the proposition that a particular activity can only be incidental to one."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,879.316,879.704,That's--
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,879.704,884.518,All the statute requires is that it be incidental to the farming operation.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,884.518,892.783,--The board has effectively imposed a solely or exclusively requirement into section 3(f) which is not warranted by the act.
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,937.003,953.055,"And I suppose that you'd have a real problem with any farmer who has an integrated operation, not only farms but slaughters, and then if these people who catch his chickens are doing things that are incidental to both operations, they presumably would not be entitled to the exemption."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,953.055,954.694,"Well, that's correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,954.694,956.016,Which is just like the case you describe.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,956.016,972.216,"Well, I think that one problem with the board's interpretation is it leads to a detailed analysis of the business relationships between the different employers, and we read section 3(f) as focusing primarily on the nature of the work, and under the board--"
1995.95-210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,972.216,989.607,"Suppose that you had... suppose I go into the business of supplying water to people who are threshing and they get thirsty, and each day I drive from my town, in the middle of the city, and I put water in my truck, and I go out there and I give them cups of water while they're threshing, or whatever they're doing."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1010.681,1012.193,"--No, I don't think so, Justice Breyer."
1995.95-210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1012.193,1012.511,Why not?
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1012.511,1013.802,The... there's two--
1995.95-210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1013.802,1014.904,Why isn't it incidental to the farm?
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1014.904,1016.594,"--Well, there's two problems with that."
1995.95-210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1018.705,1021.309,"Yes, that's what I thought it was in the analysis--"
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1021.309,1024.789,"--But... but it still, to be covered, has to either be performed on a farm--"
1995.95-210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1024.789,1025.119,"--Yes, it is."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1025.119,1025.981,--or by a farmer.
1995.95-210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1025.981,1027.962,"What they do is, they go out there and they hand them the cups."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1034.176,1039.288,"Well, I mean, obviously that is a question that I think the court would have to--"
1995.95-210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1039.288,1055.42,"What I'm trying to suggest is, it makes a difference who you're working for, that if, in fact, the water person was working for the farmer, you'd say, hey, this is incidental to the farming, but if the water person is working for a city water company, it seems more incidental to that."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1061.094,1064.817,"--Well, that same argument would apply to the independent wheat thresher."
1995.95-210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1070.521,1070.831,But he's a farmer.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1070.831,1071.462,--No.
1995.95-210,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1139.634,1152.734,"Mr. Roberts, can I ask you a question about the fact, does a particular crew go out and catch the chickens on one farm, deliver them, and go back to the same farm, or does it cover a lot of farms on one--"
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1152.734,1160.688,"--Your Honor, it covers a lot of farms, but what happens is, the live haul drivers deliver the chicken catchers and the forklift operators to the farms."
1995.95-210,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1160.688,1160.918,--Right.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1160.918,1164.832,So we have the chicken catchers and the forklift operators perform their tasks.
1995.95-210,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1165.843,1169.543,Will one truck load take all the chickens they're going to get from that farm?
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1169.543,1169.804,--No.
1995.95-210,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1173.006,1174.248,"No, that's not quite my question."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1183.514,1187.827,--I think the... from one farm would probably be less than what they get in one load.
1995.95-210,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1188.247,1191.25,So they have to go back to the same farm a second time?
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1191.25,1191.53,--No.
1995.95-210,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1195.731,1198.355,But I thought you said that one load would not clean out the farm.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1198.355,1200.246,"--They have to go to other farms, Your Honor."
1995.95-210,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1201.715,1206.069,"No, I understand, but I'm trying to get... one crew goes to farm A."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1209.881,1211.502,--It picks up all the available chickens.
1995.95-210,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1211.502,1212.633,In the same load?
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1212.633,1214.814,"Yes, and then it goes to farm B."
1995.95-210,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.814,1219.166,"I got the impression that it went to the farm, loaded up the truck, went back to the processing plant, and then came back to the farm."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1219.166,1219.997,"No, Your Honor."
1995.95-210,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1219.997,1220.828,That's not right.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1220.828,1221.219,It goes to farm B.
1995.95-210,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1229.975,1231.775,To a farm it's already been to.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1231.775,1231.955,--to a farm.
1995.95-210,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1241.333,1254.311,"It would just be a coincidence, then, that if at some point you didn't have to go back to the same farm, because what you... what regulates when they go back is when they've got a full truck, not when they've cleaned out one farm."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1254.311,1255.83,"Well, obviously, yes."
1995.95-210,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.321,1289.033,"A different truck will come and pick them up, then?"
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1289.033,1291.364,"It may be the same, or it may be a different truck."
1995.95-210,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1291.364,1292.605,I see.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1299.339,1300.31,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1359.089,1360.711,"But you deny that, so you're another."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1365.752,1367.683,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, I didn't--"
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.683,1375.618,"Just as they are saying that he is not the farmer, you are saying that he is."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1375.618,1378.301,--We're saying that both are.
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1411.471,1412.092,That's the other issue.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1412.613,1432.446,"Our position, though, is, is that in addition to that, Holly has resumed its status as a farmer because it holds title to the chicks, it actually performs the delivery, or the catching, the caging and the delivery, and as the board points out in its brief, the grower provides a service for Holly."
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1432.446,1432.667,"--Well, wait a minute."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1445.416,1445.886,Because that--
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1445.886,1452.388,So the mere fact that Holly did the catching-caging doesn't reconvert Holly to a farmer.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1456.552,1465.1,"--Well, Your Honor, and the case you pose would be one where the entity had no previous farming status with regard to those chickens."
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.808,1466.159,Okay.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1470.072,1470.423,--That--
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.423,1471.943,That Holly used to be a farmer.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1471.943,1472.975,--Well--
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1472.975,1478.416,"Unlike the independent contractor, before Holly dropped off the little chicks, Holly was a farmer."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1478.416,1481.179,"--That's the major distinction, but we think it's an important distinction."
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.581,1483.6,"It is, maybe it isn't."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1483.6,1483.96,--Well--
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1483.96,1486.133,I'd sort of leave it to the agency to figure out.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1486.133,1490.445,"--There's a second distinction, Your Honor, is that Holly owns the chickens."
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1505.876,1506.937,"Well, why is that material?"
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1508.908,1512.161,"--Well, in this particular case--"
1995.95-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1512.161,1514.121,He can even eat it and not be a farmer.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1514.311,1516.752,"--I would agree with that, Your Honor."
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1529.441,1544.711,"Yes, but I can raise some chickens and then rent them out to someone else, and at that point I'm saying, the farming's over for me, but I still own the chickens, so I don't see the materiality for the classification of the fact that I have title."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1544.711,1553.587,"--Well, I think the title of it bears on the fact that it shows that the relationship that Holly has to the chickens... by itself, I would agree with you that that would--"
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1553.587,1554.167,It shows it's a chicken owner.
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1554.167,1560.089,--But it also has to show that in conjunction with that it is engaged in the breeding and hatching of chicks.
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1560.98,1563.833,"It used to be, and it's finished."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1563.833,1580.174,"--And it performs... and another argument that I've not really had time to address is that the activities of the chicken catchers and forklift operators are actually primary agriculture, and they're actually harvesting the chickens within the regulations of the Secretary of Labor."
1995.95-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1580.174,1582.516,You're not going to spend a lot of time on that argument--
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1582.516,1584.477,"No, I'm not, because I don't have a lot of time."
1995.95-210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1588.691,1611.094,"--Mr. Roberts, as I understood your answer to my question in the very beginning you're saying this business about whether Holly is the farmer is only relevant to whether you can catch the live haul driver, because under any scenario, as you see this case, the chicken catchers and the forklift person have to be agricultural laborers."
1995.95-210,0,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,1611.094,1618.009,"--Obviously, that is our position, and it's our... I would agree it's our strongest argument, and that's why I keep emphasizing you have to separate the two."
1995.95-210,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1637.503,1639.415,"Very well, Mr. Roberts."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1642.116,1646.029,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-210,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1691.269,1700.055,"But as to the chicken catchers and the people who... the forklift operators, it is being done on a farm."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1700.055,1700.495,--That's right.
1995.95-210,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1700.495,1703.988,And it certainly is incidental to the farm operation.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1719.368,1720.898,That's correct.
1995.95-210,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1720.898,1732.886,It just seems to me that the position of the board is not reasonable in light of the language of the statute as to those two categories of workers.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1732.886,1750.508,"We believe that the work of the chicken catchers and forklift operators isn't incidental to the primary farming operations that go on on the farms where they do their activity, and one of the difficulties of petitioner's argument is that they avoid the statutory term, such."
1995.95-210,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1758.972,1765.677,"Well now, what's going on on the farm is growing the chickens for a certain period of time, isn't it?"
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1765.677,1767.439,"--That's right, and that process--"
1995.95-210,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1767.439,1773.833,"And that process requires getting rid of them after they're 49 days old, doesn't it?"
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1775.555,1776.196,--Absolutely.
1995.95-210,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1776.196,1779.578,And that's incidental to the operation they have.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1779.578,1779.659,And--
1995.95-210,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1779.659,1787.835,"It may also be incidental to processing, but it certainly, at a minimum, is incidental to the farming operation."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1787.835,1794.19,"--But in that sense of the term, incidental, the processing operation itself is also incidental to the farm."
1995.95-210,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1800.304,1802.825,"Does the statute use the term, processing?"
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1802.825,1805.056,"No, the statute does not."
1995.95-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.73,1841.12,Why is that?
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1901.892,1905.402,The answer to that I believe was suggested by Justice Breyer.
1995.95-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1917.029,1919.522,In neither case are they working for farmers.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1928.559,1928.999,That's right.
1995.95-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1928.999,1929.27,He's not a farmer.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1929.27,1959.319,"And the independent contractor example came up as a result of concerns on the part of some Senators with a situation that fell somewhere between farming and processing, and they were concerned with a firm that carved out a niche for itself by traveling from farm to farm performing a service on the farm for the farmer with regard to his or her commodities, and those firms were described as doing nothing but threshing wheat, or some other similar service."
1995.95-210,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1959.319,1962.252,"Well, they're not described that way in the statute."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,1982.746,1997.725,"That's correct, and we... but we believe that in terms of determining whether an activity is incidental to the primary farming operations that are going on on a farm, it's important to determine whether it's connected with some broader process."
1995.95-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2016.769,2026.135,"Your assumption, Mr. Seamon, is, and I'm sure you'll agree with this, but I'm not sure it's a correct assumption, is that you can only be incidental to one thing."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2032.587,2034.149,"No, we don't agree with that."
1995.95-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.149,2034.999,--I'm not sure I agree with that.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2034.999,2037.643,That's not a necessary premise of our argument.
1995.95-210,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2056.143,2065.109,"Well, Mr. Seamon, any farmer would tell you it's incidental to the farm operation to get those chickens out of there when they've reached the right age."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2077.516,2100.853,"--It's only incidental in the same sense that it's necessary for the farmer to find someone to sell the farmer's... the chickens to once they're grown, and that's... and whatever operations the purchaser performs on those chickens are part of the process that if there were no market for the chickens they wouldn't be grown at all in the first place, so in that sense, processing is--"
1995.95-210,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2100.853,2106.786,"Yes, but the statute itself refers to preparation for market, delivery, storage, et cetera."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2113.12,2121.606,--We are not saying... the board is not saying that chicken catching operations can never be incidental to primary farming.
1995.95-210,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2145.982,2159.35,"I don't want to belabor the point too much, but it certainly benefits the farmer to have the mature chickens moved out so the farmer can get more money by raising chicks again."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2163.663,2185.818,"--Yes, but again I would go back to the term ""such"" in the statute, because I believe that word is key here in the sense that it requires you to focus on the particular farming operations that we're talking about, and those operations are defined by contract as being limited to raising the chickens to a certain age and then making them available for processing."
1995.95-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2185.818,2202.319,"Suppose that Holly contracted out in the manner in this case only half of its chickens, and the other half it raises on its own, it has its own farms, and the chicken catchers spend half their time on Holly's own farms and half their time doing what they're doing in this case."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2204.12,2209.803,The answer would be the same with respect to both phases of the operation.
1995.95-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2214.748,2217.888,They would be processing even when they are on Holly's own farms?
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2217.888,2223.014,"--Yes, that's right, and again for the same reasons that exist on this case."
1995.95-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2227.765,2249.61,"No, no, my hypothetical is that they spent half their time on the farms where the chickens are raised from the very beginning to 49 days, and half the day they go out and work on Holly's farms engaging in this operation, and the other half the time they spend going out to these other farms as in this case."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2249.61,2261.669,"We would say that the time spent on both farms, on both kinds of farms would not be incidental to the farming operations there, if the facts were otherwise the same as they are in this case."
1995.95-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2261.669,2273.877,"And so then if 90 percent of their time was spent on Holly's own farms, and then 10 percent of their time doing this, the result would be that they would be farm workers then, or not?"
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2273.877,2280.99,"That they would not be farm workers there, and again, it is because of the way in which this work is organized."
1995.95-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2294.709,2299.373,"Well then, in my hypothetical, half of their time is spent where they're doing the growing themselves."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2299.373,2299.643,--Yes.
1995.95-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2299.643,2303.614,And the workers aren't engaging in farm work at that time either?
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2303.614,2304.555,"No, that's right."
1995.95-210,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.418,2326.481,May I just make sure I understand what you're saying?
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2342.47,2343.001,That's correct.
1995.95-210,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2351.847,2360.681,But if it were a totally independent chicken catcher who didn't... then what's the result?
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2360.681,2364.735,"In that case the work would be secondary to farming, and again, it is--"
1995.95-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2364.735,2369.307,Which means what you're saying is that it can only be incidental to one thing.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2389.721,2392.272,--I'm sorry if I'm not making it clear.
1995.95-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2408.254,2415.818,"The certain circumstances you're saying is the circumstance that it is not incidental to something else, namely incidental to processing."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2415.818,2435.271,"--Well, in a colloquial sense it's certainly true that things can be incidental to both one operation and another operation, and that's why part of the inquiry that's important under this Court's own decisions regarding the agricultural exemption is the way in which the work is organized."
1995.95-210,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2435.271,2452.592,"Let's assume the case in which you consider all the factors and you're on the fence, and you say, in this particular case there are good reasons to say it's incidental to such farming, and there are good reasons to say that it's incidental to slaughtering."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2455.755,2464.541,I think one of the most important determinants in that case is who are the employees employed by?
1995.95-210,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2464.541,2468.644,"Well, but no, I was assuming that was one of the good reasons."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2501.844,2502.405,That's right.
1995.95-210,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2512.282,2514.623,"Well, that comes from a couple of old cases."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2516.614,2523.589,Nonetheless... and we don't think that a tie-breaker needs to be applied in this case.
1995.95-210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2524.36,2545.584,"Mr. Seamon, are you saying that even if Holly Farms never has this contracting-out operation, so they did everything from hatching the chicks to raising them to bringing them to slaughter, even so, these employees would be typed by the board nonagricultural employees?"
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2545.584,2546.173,--Not necessarily.
1995.95-210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2557.282,2557.5,No.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2571.691,2578.794,"--Yes, then the answer to that would be that they would be involved in processing rather than agriculture."
1995.95-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2578.794,2581.906,"Okay, can I go back for a second... were you finished?"
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2619.32,2619.9,That's correct.
1995.95-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2619.9,2632.43,"Okay, and I take it that if Smith were either himself an independent contractor or worked for an independent contractor like the independent thresher, he would be an exempt agricultural laborer."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2632.43,2632.901,That's correct.
1995.95-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2632.901,2651.834,"And if, in fact, he happens to work for a firm which is in the business of grabbing chickens, transporting them, and turning them into sort of delicious packaged chicken, he does not become an agricultural laborer, he's not exempt."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2651.834,2653.333,"That's right, or in that--"
1995.95-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2653.333,2653.674,All right.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2692.349,2693.19,--That's right.
1995.95-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2693.19,2721.839,"All right, and so what we should look to, I guess, is what do the FLSA administrators think about this, and I have some regulations, and they talk about transporting plant employees, they talk about delivery to market, and they seem in talking about the transporting of plant employees that they're not exempt unless they're the employees of the farmer, i.e., of Brown."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2721.839,2723.097,That's correct.
1995.95-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2723.097,2728.621,"But they aren't too clear on that, and that's what I'd like you to address yourself to."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2753.619,2760.544,There are a series of regulations of the Department of Labor that address this situation.
1995.95-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2790.552,2793.456,So we've now got against you that it's secondary agriculture.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2793.456,2793.704,--Well--
1995.95-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2793.704,2794.415,So it's against you--
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2794.415,2794.725,"--No, I'm--"
1995.95-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2794.725,2796.646,--if they're employed by Farmer Brown.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2796.646,2798.128,"--Respectfully, I disagree."
1995.95-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2798.128,2798.519,No.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2798.519,2808.363,"What the regulation says is, it makes it conditional on whether the work is done as an incident to or in conjunction with the primary farming operations on that farm, so--"
1995.95-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2808.363,2810.717,"Well, the chicken-picking normally would be, wouldn't it?"
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2812.196,2818.522,"--That basic regulation requires an inquiry into, is this work incidental to primary farming operations?"
1995.95-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2865.913,2880.131,"I see, and if farming should develop so that farmers no longer feed their own hogs but there are hog-feeding companies, then the feeding of hogs would no longer be farming, is that right?"
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2880.131,2893.17,"That's quite possible, and this Court anticipated that very situation in the Farmers Reservoir Company, when it said, agriculture as an occupation includes more than the elemental processes of planting, growing, and harvesting."
1995.95-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.232,2913.724,Read the last sentence again.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2927.672,2928.943,"That's right, and--"
1995.95-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2928.943,2930.173,Isn't that right?
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2930.173,2930.574,"--Yes, that's right."
1995.95-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2930.574,2937.148,So the question is whether catching a chicken and putting him in a coop so he can be taken to market is the equivalent of feeding hogs or not.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2937.148,2950.217,"And I think it's clearly not, because if a firm were engaged simply in the work of going from farm to farm catching chickens, it wouldn't be ordinary to call the person who owns that business a farmer."
1995.95-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2950.217,2972.782,"All right, so if in fact the... I mean, you have to draw the line somewhere, and I guess people would think that transporting the chicken, coming and just taking the chicken and bringing it to the processing factory, that's fair enough to call not agriculture, but you've gone a little bit in the direction of feeding the hogs, because he's actually picking the chicken up, and that's not quite feeding the hog, but it's a step in that direction."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2972.782,2973.153,"Well, I--"
1995.95-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2973.153,2974.822,That's one problem.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2983.047,2996.769,"--Well, let me say a couple of more words about the regulation that specifically addresses the incidental-to requirement, because that is really the requirement on which we contend that petitioner's argument founders."
1995.95-210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3024.976,3036.193,"Could you just... what I was trying to do is, I'm just trying to list on my piece of paper all the regs that I want to be certain that I read, so I want to be sure that I have them all on that list, so just be sure you mentioned them all."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3046.942,3048.44,"Yes, that's correct."
1995.95-210,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3049.422,3052.785,"Is that the same reg that Justice Breyer just referred to, or is that somewhere else?"
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3052.785,3057.957,--It is not the same regulation as the one in which I'm talking about.
1995.95-210,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3059.688,3061.08,But it's in the brief.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3061.791,3064.342,--It is on page 27 of our gray brief on the merits.
1995.95-210,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3064.342,3065.882,Okay.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3065.882,3072.177,"And it is quoted towards the bottom of the page of our gray brief on the merits, page 27."
1995.95-210,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3117.918,3120.409,"But again, it's probably done for both."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3136.119,3155.222,"--Whether the... we would say that you have to look at some additional factors in that, however, and one of them would include the fact that there is a good reason why these chicken catching operations are employees of the processor rather than employees of the farmer."
1995.95-210,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3157.803,3171.661,"But under the statute, if it's on the farm, it doesn't matter who the employer is if it's on the farm and incidental to or in conjunction with such farming operation."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3176.455,3193.216,"--But the incidental-to requirement requires you to look at the relationship between the activity to be classified and the primary farming operation that goes on on that farm, and in looking at the relationship between those two activities, I would submit you also have to look at the relationship between the parties."
1995.95-210,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3211.659,3223.256,"Well, it's crystal clear that the language of the statute was included to bring in, for instance, the independent thresher and so forth."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3227.407,3236.015,And that independent contractor is described in the legislative history as limited to doing nothing but going from farm to farm threshing wheat for the farmer.
1995.95-210,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3246.411,3256.006,But don't you suppose the farmer here has to tell the chicken catchers the chickens that are 49 years old are in that particular area--
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3264.983,3268.236,--The record doesn't make that clear.
1995.95-210,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3279.012,3285.748,"But Mr. Seamon, we assume they're not going to show up at the farm and have the farmer just stand mute."
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3330.837,3331.516,That's right.
1995.95-210,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3331.516,3353.912,"And why don't you... I mean, why... don't you have a fair argument saying, look, we've got to have tie-breakers somewhere, somebody's got to figure out what they are, and this Department of Labor regulation has said, let's look to title, and therefore defer to the regulation, admitting that as a matter of language it could go either way?"
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3353.912,3361.946,"And certainly title is relevant, and the Court could decide to make title a tie-breaker, and the board--"
1995.95-210,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3361.946,3362.728,And we ought to defer to it.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3459.299,3460.739,--May I answer?
1995.95-210,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3460.739,3461.511,Yes.
1995.95-210,1,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3461.511,3464.713,The purpose of the statute is highly relevant.
1995.95-210,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3472.487,3474.119,"Thank you, Mr. Seamon."
1995.95-210,2,19870,charles_p_roberts_iii,,3477.161,3481.393,Just a couple of quick responses on some of these regs which have been referred to.
