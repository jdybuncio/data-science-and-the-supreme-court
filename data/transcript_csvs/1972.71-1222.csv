1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,33.562,37.82,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,842.184,847.359,Do you mean that Equal Protection Clause did not apply to state employees?
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,847.359,853.891,It does not apply to aliens seeking to obtain public employment.
1972.71-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,853.891,863.824,But you don’t take the position of the State is at from under the Fourteenth Amendment when it hires its own employees?
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,863.824,868.512,The Equal Protection Clause of course is applicable to the State.
1972.71-1222,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1107.144,1117.973,"Mr. Hirshowitz, are you going to come to the case of Graham against Richardson which I guess the three-judge District Court below relied on?"
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1117.973,1129.068,Graham against the Richardson did not involve any practice in New York.
1972.71-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1248.351,1256.345,"Mr. Hirshowitz, what do you -- how do you define the term that you’ve employed career civil service?"
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1256.345,1266.044,There are three grades of employment under New York States Civil Service and I think it is generally the rule.
1972.71-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1301.715,1307.774,"But on New York City, is his trash collected by the City?"
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1307.774,1310.854,"It is for residents, yes."
1972.71-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1310.854,1323.182,And the -- is the statute one that would require than the municipally employed trash collector to be a citizen of the United States?
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1323.182,1343.827,"Every employee of the city must be a citizen unless as I said coming within the exceptions of certification and incidentally they’ve only been in the City of the New York, they’ve been only 27 certifications of waiver of this citizenship requirement."
1972.71-1222,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1456.283,1470.089,Do you read Judge Lumbard’s concurrence as in effect a characterization of the Court’s opinion generally.
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1493.112,1501.229,I don’t know -- I don’t think they did the -- Lumbard -- Judge Lumbard was troubled by the decision.
1972.71-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1716.193,1719.423,That would apply to the trash collector?
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1719.423,1721.029,"It does, Your Honor."
1972.71-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1723.076,1725.354,He have dual citizenship problem?
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1725.354,1728.724,Not so long ago in Lerner against Casey.
1972.71-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1729.238,1731.171,What problem would he have?
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1735.842,1756.403,The trash collector could create as much problems as the conductor in Lerner against Casey where this Court held that a subway conductor was obligated to fill out a loyalty of the -- where do you stop when --
1972.71-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1756.403,1760.362,"That Truax against Raich, that’s where you stop."
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1760.362,1769.652,"Now, Truax against Raich merely held as I have pointed out that applies to persons in common occupations and as I indicated --"
1972.71-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1769.652,1777.329,"Do you say that State of New York could not pass a law, prohibiting the employment of aliens by anybody?"
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1778.541,1779.405,"No, sir."
1972.71-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.405,1784.757,"But they could pass a law that said, “we will not employ aliens in our state government.”"
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1784.757,1785.372,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1785.372,1786.929,And you don’t see any problem?
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1786.929,1801.515,"No, problem at all because it is the -- that is the way this country once said this country could not be run by aliens and addition to what's the -- and Mr. Justice Marshall --"
1972.71-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1801.515,1806.325,Do you think this country could exist if every trash collector in New York was alien?
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1808.666,1808.964,Any person --
1972.71-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1808.964,1810.991,That’s just my personal view.
1972.71-1222,0,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1810.991,1811.323,Yes.
1972.71-1222,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1872.868,1888.742,Thank you for eventually getting round to it.
1972.71-1222,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1888.742,1889.811,Thank you Mr. Hirshowitz.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,1891.46,1895.141,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1222,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1942.125,1946.456,Do I understand by your opening statement that you therefore disagree with the --
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,1946.456,1947.387,The remarks on --
1972.71-1222,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1947.387,1948.93,-- the concurring opinion in this case?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,1948.93,1949.939,"Yes, I do."
1972.71-1222,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2026.466,2028.236,That is elective?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2028.734,2039.71,"Well, what I'm saying how -- it includes elective plus heads of departments and appointments by the Governor directly, executive appointments and it includes appointments by the legislature for various jobs."
1972.71-1222,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2039.71,2043.64,So far as the law of New York goes to the Governor New York could be as a --
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2043.64,2044.087,Must be a citizen.
1972.71-1222,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2044.087,2046.181,"He could be a citizen of Japan, could he?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2046.181,2046.486,No.
1972.71-1222,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2055.513,2056.623,Everybody in elective office?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2056.623,2057.353,In elective office.
1972.71-1222,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2057.353,2058.206,At every level?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2058.206,2058.976,At every level.
1972.71-1222,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2058.976,2060.414,To be a citizen of what? Of the United States?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2060.414,2061.362,Of the United States.
1972.71-1222,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2061.362,2061.831,And of the State of New York.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2061.831,2068.127,"And of the State of New York, residency of the State of New York in varying degrees depending upon the position involved."
1972.71-1222,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2070.34,2072.19,But none can be a resident alien?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2072.19,2083.139,"None can be a resident alien under the Constitution of the State of New York, however, under the unclassified designation within the civil service statute."
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2126.122,2126.604,"Well, may --"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2126.604,2127.297,I'm sorry.
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2127.297,2132.005,May the State excludes the aliens from running for office in New York?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2132.005,2136.717,It would seem to me quite clearly under the Constitution of the State of New York that you are required to be a citizen to run for office.
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.717,2137.732,"Well, I know about that."
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2143.895,2147.146,My personal attitude is that I have difficulty with that.
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.425,2150.073,How about the aliens voting?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2150.073,2152.346,I think that aliens certainly should have the right to vote.
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.673,2154.06,"So, the aliens don’t have the right to vote?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2154.06,2156.103,They don’t have the right to vote in New York State.
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.103,2169.039,"And assume those provisions that are for voting and for running for office are valid under the Equal Protection Clause, would that make your case any tougher?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2169.039,2169.708,No.
1972.71-1222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2207.15,2210.328,"[Voice Overlap] even the language of the Fourteenth Amendment, Mr. Evens?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2210.328,2217.426,"No, I find it in the cases and I refer specifically in most recent case in Graham versus Richardson."
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2254.052,2259.904,Let’s assume that that the requirement that of course to be a citizen to vote is valid under the protection to vote.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2259.904,2260.796,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2260.796,2270.219,And the justification is that you do not want the political up rightist to be in control of aliens.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2287.578,2288.448,The initial position --
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2288.448,2294.921,He might even run and say that a fortiori they shouldn’t be entitled to?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2294.921,2303.51,"Except if I may just point out, we are here challenging Section 53 of the New York State Civil Service Statute."
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2331.773,2335.025,"That’s a matter of a choice by the State, is it not?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2335.025,2335.49,Pardon?
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2335.49,2338.508,It’s a matter of choice by the State?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2338.508,2341.301,Or by the Executive who has the certainly that prerogative to act --
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2341.301,2345.539,Which are not -- we’re talking about the compulsion of the Fourteenth Amendment?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2345.539,2352.727,"However, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that that’s relevant to exactly the issue that’s involved here."
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2386.283,2394.635,What about the federal statute which has been reproduced at page 40 of the -- of your friend’s brief?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2398.043,2404.317,Is that the statute that was recently amended in 1970 or 1971?
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2404.317,2406.446,Its 1972 which would appear --
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2406.446,2407.96,1972.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2423.033,2426.478,Do you think this -- the federal statute is unconstitutional?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2426.478,2429.611,"Yes, Your Honor I do."
1972.71-1222,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2429.611,2446.726,"Mr. Evens, let me follow through with one thing more, I take it from your answer to Justice White that you were troubled by the provisions of a New York Constitution requiring that elective office holders be citizens?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2448.957,2449.454,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1222,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2489.728,2493.11,"Well, now in the Federal Constitution we have citizenship requirements --"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2493.11,2493.281,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2493.281,2496.399,For the President and members of the Congress.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2496.399,2496.793,"Congress, yes."
1972.71-1222,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2496.793,2498.491,Both Senate and House.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2498.491,2498.648,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2498.648,2505.987,Are you equally troubled by those provisions in the light of the more the later enacted Fourteenth Amendment?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2505.987,2521.114,"Well, in that situation I would have to respond and I don’t mean to be evasive that I don’t see the mechanism or the device to do anything concerning that other than the method of repeal."
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2556.528,2567.817,"Well, what's wrong with relying on the Fourteenth Amendment to repeal the provision of the President of United States must be a native born American citizen?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2567.817,2570.795,"Well, I have -- I must start --"
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2570.795,2590.802,"Before you start -- when you start down that road, suppose a citizen of Venezuela who came up here and like the country but wanted to keep his citizenship in Venezuela filed for the President of United States, and the issue might arise when he was trying to run in an State primary let us say."
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2599.071,2603.309,If I may.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2696.794,2698.948,"In other words, he wants to keep his options open?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2698.948,2699.676,No.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2783.526,2788.13,"On your theory, you’ve just told us I thought that they should be entitled to vote?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2788.13,2788.339,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2788.339,2790.534,And that they are entitled to run for public office?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2790.534,2792.041,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2792.041,2794.697,Isn’t that keeping options open?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2794.697,2801.336,It may keep options open but I certainly doesn’t -- don’t -- do not think that it is necessary their intention to keep these options open.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2826.626,2831.894,What about an alien who came here and then returned to his native land.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2836.726,2838.571,No.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2839.933,2843.75,[Voice Overlap] doesn’t make him a non-resident alien on your theory?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2843.75,2846.502,I -- there is a distinction between a resident and non-resident alien.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2846.502,2847.341,On your theory?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2847.341,2847.38,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2847.38,2850.65,I thought there is in law but what's your theory of the difference?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2850.65,2868.701,"Our theory has been that the resident aliens involved the name plaintiffs and the class they represent in this proceeding at people who are participating as viable members of the State of New York had live their legally and lawfully, had designated New York as their residence."
1972.71-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2881.559,2892.47,Is there anything that you can think of any right that a citizen could possibly have that you wouldn’t urge that an alien would also have?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2892.47,2896.187,It would be very difficult for me to answer that question.
1972.71-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2897.522,2900.524,Pray tell what is the benefit of American citizenship?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2900.524,2906.845,"Well, the benefit of the American citizenship for one essentially sets forth a political benefit."
1972.71-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2908.147,2909.825,"Well, I thought you said they should have right --"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2909.825,2910.843,Well --
1972.71-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2910.843,2912.611,-- empathy?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2912.611,2927.692,"What I'm saying is it that, this is a country that has granted refuge to political refugees and the -- well, let me withdraw that."
1972.71-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2937.127,2942.714,I probably note (Inaudible) to better end then we didn’t need the Fourteenth Amendment?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2942.714,2947.513,If people were not discriminated against and if the Equal Protection Rights were not violated.
1972.71-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2947.513,2950.165,What did Amendment give citizenship to people?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2954.698,2956.153,"It was my understanding, yes."
1972.71-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2958.671,2963.168,The trouble is how far you go away from the issue that’s in this case?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,2963.168,2966.165,"Well, I do not intend to go away from the issue of this case."
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3047.485,3053.449,"But it would make any difference what their race was, if they were coming from the south to the north, if they were people here?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3053.449,3074.93,"Well, if they came from -- if they came from adjoining states of Connecticut or New Jersey or Pennsylvania, if they were black and the statute said that blacks could not be a civil service employees because they are unstable and because they are disloyal or they have loyalty to the State that they came from."
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3076.181,3079.402,"Of course, that’s doesn’t have anything to do with this case, does it?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3079.402,3086.304,It does in the sense that the classifications’ concerning aliens is tantamount to a classification concerning race.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3086.304,3088.112,Where did this Court ever say that?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3088.112,3091.547,It is my understanding that’s exactly what the Court said in Graham v. Richardson --
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3091.547,3093.127,For purposes?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3093.127,3098.344,For purposes of the degree of judicial scrutiny on the Equal Protection Clause.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3098.344,3098.77,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3101.012,3101.136,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3101.136,3112.016,-- which means nothing more or less has as I think Chief Justice Warren said that we scrutinized the line drawing and the basis of the classification very carefully.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3112.016,3113.89,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3113.89,3114.205,But --
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3114.205,3119.387,More strictly than would be if it were a matter not a grace.
1972.71-1222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3119.387,3127.305,"One factual distinction Mr. Evens is that your clients presumably have it within their own power to change their status, don’t they?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3128.195,3130.042,"Yes, they certainly do."
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3283.291,3301.169,Would you think Mr. Evens the -- what would you think of the statute of the State of New York that will have a limitation to the employment of people in these categories who had signified their intention to become citizens by having filed the first application?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3305.111,3306.833,If that requirement were in there?
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3306.833,3307.383,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3307.383,3309.977,I incidentally there is a statute that does.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3364.589,3368.277,We aren’t -- we haven’t found that the reasons that are argued.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3368.277,3369.222,"No, I understand that."
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3369.222,3373.192,"The Court of Appeals, the three-judge court didn’t rest on any significance --"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3373.192,3400.679,"No, it didn’t but the reason that I point this out is it that even using a close judicial examination of what the legisla -- what was the purpose of the legislation really does not permit the statute to survive the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause and that the examples for the arguments made by the appellants are themselves invidious."
1972.71-1222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3401.843,3413.149,"Mr. Evens, one of the fact situations you described is that of Mr. Dougall who plans if the Government changes in Guiana to return."
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3439.623,3443.582,"However, I'm not so sure that if citizen might not subject to it."
1972.71-1222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3444.57,3447.555,"Well, assuming that no citizens are going back to Guiana?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3447.555,3451.81,"No, but a citizen might go back to New Jersey or to Washington District Court."
1972.71-1222,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3455.761,3462.055,"No, but most people haven’t left New Jersey or Connecticut to come to New York as political refugees?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3462.055,3462.708,No.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3553.064,3558.586,But I recall that you do make a distinction between resident and non-resident aliens?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3558.586,3559.536,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3564.989,3565.962,Do you accept that?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3565.962,3566.509,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3571.509,3571.564,In other words if --
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3571.564,3586.029,People come here on short term visas as tourists and I certainly don’t think that they would be certainly be entitled to the kinds of prerogatives that a citizen or a resident alien would be entitled to.
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3601.947,3609.732,"But the State or National Government excludes aliens, excludes your clients to military service?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3612.598,3616.953,Under the present law or could they enact the law saying aliens --
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3616.953,3624.032,To say that they are just disqualified from working from the Government and the Military Service?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3624.032,3627.731,"Well, it sounds very similar to a Civil Service Statute."
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3635.585,3636.294,I agree with you.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3636.294,3646.369,"And now using it from the other point of view, I would have to presume that to be a form of Government employment or public employment, and therefore I think that it would equally objectionable."
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3646.369,3651.92,And just like across the board as far as Government employment is concerned?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3651.92,3660.18,"Provided, provided as long as the statutes of the State of New York say that the person closest to the Governor."
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3671.074,3675.001,So your position is limited to the peculiarities of the New York Law.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3679.45,3680.592,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3680.592,3681.879,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3681.879,3682.655,I would.
1972.71-1222,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3682.655,3685.59,"So, it really doesn’t make much difference about the Government?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3685.59,3690.296,"No, I am just trying to point out the anomalies in the argument of the appellants."
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3690.296,3690.606,"Well, does that --"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3690.606,3708.409,How can they argue -- how can they argue the necessity for making policy decisions by someone who on the one hand to use the analogy the Court has used today of a garbage collector or the analogy on the other hand a biologist to who happens to be working with fungus on let’s say tobacco leaves or whatever.
1972.71-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3708.409,3717.619,Can you imagine a Governor of a State in this country today appointing somebody to high government office who wasn’t a voter?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3717.619,3719.108,Who is not a citizen?
1972.71-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3719.108,3720.997,"No, he was not a voter --"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3720.997,3724.841,"Can you appoint him to high government office, if he was not a voter?"
1972.71-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3724.841,3725.776,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3725.776,3729.815,Do you mean an office such as to fill a vacancy on the bench or to fill a --
1972.71-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3729.815,3730.847,Any.
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3730.847,3736.587,He could not to fill a vacancy on the bench or could not to fill a vacancy in the legislature.
1972.71-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3736.587,3741.76,But you said there were some high positions that the Government would appoint an alien to?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3741.76,3742.539,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3742.539,3749.891,"And I'm asking you, you name me the position that any Governor would appoint a non-voter too."
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3749.891,3753.157,I know no Governor who would do that for a many other reasons.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3758.928,3772.578,But with this -- with your constitutional objections to this statute disappear then if the statute said that this could be waived under certain circumstances?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3772.578,3780.323,The -- my objection is to the classification and it would exists regardless to what modifications there might be by legislation.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3790.493,3796.409,"Well, all New Yorkers said about this Governor’s aides that hypothetical people you're talking about?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3796.409,3797.345,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3797.345,3800.832,Are that Governor may appoint some of them if he wants to?
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3800.832,3801.347,Yes.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3801.347,3812.001,"Now, what if in the civil service they said that the head of the agency may appoint some aliens who rank in the first three of the civil service if they want to?"
1972.71-1222,1,34380,lester_evens,,3817.047,3831.203,I have some difficulty with that because I think that once we get into qualifications and making divisions then we are no longer performing a judicial function.
1972.71-1222,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3903.422,3904.583,Very well.
