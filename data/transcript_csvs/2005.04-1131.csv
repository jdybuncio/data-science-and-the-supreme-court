2005.04-1131,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.782,We'll hear argument first today in Whitman v. Department of Transportation.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,6.142,7.553,Thank you.
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,24.276,25.803,We're not bound by that concession.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,31.179,31.745,No.
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,36.061,36.971,That's a different question.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,36.971,49.752,"--So the question before the Court is not whether, I think, Mr. Whitman can receive constitutional judicial review, but rather, where and how he is supposed to do so."
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,49.752,52.684,I still think it's whether because I don't agree with the Government.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,54.528,55.888,"Of course, you can."
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,55.888,57.049,So that is the question.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,59.404,59.754,Yes.
2005.04-1131,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,74.621,75.204,Was it raised?
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,79.137,84.347,It was raised in the district court and the Government chose not to raise it in the court of appeals or here.
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,91.067,97.037,"--But our cases say that where we don't speak to a jurisdictional question, it is not regarded as having been decided."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,97.037,97.203,No.
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,107.955,112.953,"Even... even if you assume that Von Raab decided it, you have a quite different situation here."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,144.744,145.427,No.
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.19,194.39,"He could have refused... he could have refused the search, in which case if there was any significant personnel action taken against him for refusing it, he would have had judicial review of whether the search was constitutional or not."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,194.39,198.089,"Yes, Justice Scalia, but he would have to bet the ranch to do it."
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,198.689,209.508,"That's often the case where... where, in... in order to challenge a governmental action, you... you have to be willing to... to go to court by resisting it."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,209.508,214.301,"--Justice Scalia, I think that's incorrect when it comes to Government agency actions of this kind."
2005.04-1131,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,259.998,278.138,"Even though if... if... do you concede that if he had, for example, refused the testing and been fired and it was a major personnel action, he would have to go through the statutory procedures before bringing that... the constitutional claim on review of those administrative procedures?"
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,278.138,279.993,"--Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1131,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,279.993,297.354,"Well, doesn't it seem odd... and this is sort of the logic of... in Fausto and some of the other cases... that when you have a major action, you have to exhaust before you can go into court, but if you have something that doesn't qualify as a major adverse action, you get to go to court right away?"
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,297.354,302.33,"I can see why that might seem at first a little strange to you, Your Honor."
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.617,331.416,But that search was a consequence of his employment.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,352.904,354.431,"No, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,366.094,369.282,Do you think it becomes unconstitutional when... when you have one more test?
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,373.898,374.748,"--No, Your Honor."
2005.04-1131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,382.878,384.306,How many tests did he have?
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,384.306,389.348,"--Well, he alleges in his complaint that he was subjected to 13 tests, and then when he complained--"
2005.04-1131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,389.348,390.442,Over what period of time?
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,390.442,397.597,--Over a period of time of approximately 5 years in which other employees were subjected to no more than one or two.
2005.04-1131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,397.597,398.424,So it's maybe three... three a year?
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,399.124,400.268,"Yes, but he was picked--"
2005.04-1131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,400.268,401.029,And that's unconstitutional?
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,401.029,402.623,"--No, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-1131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,407.071,408.499,"Well, somebody will be if it's random."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,419.417,420.695,"Right, and--"
2005.04-1131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,420.695,425.06,"--whether he has a good constitutional claim here I guess is rather doubtful, and maybe it is--"
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,425.06,425.893,"--Well, he may well not."
2005.04-1131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,441.606,442.2,--What are they?
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,446.171,447.248,--I... I tried to do it and I couldn't do it.
2005.04-1131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,447.248,447.826,--in the Federal Government?
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,447.826,448.426,"Well, it wouldn't--"
2005.04-1131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,448.426,451.264,All you do is you get a bell curve and you ask the Library of Congress and they'll do it--
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,451.264,452.774,"--Well, right, but it would be... I... I know."
2005.04-1131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,455.562,455.906,--No.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,457.234,457.767,But it's high.
2005.04-1131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,457.767,458.928,But it's not hard to do.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,462.443,464.004,It's the undergraduates that know how to do that.
2005.04-1131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,464.004,464.32,--All right.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,475.29,475.723,Right.
2005.04-1131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,475.723,479.916,"But I find it hard, in reading this, to believe the following."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,520.57,522.097,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-1131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,544.513,551.233,"I thought your position, Ms. Karlan, was that he doesn't even have to ask the union."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,559.547,560.297,That's right.
2005.04-1131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,560.297,564.079,But I think your position is he doesn't have to ask at all.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,568.279,569.473,That's correct.
2005.04-1131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,609.361,611.471,"Well, why... why can't he?"
2005.04-1131,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,611.471,612.132,Why not?
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,635.314,639.774,"--Well, I have two somewhat different answers to your question, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-1131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,706.132,713.518,"Yes, but that simply means that the grievance procedure is more valuable in this case than merely talking to his supervisor."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,734.773,743.337,"Well, if his union had negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that required exhaustion, then it would be appropriate to make him go through it, but they didn't do that."
2005.04-1131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,743.337,743.803,"No, but... no... no question."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,749.89,764.925,"Well, if I could go through the grievance process, I think you'll see why this grievance process cannot be turned into an exhaustion process without this Court, in words that Justice Ginsburg used last week, inserting a lot of carets into the statute."
2005.04-1131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,794.81,798.659,"He may not have any right to it, but in fact, he may get some relief."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,798.659,799.076,--Well--
2005.04-1131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,799.076,801.847,"The union may say, okay, we're going to take this one on."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,801.847,817.725,"--They may and I'll turn to that in just a moment, but let me add one more thing to the answer I was giving a moment ago to Justice Ginsburg, which is one of the problems here is that our client alleges in his supplemental complaint that when he first complained about this, he was singled out yet again for retaliatory testing."
2005.04-1131,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,825.707,829.505,"Well, Ms. Karlan, let me put one other element in here."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,836.809,839.23,--He was... he wasn't told.
2005.04-1131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,904.411,919.456,"Well, why isn't the thing to do here... I... I see that you are raising a significant question in respect to... at least in my view, in respect to the... an action that violates a regulation that violates a statute."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,971.113,971.873,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,971.873,981.199,"Well, why isn't it, at that stage if he doesn't get into court, you then say that that isn't true?"
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,988.669,991.79,"Well, there are two reasons for that I think."
2005.04-1131,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1013.111,1018.355,"You... you... I... I believe that there are millions of instances, perhaps."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1040.853,1056.653,"Absolutely, and I think if you used this Court's opinion in Madigan against McCarthy as your template for thinking about whether to impose an exhaustion requirement here, because I think, quite frankly, that's what you would be doing... you would be imposing one that doesn't exist now."
2005.04-1131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1056.653,1057.564,"Well, but the... the--"
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1057.564,1058.097,The Court--
2005.04-1131,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1058.097,1063.952,--the whole right to... to go into court with a constitutional claim is absent from the statute.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1076.048,1086.55,"--I... I don't think so, Justice Souter, because I think this Court has traditionally allowed individuals who are bringing constitutional claims for injunctive relief to seek that relief."
2005.04-1131,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1151.397,1164.688,"--But the grievance procedure covers it, and you took pains to point out to us that when you go to the grievance procedure, you're not necessarily entitled to findings and... and written conclusions, et cetera."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1187.192,1198.456,"Justice Kennedy, all sorts of personnel actions might be minor and they might be the kind of thing that the CSRA wants to have decided administratively only or through exhaustion."
2005.04-1131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1208.447,1209.524,I have to interrupt you.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1211.879,1225.753,"--The Fourth Amendment violation here is this Court said that warrantless, suspicionless drug testing of Federal employees is acceptable only if it has safeguards that ensure that there is no discretion exercised in the field and that it's truly random."
2005.04-1131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.753,1232.806,"As I understand, the allegations are that there was random procedure in effect, and he thinks maybe he's been tested more frequently than some other people."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1233.256,1233.689,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-1131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.761,1259.543,"Well, but as I understand it, the... the system as a whole is not challenged as violating the Fourth Amendment."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1259.543,1259.909,--No.
2005.04-1131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1263.758,1268.201,By having him take more tests than would be produced by a purely random selection.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1268.201,1268.734,That's correct.
2005.04-1131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1270.045,1271.905,Have we ever said that's a Fourth Amendment violation?
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1271.905,1274.921,"--Of course, it is because you can't conduct a random--"
2005.04-1131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.921,1278.359,"If the computer malfunctions, that's a Fourth Amendment violation?"
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1278.359,1278.775,--No.
2005.04-1131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1288.612,1295.748,"But the relief that he requested was to do a little more testing to see whether he was being tested more than the average person, as I understand it."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1295.748,1296.198,"--Well... well, yes."
2005.04-1131,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1298.636,1302.135,Which is not... did not seem to me to be alleging a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1302.135,1302.668,No.
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1316.92,1323.39,"Ms.... Ms. Karlan, if this is indeed serious, are you sure that it's not a personnel action?"
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1323.39,1324.44,Yes.
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.44,1335.986,"There is a residual category in the definition of personnel action which says, any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1356.497,1358.252,"Well, two answers to that."
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.068,1378.578,I'm not adding it.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1390.509,1391.425,--With all respect--
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1391.425,1394.541,"And he thought he didn't have to undergo drug testing, and what do you know?"
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1397.312,1418.95,"--Well, with all respect, Your Honor, I think you would have to overrule the Fort Stewart School against FLRA case that the Court decided in 1990 to define working conditions to include a drug test because there... and it's cited at page 28 of the NTEU's brief... the Court says that the term, working conditions, refers to, quote, circumstances or states of affairs attendant to one's performance of a job."
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1436.206,1444.354,Why then would a decision to order psychiatric testing qualify?
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1448.025,1448.636,--That's--
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.636,1452.501,"Significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1462.093,1472.495,"--But if the... but if Congress, Justice Scalia, had thought that that catchall phrase covered psychiatric tests, it would not have amended the statute in 1994 to add them specifically."
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1472.495,1473.661,It's always good to be safe.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1473.661,1478.205,"Well, yes, and it's good for the FAA to comply with the Constitution."
2005.04-1131,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1480.726,1487.036,"Ms.... Ms. Karlan, you have a... a statutory claim that essentially mirrors the constitutional claim."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1504.674,1509.885,I don't think that there would be a difference with respect to exhaustion on those two claims.
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1521.314,1524.996,"And you... you agree with the Government on that, that he can never get review of the statutory claim."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1524.996,1525.663,"--Oh, no."
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1525.663,1526.257,"Oh, well."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1526.257,1527.934,We spend rather a bit of time in our brief explaining--
2005.04-1131,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1527.934,1530.539,"Well, don't... don't appeal to them on a... on a point on which you don't agree with them."
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1531.205,1534.487,--What can I... what can I say?
2005.04-1131,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1534.487,1536.348,I still don't understand how they proceed.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1544.146,1546.174,The answer to that would be yes.
2005.04-1131,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.627,1555.826,So the identical claims have to proceed under two different routes.
2005.04-1131,0,38065,pamela_s_karlan,,1555.826,1556.326,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-1131,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1563.229,1564.723,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1573.299,1575.476,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1702.743,1704.687,"Mr. Stewart, can I just ask one question?"
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1719.388,1725.175,"--There would have been, at least for this employee, by virtue of the fact that he was covered by a collective bargaining agreement."
2005.04-1131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1725.175,1726.308,Through the collective bargaining--
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1726.308,1726.685,Yes.
2005.04-1131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1726.685,1732.078,"--But then supposing the union is unwilling to grieve or take it up or he fails, then what happens?"
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1732.078,1745.752,"If... if he requests that the union take the grievance to arbitration and then to the FLRA and the union refuses, our position would be that he could then file suit in Federal district court under the Administrative Procedure Act on his constitutional challenge alone."
2005.04-1131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1747.43,1748.774,And it would be in the district court.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1748.774,1749.968,--That would be in the district court--
2005.04-1131,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1749.968,1753.9,"Now, that is if... if the union doesn't agree to arbitration?"
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1753.9,1758.015,--That is if the union does not agree to take the case to arbitration and then to the FLRA.
2005.04-1131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1758.776,1765.912,"So your difference... what's separating you and Whitman, it seems, is a question of timing."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1779.103,1780.364,--I think--
2005.04-1131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1780.364,1786.173,--and... and it's based on the Government's waiver of sovereign immunity for nonmonetary claims.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1786.173,1788.928,"--It is in part one of timing, but it's not one of timing alone."
2005.04-1131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.44,1845.201,"Mr. Stewart, you know, you have here a statute in which Congress, with malice aforethought, very clearly provides for judicial review of any major personnel actions and does not provide for judicial review of what it had regarded as insignificant personnel actions."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1895.846,1904.921,"--I mean, first, certainly if Congress had said with absolute clarity that district court review of claims like this is precluded, we would defend the statute as constitutional."
2005.04-1131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1933.313,1941.644,Did any of them involve a situation in which Congress took the pain to separate significant actions from insignificant actions?
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1941.644,1942.988,"I mean, in some sense the CSRA--"
2005.04-1131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.988,1946.254,"I mean, some of them involve deportation and, you know, major... major actions."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1957.606,1967.758,--But I... I think the flip side of it is that some of those cases involved statutes that appeared on their face to function as express preclusions of judicial review.
2005.04-1131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1977.517,1986.481,"But I'm... I'm not sure what the congressional intent would be to bifurcate the constitutional and the statutory claims, especially if they're the same thing."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1986.481,1990.179,"--I don't know that there was necessarily an intent to bifurcate, but I think we had the same--"
2005.04-1131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1990.179,1992.117,"Well, that's what... that's what you're asking us to say."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1992.117,1994.722,--I think the Court had the same situation in Webster v. Doe.
2005.04-1131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2045.285,2052.616,"But if... if... under... under your explanation of how the system works, you go to district court with a constitutional claim."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2056.715,2057.398,No.
2005.04-1131,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2060.585,2061.447,"Well, that's what I mean."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2066.889,2086.289,"--I... I agree that it's an unusual system, but I think it... and in a sense the same situation would have been present in Webster v. Doe, that is, the Court, when it came to review the merits of the constitutional challenge, wouldn't have had any possibility of deciding the case on a nonconstitutional basis because nonconstitutional challenges would be foreclosed."
2005.04-1131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2086.806,2094.386,"I thought your position on the statute was that it doesn't afford a right of action, that it was just an instruction to the Secretary."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2102.0,2102.8,--Yes.
2005.04-1131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2102.8,2107.843,I thought that the Government's position was there's no right of action under that statute.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2107.843,2112.342,There's no private right of action conferred by 45-108 itself.
2005.04-1131,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2170.119,2192.635,"Now, as to that, if... if there were a petitioner with some constitutional claim... let's not get into the debate about significant or non significant... covered by the collective bargaining agreement, you say the petitioner can't go to court with the constitutional claim unless he first persuades the union to seek arbitration."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2192.635,2193.101,No.
2005.04-1131,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2208.513,2208.863,All right.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2213.74,2216.0,We didn't characterize it as an exhaustion argument.
2005.04-1131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2259.687,2260.203,All right.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2282.269,2283.863,"Well, they would first have to get into court first."
2005.04-1131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2284.38,2284.874,"No, no."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2327.139,2331.271,"--I... I mean, again with the caveat they would first have to avail themselves of the administrative--"
2005.04-1131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2331.271,2331.915,"No, they wouldn't."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2353.092,2357.285,"--I mean, I think you're... you're correct that you could do that in the general run of cases under the administrative--"
2005.04-1131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2357.285,2357.668,Yes.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2386.61,2387.371,--No.
2005.04-1131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2391.636,2392.036,Yes.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2392.036,2396.929,--will ordinarily be available for a constitutional claim with the remedial scheme established by the CSRA--
2005.04-1131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2396.929,2398.867,You think they could not do that under 705.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2435.422,2436.766,--That's correct.
2005.04-1131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2436.766,2439.705,"Now, my question is do we have to decide that."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2487.163,2487.574,No.
2005.04-1131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2503.041,2508.151,"So we have to say the easier matter is it's clear that as to such matters, you must exhaust."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2523.369,2533.787,"--Well, certainly to... I mean, that is, justifiably to impose an exhaustion requirement, the Court would have to find that the... the exhaustion principle is in some sense implicit in the CSRA."
2005.04-1131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2533.787,2534.254,All right.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2535.798,2548.806,"And I think if there's ample basis for the Court to do that... that is, one of the noteworthy features of the CSRA is that the act authorizes judicial review of a wide category of Government actions in different courts under different circumstances."
2005.04-1131,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2555.659,2560.735,"Well, is... is... should it be a little bit of a concern to us that the lower court didn't address it?"
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2564.7,2578.458,"--I mean, I think it's clear... it... it is clear and undisputed that the plaintiff was advised by the FLRA that the grievance procedure was his available remedy and declined to invoke even the initial step of the grievance procedure, and therefore--"
2005.04-1131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2578.458,2581.329,But that was on the view that it was an exclusive remedy.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2603.912,2610.215,--But I think... I think that's why I said earlier that there was some element of untidiness to our position.
2005.04-1131,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2624.766,2626.926,So you... you have picked one way to do that.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2655.418,2660.027,"--I... I mean, we would... we would resist the notion that we're making it all up."
2005.04-1131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2674.746,2675.062,"Yes, I--"
2005.04-1131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2675.062,2675.74,What's the second statute?
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2694.722,2704.131,"--There is a... a second statute, and it's the Administrative Procedure Act, which would generally allow an individual who is aggrieved by a Federal Government action to file suit in Court."
2005.04-1131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2711.851,2721.953,"Mr. Stewart, if you assume the APA is the remedy... we're talking about a district court procedure... how would you describe the final agency action that would be challenged in that lawsuit?"
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2721.953,2728.756,"--I mean, it really depends upon the extent to which... it really depends on where the administrative procedures go."
2005.04-1131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.751,2734.283,"Let's assume that the... he seeks a grievance, and the union refuses to grieve."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2741.103,2743.524,--The final... it's... it's a little bit hard to define.
2005.04-1131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2744.785,2745.702,Very hard to define.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2745.702,2750.994,--It... it would in some sense be the allegedly unconstitutional drug test that he's already been required to take.
2005.04-1131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2752.188,2753.616,So what would his relief be?
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2754.943,2755.193,--Exactly.
2005.04-1131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2755.976,2757.714,Because he can't damages under the APA.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2757.714,2776.614,"--One of the things that makes this tricky is that under this Court's decision of City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, if an individual is subjected to allegedly unconstitutional conduct but has no reason to believe that it will happen to him again and damages are unavailable, then the... there is no standing to seek injunctive--"
2005.04-1131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2776.614,2780.896,"--But... but here, that's not this case because he said, when I complained, they did it again."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2780.896,2781.463,--That's right.
2005.04-1131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2801.873,2803.034,But that's not a final agency action.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2806.267,2839.29,"I would certainly think that if... if there were no question of CSRA preclusion, if we were just looking at the APA standing alone, and an individual said they've done this unconstitutional thing to me time after time, my supervisor has ransacked my office time and again or FBI agents have shown up at my door every day and have insisted on searching, I think even if damages were unavailable for the prior unlawful actions, at some point we would say the likelihood of repetition is sufficiently imminent that a right of action should be available in court."
2005.04-1131,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2891.107,2907.153,If the dispute were to go to arbitration... there are very limited provisions for judicial review in the event there is a decision... could the constitutional claim still go to court?
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2907.153,2920.099,"--The constitutional claim could go to court, and what... what we've sketched out in the brief is two alternative routes for judicial review in the event that the grievance was processed to its conclusion, that is, a finding by the FLRA."
2005.04-1131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2955.371,2961.581,Am I right that the statute as written says you don't have any judicial review for these kinds of actions?
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2966.374,2969.162,It doesn't say you have no judicial review.
2005.04-1131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2980.908,2983.53,The statute does not provide for judicial review--
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2983.53,2983.846,"Exactly, but the--"
2005.04-1131,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2983.846,2986.801,--as it does in the case of major actions.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2986.801,2998.215,--But the statute... the CSRA does not say... does not purport to divest the courts of the authority that they would otherwise have under different statutes to adjudicate challenges to employment decisions.
2005.04-1131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2998.631,3009.633,"Mr. Stewart, if... if we're going to tweak the statute, isn't the least possible tweak... and perhaps not a tweak at all... simply to consider this a personnel action?"
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3009.633,3012.505,--If the Court--
2005.04-1131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.505,3022.407,"If... if a decision to order psychiatric testing can be one, why can't a decision to require drug testing be one?"
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3022.407,3023.917,--That... that would be a possible tweak.
2005.04-1131,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3025.095,3027.039,I'm not sure it's a tweak at all.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3037.014,3039.119,--I think that would be a basis for dismissal in this case.
2005.04-1131,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3043.912,3045.506,"Well, it would mean you don't get into court at all then."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3045.889,3055.514,"--It would... the... the remedy for a... an alleged prohibited personnel practice... and, I think, an unconstitutional personnel action would be a prohibited personnel practice under the statute."
2005.04-1131,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3076.952,3079.607,Even in the... even if it's not a major personnel action?
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3079.607,3085.743,"--Yes, if... again, if the OSC asked for a corrective action in the MSPB."
2005.04-1131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3118.8,3128.259,"What their brief says is that they can go on a personnel, as opposed to major personnel, to the OSC if, and only if, the complaint has to do with whistleblowing."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3128.259,3128.793,--That's correct.
2005.04-1131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3129.453,3131.614,And this doesn't have to do with whistleblowing.
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3131.614,3132.197,--That... that's correct.
2005.04-1131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3132.197,3139.5,"And therefore, even if this were a personnel action, that route to the OSC is not open to them."
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3139.5,3141.522,That... that is the position that they've taken in the brief.
2005.04-1131,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3142.222,3142.616,Is that true?
2005.04-1131,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3142.616,3149.92,--the position of the OSC and the Department of Justice is that OSC's jurisdiction over FAA employees is not limited to whistleblower complaints.
2005.04-1131,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3164.954,3166.559,"Mr. Stewart, let me just be sure I understand."
