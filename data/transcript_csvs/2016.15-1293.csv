2016.15-1293,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.77,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15-1293, Lee v. Tam. Mr. Stewart."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,6.77,20.715,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statutory provision at issue in this case, 15 U.S.C. 1052(a), prohibits the registration of any mark that may disparage persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols."
2016.15-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,47.73,51.92,Is copyright -- copyright a government program?
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,51.92,64.6,"I think we would say copyright and copyright registration is a government program, but it's historically been much more tied to First Amendment values to the incentivization of free expression."
2016.15-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,64.6,78.71,"But part of that, seems to me, to ignore the fact that we have a culture in which we have tee shirts and logos and rock bands and so forth that are expressing a -- a point of view."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,82.84,83.73,"I mean, certainly --"
2016.15-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,83.73,92.825,"But I was -- disparagement clearly wouldn't work with copyright, and -- but that's a powerful, important government program."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,92.825,102.145,"Let me say two or three things about that. First, there's no question that through their music, The Slants are expressing views on social and political issues."
2016.15-1293,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,121.15,122.88,Substantial First Amendment issue.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,136.62,144.81,"I -- I hate to give away any hypothetical statute without hearing the justification, but I'll come as close as I possibly can to say, yes, we would give that away."
2016.15-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,194.27,204.485,"There's a significant difference between the copyright regime, you can't sue for copyright infringement unless you register."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,205.675,210.865,You have to have filed an application to register in order to -- to pursue an infringement suit.
2016.15-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,228.16,234.155,There's no restriction on -- on the trademark.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,234.155,234.89,That's correct.
2016.15-1293,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,248.58,254.525,"Counsel, I'm -- I'm concerned that your government program argument is -- is circular."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,268.705,281.09,"Well, I think the disparagement provision is only one of a number of restrictions on copy -- I'm sorry, on trademark registrability that really couldn't be placed on speech itself."
2016.15-1293,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,297.26,306.53,"Well, each of those -- and I know there are several -- are related to the ultimate purpose of a trademark, which is to identify the source of the product."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,338.55,350.2,I think Congress evidently concluded that disparaging trademarks would hinder commercial development in the following way: A trademark in and of itself is simply a source identifier.
2016.15-1293,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,350.2,350.32,Right.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,350.32,354.24,Its function is to tell the public from whom did the goods or services emanate.
2016.15-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,414.005,421.245,But suppose the -- the application here had been for Slants Are Superior.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,430.95,436.93,"I -- I think that under the PTO's historical practice, probably not."
2016.15-1293,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,446.44,451.86,"Why isn't that disparaging of everyone else? Slants Are Superior, well, superior to whom?"
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,451.86,462.48,"I -- I think the basis for the PTO's practice, and they obviously don't have that -- this -- that case, is that the term ""Slants,"" in and of itself, when used in relation to Asian-Americans --"
2016.15-1293,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,462.48,463.22,I have it.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,529.71,544.31,"Well, I think what -- I think what you've described as my first-line answer, and I think the precise justification for different kinds of -- for prohibiting registration of different kinds of disparaging trademarks would depend to some extent on who is being disparaged."
2016.15-1293,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,545.15,548.915,It's not disparaging; your answer was distracting.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,572.305,576.71,They don't want -- they don't want distraction and they don't want particular type -- types of distraction.
2016.15-1293,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,577.46,579.375,But that's where I have the question.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,591.23,601.43,The -- the type -- the type of distraction that may be caused by a disparaging trademark will depend significantly on the precise type of disparagement at issue.
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,616.4,618.065,"Mr. Stewart, please."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,618.065,631.28,"Another type would be a competing soft drink manufacturer who wants to register the trademark Coke Stinks, who wants to identify his own product with a sentiment that is antithetical to one of his competitors."
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,648.625,651.94,Assume government speech itself is not involved.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,664.82,670.91,Because it -- it precludes disparagement of all and it casts a wide net.
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,671.315,671.63,Yes.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,718.895,726.835,"Well, as we pointed out in our brief, laws like libel laws have -- have not historically been treated as discriminating based on viewpoint, even though they --"
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,726.835,734.45,"Well, that's libelism, one of our historically different, but very distinct categories."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,771.405,788.67,"Well, certainly if you singled out a particular category of people like political officials and say -- said you can't say anything bad about any of them, but you can say all the good things you want, I think that would be viewpoint-based, because it would be protected a discrete group of people. Let me just give a -- a couple of other answers."
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,788.67,790.11,But why isn't that this?
2016.15-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,790.11,797.32,"But -- but if you didn't limit it, if you -- if you said you can't say anything bad about anybody any time, that's okay?"
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,797.32,799.76,"Again, it's -- again, we're not saying you can't say anything bad."
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,803.165,803.81,"No, no, no."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,816.43,835.885,"Well, in -- in Boos v. Barry, it's -- it's not a majority opinion, but the Court there was confronted with a law that made it illegal to -- I believe it was post signs or engage in expressive activity within 500 feet of a foreign embassy that was intended to bring the foreign government into contempt or disrepute."
2016.15-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,889.43,893.51,"So -- so the government is the omnipresent schoolteacher? I mean, is that what you're saying?"
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,893.51,893.87,No.
2016.15-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,893.87,895.175,The government's a schoolteacher?
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,895.175,895.58,No.
2016.15-1293,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,924.19,929.61,But one distinction is the scope of the government program.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,939.755,948.415,"Well, the -- the trademark registration program and trademarks generally have not historically served as vehicles for expression."
2016.15-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,975.39,983.83,"It's not because -- it's not because of the content or the viewpoint expressed, it's just it's a short phrase, and any short phrase would be no good."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1005.095,1006.04,I think --
2016.15-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1006.04,1007.735,It takes the sting out of the word.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1007.735,1013.08,"Well, the trademark examining attorney went through this in a lot of detail."
2016.15-1293,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1065.31,1070.16,Do you deny that trademarks are used for expressive purposes?
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1070.16,1073.03,I don't deny that trademarks are used for expressive purposes.
2016.15-1293,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1099.91,1107.25,"I -- I wonder if you are not stretching this, the -- the concept of a government program, past the breaking point."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1134.5,1135.06,No.
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1142.16,1150.71,"There are potential -- there are potential First Amendment problems, too, if the nature of the distinction was based on the person's speech; isn't that right?"
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1150.71,1151.15,Certainly.
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1154.76,1157.58,So absolutely clearly if it was based on viewpoint.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1179.41,1180.015,Right.
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1180.015,1186.59,"So -- and similarly, if you said that the flag is a wonderful emblem, this -- this applies to national symbols --"
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1186.59,1187.135,Uh-huh.
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1187.135,1192.965,"-- but you could say that the flag is a wonderful emblem, but you can't say that the flag is a terrible emblem."
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1192.965,1194.525,That would be viewpoint-based.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1194.525,1195.775,Well --
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1195.775,1198.87,"I mean, that's what this -- this regulation does."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1198.87,1199.32,If you're talk --
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1199.32,1204.29,"It says you can say one of those things, but you can't say the other and get trademark."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1204.29,1206.64,But it -- it sweeps with a broad brush -- brush.
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1261.13,1267.4,But that's like saying it does so much viewpoint-based discrimination that it becomes all right.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1267.4,1274.61,"But it -- it does so -- I mean, it -- it imposes this restriction only within the confines of a government program."
2016.15-1293,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1274.93,1275.54,"Yes, yes."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1288.29,1291.41,"Well, part -- part of this government program is government speech."
2016.15-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1345.68,1349.749,What about scandalous? That's another one.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1359.375,1365.82,"They do block you from registering the mark, not -- not from filing an infringement suit or alleging unfair competition."
2016.15-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1365.82,1368.08,Because that's the same thing.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1368.08,1369.58,That's -- that's the -- that's the same thing as disparagement.
2016.15-1293,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1398.27,1401.58,Running the Federal courts is a government program.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1410.855,1422.16,If Congress had taken to its furthest possible step the desire to disassociate the Federal government from the enforcement of -- or from these marks --
2016.15-1293,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1422.16,1424.25,So that was how the hypothetical was framed --
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1424.25,1424.51,Right.
2016.15-1293,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1424.51,1425.9,-- the furthest possible step.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1433.58,1448.47,I think we would typically think of the -- the PTO as exercise of discretionary authority and as -- the exercise of discretionary authority by an executive branch agency as -- as different from the neutral enforcement of the law by -- by the courts.
2016.15-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1448.91,1461.875,"If it's a government program, can you do anything you want with speech? Or what -- what are -- what are the restrictions that we can -- is it intermediate? You don't argue that this statute meets strict scrutiny."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1461.875,1463.36,I think -- I think --
2016.15-1293,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1463.36,1463.96,I take it you don't.
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1463.96,1464.36,No.
2016.15-1293,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1524.595,1545.72,"And just as importantly, because your time is running, the questions have concentrated on viewpoint discrimination, but there's also a large concern with vagueness here, and the list that we have of things that were trademarked and things that weren't."
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1556.55,1571.58,"First, if -- if the Court accepts our basic theory that this should be judged by the standards that typically apply to government benefits under a government program, although the statute doesn't draw an entirely bright line, it's sufficiently clear."
2016.15-1293,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1601.475,1606.505,Isn't it another way to say it's not clear enough for them to get it right?
2016.15-1293,0,36708,malcolm_stewart,,1606.505,1608.9,It -- it's not a bright-line rule.
2016.15-1293,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1667.49,1683.31,"Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Connell."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,1683.31,1696.845,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If our client, Mr. Simon Tam, had sought to register the mark of his band as The Proud Asians, we would not be here today."
2016.15-1293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1701.045,1704.815,Suppose we had this hypothetical case.
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,1723.95,1725.245,They could not.
2016.15-1293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1725.245,1732.51,The First Amendment protects absolutely outrageous speech insofar as trademarks are concerned.
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,1732.51,1733.58,That is correct.
2016.15-1293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1733.58,1735.865,I think you have to take that position.
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,1735.865,1739.845,"Well, we take that position because -- (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,1739.845,1755.46,"-- because marks constitute both commercial speech and noncommercial speech, and the disparagement clause specifically targets the noncommercial speech and denies registration to marks that only express negative views."
2016.15-1293,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1755.46,1756.05,But I have --
2016.15-1293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1756.05,1771.96,"But in your view, the Congress could not draw a statute, even different to this, to make the distinction that the hypotheticals points out, and the Congress, in your view, could draw no statute denying trademark protection in the hypothetical case."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,1771.96,1774.73,I cannot think of a circumstance under which that could occur.
2016.15-1293,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1774.73,1776.685,Then I have a question for you.
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,1854.915,1886.26,"The registration program, the regulatory system of trademark registration, is widely available to a broad number of mark holders who seek the legal protections of registration. In this case, the government has used the disparagement clause to selectively deny those legal benefits to a mark holder expressing negative views that the government favors, as opposed to mark holders who received those benefits because they express neutral or positive views that the government does favor."
2016.15-1293,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1886.26,1887.965,It doesn't answer my question.
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,1889.655,1890.34,But --
2016.15-1293,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1890.34,1891.66,Why is it a burden?
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,1891.66,1903.215,It -- it is a -- it is a burden because our client is denied the benefits of legal protections that are necessary for him to compete in the marketplace with another band.
2016.15-1293,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1911.4,1912.805,He can still sue.
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,1912.805,1913.61,He can still --
2016.15-1293,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1913.61,1914.84,He can still compete.
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,1914.84,1916.86,"He can still compete, but he can't --"
2016.15-1293,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1916.86,1925.19,"He's just not getting as much as he would like, but he's not stopped from doing what he's doing."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,1925.19,1945.34,"He could still -- his only resort at that point would be to seek the protection of -- of -- or to assert his right to exclusive use of the mark under Section 43, or State trademark law, or common law, none of which have the extensive and substantial benefits that this Court has recognized under trademark registration."
2016.15-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1945.34,1961.79,"It seems to me -- I mean, does your argument depend upon the breadth of the government program? Let's say you had a government program putting on a -- a festival or a lecture series. We only want pro-Shakespeare presentations."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,1969.98,1975.82,"I -- I don't believe there is in that -- in that limited forum, that that -- that would make a difference."
2016.15-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1983.76,1984.96,"Well, but no, it's not."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,1989.2,1998.785,"Except again, that targets the noncommercial aspect of speech, which has nothing to do with the commercial objectives of the Lanham Act."
2016.15-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1998.785,2008.395,"Well, I guess I don't understand yet your distinction why the only-celebrating-Shakespeare program is -- is okay, but the trademark one is not."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2018.115,2019.655,In -- in this case it is.
2016.15-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2019.655,2020.46,But why does that --
2016.15-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.46,2020.96,Why does that --
2016.15-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2020.96,2021.42,-- matter?
2016.15-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.42,2022.095,Yeah.
2016.15-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2022.095,2026.535,"I mean, maybe the government just decides we want to celebrate everything."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2030.795,2040.93,"And Justice Kagan, that goes back to your point before, that that would -- would discriminate against any negative viewpoints and only arm one side of the debate."
2016.15-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2040.93,2056.1,"It isn't quite like that. After all, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, this is more like a single bulletin board on the train station. The train station which has a thousand bulletin boards. People can say whatever they want."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2143.795,2147.9,"Actually, I think the -- the government's position is --"
2016.15-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2147.9,2148.99,I don't care what their position is.
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2152.605,2162.9,"Well, I -- I think what the government is trying to do here is simply encourage commercial actors to conduct business in such a way as to not insult customers."
2016.15-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2162.9,2164.81,"Well, not -- not conduct business."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2209.155,2210.72,They could not stop that.
2016.15-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2210.72,2218.315,They could not stop that. They can't -- can they say Smith's beer is poison?
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2218.315,2219.27,They could not.
2016.15-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.27,2220.51,"Oh, my goodness."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2239.635,2246.19,"The government cannot burden the noncommercial aspect of the mark, and that's what they would be doing in that case."
2016.15-1293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2246.19,2260.64,"Now, that's saying you cannot trademark a slogan that has one of George Carlin's seven day -- dirty words in it. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-1293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2260.64,2268.304,"If you were to use one of those seven words, we won't register your trademark."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2268.304,2272.295,I think that is a burden on speech.
2016.15-1293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2283.83,2284.14,"Yes, but --"
2016.15-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2284.14,2284.26,Can I --
2016.15-1293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2284.26,2292.295,"-- due to this Court's specific decision, which said it was okay to ban those words from the airwaves --"
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2292.295,2293.39,"Well, I --"
2016.15-1293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2293.39,2301.935,"But then -- now, this -- this is not, yeah, you can have trademark protection, but we're not going to let you get the extra benefits of registration."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2306.815,2307.51,Yeah.
2016.15-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2341.2,2344.04,"But time, place, or manner, there is time, place, or manner."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2369.83,2378.38,"Because, again, I come back to the fact that this is a burden on the noncommercial aspect of the mark."
2016.15-1293,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2378.38,2378.92,Excuse me.
2016.15-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2378.92,2379.3,How do you --
2016.15-1293,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2379.3,2388.17,"Let's go back to, if we can, the earlier part of Justice Breyer's question. 1052 has two components."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2404.475,2406.87,That's not the question before this Court.
2016.15-1293,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2406.87,2407.615,I know.
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2439.575,2441.76,I believe that's correct.
2016.15-1293,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2441.76,2443.41,That makes no sense.
2016.15-1293,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2443.41,2460.075,"Mr. Connell, don't you think that Congress could deny a trademark registration for something that fit within the narrow, historically recognized category of libel and slander which have never been regarded as having First Amendment protection?"
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2460.075,2466.475,I -- I think the outer limit of the protection here are the categories of historically prescribed speech.
2016.15-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2477.04,2506.26,"Well, one of the things, Mr. Connell, that troubles me about this case is that it's not quite as simple as just saying, well, here's a government program and the government is discriminating on the basis of viewpoint, because there are aspects of this program that seem like government speech itself, maybe not quite that, but something approaching it, which is the program says that anything that's registered, the government publishes in its own publication."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2538.615,2541.06,It does not.
2016.15-1293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2583.62,2604.515,"But doesn't the government have some interest in disassociating itself from racial ethnic slur -- slurs? Things like, what about the license -- Texas license, vanity license plate, and they said we won't do one with the Confederate flag."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2604.515,2607.35,That was specifically a government speech case.
2016.15-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2618.12,2631.925,"You've said -- you've said several times that the problem is that the government is burdening noncommercial -- the noncommercial aspects of the trademark, but it seems to me that that's an awfully blurry line."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2647.875,2655.495,The commercial aspect is that part of the mark that simply identifies the source of the good or service in question.
2016.15-1293,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2694.87,2710.874,"You want us to say that trademark law is just like a public park -- the public park, a public forum, the classic example of where you can say anything you want."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2719.17,2720.59,It -- it is my argument.
2016.15-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2726.205,2736.1,"Well, Mr. Connell, this can't be right, because think of all the other things, the other -- I mean, I'll call them content distinctions because they are -- that trademark law just makes."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2762.395,2771.01,All of those other distinctions are viewpoint-neutral and advance the commercial objectives of the Lanham Act in terms of reducing consumer confusion.
2016.15-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2771.01,2781.3,"Well, these might be viewpoint-neutral, but they're certainly not content-neutral, and yet we would -- I mean, I think that a challenge to many of these would fall flat."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2781.3,2783.195,On what basis?
2016.15-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2783.195,2789.88,"Because -- like, how is trademark law supposed to function unless it can make these kinds of distinctions?"
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2789.88,2793.45,I'm suggesting that those -- those sections would survive.
2016.15-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2793.45,2794.15,Well --
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2794.15,2795.13,Section B --
2016.15-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2795.13,2795.62,-- okay.
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2803.745,2806.785,Agreed.
2016.15-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2806.785,2813.63,"There's something different here, in other words, that this is coming up in the context of a government program --"
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2813.63,2813.87,Well --
2016.15-1293,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2813.87,2817.765,-- which provides certain benefits that the government doesn't have to provide at all.
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2817.765,2835.565,"The -- the point here is that the -- the government program, at least the goals of the Lanham Act, are to reduce consumer confusion, and that is a legitimate interest that the government has. And these -- these factors under 1052 advance that -- that purpose."
2016.15-1293,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2835.565,2838.34,I want to come back to the -- the Chief Justice's question.
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2854.185,2854.96,It is both.
2016.15-1293,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2870.8,2886.025,"Well, if they're inexplicably intertwined, then I -- I don't understand how we can separate them and apply to the expressive part a more rigorous test than we would apply to the commercial part."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2886.025,2889.934,I'm not sure I understand your question.
2016.15-1293,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2889.934,2891.17,All right.
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,2912.28,2917.075,"Viewpoint discrimination is prohibited in commercial speech, no question, under the Sorrell case."
2016.15-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2917.075,2921.505,"Well, it's back to really the Chief Justice's question."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,3029.05,3033.8,Disparaging messages in trademark do not interfere with the source.
2016.15-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3057.43,3061.715,"Well, I understand that. But now your answer -- okay, I've got your answer."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,3091.23,3091.53,No.
2016.15-1293,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3092.48,3093.01,"Well, why not?"
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,3093.01,3105.495,"Because the purpose, as -- as you said, Your Honor, of Peaceful Grove was to have a place of seclusion, of solitude, of -- of calm."
2016.15-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3127.05,3132.765,"Well, but it seems to me that you're defining the government program differently than the government would."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,3138.995,3143.14,That is not clear at all in the Lanham Act.
2016.15-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3159.895,3160.41,"Well, we heard --"
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,3160.41,3161.505,-- a politeness statute.
2016.15-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3161.505,3168.485,"Well, we heard from Mr. Stewart that they thought the disparagement aspect would distract from the commercial identification."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,3170.42,3170.57,Yes.
2016.15-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3170.57,3174.095,And you're saying that's -- that's not really their purpose or --
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,3174.095,3179.88,"Well, I'll say they -- that's nowhere in the legislative history and that's nowhere in the legislation itself."
2016.15-1293,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3197.07,3204.655,Would you say the same thing about a scandalous mark? Would that be equally impermissible?
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,3204.655,3215.7,I think that conclusion is inevitable. If there are no further questions.
2016.15-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3215.7,3216.76,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.15-1293,1,62795,john_c_connell,,3216.76,3217.435,Thank you.
2016.15-1293,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3217.435,3221.229,"Mr. Stewart, two minutes."
2016.15-1293,2,36708,malcolm_stewart,,3221.229,3240.97,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let make three quick points. Mr. Connell has said that the government -- that the government registration program regulates only the expressive and not the commercial aspect of the mark, and I think that's getting it exactly backwards. The -- Mr. Tam wants to do two things with the mark The Slants."
2016.15-1293,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3341.01,3363.28,"Mr. Stewart, you really think that speech can be restricted by the government on the ground that foreign countries may object to it? Could -- could the government do that with copyright? I mean, an awful lot of things are copyrighted in this country that are deeply offensive to some foreign countries, and yet, the FBI enforces the copyright laws."
2016.15-1293,2,36708,malcolm_stewart,,3363.28,3365.79,I would agree that with the copyright is different.
2016.15-1293,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3384.24,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. Case is submitted."
