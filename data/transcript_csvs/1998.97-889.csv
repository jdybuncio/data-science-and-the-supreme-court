1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.907,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-889, Ceasar Wright v. Universal Maritime Service Corporation."
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,15.391,16.833,Excuse me.
1998.97-889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,65.582,70.846,Do you think that the ADA claim could have been resolved in a grievance procedure?
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,70.846,78.894,This grievance procedure I do not believe was thought by the union to cover it.
1998.97-889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,78.894,82.265,I'm not asking you what the union thought.
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,96.064,98.546,Not with finality.
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,104.979,108.853,Why would it not have been binding on the petitioner?
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,108.853,124.554,Because the grievance procedure itself did not specifically provide for a statutory claim to be pursued through that manner.
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,124.554,134.658,"So then you're saying that the collective bargaining agreement, because it didn't specify statutory claims, didn't include this kind of a claim?"
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,134.658,140.364,"That's been the holding of this Court for years, Your Honor."
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,140.364,141.614,In what cases?
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,141.614,158.134,"Livadas v.... the Livadas case is the most recent one, in which it was indicated that the waiver of an individual's right to proceed under a law that was applicable to all workers would not be inferred."
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.134,164.81,"Well, you said a holding of this case, and now you say... the case you cite for the holding, you say it was indicated in the case."
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,166.692,173.534,"I believe it actually was part of the holding of that case, Your Honor."
1998.97-889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.967,184.874,"If there had been a nondiscrimination clause in the collective bargaining agreement, would that have changed the situation here?"
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,185.572,194.97,"No, because as in Alexander the petitioner had both remedies recognized by this Court's decision."
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,194.97,199.814,"Well, Alexander's been cut back in later cases by our Court."
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,206.589,231.236,"That's correct, Your Honor, but however, an essential part of the reasoning of Alexander which this Court emphasized in the decision in the Gilmer case is as applicable today as it was when Alexander was decided, and that is that Mr. Wright had no legal authority to compel a hearing on his claim."
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.89,252.29,"Why is that worse for a statutory claim than it is for... is that only bad for Federal statutory claims, or is it State statutory claims as well?"
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,252.29,254.711,The same rule applies to the State statutory--
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.711,255.653,To State statutory claims.
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,255.653,257.974,--Which Livadas was an example of.
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.974,273.615,"Why is a State statutory claim against... well, let's assume... or a Federal, against discrimination, why is that more important to the worker than his common law right to get the money owed him for work performed under a contract?"
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,278.156,282.04,"I don't want to give up either one, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.04,293.026,"Yes, me neither, but if I had to pick I would think my right to agreed upon contract compensation might be the more important to me, to tell you the truth."
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,293.026,293.447,Well--
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.447,294.787,What's the reason for this rule?
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,312.558,319.643,"--Your Honor, basically... let me back off just a minute and try to start with the questions one at a time."
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,319.643,319.954,All right.
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,319.954,343.098,"First, Congress has determined that certain minimum standards should apply to all workers, and they have determined that these minimum standards are enforceable in court, and they've determined that they're only... as this Court held in Alexander, it has been determined that there are only two jurisdictional requirements for going to court."
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.098,346.621,But congressional law is interstitial.
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,356.597,357.658,"Well, I would--"
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,357.658,368.905,"--just as ponderously the States have determined that a man or woman should get a day's pay for a day's work as agreed upon, and has determined that there should be a lawsuit available for that."
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,368.905,393.983,"--But in the unionized contract context, it is in fact Federal law that governs because of the statutory relationship between the union as the exclusive bargaining agent for the workers in that unit, and so the union has to be the party to enforce the rights, and the rights that it can enforce are those which it has negotiated with the employer."
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.074,408.753,I'm not sure what you're saying.
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,420.222,420.702,"No, sir."
1998.97-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,446.53,448.14,You're talking about 301.
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,448.14,448.66,--That's correct.
1998.97-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,448.66,450.123,"And Lincoln Mills, and that--"
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,450.123,450.67,"Yes, ma'am."
1998.97-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,450.67,457.736,--And that under that whole regime you have a right to go to court but you have to use the grievance arbitration procedure--
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,457.736,461.089,"First, under 301--"
1998.97-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,461.089,464.902,--So that works for the whole collective bargaining regime.
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,464.902,465.423,--That's correct.
1998.97-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,465.423,476.19,"And was your distinction of Gilmer primarily that the... it is not the worker that has a claim in the grievance procedure, it is the union that is in control and that's--"
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,476.19,476.4,That's--
1998.97-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,476.4,478.042,--That's how you differ it from Gilmer?
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,478.042,478.971,--That's absolutely right.
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,500.005,502.769,"Well, but that simply states the conclusion."
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,516.397,523.809,"Well, Your Honor, of course this Court has not decided the question of whether or not the Federal Arbitration Act applies to any contract of employment."
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,523.809,530.205,"No, but let's assume we did decide that point in favor of arbitration."
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,530.205,544.924,"And then... well, no... the critical distinction between Mr. Gilmer's situation as an individual and Mr. Wright's situation as a member of an organized bargaining unit is absolutely critical."
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,548.277,550.178,"Are you answering my question, or--"
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,550.178,552.599,--I'm trying to.
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,552.599,552.78,--Okay.
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,552.78,553.08,Sorry.
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,553.08,554.122,Keep trying.
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,554.122,564.62,"The answer is no under the FAA, because the promise... the union just can't make the same promise."
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,564.62,584.552,"Well, but the union certainly is capable of enforcing the contract rights, and it may have to give away some of Mr. Wright's claims there, and you're saying that there's some magic difference between statutory rights and contract rights?"
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,584.552,596.02,That is the case because the whole labor grievance arbitration process for enforcing the contract rights is an integral part of the bargain.
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,596.02,605.888,"Well, if you made the arbitration clause broader, supposing it said specifically that we include statutories, then you could say that was an integral part of the thing, too."
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,608.749,611.851,"No, sir, I'm sorry, I didn't make myself clear."
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,622.837,623.608,--Well--
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,623.608,628.992,"--and there is... it doesn't have any source in external law, in public law."
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,628.992,630.744,"--Well, but why does that make a difference?"
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,630.744,634.425,As between the FAA and--
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,634.425,639.991,"Well, either between the FAA and the present situation or between statutory rights."
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,653.068,660.443,--Because that would threaten the union's role as the exclusive bargaining agent.
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,660.443,661.124,How would it do that?
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,661.124,695.568,"Well, the control, as this Court has emphasized in decisions such as Vaca v. Sipes, the control of the grievance process in the hands of the union subject to only an extremely limited review is essential to the union's role as... in enforcing the contract, in continuing to maintain labor peace by not only making an agreement with the employer in the first place but by then resolving disputes that arise under the agreement with that employer."
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,713.11,718.062,"Well, maybe it does have authority to make these decisions with limited scope of review."
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,718.062,726.857,"--That's correct, and then that... that deprives the individual of his right under the Federal statute."
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.857,734.752,"Well, but if his right to... if his right to contract for wages is subject to that, why shouldn't his statutory rights be subject to that?"
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,734.752,739.957,In part because this Court concluded in Alexander that--
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,739.957,740.147,Well--
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,740.147,759.279,"--that was not the case, and it has been reaffirmed in numerous cases since that time, because of the absence of the ability of the individual to control the prosecution of his claim, and Congress has approved that arrangement, and--"
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,759.279,760.711,--How did Congress approve it?
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,760.711,780.113,"--In the same way that Congress approved this Court's decision in the Meritor case, as was discussed in the Faragher and Ellers decisions at the end of last term, that the... in the 1991 Civil Rights Act Congress specifically addressed and modified some eight decisions of this Court."
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,782.083,785.595,So by not addressing a case Congress confirms it?
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,785.595,790.18,"Well, in... that's... I'm simply citing the decisions of this Court."
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,790.18,793.753,You must not be familiar with the legislative process.
1998.97-889,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,793.753,807.294,"Mr. McClain, I thought your argument at least in part is somewhat different from what you have been saying to the Chief Justice, and let me just put forward what I thought was at least one strand of your argument, and you tell me whether it is or it isn't."
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,890.258,897.59,"I think... I certainly agree with your... the case as stated, or the propositions as stated, Justice Souter."
1998.97-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,905.547,928.052,"May I ask if the end result, then, is what you're saying is, in any employment covered by a collective bargaining contract you simply cannot have a Gilmer type deal because the employer, under the NLRA the employer cannot contract with the employee, but only with the union?"
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,928.052,938.949,"Well, that is the case unless the union authorizes the employer to make a separate agreement with the individuals."
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,938.949,940.639,Can the union do that?
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,941.611,945.324,If the union and the individual agree to do so we believe that they can.
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,946.744,979.595,"Do you know of any instances where they... you see, one of the things that affects me about this case is, if I were an employer, I would have a severe... and with the multiplication of Federal laws affecting the employment relationship, the ADA and a number of others, I would be very disinclined to have a unionized shop if it means that neither the union can agree to have all of these common disputes arbitrated, nor can the individual employee."
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,979.595,990.782,"I think I'm trying to state that our position is that if the union and the individual employee concur, each individual employee as to his claims, then it can be done."
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,990.782,991.774,But--
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,991.774,993.085,It cannot be done--
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,993.085,1002.553,--I thought the rule was the individual employee cannot negotiate... in a unionized situation the negotiation between the employer must be through the union.
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1024.255,1027.588,"--Not if it's a condition of employment, Your Honor."
1998.97-889,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1029.611,1031.411,Not if it's a condition of employment?
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1031.411,1033.712,Not if it's a unilaterally imposed condition of employment.
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1035.434,1042.317,"Maybe what you're saying is that the JI case law is for the benefit of the union, that you can't... the employer can't make individual contracts."
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1051.103,1062.77,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and... or the union could negotiate a framework and allow individual members of the union... the bargaining unit to opt into that framework."
1998.97-889,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1062.77,1067.645,In that hypothetical could the employer make it a condition of employment?
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1067.645,1071.257,"Could the... well, the employer--"
1998.97-889,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1071.257,1078.381,"Could the employer say, we've agreed on this framework and you're going to let me go to individual employees, but if they don't sign this they can't work for me?"
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1078.381,1089.918,"--I don't... well, he has to bargain with the union, and if the union doesn't... certainly if the union does not agree to make it a condition of employment the employer could not impose it unilaterally without the union's consent."
1998.97-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1089.918,1111.423,"The union is in the driver's seat on all of this, so what you said is, the union if it wants to can say, we're going to give up the control rein that we hold over the grievance procedure and we're going to let this person make this deal with the employer, but the union stands at the gate, and unless the union says yes, the employer cannot make a deal with the individual employee, right?"
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1111.423,1114.706,That's the nature of the union's role--
1998.97-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1114.706,1115.016,Yes.
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1115.016,1115.955,--as exclusive bargaining agent.
1998.97-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1115.955,1127.712,"So it is the case that in a collective bargaining situation the employer will not be able to make a Gilmer deal, because he can't deal, get past the union."
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1127.712,1140.021,"Well, but even if he made an agreement with the union and... that's correct, but even if he made an agreement with the union it would not be a Gilmer deal because individual employees have not--"
1998.97-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1140.021,1140.762,Yes.
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1140.762,1142.024,--Don't have the power to enforce it.
1998.97-889,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1142.024,1146.618,What I mean is he can't get... he can't get... he can't go directly to the individual employee.
1998.97-889,0,39968,ray_p_mcclain,,1156.653,1162.086,"Well, that may be, and then it's a question for bargaining between the employer and the union."
1998.97-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1162.086,1164.748,"Thank you, Mr. McClain."
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1166.761,1178.339,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-889,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1224.167,1225.85,"I know we said that, but I--"
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1225.85,1228.02,"Well, I'd like to say that not--"
1998.97-889,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1228.02,1230.451,--I'm still not sure I understand why it's so.
1998.97-889,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1231.172,1232.785,--And Alexander was different.
1998.97-889,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1232.785,1238.22,--like my individual right to money is no less individual than my individual right not to be discriminated against.
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1238.22,1253.798,"--Well, but your right to money, your wages and... except for the minimum wage requirements established by the Federal... by the Fair Labor Standards Act are precisely what the union was set up and authorized by Congress to negotiate."
1998.97-889,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.416,1282.58,Both of these laws apply to the employment relationship equally.
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1298.368,1298.629,--That's true.
1998.97-889,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1305.023,1307.625,"--But wait, Alexander, I take it a different case."
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1366.964,1374.638,"Well, I think there's a question about whether Congress intended to permit unions to settle in advance, which is what this is, not to--"
1998.97-889,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1374.638,1375.749,I mean in my case.
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1377.051,1378.13,"--Oh, to settle the existing claim?"
1998.97-889,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1378.13,1378.32,--No.
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1396.543,1396.804,Yes.
1998.97-889,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1397.385,1397.885,What?
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1398.273,1400.947,--antidiscrimination laws as prohibiting that for several reasons.
1998.97-889,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1424.98,1427.194,It wouldn't be a power given to the union.
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1453.702,1454.19,"Well, one of the things--"
1998.97-889,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1454.19,1454.851,"And if so, what is that?"
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1454.851,1471.252,"--One of the things I'd point to is the fact that in the antidiscrimination laws, in title VII in the ADA and the ADEA, the unions are identified as potential defendants, and it seems implausible that Congress would, in the same statute that it... and there's a historical reason why that's so."
1998.97-889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1478.186,1496.498,"Why is that different from the Securities Act cases, where we've said you can agree to an arbitration, and the... you know, the obviously the arbitration is going to be against your employer, very often, or perhaps your broker, and you have a board of arbitrators in which the broker has a large part of saying who's going to be appointed."
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1496.498,1503.103,"Well, we're not challenging the Gilmer propositions that you can agree to arbitration of these antidiscrimination claims as well."
1998.97-889,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1527.829,1529.269,What if... I'm sorry.
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1568.255,1581.285,"--Well, I think the statutes, the antidiscrimination statutes are fairly read as reserving to the individual the right to assert or waive both the statutory right itself and the judicial forum for it, but it would--"
1998.97-889,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1581.285,1586.849,"Well, why should that be, because there is such a danger that the union is going to be a coparticipant in the kind of discrimination?"
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1594.846,1596.596,"--Well, I think that's one of the reasons."
1998.97-889,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1628.757,1629.808,Do I understand--
1998.97-889,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.808,1635.592,"--Am I missing... am I missing the boat here, or is it really not Justice Breyer's question that we have before us here?"
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1648.353,1662.452,This individual employee... this compuls... this arbitration clause was a) agreed to by the union and not by the employee and 2) constructed an arbitration process that was controlled by the union and not by the individual.
1998.97-889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1714.888,1715.278,"Fickle workers, eh?"
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1716.42,1717.111,Yes.
1998.97-889,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1733.441,1735.034,"Because the risk is just too great, right?"
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1735.034,1735.561,--Yes.
1998.97-889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1754.765,1756.986,"Thank you, Ms. Underwood."
1998.97-889,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,1756.986,1757.297,--because it could not.
1998.97-889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1757.297,1760.299,"Mr. Edwards, we'll hear from you."
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,1760.299,1765.634,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-889,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1794.473,1812.435,"Either way we're going to have that, is that not true, unless we overrule Alexander, because Alexander says it comes in after the grievance and arbitration procedure has been used, and then the Court says, but title VII is something different, so there's already a separate regime."
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,1812.435,1831.616,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, in the Gilmer decision this Court brought up three issues which were not before the Court in Gilmer, and said that those three issues represented grounds upon which Alexander had continuing vitality."
1998.97-889,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1915.521,1924.678,"--I don't understand, because it seems to me that if... unless there's going to be very limited review of the arbitration, then all this is is a protraction thing."
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,1936.897,1958.741,"--Well, the question of scope of review was, of course, addressed in a sense in Alexander by saying there can be no estoppel effect whatsoever, so there is nothing to review, but the question of the scope of review of an arbitration award involving statutory claims is, of course, not properly presented in this case."
1998.97-889,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2026.506,2039.355,"Well, instead of talking about Judge Edwards' decision, could you tell me how you think, if you prevail in this case, what happens when the employee says, I don't like what the union got for me, I'm bringing my own title VII case?"
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2041.055,2043.146,"Certainly I can, Your Honor."
1998.97-889,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2066.422,2067.252,I'm not asking about several.
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2096.743,2108.661,"When he is in court he... the... a... the problem then is determining what standard of review, if any, applies to the prior arbitration proceeding, because he'd have to show--"
1998.97-889,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2108.661,2109.442,"Well, let me ask you--"
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2109.442,2109.672,--Yes.
1998.97-889,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2109.672,2111.012,"--a very particular question, then."
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2111.012,2111.313,Yes.
1998.97-889,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2111.313,2115.606,Title VII nowadays gives a plaintiff a jury trial.
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2126.081,2150.539,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, because the same statute that afforded the title VII plaintiff a right to a jury trial, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 gave on the one hand, took away on the other by encouraging alternative dispute resolution through a section of that statute, a section of the... and an, virtually identically worded section of the Americans With Disabilities Act."
1998.97-889,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2150.539,2161.475,"Well, now you're going on to another point about the... what was the ADR thing in the 1991 act, and I think Judge Posner takes a view of that quite different from the one that you--"
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2161.475,2163.616,"He certainly does, and--"
1998.97-889,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2163.616,2181.708,"--But anyway, let's... so you're saying that in essence you are asking us to overturn Alexander, because you've given me the answer that if you prevail here you come to court and you get some kind of standard of review that's less than de novo, and you don't get a jury trial."
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2181.708,2186.573,"--The plaintiff in Gilmer didn't get a jury trial, either, so--"
1998.97-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2186.573,2189.555,You're not asking us to agree with you on the second one.
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2189.555,2189.936,--No.
1998.97-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.936,2202.665,"You're just saying that that's what you think will happen, but we could agree with you as to what should happen to this case and disagree with you as to what happens when whatever the result of the arbitration is is brought before a court."
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2202.665,2203.416,Certainly.
1998.97-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2203.416,2204.888,I don't have to agree with both just because I agree with one.
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2204.888,2206.15,You do not have to agree with both.
1998.97-889,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2206.15,2208.761,"Now if... may I ask, Mr. Edwards--"
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2208.761,2209.35,"For that matter, you don't have to agree with either."
1998.97-889,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2209.991,2213.083,--Mr. Edwards... Mr. Edwards.
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2213.083,2213.353,Yes.
1998.97-889,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2213.353,2213.754,Hello.
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2215.136,2215.935,"Pardon me, Justice O'Connor."
1998.97-889,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2215.935,2217.097,--May I ask a question of you?
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2231.606,2235.669,Independent of any action by the union?
1998.97-889,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2235.669,2237.792,"When the... the union says no, we're not going to do it."
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2238.253,2263.948,"If that were the case, if the union had flatly refused, which is not established in the record, if the union had flatly refused, there is, as I read section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act, an opportunity for the individual to attempt to present a grievance on his own with the proviso that the union has to be given notice of his intent to do so, and I think he could have prosecuted it."
1998.97-889,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2270.874,2271.044,--For saying that.
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2271.044,2271.833,--For saying that.
1998.97-889,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2271.833,2272.114,No.
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2272.114,2276.468,But this is the only employment discrimination claim that has ever arisen in this context.
1998.97-889,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2276.468,2283.023,"And could the grievance procedure deal with the ADA issue, do you think?"
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2283.023,2300.654,"The grievance procedure could deal with the ADA issue presented in this case because, and only because... I'm not making a position here that under the general language of the collective bargaining agreement in question all discrimination claims can be arbitrated."
1998.97-889,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2305.93,2309.794,But nothing that specifically includes statutory claims.
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2309.794,2342.715,"Nothing that specifically includes statutory claims except that section 17 of the collective bargaining agreement requires that the agreement not be construed so as to violate any State or Federal laws, which would mean that, in Ceasar Wright's case, in order for an arbitrator to determine whether he was ADA."
1998.97-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.249,2364.44,Why are they less specific?
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2367.332,2389.626,"Well, the agreements in many of those cases, not in Brisentine but in Austin and Pryner, specifically refer to statutory claims, say that statutory claims are dealt with by this agreement, that the affirmative obligations of Federal law with respect to discrimination specifically apply."
1998.97-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.988,2415.482,"Mr. Edwards, may I ask you a question about the Civil Rights Act in 1991 to which you referred--"
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2415.482,2416.022,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1998.97-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2416.022,2416.954,--and which you quote on your brief?
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2441.789,2443.601,I'm quite familiar with that.
1998.97-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2478.764,2484.778,Why is it meaningless if it expresses an intent to adopt the earlier view?
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2488.562,2491.714,--There's no floor debate on any of this.
1998.97-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2491.714,2498.157,"And it is clear, is it not, that the... a bill was proposed and rejected that would have clearly adopted your view?"
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2498.157,2506.032,"And it's also true, Your Honor, that there have been bills proposed since Gilmer was decided to overrule Gilmer, and those haven't been enacted."
1998.97-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2506.032,2506.372,Right.
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2506.372,2507.042,So--
1998.97-889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.042,2511.407,"We're talking about the history of the statute on which you rely, the 1991 act."
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2511.407,2533.391,"--That's correct, and in the... a statement by Senator Dole immediately prior to passage in the Senate, Senator Dole said that this provision on encouraging ADR is designed to further the goals expressed in Gilmer, so apparently there are legislators of different views which--"
1998.97-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.497,2547.019,"It's really hard to tell, isn't it?"
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2547.339,2549.681,--It's extremely hard to tell.
1998.97-889,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2550.932,2552.072,"Spent a lot of time on it, though."
1998.97-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2552.072,2552.523,Can I--
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2552.523,2555.485,--I would hate to do that.
1998.97-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2556.987,2559.358,"--If you would like... not like to spend more time on it, could I ask you the--"
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2559.358,2560.207,"--Certainly, Justice Breyer--"
1998.97-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2560.207,2563.391,--sort of the second half of the question I asked Ms. Underwood.
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2656.953,2679.189,--The critical problem there it seems to me is that then what would really be being said is that except under the most exceptional circumstances an employer which has a collective bargaining relationship with a union cannot have statutory discrimination claims for employees covered by that relationship--
1998.97-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2679.189,2679.779,It does not say that.
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2679.779,2680.16,--with the arbitrator.
1998.97-889,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2680.16,2701.485,"It says that it would have to be... it would have to be stated pretty explicitly, and now, if there is such a situation, if there does turn out to be a collective bargaining agreement where the union really goes to the employees and says, do you want us to settle these claims, and they write it right into there, and the employer signs it, that's the time to deal with the question that I asked Ms. Underwood."
1998.97-889,2,18871,charles_a_edwards,,2713.482,2737.859,"I think the hypothetical assumes certain facts which are highly unlikely to occur in today's labor management workplace, but certainly if a union were to agree that individual employees could consent to arbitration, prospectively, of future disputes, then that would present a clearer case."
1998.97-889,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2740.38,2740.8,"No, no."
