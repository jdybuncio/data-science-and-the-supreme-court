2011.10-879,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.745,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 10-879, Kurns v. Railroad Friction Products Corporation."
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,8.934,11.555,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-879,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,27.004,49.695,"So what do you -- what do you make of the ICC in 1916, in the Tiller case, regulating the lights that railroads had to have, locomotives had to have in the yard, and that those lights had to differ when the railroad was in use."
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,49.695,58.537,"--That was actually I think pursuant to the Safety Appliance Act, Justice Sotomayor, if I'm not -- if I'm not mistaken."
2011.10-879,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,81.184,82.182,I'm not sure I understand.
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,88.823,89.151,--Yes.
2011.10-879,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,89.151,91.538,That had nothing to do with safety in use.
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,93.413,101.068,Our position is that it was not pursuant to the Locomotive Inspection Act that the ICC promulgated that rule.
2011.10-879,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,128.789,132.007,Distinguish for me our reasoning in the Ray case.
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,132.007,132.756,I'm sorry?
2011.10-879,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,132.756,152.951,"Distinguish for me the difference in the Ray case, that had to do with navigation, and where we held that the agency, in ensuring safety in navigation, controlled design completely, whether in repair or not."
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,158.121,163.542,"Well, of course in Ray you addressed the Port and Tanker Safety Act, as well as the Port and Waterway Safety Act."
2011.10-879,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,188.124,189.827,"That's the argument here, which is--"
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,189.827,190.327,--No.
2011.10-879,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,190.327,200.618,"--once you regulate what -- what the design or use of asbestos is, you're interfering with what available components there are for locomotives."
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,200.618,203.492,"If I could make two points about that, Justice Sotomayor."
2011.10-879,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,218.552,219.862,So you're giving up all of your other claims?
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,219.862,220.127,--No.
2011.10-879,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,244.367,257.52,"Well, but counsel, looking at Napier, the power that Justice Brandeis said was conferred in that case was to specify the sort of equipment to be used on locomotives; right?"
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,257.52,258.331,"--Yes, but on--"
2011.10-879,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,258.331,260.893,So this is equipment that was used in locomotives?
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,260.893,269.81,"--Yes, but, Mr. Chief Justice, it also says on page 612 that the power delegated by Congress is to determine fitness for service."
2011.10-879,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,271.027,274.261,"Yes, but that's the same -- that's the same thing, thing, I'll give you that, fitness for service."
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,274.261,275.075,"--No, it doesn't--"
2011.10-879,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,275.075,279.259,It doesn't say something that's going to cause harm while it's actually being used.
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,279.259,291.738,"--But, Mr. Chief Justice, the principle here is to ensure that the locomotives when they are outside the repair yard and are on the locomotive -- on the railroad line -- are -- are safe to operate."
2011.10-879,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,294.363,295.193,Why does it depend?
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,302.002,303.811,--Not to be broken down.
2011.10-879,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,303.811,310.139,"If you have a boiler that's going to be used, that's within the power that was confirmed."
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,314.651,318.555,But the point here is that it is not to be broken down.
2011.10-879,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,335.082,337.362,I guess your argument isn't limited to being taken apart.
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,343.531,345.029,--That's absolutely correct.
2011.10-879,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,347.872,354.278,"Yes, but if there is an accident or something does the asbestos come out during the use of the locomotive?"
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,354.278,361.492,"If it did, it would be covered under the Locomotive Inspection Act safety standard, and that would be covered by Federal law."
2011.10-879,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.492,365.801,"You -- you would say once there is an accident and the locomotive is disabled, it's no longer in use."
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,367.459,368.332,That's correct.
2011.10-879,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.332,370.068,"It's unrealistic, but that's what you'd say."
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,370.068,370.739,No.
2011.10-879,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,375.69,384.999,"Well, that's the old insurance cases we've had, that, you know, when the car, you know, slams into a pole or something, it's not being used as a car anymore, and therefore, the insurance doesn't cover it."
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,384.999,410.471,"Well, if I could finish my answer to your previous question, Mr. Chief Justice, there's a specific statute on that point, and it predated the Locomotive Inspection Act, and it provided that when there was a crippled locomotive, the -- the railroad did not face liability, civil penalties, to bring the crippled locomotive back to the yard, but it specifically said if a worker was injured during that process the railroad would face liability."
2011.10-879,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,439.35,447.862,"What I'm concerned about I think is the same thing that the Chief Justice mentioned, the particular language in Napier."
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,504.78,508.885,"Well, first, I would urge you not to read Napier like a statute, although Justice Brandeis is obviously--"
2011.10-879,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,508.885,510.071,Okay.
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,525.362,530.279,--B is that he was addressing himself to fitness for service standards on the line.
2011.10-879,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,541.79,560.095,"Not -- now, is there any way that you could win your case -- reasonably, in a reasonable way, not some far-out way -- but you win your case on this, and it does not affect the manufacturers' way of dealing with their equipment?"
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,560.095,560.55,Yes.
2011.10-879,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,560.55,561.315,What is that?
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,561.315,566.517,"First is, if you accept our proposition that warning claims are valid negligence claims."
2011.10-879,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,607.388,609.185,I'm not sure I understand this.
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,614.418,615.151,That would be--
2011.10-879,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,615.151,617.9,Are you talking about blowing out air?
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,628.709,629.177,--Both.
2011.10-879,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,664.32,665.349,Could I make sure I understand you?
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,684.812,685.124,--No.
2011.10-879,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,690.497,692.338,But the Secretary cannot do that under LIA?
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,693.292,696.947,"It -- it very well could, because it's a fitness for service standard."
2011.10-879,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,709.456,709.924,"Okay, then I'm a little bit lost."
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,721.467,738.336,"It would have to do so under the B&O Railroad case in the early 1930s -- there was another Justice Brandeis opinion -- in which it would have to make a finding that to make that regulation that you posit, Justice Kagan, was necessary to avoid unnecessary peril to life or limb."
2011.10-879,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,809.932,815.382,"Mr. Frederick, could you -- could you clarify what is at stake for the worker here?"
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,846.637,860.27,"If we lose this case, Justice Ginsburg, the decedent's family gets nothing, takes nothing, because the FELA claim was rendered summary judgment on the finding that there was no negligence by the railroad."
2011.10-879,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,874.421,883.059,"You just -- you just said that, which I think you certainly have the right to bring a claim, don't you, to say the repair shop doesn't have adequate warnings."
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,896.866,906.253,"Well, here -- ordinarily, you'd bring a failure to warn claim directly against the manufacturer for not putting in the manual or stamping on the equipment or providing instructions for safe use."
2011.10-879,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,906.253,906.378,"No, no."
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,913.92,915.546,It's both.
2011.10-879,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,915.546,916.264,There's something I'm not seeing.
2011.10-879,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,916.264,916.778,No.
2011.10-879,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,931.787,932.821,"Thank you, Mr. Frederick."
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,942.441,945.752,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-879,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,979.955,997.057,"Don't -- don't you think that one of the purposes of the legislation, which everybody understood, was to enable engine manufacturers to be able to construct their engines without having to worry about a variety of different State requirements?"
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1007.415,1008.335,--Absolutely.
2011.10-879,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1008.335,1030.339,"And you're saying it won't be okay, because, although every State may have -- every State's requirements may be preempted when the -- when the locomotive is in use, all 50 States can have different requirements with respect to what the design has to be in order to make the engine safe when it's being repaired."
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1033.934,1035.151,I completely agree with what you're saying.
2011.10-879,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1058.752,1062.405,So what -- I'm not concerned about conflict preemption.
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1084.196,1084.945,"No, I'm sorry."
2011.10-879,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1122.212,1123.039,"Well, what's the difference then?"
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1143.78,1146.139,"Well, I think it depends on what the warning claim is."
2011.10-879,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1146.139,1147.34,"Well, give me an example."
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1147.34,1156.665,"Well, under the -- under the Respondents -- under the Respondents' view of the field that's preempted, a State could not regulate the disposal of equipment that's removed from a locomotive during their repair process, even though--"
2011.10-879,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1156.665,1163.508,"Does that have anything to do with this case, the removal, never further -- no further use of a bit of a locomotive?"
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1163.508,1163.602,--No.
2011.10-879,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1163.898,1164.21,No.
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1165.786,1172.645,"--Also, in Respondent's view a State could not regulate workplace hazard, such as by requiring that workers wear goggles or masks."
2011.10-879,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1172.645,1188.277,"Oh, I didn't know anybody denied that, that the State could regulate the repair shop, indeed require what warnings they wish, indeed require what equipment workers have to have."
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1203.162,1203.599,"Yes, but when you're--"
2011.10-879,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1203.599,1204.894,And that's where I'm having trouble.
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1229.901,1230.369,--No.
2011.10-879,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1246.552,1246.755,--All right.
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1250.081,1258.154,"--Well, I think in this case the claims that we say would not be conflict preempted or within the field are claims -- are the failure to warn claims."
2011.10-879,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1266.292,1277.085,"If the manufacturer is really not controlling the repair shop, of what value is this failure to warn claim?"
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1277.085,1279.581,"Well, again I think it depends how the warning is issued."
2011.10-879,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1286.518,1289.205,They can't control whether they do or don't.
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1289.205,1292.484,They could require it contractual through the sale of the product.
2011.10-879,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1301.996,1315.679,"So on that question, Ms. Harrington, I'm still confused about the scope of your regulatory authority and whether you think you have the capacity to issue rules that are meant to protect repair workers on railway equipment."
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1328.656,1329.015,--No.
2011.10-879,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1349.725,1361.267,"Well, what -- what self-abnegation by the Federal Government, that ""safe for use"" does not include safe for use when it's being repaired."
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1361.267,1363.517,Because the statute says safe for use on --
2011.10-879,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1368.575,1371.594,But this does seem a very limiting construction.
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1383.558,1387.867,I'm not aware that we've taken a broader view of our regulatory authority under the LIA.
2011.10-879,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1400.376,1408.515,"Well, but if you're talking about -- I bet there are a lot of things on railroad cars that you can fix in the shop or you can fix while it's under way, right?"
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1423.478,1425.914,"--Well, again the LIA only applies to the locomotive."
2011.10-879,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1434.52,1440.217,"So the line you've been talking about between the repair shop and the locomotive on the tracks, that's not really the line at all."
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1440.217,1442.639,--The line is in use versus not in use.
2011.10-879,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1443.969,1446.403,"Well then, what's the answer to my question?"
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1454.775,1461.946,"--Well if the -- if the fact that it's broken makes the locomotive unsafe to use, then the railroad cannot use it, cannot repair it while it's in use."
2011.10-879,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1461.946,1465.397,So then it's not whether it's in use or in the shop.
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1470.193,1471.02,That's right.
2011.10-879,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1490.716,1492.307,Do you have any--
2011.10-879,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1492.307,1492.931,Can you--
2011.10-879,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1492.931,1493.602,--I'm sorry.
2011.10-879,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1494.276,1504.614,--Can you explain the difference that -- you make a distinction between field preemption and conflict preemption.
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1516.324,1518.056,"--Well, we agree that they might be barred."
2011.10-879,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1545.714,1546.935,"--Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-879,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1546.935,1547.575,Thank you.
2011.10-879,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1547.575,1550.371,Mr. Hacker.
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1550.371,1554.808,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-879,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1607.347,1627.619,"Well, Mr. Hacker, could you explain to me, I wasn't sure reading your brief whether you agree or disagree with the government's point that the agency cannot under the LIA issue the kind of rule that I suggested just, you know, saying no asbestos containing brakes because of the danger that those brakes pose to the repairmen."
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1627.619,1630.338,"Frankly, I would have thought it possible."
2011.10-879,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1653.376,1654.249,"Well, how is that?"
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1669.84,1676.633,"Because the field is not -- it's not about the repair shop versus not the repair shop, the field is the physical elements of the locomotive itself."
2011.10-879,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1685.536,1689.377,"But only the design, materials and constructions for use."
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1704.447,1709.057,"I think we are not, Your Honor, because the design doesn't change between the line and the repair shop."
2011.10-879,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1711.681,1713.959,It's designed for use.
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1713.959,1714.961,"--I understand, but--"
2011.10-879,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.961,1718.537,"I'm not talking about the word ""design""; I'm talking about ""design for use""."
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1718.537,1726.379,--But the statute -- the reason the statute gives power to the DOT is to ensure that locomotives are safe for use on the line.
2011.10-879,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1734.825,1757.086,"It's not clear to me why a railroad executive couldn't say, now I need to use 10 locomotives in this division because I will be using two of them every week in the repair shop to repair them, right?"
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1760.225,1761.629,"Well, I don't necessarily disagree."
2011.10-879,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1765.486,1772.33,"I know it's use on the line, but it seems to me that the repair shop is an obvious extension of the line."
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1782.074,1783.275,We don't disagree with you.
2011.10-879,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1783.275,1817.591,"Why would their law be preempted, a law be preempted, a State law that says: Since the railroad knows that asbestos is dangerous when revealed and since it would be revealed in a repair shop, the railroad has to provide the repair shops with appropriate worker safety equipment; or alternatively, in Lesser, the railroad has to provide for the repair shop's documents to be given to the workers which explain the risks and how they can overcome them."
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1832.331,1834.222,"I would say -- two points, Your Honor."
2011.10-879,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1850.202,1852.464,I thought that that was not the nature of the notice claim.
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1892.684,1898.338,"At common law, a design -- a failure-to-warn claim was a type of design defect claim."
2011.10-879,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1933.648,1933.774,"No, no, no."
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,1967.336,1981.909,"Well, what we could say is that generally applicable laws that govern the repair shop -- States have the authority to the extent not preempted by OSHA, States have authority to require workplace conditions and to require employers to protect employees working."
2011.10-879,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.108,2016.693,"What would apply to the repair shop would also apply to the locomotive in use, I, suppose, and it would be of little comfort to the manufacturer that although the engine he has manufactured has been certified as safe for use by the Secretary, he is liable unless he warns the engineer: Oh, it isn't safe for use in these circumstances; I have to give you warning."
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2027.139,2028.329,"Well, we agree with that."
2011.10-879,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2049.475,2059.376,"What you're saying is because when you open up the box, something no one does on line, you will expose yourself to risks."
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2091.037,2095.922,"Well, for the reason I said earlier, Your Honor, which is, you don't know in advance."
2011.10-879,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2127.817,2135.752,Suppose the allegation is it's the failure to warn workers to use a special kind of mask that's very important if you're working near asbestos.
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2143.454,2144.281,That's correct.
2011.10-879,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2144.281,2149.417,Are you also saying the railroad cannot be forced to give that warning in its repair shop?
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2149.417,2155.574,The railroad can be required to ensure the safe protection of employees that work there.
2011.10-879,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2158.385,2158.572,No.
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2163.504,2167.1,"It can be under OSHA, be held liable for that."
2011.10-879,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.1,2170.364,Can the manufacturer be liable for failing to tell the railroad?
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2170.364,2171.362,No.
2011.10-879,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2175.469,2177.484,How is the railroad going know whether it's unsafe or not?
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2177.484,2178.108,--Because they have the--
2011.10-879,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2178.108,2185.139,"How is the railroad going to know whether there is asbestos in there unless the manufacturer at least tells the railroad, even it doesn't have to tell the worker?"
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2185.139,2189.167,--Railroads have a duty under FELA to ensure a safe workplace environment.
2011.10-879,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2197.478,2202.191,But you could -- could State law say you need a special kind of mask?
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2202.191,2208.096,"--Well, not under the current regime because FELA would preempt any claim by a railroad worker."
2011.10-879,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2210.471,2213.906,What about an independent contractor who is not covered by <FELA> [= FELA]?
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2213.906,2222.528,"Could be -- could not have a claim against the manufacturer, an independent contractor would not have claim against the manufacturer--"
2011.10-879,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2222.528,2226.716,Under State law which by hypothesis says you need this very special kind of mask.
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2228.291,2228.837,--Right.
2011.10-879,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2237.147,2243.737,Could the railroad be held liable for failure to do that kind of mask under State law if it's not a FELA worker?
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2243.737,2247.394,"--If it's a generally applicable law about asbestos use, yes."
2011.10-879,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2263.246,2264.245,Let me ask this question.
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2273.853,2276.396,We don't have a problem with that position.
2011.10-879,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2298.997,2319.942,"Well, the reason it seems to me somewhat important is that I can't conceive of 50 different State regulations for the kind of gloves and things that the engineer has to wear on -- when he is running the train on the track, and if that's so, it seems to me it would help you to say that the shop was the same but you seem to say the shop was different."
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2319.942,2331.453,"Well, I only mean to say that our position doesn't change whether or not the shop is different; because it's not, the LIA preemption -- LIA regulation isn't about repairing."
2011.10-879,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.391,2413.935,"Well, they are -- they are not saying here you have to manufacture it a certain way."
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2420.011,2425.93,"--Well, that's part of their argument, but their main claim is the first one, which is that you are prohibited in this State from using asbestos."
2011.10-879,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2457.871,2462.57,"Well, do we have to reach the failure to warn problem in this case?"
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2462.57,2465.023,I think it's presented here.
2011.10-879,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2479.175,2502.911,"I -- if I'm understanding your argument correctly, you're saying that if Napier controls the design of -- and a locomotive part, that includes any design defect that's encompassed by State law, whether it's design in its traditional sense or failure to warn?"
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2502.911,2503.602,That's correct.
2011.10-879,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2503.602,2505.255,That's basically what the court below said?
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2505.255,2511.737,"That's correct and that's what Judge Koscinski said in the Law case, and Judge Winters said in--"
2011.10-879,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2511.737,2523.47,"Just as a practical matter, I'm assuming that some railroad repair yards are owned by the railroad itself, so the railroad repair people are railroad employees, correct?"
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2523.47,2525.122,"--I -- I think that's right, yes."
2011.10-879,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2525.122,2526.733,Are there some that are not?
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2530.964,2533.338,I don't -- two things I would say.
2011.10-879,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2550.142,2556.861,"Just to be -- just to be clear, under your view of the LIA there could be other laws that preempt it or prohibit it?"
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2567.966,2568.839,Yes.
2011.10-879,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2568.839,2569.791,They just can't tell them--
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2569.791,2571.413,Yes.
2011.10-879,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2571.413,2574.896,"--include a warning on the brake, or to--"
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2574.896,2577.317,Specific to the equipment itself.
2011.10-879,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2595.216,2600.04,"Mr. Hacker, do you think we would decide Napier the same way if it came to us today?"
2011.10-879,2,30716,jonathan_hacker,,2600.04,2601.226,"I do think so, Your Honor."
2011.10-879,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2630.34,2631.513,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-879,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2634.683,2651.284,"Manufacturers clearly have the best information about the dangerous aspects of their products, and they issue warnings and instructions in manuals and provide all kinds of information so that persons working on their equipment are going to know the special hazards."
2011.10-879,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2806.379,2816.611,"And it knows -- it knows about Napier and what's been going on for 85 years, and if it wants to pull back on the preemptive effect of the provisions interpreted in Napier, it's free to do that, too."
2011.10-879,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2816.611,2828.856,"--It did so, though, Your Honor in 49 U.S.C. 20106, where it said that unless and until the Federal Government issues a regulation in a particular field, the States are allowed to have their rule be in effect."
2011.10-879,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2828.856,2833.649,That was -- that was the Safety Act and they didn't amend the Locomotive Act.
2011.10-879,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,2839.021,2866.744,"But that's why, Justice Ginsburg, the point here is how broadly do you define the scope of the field, and Napier defined it in an historical context that we just don't live in any more; and there is no reason to give manufacturers a complete pass from liability when they have the best information to advise railroad -- railroads and railroad workers how to work on their equipment in a safe way without exposing their workers to unnecessary risks."
2011.10-879,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2867.808,2869.212,"Thank you, counsel."
