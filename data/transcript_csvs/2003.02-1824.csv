2003.02-1824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.082,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 02-1824, Doug Dretke v. Michael Wayne Haley."
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,10.774,13.541,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1824,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,38.349,45.574,Can... can you tell me... I don't want to derail the argument... you've conceded that this sentence is unlawful?
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,45.574,46.894,"Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2003.02-1824,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,46.894,47.97,"Well, then why are you here?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,51.231,59.237,"No, Justice Kennedy, but the state is here, because the state is concerned about the impact on the procedural default rule, in particular the Fifth Circuit's decision."
2003.02-1824,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,59.237,63.035,"Well, so a man does 15 years so you can vindicate your legal point in some other case?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,71.291,73.399,Implicit in the procedural default--
2003.02-1824,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,73.399,74.968,And I'd say the same for the Government of the United States.
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,74.968,80.745,--Implicit in the procedural default rule is the premise that petitioner has a valid claim.
2003.02-1824,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,95.523,96.704,At... at the prisoner's expense.
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,96.704,101.467,--But that is inherent in any claim with procedural default.
2003.02-1824,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,101.467,105.061,"No, but it's not a... it's not a... as if there's some new trial and... and it's in doubt."
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,110.755,118.064,"It is very clear that there was an error, and that if Mr. Haley had raised the error at trial, that the trail judge would have and should have sustained--"
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,118.064,118.314,But is it--
2003.02-1824,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,118.314,118.536,--Well--
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,118.536,123.448,--not also very clear that he's going to spend over 10 year in jail when he shouldn't spend 10 years in jail?
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,123.448,129.657,--It is clear that he will spend 10 years in jail when he had an objection he could have raised that he did not.
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,129.657,136.834,"Well, I understand that, but... but if the law were followed and everything went perfectly, he would spend less than 2 or... what is it, 2 or 3 years?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,136.834,138.032,Two years would be the max.
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,138.032,140.178,"And he's going to spend 16 years in jail, is that right?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,140.178,141.747,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,141.747,142.862,"Now, is that just, do you think?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,142.862,146.372,Maintaining the procedural default rule is--
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,146.372,149.632,"I understand that you want to preserve the procedures, but do you think justice is being done?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,149.632,155.948,"--I think justice is being done because he had a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his errors, and there's no greater--"
2003.02-1824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.948,156.569,"Well, let me ask you this."
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,167.343,171.884,"--Justice O'Connor, I think there is a very strong argument that there was inadequate assistance of counsel."
2003.02-1824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,171.884,173.825,"Well, why don't we vacate and remand and let them deal with that?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,173.825,180.308,"Justice O'Connor, I think that is something that is open to the Court to do and I think that is one of the fundamental problems with what the district court did."
2003.02-1824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.308,182.825,You don't think that that claim was waived here?
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,186.419,189.02,"There is an argument that it was waived, but I think the Fifth Circuit--"
2003.02-1824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.02,191.332,"Well, except the court below didn't decide that question."
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,191.332,196.45,--And I think the Fifth Circuit could certainly deem the petitioner's pleading sufficient to preserve that claim.
2003.02-1824,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,196.45,197.936,"Yeah, I would think so too."
2003.02-1824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,198.308,200.62,--Are you saying you won't... you won't argue a waiver if it's sent back?
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,200.62,205.988,"If it's sent back, we would be prepared to address the ineffective assistance claim on its merits."
2003.02-1824,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,205.988,209.703,And not raise any procedural impediment to--
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,209.703,210.779,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct."
2003.02-1824,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,210.779,229.56,"--The... the... another feature of this case, what makes it so disturbing, is that the initial error was the prosecutor in... when the prosecutor indicted him, that indictment was incorrect, and then the rest followed, relying on that original mistake of the prosecutor."
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,248.796,273.604,"And, Justice Ginsburg, this case may well, if the Court finds ineffective assistance, that would suffice to correct this, because ineffective assistance counts as cause, and in many ways this case illustrates why cause and prejudice is ample to address error in sentencing in non-capital sentencing and why there's not a need to open the door to a new category of exceptions to procedural default."
2003.02-1824,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,273.604,291.332,"Well, this defendant certainly raised... he raised the point in his pro se petition in the state court and he raised it in the Federal court, the ineffective assistance, but nobody paid any attention to him."
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,291.332,302.173,The... the claim was denied in state habeas and the Federal habeas court did not address it because it had already granted relief based upon his claim that he was actually innocent of the sentence.
2003.02-1824,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,302.173,310.263,"Did the prosecutor suggest that maybe the court should have dealt with it, because neither court gave any reason for rejecting that claim?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,310.263,314.683,I... the... the district court jumped ahead in the process.
2003.02-1824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,326.738,330.824,"Mr. Cruz, let me... let me make... get clear what... what... what your position is."
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,366.203,375.945,"--Justice Scalia, the first preference of the State of Texas is for the Court to address the circuit split and to clarify that there is no actual innocence exception to non-capital sentencing."
2003.02-1824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.726,388.122,Why should we... why should we not be inclined to do so?
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,401.952,405.417,And Texas is not urging the Court not to decide it.
2003.02-1824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.534,421.188,So you come back and fight another day?
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,421.188,424.531,"Well, or perhaps someone else would fight in a different circuit."
2003.02-1824,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,424.531,440.672,"But if the court views this as a preliminary question, a question that the Fifth Circuit and any other Federal court should have reached logically before it reached the question on which it decided the case--"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,440.672,441.581,"Yes, Justice--"
2003.02-1824,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,441.581,446.223,--then we should put the court back in the position that it should have been in if it handled the case correctly.
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,446.223,460.174,"--Justice Ginsburg, we certainly agree that as a matter of thinking through procedural default, that courts should begin with cause and prejudice, that the actual innocence exception as a potential trump card should not be jumped to first."
2003.02-1824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.174,461.849,"Well, that just means it made two mistakes."
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,474.192,475.389,And--
2003.02-1824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.389,483.358,I don't see why it's more intelligent for us to reach the first question than the second if... if there isn't any such thing as number one and number two.
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,486.535,491.615,"--And, Justice Scalia, I agree entirely with your characterization of the errors made by the court below."
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,491.615,491.987,May I ask this question?
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,512.602,515.37,"Justice Stevens, I... I do not believe it is."
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,517.311,522.222,"Well, can you give me an example of when manifest injustice would exist other than a death case?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,522.222,534.855,--There are a host of instances in which this Court has held that actual constitutional errors should nonetheless not be addressed because the defendant has procedurally defaulted that.
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,534.855,539.397,"Well, I understand that, but is there any... any content to the manifest injustice exception in your view?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,539.397,541.005,Absolutely there is.
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,542.286,542.574,"Well, give me an example."
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,542.574,544.06,--is an individual was is innocent of the crime.
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,544.06,547.487,"Well, he's innocent of the crime he's in... in prison for."
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,547.487,551.202,He is innocent only in the most technical of legal sense.
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,555.66,558.965,"No, but if the law were followed, he would have been released a long time ago, would he not?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,558.965,560.784,--If he had raised his objection.
2003.02-1824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,560.784,563.673,"What... what actually... what was he charged with, Mr. Cruz?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,568.253,574.197,"He was charged with theft, and that was enhanced to a state jail felony because he had committed two prior thefts."
2003.02-1824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.995,587.822,Well--
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,599.627,603.137,"No, actually, Justice Scalia, the way the statute reads--"
2003.02-1824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,603.137,612.796,"As I understand it, the... the... the theft that... that was used for recidivism occurred 3 days after, right, the--"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,612.796,615.685,--It's a 3... it's a 3-day disparity.
2003.02-1824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.08,618.246,--Yeah.
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,618.246,627.99,"And he committed that in 1988, but that conviction did not become final until October 18th, 1991."
2003.02-1824,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,639.879,642.108,But why did the first felony take so long to become final?
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,643.388,645.534,It... it did.
2003.02-1824,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,652.759,661.388,"At... at trial, do you think the prosecutor would have, if he had noted this error, have the duty to call the attention of the trial judge before the trial judge imposed sentence?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,661.388,662.047,"--Absolutely, absolutely."
2003.02-1824,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,663.245,669.932,But the trial obligation... the trial lawyer's obligation to do justice is... is somehow missing in your office?
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,669.932,688.879,"--The state has an obligation to be candid with the court, so at any point in which the state became aware of this error, the state would be obliged to inform the court, but that's a very different thing to say that when there is a procedural default, when the defendant has not preserved his error, that the state should not act to vindicate that procedural default."
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,713.377,720.503,"Well, narrow circumstances, when the record makes it perfectly clear that an error has been committed and an innocent person is in jail, that's... what more do you need?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,720.503,722.239,--The difficult--
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,722.239,723.187,There aren't many cases like this.
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,723.187,734.415,"--It is true that there are not many cases where the state concedes error, but the difficulty with pivoting the test on that is the basic operating premise of every habeas petition."
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,747.668,750.473,"Yes, but usually the valid claim is some procedural error in the trial, something of that character."
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,753.984,764.137,"This... this Court has addressed procedural default in the context of forced confessions, in the context of statements without Miranda rights, in the context of psychiatry--"
2003.02-1824,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,764.137,778.133,"But that... but... but... no, what you need to satisfy Justice Stevens is... is a case where the mistake unquestionably caused the outcome of the... unquestionably caused the outcome of the trial to be wrong."
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,797.452,809.916,"--We do not have any cases like that, but that aspect simply goes to prejudice, and this Court has repeatedly cautioned that the actual innocence exception should not be used to transform cause and prejudice just to prejudice."
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.287,839.97,I think it's a lesser injustice if he's really guilty of the crime.
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,839.97,844.594,"--But in this case, Mr. Haley is guilty of the theft, he's guilty of the predicate offense--"
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.594,845.42,He is not guilty of what he's in prison for.
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,845.42,847.815,--Only in the sense--
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,847.815,849.69,And I don't think the 3 days is an argument that has any merit.
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,854.048,858.689,--It is... it is true that 3 days or 5 days or whatever does not matter.
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.127,878.197,"If he could deliberately refuse to do it in order to trap the state into some kind of mistake, is this a case of, you know, in our original case that we talk about gamesmanship and so on, do you think this is gamesmanship on his part?"
2003.02-1824,0,38986,r_ted_cruz,,878.197,894.709,"You know, we don't have reason to suggest that Mr. Haley in this instance was engaged in gamesmanship with respect to this error, but the record is susceptible to an interpretation that his counsel was engaged in gamesmanship with respect to whether or not Mr. Haley pleaded to the enhancements."
2003.02-1824,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.0,923.976,"Well, if the counsel sandbagged for the purpose of getting a 16-year sentence instead of a 3-year sentence, doesn't that demonstrate that he was incompetent?"
2003.02-1824,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,997.498,1005.422,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1824,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1018.796,1027.424,"Well, what should we do in this case with someone who... who is serving an unjust sentence under the law?"
2003.02-1824,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1027.424,1038.958,"Well... well, Your Honor, even if this Court holds that the actual innocence exception doesn't apply to non-capital sentencing, respondent may well be entitled to relief here."
2003.02-1824,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1038.958,1041.809,On the inadequate assistance claim?
2003.02-1824,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1041.809,1042.718,"On the ineffective assistance claim, and I--"
2003.02-1824,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1042.718,1046.349,"Do you urge that that's waived, or can the court below address it?"
2003.02-1824,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1046.349,1050.604,"--We don't believe that it's waived, Your Honor."
2003.02-1824,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1050.604,1051.18,Thank you.
2003.02-1824,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1051.18,1057.413,"Why not go to that first and tell them to do that, because this is just very difficult, that that would be the reason?"
2003.02-1824,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1096.551,1097.044,That... that's--
2003.02-1824,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1097.044,1097.294,--I'm getting you to--
2003.02-1824,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1097.294,1098.053,"--but that's right, Your Honor--"
2003.02-1824,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1098.053,1098.879,--I know that's just what you were going to say--
2003.02-1824,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1098.879,1099.994,--and that's our primary... that's our primary concern here.
2003.02-1824,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1099.994,1100.177,--All right.
2003.02-1824,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1102.201,1104.885,"Well, the... the Court certainly could do that."
2003.02-1824,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1124.454,1126.849,"So you're saying it would be wise to send it back, is that right?"
2003.02-1824,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1126.849,1142.908,"It... it... yes, except that, you know, certainly our... our primary interest in the question here is in the question that's divided the circuits and in making clear that there isn't a broad actual innocence exception as applied to... to non-capital sentencing."
2003.02-1824,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1142.908,1147.654,Perhaps when it's clear it will always be the case that there's been ineffective assistance of counsel.
2003.02-1824,2,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1154.22,1155.084,"That... that's... that's right, Your Honor."
2003.02-1824,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1183.031,1185.632,"Well, suppose... suppose this were the Federal system."
2003.02-1824,3,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1193.351,1198.552,We... we well might not have appealed from the district court judgment in this case.
2003.02-1824,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1206.011,1210.719,"That's one tremendous advantage the Government has over individual criminal defendants' lawyers, isn't it?"
2003.02-1824,4,21758,eric_m_albritton,,1627.43,1630.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1824,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1664.128,1668.215,"Well, it has never extended beyond the capital sentence context either, has it?"
2003.02-1824,4,21758,eric_m_albritton,,1668.215,1669.291,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1824,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1670.073,1681.856,"And there is some suggestion in our cases that other claims ought to be addressed before resorting to that, such as inadequate assistance of counsel."
2003.02-1824,4,21758,eric_m_albritton,,1681.856,1690.878,"--Your Honor, I agree that this Court's precedents suggest that ineffective assistance of counsel, cause and prejudice, should be addressed first."
2003.02-1824,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1709.266,1709.516,Why not?
2003.02-1824,4,21758,eric_m_albritton,,1713.353,1715.748,"--Your Honor, I think it was grossly inadequate."
2003.02-1824,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1729.866,1742.459,"Yes, but if it's our view that the court below addressed that out of order too soon when it had an alternative, certainly we could vacate and remand."
2003.02-1824,4,21758,eric_m_albritton,,1742.459,1743.468,"You could, Your Honor."
2003.02-1824,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1743.468,1744.006,Yes.
2003.02-1824,4,21758,eric_m_albritton,,1744.006,1746.318,"Again, I would respectfully suggest that's inappropriate."
2003.02-1824,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.981,1771.46,"But we... we haven't in... in at least two or three cases when we have a question of certiorari, we've said that there's a logically preceding question that has to be decided before we can get to that."
2003.02-1824,4,21758,eric_m_albritton,,1774.47,1780.748,"Your Honor, I am familiar with that precedent, and I understand that the Court could--"
2003.02-1824,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1780.748,1783.348,"Well, I guess you'd like your client out of jail?"
2003.02-1824,4,21758,eric_m_albritton,,1783.348,1786.98,"--That's absolutely correct, Your Honor, and the state didn't--"
2003.02-1824,4,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1786.98,1788.632,Doesn't sound like it.
2003.02-1824,5,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3417.441,3419.958,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1824,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3505.945,3517.296,"But can I... I just... this is a case in which you yourself concede he shouldn't be in jail under the substantive law of Texas, and it is a case where you yourself agree there is a very big claim that the lawyer was incompetent."
2003.02-1824,5,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3521.027,3531.952,"The... the state is willing to allow the ineffective assistance case to be litigated before proceeding to reincarcerate Mr. Haley, so we will wait until that... that claim is resolved before... before--"
2003.02-1824,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3531.952,3534.181,He's out while it's being litigated?
2003.02-1824,5,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3534.181,3538.822,--He... he is out right now and the state will leave him out until his claim is resolved with respect to that.
2003.02-1824,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3604.11,3611.829,What has been the... the experience in the circuits that have adopted this rule applying the actual innocence to sentencing?
2003.02-1824,5,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3613.315,3627.97,"There have been relatively few cases that have come up since those decisions, but I would note first of all we don't know what unpublished decisions are out there, and secondly, there's a significant difference between a circuit decision allowing an exception and a decision of this Court."
2003.02-1824,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3627.97,3629.085,"Thank you, Mr. Cruz."
