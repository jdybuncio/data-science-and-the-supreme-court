1996.96-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 96-542, Walter McMillian v. Monroe County, Alabama."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,10.068,13.23,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,64.144,71.097,"Well, Mr. Stevenson, I assume that the plaintiff here also sued the sheriff."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,71.097,72.218,--That's correct.
1996.96-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,72.218,76.703,"And if there's a judgment against the sheriff, who pays it in Alabama?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,76.703,80.293,The evidence in this case is that it will be paid by the county.
1996.96-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,83.025,85.797,So what difference does it make whether you can join the county?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,90.01,101.738,"--Well, the policy is capped, Your Honor, and because we don't know yet whether the county has the option of disclaiming the conduct in question, then it does make a difference."
1996.96-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,101.738,109.862,"Well, presumably if you sue the sheriff and get a judgment, somehow that money is going to be produced to pay the judgment."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,109.862,111.865,That's not required under Alabama law.
1996.96-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,132.329,136.89,You suggest perhaps in other Alabama counties there might not be an insurance policy--
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,136.89,140.553,"That's correct, Justice... Chief Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, that there may not be--"
1996.96-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.553,149.83,"--Well, has there ever been a judgment against a sheriff in Alabama in a civil case or a 1983 case in the history of Alabama?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,153.883,154.534,--Yes.
1996.96-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.534,156.935,And have the judgments been paid?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,156.935,160.058,"Not necessarily by the counties, no."
1996.96-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.058,161.907,"But have they been paid, somehow?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,161.907,163.78,It depends on the solvency of the sheriff.
1996.96-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.278,197.021,"Well, maybe it was given to him by State law, or by the State constitution."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,204.345,214.033,"--Well, yes, but under Alabama law the provisions that deal with the conduct in question here make it clear that he exercises that authority for the county."
1996.96-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,214.622,218.425,"Well, I suppose... correct me if I'm wrong."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,233.104,238.057,"--That's right, and we think that's how the Eleventh Circuit dealt with this issue."
1996.96-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,269.659,284.629,"Are you asking for a rule that if the final policymaker is elected by an entity... here, the county... that entity is necessarily responsible for the judgment?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,284.629,288.509,Not... it does not turn entirely on the election by the county's voters.
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.453,295.394,What else is there?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,297.285,297.856,--Yes.
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.734,328.336,"You say the county does this, but the county does this under compulsion of State law."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,328.336,328.987,--That's correct.
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.987,330.278,It's directed by State law.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,336.561,339.975,"That's correct, Your Honor, and that's true of all of the county's functions."
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.247,345.097,"In this State, but not in all States."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,345.097,345.558,--That's correct.
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.558,349.622,States do have charters in which the counties are self-governing.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,349.622,356.614,"That's correct, and I guess our position is that that's not required to trigger municipal liability for these purposes."
1996.96-542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,358.958,361.109,"Mr. Stevenson, before you get onto the third thing--"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,361.109,361.55,--Yes.
1996.96-542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,361.55,377.178,"--Staying with the money, do I understand correctly that it's also the coroner and the tax assessor that are paid by the county, but other people who are elected... say, the district attorney or local judges... are paid by the State?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,377.709,378.44,That's correct.
1996.96-542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,402.416,407.808,"--How about the coroner and the tax assessor, who are paid by the county?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,414.703,416.424,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.96-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,433.245,436.928,"The county commission, then... and that's your form of county government in Alabama?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,436.928,437.488,That's correct.
1996.96-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,437.488,442.481,--could not instruct the tax assessor to do things in a particular way?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,442.481,444.972,Not in compliance with Alabama law.
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.203,461.605,I knew you'd get back to me.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,461.605,462.185,--Yes.
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,479.105,481.627,"Well now, wait, let's talk about the third for a minute."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,481.627,482.048,--Okay.
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.048,490.533,Are you saying anything other than the sheriff has no authority outside the geographical limits of the county?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,490.533,491.434,Well--
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.434,494.356,I don't see why that makes him necessarily a county official.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,499.349,514.038,"--Yes, but I guess my point would be that if they're State officials that are part of some State command, then their jurisdiction and their authority and their ability to perform the functions which they have been trained and prepared for aren't necessarily limited to that jurisdiction."
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.812,542.807,"What about the prosecutors you referred to earlier, the State prosecutors, whose jurisdiction exceeds the county but does not exceed the judicial district."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,545.498,554.294,"Yes, Your... I don't know that they could be moved in the sense that someone can assign them, but they have authority to prosecute cases in other counties at the direction of the court."
1996.96-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,572.145,573.868,Are they elected by the county?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,573.868,575.628,They're elected by the judicial circuit.
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.913,588.588,Is that any different from the sheriff of one county being able to enter into another county in hot pursuit?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,590.21,593.53,"--Well, I think it's different in this way, Justice Scalia."
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.419,614.634,"I understand that, but it seems to me that the instances you were describing of the prosecutors being able to act elsewhere were also exceptional instances."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,618.577,628.234,"I think that's a fair criticism, but I think it's less exceptional both as a matter of practice and as a matter of law, for the prosecutor to engage in this kind of conduct some place else."
1996.96-542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,685.52,689.203,The constitution I think identifies him as a State official.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,689.203,697.098,"What the constitution does, Justice Breyer, is identify him as a member of the executive department, and we don't dispute that."
1996.96-542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,707.055,714.8,"I'd like to get your answer to this, which is the problem that's bothering me the most from your point of view."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,760.129,776.359,"Well, I think that Alabama law is in conflict on the question, on that particular question in part because the Alabama courts have clearly said that they want to immunize both the State and counties from tort judgments for this kind of conduct."
1996.96-542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,782.353,798.294,"But what would the... but when you say conflict, I have a case here called King v. Colbert County, May 7, 1993, and it seems to say quite clearly the sheriff is not considered an employee for purposes of imposing liability upon the county."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,798.294,799.366,"--That's right, Justice Breyer."
1996.96-542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,799.366,799.974,Is that in conflict?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,799.974,805.43,That's not in... there's no conflict about the tort liability of the State or the county with regard to--
1996.96-542,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,805.43,819.369,"All right, so then why should 1983 impose respondeat superior constitutional tort liability upon a body that States do not impose respondeat superior liability upon?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,819.369,820.53,--It shouldn't.
1996.96-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.174,864.248,But you are asking us to hold the county liable for the actions of the sheriff.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,867.02,868.49,"--No, that's right, but--"
1996.96-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,868.49,870.821,So that is respondeat superior in a sense.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,870.821,873.883,"--Mr. Chief Justice, our position is that it's not in this respect."
1996.96-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,927.131,935.045,But as Justice Breyer pointed out in his question the supreme court of Alabama has said he is not a county official for tort purposes.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,935.045,937.657,"--For tort purposes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1996.96-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,937.657,940.978,"Well, this is a constitutional tort that you're suing for, isn't it?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,940.978,948.732,"That's true, Your Honor, but with regard to whether the State law immunities bind this Court, it is certainly our position that that's not true."
1996.96-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,956.189,957.268,"Well, suppose it were the other way around."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,968.267,969.116,Well--
1996.96-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,969.116,970.257,So why doesn't it work the other way around?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,970.257,986.859,"--Well, I think if that was all that was said, that is, if the sheriff was not elected by the county's officials, if the sheriff did not have this relationship to the county government, the county Treasury, the county as a jurisdiction, we might still have a problem, and I guess that's why I'm saying that the Congress doesn't resolve this issue."
1996.96-542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1057.416,1065.66,"Mr. Stevenson, I want to know who we bracket the sheriff with, and so I'd like to go back to the coroner and the tax assessor to see."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1065.66,1066.549,Yes.
1996.96-542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1066.549,1076.196,"Is the same... is the answer to Justice Breyer's question about respondeat superior the same thing with respect to those officers, or is the county liable for their common law torts?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1076.196,1078.968,The county is liable for the coroner's conduct.
1996.96-542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1083.412,1090.108,So the State does have... the county has respondeat superior liability for the coroner.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1090.108,1090.626,Yes.
1996.96-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1105.185,1110.15,"If it's not respondeat superior, what is it?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1120.815,1123.908,"No, that's right, but if a body--"
1996.96-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1123.908,1129.872,"And if the mayor of a city does something, and the city is held liable on the judgment, isn't that respondeat superior?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1129.872,1132.223,"--I don't... in my understanding, no."
1996.96-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1138.147,1139.158,But why?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1143.653,1150.066,"--Yes, and so in that sense the city is the person that is represented by its official."
1996.96-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1151.788,1158.931,"If it's not respondeat superior, what is it, some semantic legal category that I've never seen before?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1158.931,1165.876,"--Well, I guess it would be the city's officials making policy for the city in a way that creates liability for the city."
1996.96-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1165.876,1168.337,Isn't it simply imputed liability?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1168.337,1170.688,I think that's a fair statement of--
1996.96-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1170.688,1195.005,"I mean, any corporation is liable only by imputation from its officers, and the only reason we're worried about respondeat superior here is that we've got a case that says we don't have respondeat superior liability under 1983 in the sense that there's got to be a policy condition met, but respondeat superior is a variety, certainly, of imputed liability, and this is imputed liability, right?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1195.005,1196.297,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.96-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1196.297,1201.519,And in Alabama they say there is no imputed liability as between the sheriff and the county.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1201.519,1203.089,With regard to State law.
1996.96-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1203.089,1207.173,"With respect to State law, and you say that's a Federal question, and that does not bind us."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1207.173,1226.056,"That's correct, because the county does engage in the kind... the same relationship that exists between the county commission, about whom I think we'd have to concede does have authority to make policy that would create liability for the county, the same relationship between the county commission and the county, that entity."
1996.96-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1233.32,1247.999,"When we're interpreting Monell, why don't we use... why aren't the same policies that inform that decision as to respondeat superior applicable equally as well to imputed liability?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1247.999,1254.154,--Because I think that the Congress intended to make localities liable.
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.715,1262.579,It intended to make municipalities liable because they were like corporations.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1303.905,1305.588,"--Well, I think two things, Justice Scalia."
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1328.322,1330.075,You say just a corporate structure that has four elements.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1331.304,1332.015,"Well, I think--"
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1332.015,1334.396,You're saying it's just a person that has four heads.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1335.397,1336.778,"--Well, that's the second thing I'd say."
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1378.214,1381.096,--But the decision was not to make counties liable.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1390.843,1407.713,"Well, I guess our position would be it was also to make these political bodies that have status, that have power to engage in the kind of unconstitutional conduct, to empower someone to do the kind of unconstitutional conduct that took place here, to make those municipalities liable for that conduct."
1996.96-542,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1424.637,1447.901,"Mr. Stevenson, do we have cases involving actors who are admittedly county actors who are not responsible, not answerable to any board of the county, but who are... have been held final decisionmakers they are, who trigger Monell liability?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1447.901,1448.26,Yes.
1996.96-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1505.658,1509.451,Yet the county commission has no authority over him.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1509.451,1516.037,"That's correct, in the same way that they have no authority for other... over other county officials, and in that--"
1996.96-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1516.037,1523.891,So to say that he couldn't have done what he did without the county really is not quite accurate.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1530.775,1534.486,--And the resources provided to him by the county commission.
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1563.077,1563.966,"Of course, there's another--"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1573.722,1575.262,"That's true, Justice Scalia."
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1575.262,1579.026,"And it doesn't make any policy in the sense of controlling his actions, either."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1581.026,1581.837,"No, that's right."
1996.96-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1583.978,1590.864,Can you give me an example of some policies that the sheriff in one county might make that a sheriff in another county might not?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1590.864,1591.795,Certainly.
1996.96-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1598.75,1602.772,Any other legitimate... give me some examples of some legitimate policies.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1602.772,1605.282,"--Well, I mean, there are a whole range of legitimate policies."
1996.96-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1611.406,1615.69,And this can vary from one county to another because the sheriff sets that policy?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1615.69,1616.419,"--Yes, that's correct."
1996.96-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1617.07,1628.468,"Going back to the sense in which he speaks by and might perhaps... or speaks for and might be controlled by the county, the most important sense, I suppose, is that in which he is elected."
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1642.599,1646.54,"Absolutely, Justice Souter, because that is the most meaningful control over this sheriff."
1996.96-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1658.096,1661.729,But even if there were no basis to say that they had approved--
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1661.729,1662.29,That's correct.
1996.96-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1662.29,1664.291,--they at least would have the power to disapprove.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1664.291,1664.932,Absolutely.
1996.96-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1664.932,1669.226,And I suppose that's what we're getting at with imputed tort liability.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1669.226,1669.817,Absolutely.
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.817,1670.728,Can they disapprove?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1672.288,1673.12,They have no power to--
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.12,1674.989,"He's impeached by State officers, isn't he?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1674.989,1675.68,--Like--
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1675.68,1677.521,"By the attorney general, or the legislature?"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1677.521,1678.633,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia, like--"
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1678.633,1683.595,"So they really have a... I mean, gee, the power just to elect somebody without the power to remove him--"
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1683.595,1684.456,--Well--
1996.96-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1684.456,1685.688,--I don't know that that's real control.
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1685.688,1688.129,"--Well, I think that removal power is regulated every 4 years."
1996.96-542,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1688.129,1689.86,Do they have to vote for him the next time?
1996.96-542,0,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,1689.86,1693.883,"No, they do not, and every 4 years they will have the opportunity to exercise that removal discretion."
1996.96-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1697.065,1698.656,"Very well, Mr. Stevenson."
1996.96-542,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1700.809,1706.773,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-542,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1734.94,1741.285,"But you... I take it you accept the fact that it's ultimately a Federal question, not a State law question."
1996.96-542,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1741.285,1748.31,"Well, this Court has held repeatedly that the identification of municipal policymakers turns on an analysis of State law."
1996.96-542,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1748.31,1759.108,"The identification of the policymakers does, but whether, in fact, the policy is to be imputed to the county, or to any municipal corporation, is a question of Federal law, is it not?"
1996.96-542,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1759.108,1761.229,"Well, I think it's kind of an intersection between State and Federal law."
1996.96-542,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1773.047,1778.159,"No, I think we look to State law to find out who in fact has control over the policy."
1996.96-542,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1780.302,1781.272,--Correct.
1996.96-542,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1781.272,1782.424,We look to State law for that.
1996.96-542,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1782.424,1783.094,Right.
1996.96-542,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1783.094,1796.802,"But whether in fact, having identified the policymaker, the policymaker will be treated as a State official or as a municipal official of some sort, that is ultimately a question of Federal law, is it not?"
1996.96-542,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1796.802,1798.525,"Well, I'm not sure I understand the distinction."
1996.96-542,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1815.215,1816.715,"Right, but I think the distinction is simple."
1996.96-542,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1846.435,1852.277,"Your Honor, I really don't think you can answer that question without looking at State law to determine--"
1996.96-542,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1852.277,1862.015,"Well, you have looked at... you mean State law binds the question whether for 1983 liability an individual is a State officer or a county officer?"
1996.96-542,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1871.131,1872.103,"--Well, I guess--"
1996.96-542,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1872.103,1873.472,And I would have thought it clearly was not.
1996.96-542,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1873.472,1894.847,"--If what you're asking is, can there be a situation where we would... where the Court would properly disregard a label that says he's a State official, based on other circumstances that are present such as the fact that he actually day-by-day works for the county commission and so therefore there's a concern that the State statute that designates him a State official is fictitious, I think under those circumstances that would be appropriate."
1996.96-542,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1920.904,1923.866,"But the converse would not necessarily be true, would it?"
1996.96-542,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1923.866,1924.667,"Well, I think--"
1996.96-542,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1924.667,1933.041,"If he is not controlled by in this case the county commissioners, it does not follow that he is not a county official for purposes of 1983 liability."
1996.96-542,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1933.041,1933.742,"--That's true, too."
1996.96-542,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1955.616,1957.488,Suppose they said just the latter?
1996.96-542,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1973.417,1973.957,--Right.
1996.96-542,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1973.957,1974.568,Okay.
1996.96-542,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,1983.054,2005.33,"If the Court were to determine that the State law establish the contours of the municipal corporation such that the corporation includes not only a governing body but another autonomous board or official who was supposed to be part of that municipal corporation, that you have a kind of hydra-headed corporation under State law, if the Court were to conclude that's what State law said, then yes, he would be a municipal policymaker."
1996.96-542,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2016.096,2028.325,"So if this person were designated county officer, as I take it the coroner and tax assessor are, then you would not have any question about--"
1996.96-542,1,38319,paul_m_smith,,2028.325,2029.394,"Well, I--"
1996.96-542,2,18009,bryan_a_stevenson,,3561.339,3572.605,I'd like to at least suggest that the Court not accept this notion that the sheriff is a State policymaker under the law that's been provided.
1996.96-542,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3712.648,3713.97,"Thank you, Mr. Stevenson."
