1999.98-1109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.818,"We'll hear argument now in Number 98-1109, Donna Shalala v. The Illinois Council on Long Term Care."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,12.198,15.271,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,92.262,100.289,"Mr. Lamken, I guess what respondents really want is preenforcement review of the regulations."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,100.289,102.542,"Yes, that's correct, and--"
1999.98-1109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,102.542,106.436,"And is that possible, in your view, under this scheme?"
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,106.436,108.358,"--No, Your Honor, it is not."
1999.98-1109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,129.69,137.687,"And so what... in your view, the nursing homes have to wait for a deficiency citation?"
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,137.687,139.79,"That's precisely correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,139.79,155.0,"But if they then try to raise administratively some constitutional claim, for example, about the regulations, that can't be decided administratively before the level of the Secretary, I assume."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,155.0,156.181,That's correct.
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,185.17,201.462,"Mr. Lamken, assume for the sake of argument that I don't agree with you that the text of the statute, the text of the sentence that you referred to, is dispositive, so that there would be some, at least practical point to this question."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,254.098,258.473,"The answer is yes, although we don't believe that this case presents that type of problem."
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,258.473,259.004,I realize.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,259.004,267.86,"And although the Secretary ordinarily would not impose termination or expose medicare providers to extreme risks, because it's a voluntary program, they don't have to--"
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,267.86,268.441,But that's a matter of grace.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,268.972,269.443,--Correct.
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,269.443,270.945,"--the Secretary may, the Secretary may not."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,277.45,283.434,Termination is an extreme remedy that is reserved for the most extreme circumstances and violations.
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,298.314,298.464,All right.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,299.015,299.236,--Yes.
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,299.236,299.987,--there just for a second?
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,323.394,327.806,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, no, but the ordinary--"
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,327.806,329.118,So the risk would always be there.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,344.139,356.567,"--It's true that the absence of declaratory relief does subject them to some risk, but it is not the case that there is an extreme risk of termination for a provider that actually does nothing more than preserve his right to appeal."
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,356.567,357.228,But there is some risk.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,357.228,365.922,I could not... I... we would consider it a... the... an abuse of the Secretary's decision to terminate a provider for doing no more than necessary to preserve its right to appeal.
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,368.115,368.256,"No, but we... I think--"
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,368.256,381.533,"--to violate the statute, draw some remedy, and then the Secretary... and then it would come into compliance following that and dispute only the remedy, and if a provider comes into compliance shortly after the remedy is imposed, it ordinarily would not be terminated."
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,381.533,398.165,"--Okay, but one of the provider's arguments is that the risks can be so extreme that there really isn't a proper challenge scheme on your view of the law, because any provider is going to knuckle under rather than take the risk of being terminated at the end of the day."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,431.316,436.209,"In fact, Your Honor, we believe that that risk has been overstated in the way the Secretary implements it."
1999.98-1109,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,442.164,449.771,"Mr. Lamken, as I read Judge Easterbrook's opinion, he essentially agreed with what you're saying now, but he put it on a ripeness point."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,483.311,485.742,--I think that's correct.
1999.98-1109,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,500.745,521.318,"But there is something to the point that the Seventh Circuit made that Michigan Academy, that what you are essentially asking the Court to do is to declare Michigan Academy passe because part B regulations are now subject to judicial... part B rulings are subject to judicial review."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,536.596,558.19,"I... Michigan Academy we don't believe is passe in the sense that for the category of claims that Michigan Academy identified, claims that could not be raised through the express judicial mechanism, but for which Congress did not express a clear and unambiguous intent to preclude the review altogether, that remains good law, and that remains applicable to cases that fall into that category."
1999.98-1109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.508,588.232,"Oh, but I didn't understand Michigan Academy to be written that way, that, you know, there is preenforcement review with respect to those claims that can't be challenged otherwise, although there may not be with respect to claims that can be challenged otherwise."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,601.871,602.863,--No--
1999.98-1109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.863,604.944,Now you're telling us that there isn't.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,604.944,606.604,"--If, in fact--"
1999.98-1109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.604,612.639,Because of no change in the... no change in either the language of 405(h) or the language of 1395ii.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,612.639,628.179,"--That construction, Your Honor, would place Michigan Academy in direct conflict with Ringer, for example, Heckler v. Ringer, for example, which specifically held that an individual may not slice off one individual issue bearing on... one individual legal issue and seek its resolution in advance."
1999.98-1109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,641.88,644.794,"Well, in particular, these claims."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,644.794,657.672,"In particular, the claims that were at issue there under the statute as it then existed, but when Congress went and restructured the statute, it took certain... the claims that were at issue there and--"
1999.98-1109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.672,660.006,It's an interesting question of statutory construction.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,684.192,686.953,"--No, Your Honor, we don't believe its meaning's changed."
1999.98-1109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.927,710.041,"Now, is that the... you contend that's the holding of Michigan Academy?"
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,710.041,716.455,"--To the extent Michigan Academy addresses the language of section 405(h), that is the only potential ambiguity identified."
1999.98-1109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,716.455,716.885,Where does it say that?
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,737.231,746.596,"It does not actually hold that that is the language of the statute, but what it does is, it first says... there's two possible interpretations that are posited to us."
1999.98-1109,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.964,792.077,"But the first part of what you read referred to review in an administrative agency, I think, and there is no such review in this case."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,792.077,801.112,"Your Honor, the way the structure, the statute is structured is that all claims are channeled through a review in the administrative agency."
1999.98-1109,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,801.112,809.968,"Well, all claims... all of these cases really turn on the meaning of the words, to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter within the meaning of 405(h), don't they?"
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,809.968,812.101,"That's correct, they do turn on that, and in fact--"
1999.98-1109,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.101,813.763,"Some have been held to be such claims, and some have not been."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,821.547,823.17,"--No, that's not correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1109,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,823.17,824.642,Which one could not have been decided--
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,824.642,826.463,Weinburger v. Salfi could not have been decided by the administrative agency.
1999.98-1109,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,826.463,831.589,"--The claim that the class representative in Salfi had been presented to the agency, and it could have been presented to the agency."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,831.589,832.129,"Right, but the--"
1999.98-1109,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,832.129,833.491,Not on behalf of the whole client.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,833.491,841.148,"--constitutional challenge to the statute, and they sought pure declarative relief in the abstract as an alternative remedy, could not be decided by the Secretary."
1999.98-1109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.313,878.251,It seems to me that language setting forth a particular manner of judicial review is either exclusive or it's not exclusive.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,896.665,906.112,"Your Honor, we believe that the language of 405(h) is clear, and that as the Court applied it in Ringer and Salfi, any claim that can be raised through 405(g) must be."
1999.98-1109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.428,920.865,"You admit that these claims, if by claim you mean the gravamen of the complaint, the constitutional issues can't be raised in the administrative process."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,920.865,925.51,"--Right, but they can be raised on judicial review through 405(g), exactly like the constitutional--"
1999.98-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,925.51,934.366,"All right, suppose in that respect that you have... let's not take this case, where I think probably the issues are not ripe, but let's imagine one that would be plainly ripe."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,970.27,980.778,"--Although the Secretary would never be able to impose that kind of rule, because participation is strictly voluntary, and she would drive all the providers out of the program and have nobody to provide--"
1999.98-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,980.778,984.07,"No, no, but I'm simply trying to get an example of a rule that's ripe."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,984.07,984.731,--but assuming the argument that there is such a grossly unreasonable rule--
1999.98-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,984.731,985.041,Yes.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,985.041,991.986,"--providers, sometimes the absence of declaratory relief can impose difficult choices for a providers, just as it does for beneficiaries."
1999.98-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1010.699,1013.193,Why wouldn't the following be a fairer result?
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1013.193,1013.691,--Pardon?
1999.98-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1013.691,1021.628,"Why wouldn't it be fairer and consistent with all the statutes simply to say, you've just mixed up ripeness and exhaustion?"
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1059.852,1060.774,Two things.
1999.98-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1066.697,1068.18,"So, but they... you're saying that they have to violate."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1069.852,1069.992,--Right.
1999.98-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1069.992,1075.528,And so they could go and present without violating by writing the Secretary a letter.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1075.528,1076.287,That's one--
1999.98-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1076.287,1076.698,All right.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1081.475,1087.379,"--As an initial matter, that's one thing they would have to do, but we do not believe that would be... that's a necessary but not a sufficient condition."
1999.98-1109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1090.363,1098.55,"In order to present a claim, they have to violate the statute and present it to the Secretary?"
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1098.55,1099.141,--That's right.
1999.98-1109,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1102.503,1107.408,"That's where members of the Court are a little hung up, why you have to do both."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1110.112,1120.37,"--Because the statute provides a specific mechanism under 405(g), and that mechanism says that you have to challenge a determination by the Secretary that you're not in compliance."
1999.98-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1129.185,1147.898,"But then you've made... you've turned it into a ripeness statute, whereas Ringer and Salfi and Bowen and everyone else have considered it an exhaustion statute, and Easterbrook and everybody say, we're not discussing ripeness, and so what I'm thinking is, suppose it really is ripe, it's really ripe."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1152.073,1179.749,"Even where it's ripe, the way the... because of the enormous size of the administrative program and the enormous number of potential legal issues it could raise, Congress established a system where all challenges, the challenges of beneficiaries and the challenges of medicare providers who voluntarily contract to the Secretary, are channeled through what is in essence a quasi-adjudicative system, and as... you get a final decision of the Secretary, and that is how you challenge the rule, is by challenging the final decision of the Secretary."
1999.98-1109,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1180.42,1195.861,"If you made it ripeness, that would certainly be contrary to Salfi, because Salfi was a fully ripe claim, and the Court said you couldn't do it under 1331, even though it's clear that the Secretary cannot rule on the only issue in dispute."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1195.861,1196.772,--That's correct.
1999.98-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1224.741,1225.913,So Salfi didn't involve this issue.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1258.594,1262.718,"No, I... we believe that it's... the statute is more than a mere exhaustion statute."
1999.98-1109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1275.885,1278.928,"Well, you don't say it's just an exhaustion statute, either."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1288.255,1289.427,"Absolutely, Your Honor, that's correct."
1999.98-1109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1289.427,1291.387,So it's much more than an exhaustion statute.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1291.387,1292.038,That's correct.
1999.98-1109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1292.038,1292.929,It's a channeling statute.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1292.929,1315.055,"Exactly our position, and the reason for that is, Congress not only needed to channel these things to give the Secretary the opportunity to eliminate any possible way of avoiding these legal issues and eliminate overloading the courts with potentially millions of claims for beneficiaries and nursing homes that participate alike, but it also ensures that all the claims arise in the most concrete factual context possible--"
1999.98-1109,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1315.055,1329.815,"Earlier on in your discussion with Justice Souter, in answering his questions, you began to say that the provider need not risk termination, but then you didn't get to complete that."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1332.679,1333.639,"--No, that's correct."
1999.98-1109,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1333.639,1336.069,What's the reason for that?
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1336.069,1350.771,"As the Secretary implements the statute, as the Secretary implements these requirements, termination is only imposed as the first remedy when serious extreme health and safety requirements are violated, when basically the health and safety of the beneficiaries--"
1999.98-1109,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1350.771,1357.213,Is there a way for the provider to test termination as being an abuse of discretion?
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1357.213,1359.135,--Yes.
1999.98-1109,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1371.454,1374.807,"Again, but only in the context of making a specific claim for reimbursement?"
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1374.807,1378.289,"--Only in the context of a specific application, yes."
1999.98-1109,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1406.419,1411.764,"Well, as to that part of your prong, then the only way he can avoid... the provider can avoid the risk is to comply."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1411.764,1413.446,That... Congress specifically--
1999.98-1109,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1413.446,1414.027,Now you're going to talk--
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1414.027,1414.197,--Yes.
1999.98-1109,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1414.197,1415.258,--tell me about a second route that he has.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1415.258,1423.806,"And the second is, if it would violate the Constitution, and we do not believe that our applying 405(h) would violate the Constitution, given the voluntary nature of the program."
1999.98-1109,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1446.629,1453.645,"Well, you're reading any claim, to recover on any claim as a term of art."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1455.698,1456.77,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1109,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1458.192,1459.033,You don't concede even that?
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1459.033,1461.344,"--To recover on a claim... no, we don't."
1999.98-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1497.979,1504.794,"So if it doesn't, to go back to Justice Scalia for one second, I don't see any problem with sending them through 405(g) and (h)."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1523.53,1526.164,"--The language, Justice Breyer, appears in 1395cc(h)."
1999.98-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1526.164,1527.122,--cc(h).
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1527.122,1529.015,"And that's going to be on page 14, 15--"
1999.98-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1529.015,1529.445,"Yes, I have it in front of me."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1530.306,1530.426,--Okay.
1999.98-1109,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1548.552,1548.812,Yes.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1548.812,1551.065,--which are certain other determinations.
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1594.355,1597.307,"Mr. Lamken, may I go back to Justice Kennedy's question."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1635.702,1646.661,"--No, that's not correct, for two... well, first, as the statute was initially enacted in 1939, it was clear that to recover meant to get money, because that was the only thing at issue, was merely social security benefits."
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1658.728,1662.581,That's why I think you're reading it as if the words to recover simply were not there.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1662.581,1677.484,"--It means to obtain relief, but even if you had to obtain money or obtain some sort of benefit or entitlement, the court interpreted that provision in Ringer as precluding parties from slicing off individual, potential legal barriers to their recovery of money, or to recover--"
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1677.484,1683.271,"But in Ringer also, I mean, one of the claims in Ringer, as I recall, was an individual benefit claim, so that--"
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1683.271,1684.029,--No.
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1684.72,1685.17,--No?
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1685.17,1687.193,"--Well, for some of the other beneficiaries, perhaps."
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1704.445,1714.973,But there was also a procedural basis for getting him the relief in connection with a claim which would fall under the natural meaning of to recover.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1714.973,1719.027,And that's precisely that same basis here under 1395cc(h).
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1719.027,1720.619,"Oh, I don't see the same basis here."
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1720.619,1721.57,Any time there's a--
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1721.57,1722.672,It's a preenforcement claim.
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1731.057,1740.113,"--Ringer sought... brought a preenforcement claim as well, and he sought to eliminate one particular legal barrier to his potential recovery."
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1772.695,1775.878,May I go back to another answer you gave Justice Kennedy?
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1788.225,1789.767,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1109,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1793.954,1795.975,A matter of grace by the Secretary?
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1795.975,1796.856,--That's correct.
1999.98-1109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.856,1800.338,Do you think the Secretary can be reversed for abuse of discretion?
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1800.338,1801.548,Yes.
1999.98-1109,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1807.114,1813.138,Terminating for a violation that couldn't be appealed here?
1999.98-1109,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,1813.138,1814.227,--Yes.
1999.98-1109,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1817.262,1818.451,"Thank you, Mr. Lamken."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,1820.762,1824.576,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.021,1864.825,Of the petition or the brief?
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,1864.825,1866.305,"--The petitioner's brief, Your Honor."
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.305,1867.767,The petitioner's brief?
1999.98-1109,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.767,1868.418,The petitioner's brief?
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,1868.418,1894.715,"Yes, the petitioner's brief on the merits... we see that on page 15a of the petitioner's brief on the merit, on the... in their appendix, we see under section 1395cc(h) that this is the really only route for a provider to eventually arrive at the doorsteps of a 405(g) court."
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1924.751,1926.232,You say the previous sentence.
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,1928.736,1929.918,--You're correct.
1999.98-1109,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.31,2010.155,"Not just subject yourself to it, you have to incur it."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2010.155,2010.575,--That's right.
1999.98-1109,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.676,2012.918,It's not just that you're exposed to it.
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2020.104,2033.594,"That is our only route to a 405(g) court, which the Secretary argues is our adequate remedy, and I think we also have to look at the administrative process that the Secretary would urge we have to be channeled through."
1999.98-1109,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2060.161,2066.696,"--Mr. Anderson, on this argument, the Seventh Circuit said, well, we don't know about any of that."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2103.463,2116.32,"--Well, I think the Government's position is, first of all, these kinds of constitutional claims can never be brought by a trade association, so we would get, under the Seventh Circuit's view, the benefits, the resources--"
1999.98-1109,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2116.32,2121.616,"But your members could, and you could join your... you could then intervene, so that's not a large--"
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2121.616,2135.236,"--Well, even the... even our members cannot individually bring this claim, because this claim is not a claim for benefits, it's not a provider reimbursement claim, it is just a wholly untethered--"
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2135.236,2144.032,"--But how, then, does an association get the right... I thought associational standing depended upon the right of at least one member."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2144.032,2162.014,"--Well, I think it depends on the fact that at least one member has been injured and has a ripe claim, and I think the Seventh Circuit said at very least our APA claim challenging the fact that the Secretary has promulgated, under the guise of a State operations manual, a rule that--"
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2162.014,2170.6,But I thought one of your answers to Justice Ginsburg's question was that your members could not have... no individual member could have brought this claim.
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2172.923,2185.591,"--No, I'm saying that the Secretary's administrative review scheme does not allow this kind... there's not a mechanism for us to bring this claim before the Secretary."
1999.98-1109,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2191.555,2206.087,"But that isn't responsive to... my question is that the Seventh Circuit said, we're not going to throw you out because you sued under 1331, but we're not going to listen to your claim about vagueness, we're not going to listen to your claim predicting inconsistent application, because we don't know how these things are going to work."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2206.087,2227.649,"--Well, I think what the Seventh Circuit said, that the APA claim was ripe, and that our claim that the regulations effect a deprivation of rights without a proper hearing of the timing and type demanded by the Constitution may or may not be ripe, and remanded that back to the district court, if I recall, for--"
1999.98-1109,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2227.649,2242.582,"What the Seventh Circuit said was exactly, an industry subject to a battery of new regulations cannot ask for an all-at-once review, but must wait until the agency has worked through the process in administrative adjudication."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2252.086,2256.23,"--Well, the... here's what the court actually said."
1999.98-1109,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2283.037,2286.259,That was the only claim that they said was ripe?
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2286.259,2287.581,"As a matter of law, yes."
1999.98-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2287.581,2292.496,"They didn't say... they said may, which is what is bothering me about this."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2304.417,2304.987,Well--
1999.98-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2304.987,2311.662,"What are we supposed to do, assume that you have a ripe claim and then decide hypothetically?"
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2311.662,2331.136,"--Well, certiorari was not granted on the ripeness issue, but I think that we clearly do have a ripe claim as to the APA objection, and as to the remainder I think the Seventh Circuit is correct that it should be left to the district court to determine whether or not ripeness--"
1999.98-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2331.136,2347.127,"So if you assume it's a ripe claim, and you do have the language you just quoted at the beginning of your argument, that language seems to say, well, we're sorry, this is an antipreenforcement review statute."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2354.621,2356.453,"--I think that's correct, but I think we're--"
1999.98-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2356.453,2358.696,Your response to that is what?
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2358.696,2364.6,"--Well, I think the response to that is, we're really by that issue with Bowen v. Michigan Academy, with--"
1999.98-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2364.6,2368.874,"Well, you say Bowen... Bowen was interpreting not... it didn't interpret (h)."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2395.864,2399.908,"--Well, I think we're really talking about that third sentence of section 405(h)."
1999.98-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2411.977,2437.896,"I know there's no doubt the Government was talking about that in Bowen, but the... in Bowen, Michigan Academy, but what the Court said was, we don't have to reach an interpretation of (g) or (h), because we can deal with this by interpreting the equivalent of mutatis mutandis language in ii, and that made it applicable to the instance where, in the absence of the Court's interpretation of ii, there would be no review at all."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2437.896,2438.824,"--Well, I--"
1999.98-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2438.824,2442.036,"This is different, says the Government, because you get review eventually."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2443.759,2452.354,"--Well, we get it only if we fall on a sword, and let's talk about what type of review we get under section 405(g)."
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.298,2461.029,You're talking now about the district court?
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2461.029,2461.75,"Yes, I am."
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2461.75,2461.87,Okay.
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2461.87,2463.202,"Yes, I am."
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2475.701,2480.897,"Which the Seventh Circuit said they just... they didn't know enough about it to agree with you or not, is that right?"
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2480.897,2482.587,I didn't read it that way--
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2482.587,2483.688,How did you read it?
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2483.688,2484.169,--Your Honor.
1999.98-1109,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2511.697,2524.125,"What you refer to as your APA claim, to be clear on what that was, was that the manual... you contended that the manual required notice and comment, and there had been no notice and comment, so that was a discrete, concrete issue."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2524.125,2524.746,--That's correct.
1999.98-1109,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2524.746,2528.1,Unlike your prediction of how these hearings would work.
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2528.1,2529.382,That's correct.
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2577.157,2583.073,But your notice and comment claim is really out of the mainstream of this kind of litigation.
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2605.027,2615.695,"No, it wouldn't please me, and I don't think it would be... I don't think that it would be justified under the statutory language."
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2626.444,2633.637,"But when you rely on the notice and comment claim, you're putting the administrative procedure in its least appealing light, it seems to me."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2644.456,2651.01,"--Well, let me talk about challenge to the regulations for a moment, because that seems to be a concern."
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2707.732,2709.495,How could they be unconstitutional?
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2715.008,2734.221,"--Well, that's an interesting constitutional question of whether the Secretary can allow us to participate and then inflict reputational injury, which I'll talk about in a moment, and other harm without a predeprivational hearing."
1999.98-1109,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2787.778,2791.402,But you suggest no limitations for your theory.
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2812.529,2842.749,"I think the limitation is the one... you know, I think the scheme that I propose is the one that Congress has intended, that when you have a statutory or constitutional challenge to the Secretary's rulemaking or regulations that is completely untethered to a claim for benefits, or completely untethered to a claim for provider status, termination or nonrenewal, then those types of claims do not have to be channeled through the Secretary's administrative--"
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2842.749,2847.764,"But if a claim is completely untethered, what is the standing to bring it?"
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2847.764,2861.171,"--The standing is the fact that these rules and regulations that I've described are actually being enforced, and they are actually causing harm to our members."
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2861.171,2867.385,"Well then, that suggests that there may be... might be someone who could bring a so-called tethered claim."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2867.385,2869.808,Yes.
1999.98-1109,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2887.162,2901.493,"But your argument is that you should bring what you call an... you can bring what you call an untethered claim, that without having suffered any injury, kind of an advanced declaratory judgment, is that correct?"
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2901.493,2901.824,No.
1999.98-1109,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2916.305,2940.109,"How does it differ from the situation of the one plaintiff in Ringer who said, I can't have post-review because I haven't got the money to get the procedure and be denied the benefit, so I want an up-front declaratory ruling that I'm entitled to reimbursement?"
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2940.109,2958.522,"I think the answer is that Ringer itself and its progeny has characterized that case as one that is at bottom a claim for benefits, so there you had a claim that was not, as I said, totally untethered from an individual claim for benefits."
1999.98-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2958.522,2960.364,Do you have any client--
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2960.364,2960.715,This is the--
1999.98-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2960.715,2978.447,"--Don't you have any... what I don't understand as a practical matter is, there must be somebody, in all the clients that you have, that could violate some minor provision of this thing and incur a fine of 2.50 dollars and make all the claims that you want to make in the context of litigating the legality of that fine."
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,2979.799,2991.077,"--Well, for the reason I attempted to address at the outset, which is, civil monetary penalties are not reviewable by a section 405(g) court."
1999.98-1109,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3010.72,3013.143,What I... I thought it was 1395x.
1999.98-1109,1,33758,kimball_r_anderson,,3029.482,3039.25,"Yes, but as I read that, there have... paragraph (2) goes hand-in-hand with (A), (B), (C)."
