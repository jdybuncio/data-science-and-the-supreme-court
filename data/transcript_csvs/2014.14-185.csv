2014.14-185,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.815,"We'll hear argument next in Case 14-185, Mata v. Lynch. Mr. Fleming."
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,5.815,13.245,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court has been offered two ways to approach this case, a short way and a long way."
2014.14-185,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,21.5,24.9,You know the way to our hearts. (Laughter.)
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,24.9,38.015,"I try to please, Justice Kennedy. This is a case about appellate jurisdiction and specifically whether Congress has given the courts of appeals jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion to reopen that would be timely through the application of equitable tolling."
2014.14-185,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,82.05,86.905,"Can you explain why -- on the surface, he beats up his girlfriend."
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,102.75,108.36,"Justice Ginsburg, first of all, that -- that is a question that the First Circuit did not reach and we submit should have reached."
2014.14-185,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,201.605,202.24,What if --
2014.14-185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,202.24,202.84,"Well, wait --"
2014.14-185,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,202.84,209.29,"Wouldn't the Fifth Circuit need to be -- I mean, the Fifth Circuit view was no equitable tolling, period."
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,228.355,233.0,"Justice Ginsburg, we don't think that's what the Fifth Circuit did in this case or in any other."
2014.14-185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.94,269.425,"Why did -- why did the Fifth Circuit treat this, therefore, as a -- as it requested review the sua sponte extension granted below?"
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,269.425,269.77,It's --
2014.14-185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,269.77,287.99,"Why -- why would it have done that if it -- if it thought that, in fact, there was some argument about whether -- whether they could appeal the denial of extension in law as opposed to in the sua sponte discretion of the agency?"
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,287.99,292.63,"It's -- there are two stages to the answer, Justice Scalia."
2014.14-185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.09,312.135,Why? Why would one do that?
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,312.135,316.34,"So my best reading of them -- and again, the reasoning is sparse."
2014.14-185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,323.77,325.43,Which means there -- there's no equitable tolling.
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,325.43,329.54,"I -- I -- now, that's not something that they've ever adopted in a published decision."
2014.14-185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.115,348.32,Sure.
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,348.32,355.94,"-- or as a matter of administrative authority equitable tolling can be applied. But I -- I want to be clear, we -- we do not fear this question at all."
2014.14-185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.11,392.21,"Do you acknowledge that if -- if you view this as the Fifth Circuit viewed it, as a request to review the sua sponte extension granted by the agency, that the Fifth Circuit would have had no jurisdiction over that?"
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,392.21,396.26,"We do not, Justice Scalia. And I just want to be clear the context in which I answer that question."
2014.14-185,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,484.94,491.95,"Now, I've -- I've forgotten, but is there a circuit split on that third -- on the sua sponte review?"
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,491.95,502.865,"There is no circuit split as such because every other circuit believes, as we think is correct, that this kind of decision is reviewable as a matter of statutory authority."
2014.14-185,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,514.19,519.86,"How do we make it clear to the Fifth Circuit? We say Fifth Circuit, you have jurisdiction."
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,531.19,539.52,"If that is, in fact, what the Fifth Circuit does, then it may well be, because then there would be a clear circuit split on the merits question of the availability of equitable tolling."
2014.14-185,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,559.87,573.305,"Well, it knew at the time it rendered its decision that the other circuits were taking a different position on whether the 90-day period was susceptible to extension."
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,573.305,575.35,"It did, Your Honor."
2014.14-185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.04,595.175,I'm not sure -- did the First Circuit say it has no jurisdiction to review the -- the statutory question?
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,595.175,595.58,The --
2014.14-185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.58,612.23,"I thought all it did was, since there is no tolling under the statute, we're going to interpret this as a sua sponte thing, and the only question before them is whether that sua sponte thing conferred jurisdiction or not."
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,613.2,615.79,"It -- I -- I don't think so, Justice Scalia."
2014.14-185,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,615.79,615.91,Okay.
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,615.91,623.26,"I think if that had happened, if that was really what the Fifth Circuit meant to do, then it should have assumed jurisdiction over our request for statutory tolling."
2014.14-185,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,651.855,654.46,Where -- where is Mr. Mata at this point?
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,654.46,656.54,He's -- he's at home with his family.
2014.14-185,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,657.52,659.66,So you don't mind if this goes back to the Fifth Circuit.
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,659.66,680.625,"This should go back to the Fifth Circuit, and the question is simply that Mr. Peterson has raised is, what does it go back with? Does it go back solely with directions that the court has jurisdiction and everything should be addressed by the -- the Fifth Circuit in the first instance, or does it go back with a decision that, in addition to there being jurisdiction, there is also equitable tolling, and then the Fifth Circuit can address the question on the merits."
2014.14-185,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,680.625,681.32,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.14-185,0,35804,mark_c_fleming,,681.32,683.335,"With the Court's permission, I'll reserve the balance of my time."
2014.14-185,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,686.94,690.95,Mr. Yang.
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,690.95,701.2,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals here rested its decision on a basic and fundamental error of administrative law."
2014.14-185,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.005,733.105,But the way you put it causes me to believe that you agreed that the Fifth Circuit would have had no jurisdiction.
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,733.105,734.215,We --
2014.14-185,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,734.215,738.53,If indeed it was the sua sponte action that they were reviewing.
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,738.53,739.77,That's right.
2014.14-185,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.65,742.275,On that point.
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,742.275,745.2,But we don't think it affects the disposition here.
2014.14-185,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,754.29,773.175,"And Mr. Yang, could you point me to the place in the board's decision that you think makes clear what the board was doing? Because as I looked at the board's decision, honestly, I found it a little bit difficult to tell whether the board was denying it on statutory grounds or on sua sponte grounds."
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,773.175,776.975,I agree with you that the board's decision could be a little bit more clear.
2014.14-185,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,900.27,906.74,"I somehow have the impression, I don't know, the AG is going to have some kind of rulemaking relevant to this."
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,906.74,909.36,"There is pending rulemaking, as we noted in our brief."
2014.14-185,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,917.98,923.975,Rulemaking has to do with the existence or nonexistence of equitable tolling under this provision?
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,923.975,927.89,"The rulemaking, of course, is not public, but what I can tell you --"
2014.14-185,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,927.89,928.08,Yes.
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,928.08,936.72,"-- is that the -- in the Compean decision, the Attorney General addressed generally questions of ineffective assistance of counsel."
2014.14-185,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,953.33,962.84,"So on that assumption, that would, as I understand it, give the Fifth Circuit something new to think about in -- in addressing this question; is that right?"
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,962.84,982.86,"It certainly would, and it would also have the benefit, on remand, of the government's clear view that there is equitable tolling here, although not applicable to this alien, but just generally equitable tolling is available as all the courts of appeals have decided."
2014.14-185,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,988.865,1000.925,"Would the -- would the Fifth Circuit, with this rulemaking, you can't tell us what it is at this stage, this early stage, would it be available, will they have a rule should we remand this case to the Fifth Circuit?"
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1000.925,1005.54,I think it's unlikely there's going to be a final rule by the time this Court's decision is issued.
2014.14-185,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1021.76,1025.375,"I'm -- I'm sorry, but there would be an NPR when? Late this calendar year?"
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1025.375,1026.21,Late this calendar year.
2014.14-185,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1137.37,1146.48,"Well, to be fair to the Fifth Circuit, I mean, I can't put myself in their mind, but I think they may well have been trying to give Mr. Mata the benefit of the doubt or give him every chance."
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1158.965,1168.685,"Well, I won't speculate what to -- what the court of appeals' motivations might have been for its ruling, but the ruling itself is again just fundamentally into the teeth of Chenery."
2014.14-185,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1195.62,1204.34,"Just to try to be a little bit generous to the Fifth Circuit, again, I mean, I started off by saying, I found it a little bit hard to tell what the agency was doing."
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1214.74,1218.02,And I don't mean to -- to fault the Fifth Circuit.
2014.14-185,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1218.02,1223.255,"But, I mean, you can't really -- Chenery can't really operate very well if you can't figure it out."
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1223.255,1225.01,"Well, that's true."
2014.14-185,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1252.74,1270.63,"Is it true that the -- the -- the agency, the BIA, has, a number of times, recognized the existence of equitable tolling of this 90-day period, but has never done so in a precedential opinion?"
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1270.63,1271.955,That -- that is correct.
2014.14-185,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1321.8,1322.55,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.14-185,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1322.55,1325.34,Thank you.
2014.14-185,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1325.34,1330.105,Mr. Peterson.
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,1330.105,1360.06,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree with the government that orders denying statutory motions to reopen are reviewable in the courts of appeals, and we agree with the government that orders of the board denying invitations for the board to reopen sua sponte are not reviewable in the courts of appeals because they're committed to agency discretion by law. Where we part ways with the government is on how you distinguish between the two of them."
2014.14-185,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1482.63,1521.705,"Well, I'm -- I'm a little concerned because we do have to, on some levels, address the question of whether a sua -- sua sponte decision not to -- not to reopen is -- is reviewable. I -- I think as a general matter, one could say that given the vast discretion that the BIA gets in denying, that one should basically defer to their decisions in sua sponte reopenings."
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,1572.72,1578.325,"Your Honor, we disagree that Lozada sets the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel."
2014.14-185,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1584.2,1584.38,You're right.
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,1594.59,1603.4,"Your Honor, we would disagree that in this case, the board actually construed Petitioner as asking for equitable tolling."
2014.14-185,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1630.23,1630.6,"Well, who was he --"
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,1630.6,1630.78,-- Appeals.
2014.14-185,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1630.78,1646.415,"-- represented by at that stage? I mean, is -- this is a case involving ineffective assistance of counsel when he brought the -- at -- at what stage was there competent counsel?"
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,1646.415,1660.35,"Justice Ginsburg, my understanding is the Petitioner's current theory is that he was represented by competent counsel when he retained new counsel after the board's initial denial of his appeal."
2014.14-185,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1664.55,1667.545,What we have here is a question that we agreed to review.
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,1778.074,1791.59,"Justice Breyer, as we understand what the Fifth Circuit did here, the Fifth Circuit has already established in its jurisprudence that equitable tolling is unavailable for statutory motions. I know Petitioner now takes a different view."
2014.14-185,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1837.56,1847.524,"Well, but normally it's a -- a circuit precedent establishing a particular rule on the merits doesn't operate as a bar to jurisdiction."
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,1866.735,1877.11,"Mr. Chief Justice, we think the difference here is that the deadline isn't simply a question of whether the board was right or wrong in denying the statutory motion."
2014.14-185,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1922.055,1943.815,"Do you deny that the plaintiff here -- that Petitioner thought that he was asking for equitable tolling? Because I guess -- I guess this is very similar to the Chief Justice's question, but it seems to me if somebody comes in and he says, I'm entitled to equitable tolling, and the court thinks, no, you're not, equitable tolling is unavailable."
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,1979.625,1984.67,"Well, Justice Kagan we believe that's what the Fifth Circuit did, albeit implicitly."
2014.14-185,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1993.1,1997.195,"No, but there's a -- there is something, and this is what the Chief Justice was saying, too."
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,2016.62,2022.42,The court of appeals certainly always has jurisdiction to determine whether it has jurisdiction.
2014.14-185,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2024.75,2027.915,It's not determining whether it has jurisdiction.
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,2055.525,2072.78,"Justice Kagan, as we've tried to suggest it, the timeliness is related to the jurisdiction, because the timeliness of the motion to reopen tells you whether the board's order denying reopening is an order that was solely in the board's discretion or not."
2014.14-185,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2072.78,2075.71,But it's really -- you're taking a merits first.
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,2113.595,2126.22,"Your Honor, yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do agree the Fifth Circuit can decide that -- has decided it, and as a result of deciding that, did properly reach the judgement it reached in this case."
2014.14-185,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2126.22,2140.245,"But you see there's a little bit of a problem with the way the Fifth Circuit is going about this thing, because what the Fifth Circuit has done is to say that equitable tolling is unavailable and the only time it ever uttered those words is in an unpublished opinion."
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,2164.9,2170.57,"Justice Scalia, when Ramos-Bonilla adopted the --"
2014.14-185,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2170.57,2174.8,He's definitely Justice Scalia. (Laughter.)
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,2174.8,2176.48,I'm very sorry --
2014.14-185,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2176.48,2180.52,And we're not often confused. (Laughter.)
2014.14-185,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.52,2185.105,"It's a good question, though. (Laughter.)"
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,2185.105,2186.295,Thank you.
2014.14-185,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2220.325,2220.68,Wouldn't the --
2014.14-185,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2220.68,2253.49,"But the problem that I actually have, I guess, at your reaction, is if we don't follow what I think is the fairly simple thing of the question presented, you announce two things that I think there's a huge argument about. One is whether there is court review of the sua sponte thing because, as you probably know, there has been a long argument for 40 years about the meaning of that first part of the APA in Davis; or somebody says, well, when they say there's no court review when you commit a matter of discretion to the agency by law, of course there isn't."
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,2318.695,2320.18,"Well, thank you, Justice Breyer."
2014.14-185,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2323.06,2323.435,Yes.
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,2323.435,2339.34,"But let me point out though that the Solicitor General might agree that equitable tolling is available, but agrees with us that every court of appeals other than the Fifth Circuit to have addressed the availability of equitable tolling has gotten its analysis wrong."
2014.14-185,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2397.615,2398.75,I'm sorry.
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,2481.804,2505.14,"Justice Sotomayor, with respect to the Fifth Circuit, I believe, I would hope, that we've supplied the reasonings -- reasoning for why the Fifth Circuit's decision on equitable tolling is correct. With respect to the agency determinations, the Board of Immigration Appeals, with rare exceptions -- and there's no suggestion that this case is one -- will follow the authority of the circuit in which it sits."
2014.14-185,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2538.955,2540.27,They are saying --
2014.14-185,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2540.27,2540.96,That's -- that's --
2014.14-185,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2540.96,2552.87,"-- if the Fifth Circuit was right in saying we -- we -- so -- so we're going to give the Petitioner another chance, we'll consider it under sua sponte."
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,2620.13,2622.01,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.14-185,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2742.394,2758.354,So -- so you -- you say the Fifth Circuit did not implicitly hold that there was no review of -- of the statutory deadline period --
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,2758.354,2760.3,As we understand --
2014.14-185,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2760.3,2793.555,"-- because you think the Fifth Circuit read the -- the board's decision, since it came after the 90 days, to be a sua sponte decision and, hence, nonreviewable. But that's not consistent with their earlier decisions, which said, we're going to interpret it this way because we have no jurisdiction to do it if you interpret it the other way. I mean, they didn't say that, if it's after the 90 days, the -- the board should consider it to be an appeal to its sua sponte authority."
2014.14-185,2,56188,william_r_peterson,,2809.805,2813.91,"Yes, Your Honor, but we see the two as essentially indistinguishable."
2014.14-185,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2909.665,2915.095,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fleming, you have four minutes remaining."
2014.14-185,3,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2915.095,2936.68,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I -- I would simply clarify the -- the issue raised, I think, first by Justice Kagan, but then by others, as to whether there was any confusion in either the board or the Fifth Circuit as to what relief my client was seeking. In the board decision, on page 7 of the Petition Appendix, the board makes clear that it understands that Mr. Mata was seeking tolling."
2014.14-185,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3011.69,3011.81,Do you --
2014.14-185,3,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3011.81,3012.4,-- is the one that should be --
2014.14-185,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3012.4,3032.98,"-- do you disagree with Mr. Peterson that if we were simply to say, Fifth Circuit, you have jurisdiction to decide this issue of equitable tolling, that then the -- from what they've done so far, the likelihood is they'll say, fine, we have jurisdiction, there is no equitable tolling?"
2014.14-185,3,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3032.98,3036.88,I do disagree because I don't think that's a foregone conclusion.
2014.14-185,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3070.845,3083.335,"What -- what of the argument that -- that the presumption of equitable tolling applies to statutes of limitations, but not for procedural time limits like this?"
2014.14-185,3,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3083.335,3088.46,"Our -- our position, Justice Ginsburg, as laid out in our reply brief, is that this is a statute of limitations."
2014.14-185,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3150.92,3158.975,"Thank you. Mr. Peterson, this Court appointed you to brief and argue this case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment below."
