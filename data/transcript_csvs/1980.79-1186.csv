1980.79-1186,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.873,We'll hear arguments next in Dennis v. Sparks and Lynd.
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,48.903,57.946,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1186,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,109.191,111.753,Isn't immunity an affirmative defense?
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,111.753,123.357,"Judicial immunity, Your Honor, Petitioner submits, is more than an affirmative defense."
1980.79-1186,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,123.357,127.387,You mean it has a little bit of jurisdiction on it?
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,127.387,148.269,"Your Honor, in examining the development of judicial immunity, it seems that an argument can be made that it's in the rationale behind judicial immunity, the public interest to be served by judicial immunity."
1980.79-1186,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,159.561,173.26,"Well, are you suggesting that it's comparable to, analogous to the posture of a United States Senator under the Speech or Debate Clause, that he may not be questioned in any other place?"
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,173.26,196.062,"I'm saying, yes, that it's analogous to legislative immunity, congressional immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause if the judge, if the purpose for questioning the judge or for suing the judge is because of his act or conduct while a judge, acting within his jurisdiction."
1980.79-1186,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,196.062,201.092,"But we don't have a speech or debate clause typed for judges, do we?"
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,201.092,202.201,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-1186,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,202.201,206.417,That's a judicially constructive concept.
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,206.417,207.386,"It's a common law of construction; yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1186,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,282.246,291.79,So what if the judge is served with a complaint in an action such as this and simply lets the time for answer go by and a default judgment is taken against him?
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,294.164,301.848,Or he answers... yes.
1980.79-1186,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,301.848,306.423,Or he answers and litigates the case without ever raising the claim that judgment is against him.
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,307.345,323.917,"Petitioner's position is that judicial immunity, that the public interest behind judicial immunity is that it's not in the judge's discretion to raise the question of judicial immunity."
1980.79-1186,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,330.883,340.582,"So, even if he said I want to answer this on the merits and clear my name of these allegations in the complaint he would not be permitted to do so under your theory?"
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,340.582,351.546,"Your Honor, my response to that is does that not raise the question, or beg the issue, about the underlying rationale for the immunity?"
1980.79-1186,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,363.682,365.682,"As you say, on your submission, it's a matter almost of jurisdiction."
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,365.682,366.291,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1186,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,380.909,382.128,What could you do about it?
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,383.815,387.422,What can my client do about it?
1980.79-1186,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,387.422,397.966,What could you or anybody else do if a judgment was obtained against Judge Joe Bloke who never told anybody that he was a judge and never raised a question?
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,402.276,404.073,"Well, Your Honor, they know he was a judge."
1980.79-1186,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,404.073,407.04,But he says that it's not jurisdictional.
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,407.04,417.331,"If he came to me and was sued for conduct while not carrying out his judicial function, I would agree."
1980.79-1186,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,421.378,433.435,"Then it's not jurisdictional... In fact, if you'd sue him as John Jones and he happens to be a judge, what would happen?"
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,433.435,437.918,"Well, why am I suing him?"
1980.79-1186,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,440.215,447.305,"For just what he did here, and you didn't mention that he was a judge?"
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,447.305,460.798,--I would say that the public interest requires that the reviewing court apply judicial immunity and say that this judge is immune because he was acting as a judge when he did what he is alleged to have done.
1980.79-1186,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,460.798,467.953,"Let's assume... can't we start with an assumption that this judge is immune and go on to your client who is not a judge, is he?"
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,467.953,469.203,"That's right, Your Honor."
1980.79-1186,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,475.169,479.479,"--vicarious exemption, if it is an exemption?"
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,479.479,480.135,--Right.
1980.79-1186,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,557.12,562.149,That's a matter of... those cases really turn on standing--
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,562.149,563.633,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1186,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,563.633,574.114,"--and as one person has the interest through the rights of jus tertii, the rights of a third person."
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,581.515,581.89,"Well, no, no."
1980.79-1186,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,695.377,717.633,"What would be your analysis if the United States... a member of the United States Congress, House or Senate, was involved in a conspiracy with a private citizen and then the private citizen is a defendant, but not the Member of Congress?"
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,728.972,733.502,"My answer is yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1186,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,733.502,739.625,"I must say that here because if it isn't true there it couldn't possibly be true here, could it be?"
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,739.625,740.764,I tend to agree with Your Honor.
1980.79-1186,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,740.764,743.247,Something like pendent immunity.
1980.79-1186,0,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,746.59,754.759,"I am very reluctant to get into the area of using the terms of immunity, I suppose."
1980.79-1186,1,26118,garland_f_smith,,1291.953,1299.903,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the question, I think, is pretty before the Court."
1980.79-1186,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1424.383,1444.298,"Of course, one of the reasons for the immunity doctrine is that it's awfully hard to separate out, you know, before you go to trial and appeal, and so forth, the honorable judge who made a mistake in his ruling and the corrupt judge who's been jailed for theft."
1980.79-1186,1,26118,garland_f_smith,,1444.298,1447.28,I think Learned Hand addressed that question in one of his decisions.
1980.79-1186,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1456.808,1463.274,"But it wasn't made at the time you filed your 1983 action, was it?"
1980.79-1186,1,26118,garland_f_smith,,1463.274,1464.336,--Oh yes.
1980.79-1186,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.227,1507.413,But this wasn't the rationale of the Court of Appeals?
1980.79-1186,1,26118,garland_f_smith,,1507.413,1508.351,How's that?
1980.79-1186,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1508.351,1514.162,"This isn't the rationale of the Court of Appeals, the en banc decision of the Court of Appeals?"
1980.79-1186,1,26118,garland_f_smith,,1514.162,1514.88,"Oh, no sir."
1980.79-1186,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1514.88,1517.879,"Now, you're going to defend that, aren't you?"
1980.79-1186,1,26118,garland_f_smith,,1517.879,1519.238,"Oh yes, I'm going to address that."
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3135.011,3148.444,"Yes, Your Honor, if I may take a few minutes to respond to several matters that have been raised."
1980.79-1186,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3218.321,3223.211,"Yes, I know, but they say that's a briar patch down in Duval County, that they can't get justice."
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3223.211,3229.474,"Well, part of that lawsuit is pending in Nueces County, Your Honor, as was pointed out in our brief."
1980.79-1186,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3239.188,3239.813,What's that?
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3240.032,3243.546,"Yes, Your Honor, which I submit is not a hornet's nest in Texas."
1980.79-1186,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3243.546,3245.358,A briar patch is their place.
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3245.358,3246.561,Or briar patch.
1980.79-1186,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3246.561,3260.289,"Mr. Edmonds, if you had four conspirators here, alleged conspirators, rather than just one and the judge, but one of the four was a state judge, would you still be here?"
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3260.289,3265.193,If one of the four was a state judge?
1980.79-1186,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3265.193,3265.771,Yes.
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3265.771,3266.458,"Well, that's--"
1980.79-1186,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3266.458,3273.049,"So that his immunity applies to all the other conspirators, not just a single one."
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3275.127,3275.939,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1186,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3279.375,3296.413,"Well, what if the plaintiffs in a lawsuit file the lawsuit against your clients and they claim the immunity and your clients come in and claim immunity, based on the immunity of a state judge?"
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3327.419,3332.744,The public interest behind judicial immunity would definitely not be satisfied.
1980.79-1186,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3332.744,3333.712,Why?
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3334.165,3340.991,"Your statement, that in the course of these proceedings we're going to prove that there was a conspiracy for this judge to do wrong."
1980.79-1186,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3363.419,3375.618,"Well, do you think that the public interest rationale is meant to kind of put up a facade to the public that all judges are much more honest than normal people?"
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3375.618,3380.366,"To use Mr. Smith's term, I guess that would be a fiction that we'd be dealing with, Your Honor."
1980.79-1186,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3402.076,3404.465,"Well, the public interest connection--"
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3404.465,3406.231,Perhaps public interest will be changed then.
1980.79-1186,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.231,3417.507,"--The public interest rationale certainly doesn't prevent the filing of a complaint, which may get great publicity in the papers as to what the claims are about what some judge did."
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3438.404,3439.919,Yes.
1980.79-1186,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3439.919,3455.492,"And if the finding is that the conspirators really did conspire with the judge, it doesn't add a whole... so what's the--"
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3455.492,3458.819,"Just the mere fact of filing, the ability to file a lawsuit."
1980.79-1186,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3458.819,3461.724,"--Well... oh, I know, but the immunity doesn't protect their buddy from that."
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3461.724,3461.989,"That's right, that's right."
1980.79-1186,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3473.828,3491.977,"Even with the explicit, very explicit immunity and protection of the Speech or Debate Clause, a member of Congress can be sued under 1983 or in many other ways, and that doesn't stop that exposure."
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3491.977,3497.334,"No, but he's immune if the conduct for which he was sued falls under the Speech or Debate Clause."
1980.79-1186,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3497.334,3502.02,Yes but he isn't immune from having someone file a complaint with a lot of scurrilous allegations.
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3502.02,3505.096,"Yes, Your Honor, that's right."
1980.79-1186,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3562.558,3570.147,"Well, he would have very big trouble doing that in the face of the Anti-injunction Act and a few other things."
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3570.147,3583.753,Under 1983 if we have a conspiracy and if the immunity of that judge does not in effect shield the judicial proceeding--
1980.79-1186,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3583.753,3589.219,"Well, you aren't going to be, you wouldn't be enjoining the judge or the judicial proceeding."
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3589.219,3590.764,--No.
1980.79-1186,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3595.279,3596.591,"Well, you mean he could... well, all right."
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3600.604,3604.307,"Well, Your Honor, that is bribery."
1980.79-1186,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3605.899,3606.587,That would be enjoining a crime.
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3609.181,3613.131,"Well, maybe I didn't state myself clearly."
1980.79-1186,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3627.984,3642.385,"What you say is that in any court action that has more than one defendant and one of the defendants is an immune judge, all of the others are equally immune."
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3644.447,3648.086,If it's a suit under a... a civil action suit--
1980.79-1186,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3648.086,3650.991,"If it's a suit, 1983 or anything else--"
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3650.991,3654.787,--And if it's based upon the Judge's conduct as a judge.
1980.79-1186,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3654.787,3668.936,"--If it has more than person involved and one of the people is a judge, all of the others... one, two, or 37... are all immune."
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3668.936,3670.169,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1186,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3676.758,3678.246,You notice I didn't ask you for any support.
1980.79-1186,2,23876,finley_l_edmonds,,3678.246,3679.012,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1186,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3722.478,3724.711,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
