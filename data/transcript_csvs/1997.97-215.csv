1997.97-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.788,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-215, Arthur Calderon v. Thomas Thompson."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,49.364,53.275,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
1997.97-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,94.655,104.602,"Ms. Wilkens, what are the limits on a court of appeals' power and authority to recall a mandate sua sponte?"
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,109.474,119.301,"--Well, first, in distinguishing between an ordinary civil case and a 2254 case I don't perceive any limitations on an ordinary civil case."
1997.97-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,120.892,123.125,Even after a judgment has become final?
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,123.125,124.164,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,139.675,147.989,"And what do we look to in the case of a habeas proceeding, which we've said is a civil action?"
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,149.791,160.859,"I would invite the Court to look to the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 22a, wherein Congress has recently delineated a role for the courts of appeal as a gatekeeper."
1997.97-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.151,195.912,Do you think that the new Federal Antiterrorism and Death Penalty Act speaks to the question of what a court of appeals can do concerning recalling its own mandate?
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,195.912,198.813,"--Well, it does not specifically reference the recall of the mandate."
1997.97-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.813,199.284,No.
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,199.284,217.767,"It most assuredly speaks to finality, and, in fact, section 2244 as amended by the Effective Death Penalty Act is entitled finality, interjects res judicata into habeas corpus, and specifically delineates the narrow circumstances under which additional litigation will occur."
1997.97-215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,217.767,221.718,"Well, it talks about a second or successive habeas corpus application."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,243.082,256.302,Once... it would be if the first petition were final and it becomes final upon the expiration of time for filing certiorari in this Court or this Court's denial of certiorari.
1997.97-215,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,256.302,267.139,"Yes, but finality, as I understand your answer to an earlier question, there isn't a finality issue under the general rule for civil cases, is that correct?"
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,267.139,267.88,That's correct.
1997.97-215,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,267.88,268.338,All right.
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,309.664,319.691,"Well, Your Honor, there's precedent for the actions of the court being considered within the confines of the abuse of the writ doctrine."
1997.97-215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,328.218,329.369,"Well, but that's a different argument."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,354.665,356.087,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,356.087,357.606,"And if you want to spend your time on that, fine."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,362.769,395.881,"Well, certainly there are several ways to analyze it, and if this Court does not consider that we have passed into the successive petition area within respect to the Effective Death Penalty Act, most assuredly, as this court was informed by the Effective Death Penalty Act in determining Felker, we do not believe that the Ninth Circuit should be any less informed by the limitations upon relitigating the same claims on the same facts and the same law."
1997.97-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,395.881,416.636,"Let me go back a moment to the questions I believe Justice O'Connor asked about the general standard for reviewing, recalling a mandate, or for a court, an appellate court... are any of those Federal cases, did the recall of the mandate occur after this Court had denied certiorari?"
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,416.636,419.868,"I believe there are instances where that has in fact occurred, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,419.868,421.049,And are they in the brief?
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,421.049,449.196,"I believe so, and again this unique nature of 2254 cases has been repeatedly recognized by this Court, and most recently, even in the Agostini case, there was a citation to Teague as an express acknowledgement as to the distinctions between procedural rule's ordinary application in the ordinary civil case."
1997.97-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,462.877,465.599,I don't understand what AEDPA has to do with this.
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,507.574,521.465,"Well, it's most assuredly an abuse of discretion, but we need not even reach the traditional abuse of discretion standard because they're applying the wrong standard, because you must turn to the applicable law."
1997.97-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,524.275,534.512,"In other words, you're saying, suppose a circuit decides in favor of a petitioner, and then we agree to review it, does that have anything to do with AEDPA?"
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,543.688,547.091,--In a timely manner I would agree with Your Honor.
1997.97-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,547.091,547.571,All right.
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,553.304,554.065,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,560.18,562.611,"Ms. Wilkens, who did it sua sponte?"
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,586.647,587.878,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.878,589.4,But how did it get en banc?
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,591.88,593.249,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,593.249,600.606,"It was a vote of the majority of all the judges in active service, as rule, what is it, 35a requires."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,600.606,601.126,Yes.
1997.97-215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.126,605.59,"And that majority of all the active judges, what did they vote to put en banc?"
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,608.813,609.594,"No, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,617.929,618.46,Yes.
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,634.248,640.232,"That's correct, and we have questioned how you can rehear something that was not before the three judge panel."
1997.97-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,640.232,664.8,"Is that unusual, too, because isn't it a... I mean, it happens sometimes an appellant says to a court, we'd like you to issue a writ of... we'd like you to review this on appeal, and you hear it then as the court, and then the court says, gee, we can't decide this on appeal, but we have the power anyway to issue, say, a writ of mandamus, so we do it for that reason."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,664.8,668.683,"I would say this is clearly distinguishable, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,672.875,673.836,Is what they said.
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,673.836,676.448,--is what they said at the time they acted sua sponte.
1997.97-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,683.403,686.907,"Let me tell you precisely, rather than... what's bothering me... at some point we'll get to this point."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,731.926,732.455,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,802.212,806.443,But isn't there an analogy... you were asked whether the court of appeals acted sua sponte.
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,820.551,821.583,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,828.198,829.299,But then what are the restrictions on the court of appeals?
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,830.409,836.112,"--Again, the courts of appeals no longer have original habeas corpus jurisdiction."
1997.97-215,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,840.517,842.587,"No, but they didn't issue a writ of habeas corpus."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,844.149,847.87,"--Our position, Your Honor, once that first Federal habeas proceeding--"
1997.97-215,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,847.87,855.516,"Anything else any other court would do in the proceeding would be a petitioner acting on a writ of habeas corpus, in effect."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,855.516,856.635,--It must--
1997.97-215,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,856.635,859.627,"If so, why wasn't our grant basically looked the same way?"
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,859.627,861.958,--Because you're not a court of appeal.
1997.97-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,868.263,869.585,Well--
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,895.401,896.402,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,903.896,908.15,How do you define when the first court of... habeas corpus proceeding comes to a close?
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,908.15,913.093,That would be with the denial of certiorari by this Court or the expiration of time for seeking certiorari.
1997.97-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,913.093,914.475,The reason they said--
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,916.005,917.607,"Griffith v. Kentucky, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,917.607,917.915,Pardon me?
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,917.915,919.237,"Griffith v. Kentucky, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,919.237,925.562,I thought the reason they said they waited was because they wanted to see what the State courts would do.
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,934.398,941.821,I think that in the context of habeas corpus litigation that that is an inappropriate... an inappropriate consideration.
1997.97-215,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,955.191,967.399,"But this was a case where the court said, yes, we slipped up, there was a lot of carelessness going on, but the one thing we want you to know is, we are not entertaining a second habeas."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1016.752,1033.962,"Your Honor, significantly, it really matters little in the context of Federal habeas corpus in the long run as to whether or not this was pre Effective Death Penalty Act or post Effective Death Penalty Act, because it would be our position that the abuse of the writ doctrine should also have informed the Ninth Circuit."
1997.97-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1084.816,1103.298,"Well, Ms. Wilkens, let me ask you a question here about, suppose we think that the new Federal death penalty act does not mean that a circuit court cannot recall its own mandate."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1136.811,1149.538,"Your Honor, I believe there must be a distinct standard once the first habeas corpus proceeding has become final, otherwise it is a way to circumvent all of this Court's law controlling--"
1997.97-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1149.538,1164.758,"And do you think that standard should be different in death penalty cases than in ordinary civil cases, or in a criminal case versus... I mean, a criminal habeas proceeding versus a normal civil case?"
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1164.758,1165.92,"--Yes, definitely."
1997.97-215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1165.92,1166.961,And what is the standard?
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1166.961,1180.299,"I would urge this Court to engraft the standard from Congress' enactment of the Effective Death Penalty Act, otherwise a vehicle is left open to circumvent--"
1997.97-215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1180.299,1182.269,"You mean, there's just no authority at all to withdraw the mandate?"
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1182.269,1185.602,--The only means by which--
1997.97-215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1185.602,1199.31,"It's very odd for us to say, well now, suppose the AEDPA does not apply, what is the standard for withdrawing a mandate, what is the standard for... or to determine whether or not there was an abuse of discretion, and you say... and then you say, AEDPA."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1204.475,1209.448,"--Well, miscarriage of justice has been heightened by the Effective Death Penalty Act, and I--"
1997.97-215,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1209.448,1226.047,"Well, but if you... I think what's bothering all of us is that if you import the... a standard out of the Effective Death Penalty Act, then you are acting on exactly the opposite assumption of Justice O'Connor's questions and all the questions that have been asked."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1260.342,1266.796,"--Your Honor, it's not my intention to identify the court with the petitioner."
1997.97-215,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1268.156,1269.698,But isn't that the way you're ending up?
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1269.698,1274.26,"--Well, the interests of the State need to be preserved, and if--"
1997.97-215,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1274.26,1292.983,"Well, the act has made it clear that the interests of the State are being served by limiting what petitioners can do, and now I think you're saying the State's interest in effect cannot be served at all unless you likewise limit what a court sua sponte can do."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1328.816,1351.3,"--Well, Your Honor, I tried not to delineate between disingenuous and well intentioned with the belief that it's important to preserve the State's interests, and if a recall of a mandate is upon anything less than a miscarriage of justice, whether sua sponte or by the inmate, then the State's interests are not being preserved."
1997.97-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1351.3,1375.917,"Well, Ms. Wilkens, in our Felker opinion we dealt with several different issues, and one of them was a case where it was not clear whether the AEDPA had restricted our... the court of jurisdiction of this Court, but we nonetheless said that the exercise of our discretion would be guided by the standards that were made applicable to the lower courts."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1396.662,1399.683,"Yes, Your Honor, that would protect the State's interests."
1997.97-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1399.683,1409.33,"But how does the... I think the reason I'm having trouble is, the only cases I can think of where as a circuit we recalled a mandate were things like, there was a clerk error."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1428.774,1429.866,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1429.866,1435.238,So you must be thinking of a certain subset of recalls of mandates.
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1464.848,1473.974,The rule of law would be that a court entertaining a motion to recall would deem that... if it came from the inmate would deem it to be a successive application.
1997.97-215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1478.156,1482.309,"Even if there was just a simple clerical mistake, I mean, the court of appeals has no power--"
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1482.309,1483.19,"--No, Your Honor--"
1997.97-215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1483.19,1490.306,"--I mean, this is a... it seems to me a very difficult rule that you're asking us to adopt for a case where you have some other substantial arguments."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1490.306,1491.287,"--No, Your Honor--"
1997.97-215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1491.287,1492.188,"If you don't want to make them, that's your problem."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1492.188,1493.619,--We are not addressing clerical error.
1997.97-215,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1496.951,1500.433,What were you do if there were a clerical error and the mandate had been issued?
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1500.433,1502.935,They could correct the clerical error.
1997.97-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1504.504,1506.737,"You know, your time's about up."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1529.191,1532.364,If you apply the Rule 60(b) standards--
1997.97-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1532.364,1532.845,Yes.
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1532.845,1549.898,"--consistent with this Court's own authority you must engraft the applicable law from habeas corpus, and if the actions of the Ninth Circuit, sua sponte or otherwise, are considered under ordinary rules applicable to 60(b), the result in this case could not have occurred, and we do urge the Court to make it abundantly clear that--"
1997.97-215,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1549.898,1551.177,And why do you say that?
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1560.153,1564.296,--Because it undermines every decision from this Court on abuse of the writ.
1997.97-215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1570.061,1592.064,"Why can't you say that you can't recall it when the basis on which you're recalling it is a determination that it was wrong on the merits, which would be the same basis for a recall... for a habeas corpus subsequent review, but if the basis is that there has been some clerical error, or some other defect of that sort, then it can be recalled?"
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1592.064,1592.805,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1598.638,1599.179,We examine the merits.
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1599.179,1603.563,"--Right, establish well established law to the same facts and come up with a contrary result--"
1997.97-215,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.563,1604.963,Unless there's a miscarriage of justice.
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1604.963,1605.624,--Exactly.
1997.97-215,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1606.813,1607.484,All right.
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1610.887,1615.83,"Well, in this case it's quite clear that Mr. Thompson could not make a showing of a miscarriage of justice."
1997.97-215,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1615.83,1629.679,"That's right, but it's also clear, isn't it, that the court of appeals said, we made a procedural error, and a stage in our review, the en banc stage, was cut short by this procedural error."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1654.785,1661.48,It certainly does not fall under the procedural prong because Mr. Thompson was not entitled to en banc process.
1997.97-215,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1670.866,1680.002,"No, but... I don't want to play with words, but I think it's the case that under the rules the members of the court were entitled to call for an en banc standard themselves."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1681.493,1682.634,In a timely manner.
1997.97-215,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1683.723,1687.406,"Yes, but they say the reason it wasn't timely was that we made a procedural mistake."
1997.97-215,0,28410,holly_d_wilkens,,1694.212,1696.663,"No, because it could conceivably alter the judgment."
1997.97-215,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1765.288,1768.901,"There's nothing to reserve, Ms. Wilkens."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1770.551,1774.664,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.556,1795.857,"Of course, the full court of appeals didn't decide to rehear it sua sponte."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1795.857,1797.429,I think that we don't know--
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1797.429,1806.957,"After it got to the panel the panel... oh, I think it's very clear that what the court of appeals did was to grant the motion for rehearing in banc of the petitioner."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1806.957,1808.285,"--Certainly they did that, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1842.2,1843.031,On the motion.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1843.031,1845.231,"--No, on no motion."
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.604,1852.354,Let's find where it is.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1854.367,1860.16,--There was a sua sponte suggestion that the court should take the matter en banc.
1997.97-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1865.323,1868.055,--Do you have any pages?
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1868.055,1868.716,--Yes.
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1885.406,1887.199,--en banc opinion?
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1887.199,1888.908,--This is the en banc opinion.
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1888.908,1889.429,Yes.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1889.429,1897.014,"A sua sponte request to consider en banc whether to recall the mandate was made shortly thereafter, meaning after the mandate issued, but before it was spread."
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1909.172,1912.865,"Well, wait, a sua sponte request to consider en banc."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1914.264,1915.316,--I take it that--
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1915.316,1916.866,One of the judges made a request.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1916.866,1922.863,"--I know no more than what is set forth in the opinion, Your Honor, so we're left to speculate on that."
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.26,1933.277,"This doesn't remotely say that the full court, a majority of the judges in active service, decided sua sponte to reexamine that decision."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1933.277,1934.489,"--Well, I believe that--"
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.489,1935.168,It doesn't remotely say that.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1935.168,1937.99,--I believe that the en banc court makes that clear in its opinion.
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1937.99,1955.922,"Oh, the... I have no doubt that the en banc court, in order to avoid the impediment of the Effective Death Penalty Act, said we are not considering this at the instance of the petitioner, we're considering it on our own, but the question is whether the majority of the judges in active service did that."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1955.922,1968.802,"My answer is yes, clearly they did, and the reason they did clearly is that after the opinion was issued an active judge in the Ninth Circuit called for the full court to vote on whether to withdraw the matter from the en banc panel."
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1974.715,1978.338,And that proves that a majority of the active judges voted to do this sua sponte?
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1978.338,1981.768,"It... what it proves to me, Justice Scalia, is that a majority of the--"
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.768,1983.731,It proves that they probably had enough of this by then.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1986.062,1995.499,"--What it proves to me, Justice Scalia, is that all of the active judges had an opportunity to question or to repudiate a misstatement of fact contained in the en banc court."
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.499,1996.06,I agree with that.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,1996.691,2005.905,"And further, under Missouri v. Jenkins, this Court's decision, this Court has often indicated that it will accept at its word an explanation given by a court of appeals for its actions."
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.905,2007.617,It wasn't the full court of appeals.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2038.345,2041.328,"I respectfully disagree with you on that, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2059.911,2060.692,"No, I don't think--"
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2060.692,2062.632,The court then is at liberty to withdraw from the panel.
1997.97-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2066.123,2069.938,"--When you say, en banc panel, you mean the eleven judges, right?"
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2069.938,2070.766,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2070.766,2109.692,"There is some enlightenment, perhaps, in Judge Kozinski's opinion, who says, on July 7, 1997, Judge Z sent a memorandum, which memorandum he said called for a belated en banc, and then the court's order as a whole issued on July 30, 1997, and it says, the full court has voted to consider whether to recall mandate, so that what the full court did, it looks like from the timing, July 7, a judge requested a belated en banc, and on July 30 the full court votes to consider whether to recall the mandate."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2111.085,2118.459,"I believe, Your Honor, that that is consistent with the procedure in which all of the active judges of the circuit must vote on whether to do so."
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2138.771,2139.342,Excuse me.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2160.977,2170.173,"--But Justice Scalia, they were acting as the Ninth Circuit, properly constituted in accordance with the rules of that circuit and with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure."
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.605,2203.615,"No, only insofar as Rule 35a is concerned, which is a very narrowly segregable rule which requires that the en banc vote have the acquiescence, or the affirmative vote of a majority of active judges, and if the issue is whether the Ninth Circuit was considering this sua sponte or rather upon the motion of the petitioner, the only thing the Ninth Circuit did under 35a was to consider it on the motion of the petitioner."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2203.615,2210.238,"Except that there was the later requires to withdraw it from the panel, also under Rule 35a, that was declined by the full court."
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.238,2210.769,I understand.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2223.198,2229.432,"Well, Your Honor, I think that in light of my time I must beg to differ with the Court on this issue."
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.432,2234.165,"I'm sorry for taking so much of your time on this, but this is an important point to my view of the case."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2234.165,2235.787,"I understand that it is, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.787,2236.876,I will--
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2236.876,2240.568,"I wish I could convince you to the contrary, but I think I must move on."
1997.97-215,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2240.568,2249.574,"--Do I understand that your basic position on this is that those 11 members of the Ninth Circuit are like the 12 members of, say, the D.C. Circuit for all purposes?"
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2249.574,2250.436,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2276.946,2279.676,"This is the only circuit that has this at the moment, isn't it?"
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2279.676,2280.626,I believe that's correct.
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2296.47,2300.783,But that power I assume is controlled by an abuse of discretion standard.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2300.783,2301.943,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2308.868,2322.445,"And how does the judge exercise his or her discretion in a case such as this, where habeas proceedings have gone on for some, I think, 9 years, 7 years in the Federal courts alone."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2329.561,2335.287,"Well, if I may quarrel with the previously final judgment a bit later, I'll answer your question directly."
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2350.207,2354.428,"Well, in the context that's habeas corpus, don't you think it ought to be to avoid a miscarriage of justice?"
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2354.428,2356.881,"--No, I do... I would not agree with that standard, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2367.577,2384.328,"Well, except that's the standard that we've applied generally in habeas corpus successive petition cases, and this circumstance that we're faced with raises all of the intrusive concerns on... that we have with reference to the Federal system."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2384.328,2392.805,"I do not believe that this is similar to a successive petition case, and I believe that's the case for several reasons."
1997.97-215,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2402.148,2437.502,"But what happens here, the court of appeals waits until this Court has denied certiorari, until the State has mobilized all of its forces and its moral will to execute this penalty, the Governor has held lengthy and very careful clemency hearings, and then the court of appeals, based on the recitation that two of the judges didn't read their E mail, stops the process, and it seems to me that that quite squarely invokes the question of whether or not there's an abuse of discretion."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2437.502,2438.654,--Your Honor--
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2438.654,2445.749,And it seems to me that discretion can only be exercised if there was a... if necessary to avoid a manifest miscarriage of justice.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2445.749,2449.219,--There are a number of points that you raised in your question.
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2474.898,2478.391,"Yes, but it does compound the injury done to the State."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2478.391,2481.093,"It's a 53-day injury, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2482.733,2488.626,"Well, you measure the 53 days after the matter has been pending for 7 years, and this Court has acted."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2488.626,2497.251,"--But my point is, Your Honor, if they had withdrawn the mandate, let us say, before it was spread in the district court, then would we be here?"
1997.97-215,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2497.251,2498.793,Before it was what in the district court?
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2498.793,2501.735,"Before it was spread in the district court, Your Honor... would we be here?"
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2528.263,2534.885,"Yes, but it couldn't do that until it withdrew the mandate, and the mandate indicates sufficient finality for this Court to act."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2541.42,2552.417,"--Well, that is true, Your Honor, but that sort of... in my view that is circular in reasoning, because you... it's like saying that it's not final until it's final, or it's final because it's final."
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2558.143,2564.355,"Well, but even you agree, and I think you have to, that an abuse of discretion standard must be imposed."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2564.355,2564.995,--Yes.
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2564.995,2567.456,And you don't have to have an abuse of discretion before you have an en banc hearing.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2567.456,2568.848,"No, you do not."
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2571.54,2575.554,So the issuance of the mandate is a very highly significant fact in this case.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2575.554,2583.171,"--But, Your Honor, there are any number of cases in which mandates have been recalled after the certiorari has been denied and the mandate has issued."
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2583.171,2584.032,I don't know that there are any number.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2585.431,2595.168,"There... we cite the Sargent case, we cite the Alphin case, and there are others in our brief that we can refer to, so this is not a peculiar act either in this case or in this category of cases."
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2604.806,2605.467,I'm not questioning that.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2613.621,2615.15,"And my answer is no, it should not."
1997.97-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2615.15,2640.059,"In England there isn't any collateral review of criminal conviction, so that to say the abuse of discretion standard has applied in England, I don't think carries you over to this very particular situation where you're dealing with something where this Court has gradually circumscribed the free wheeling availability of the writ, and Congress has circumscribed it."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2640.059,2641.711,"No, Your Honor, I'm not suggesting that."
1997.97-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2673.981,2675.183,It certainly isn't this case.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2675.183,2687.588,"--Well, no, Your Honor, I think that the court was at pains to point out that first the act does not apply to this case because the petition was filed before the effective date of the act, so under this Court's decision in Lindh there is no application whatsoever."
1997.97-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2701.028,2708.324,But I think... isn't it just as likely Congress didn't remove it because they couldn't conceive of something like this happening?
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2708.324,2714.617,"No, Your Honor, I... in the first place, we would be speculating about congressional intent, but I think that the statute is carefully drafted."
1997.97-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2743.086,2759.406,I think that Congress perhaps contemplating this legislation could have canvassed courts of appeals habeas opinions and not found any example in those particular opinions where a... where the mandate had been withdrawn under circumstances like this.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2761.328,2769.073,"Well, and I think that is true, Your Honor, and the court of appeals in this case was very careful to note this is a once in a decade, or many decades case."
1997.97-215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2794.559,2797.323,"Well, there were... there is no right, though, to an en banc hearing."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2798.754,2799.964,"--I absolutely concede that, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2810.881,2835.638,"They were put in motion, but they didn't take effect, and in the meantime the habeas proceedings became final, and they are habeas proceedings, so we are confronted with what standard to apply, and there certainly are arguments to make it a fairly high standard for a reversal here, it seems to me, by the Ninth Circuit."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2835.638,2841.941,"--I don't think that there is a principle basis for distinguishing these cases from all other civil cases, Justice O'Connor."
1997.97-215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2843.133,2851.058,"Simply the fact that it's a habeas proceeding, where we have established some higher standards generally."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2851.058,2869.751,"--As Ms. Wilkens considered earlier in response to a question, the standard has always been the same, so what the State is asking this Court to do now is to be a back up legislature and to amend the AEDPA, as it were, to infer that Congress meant to take away authority from the courts of appeals that it does not explicitly do so."
1997.97-215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2895.317,2915.63,"Do you think this petitioner's motions, if they were governed here by AEDPA, and maybe they're not because of the effective date problem, but if they were, would his motions under 60(b) and so forth be in violation of AEDPA, and in effect be a second--"
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2915.63,2922.506,"That, of course, is a question that I need not decide, and I think it's not the question that's posed to this Court."
1997.97-215,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2922.506,2923.267,--That's true.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2923.267,2925.026,I would go so far as to say this.
1997.97-215,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2949.454,2951.104,Was that an en banc decision?
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,2951.104,2952.966,"--No, Your Honor, it was not."
1997.97-215,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2979.283,2983.344,What standard would you apply for abuse of discretion?
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,3088.736,3118.245,"Well, I think, Justice Breyer, that the courts of appeals have struggled with precisely that question over the course of many years, and as one reviews the cases that are set out in notes 17 and 19 of our brief you see that the courts have come up with certain phrases that they use to describe the process they go through... protecting the integrity of the court's processes, to... for good cause, to prevent injustice, et cetera, et cetera."
1997.97-215,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3197.32,3207.164,"Wouldn't you also look to the effect on the parties, or those generally who rely on the decision, even if the recall were a more prompt one?"
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,3207.164,3214.889,"I think that one might, Your Honor, but I don't think that it would be dispositive, certainly not in our case."
1997.97-215,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3214.889,3221.975,"As a guide, how about the old common law rule that during the term you could recall a mandate?"
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,3221.975,3247.64,"Yes, and that, of course, was set aside in 1948, as Your Honor knows, by statute, and the term limit no longer has anything to do with the ability of the courts of appeals to reach beyond or backward farther and, of course, this Court recognized in Hazel Atlas that even when the term limit was in place, in certain circumstances, fraud on the court or miscarriage of justice, the court was free to ignore the term limit."
1997.97-215,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3247.64,3248.561,"All right, now--"
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,3251.834,3258.029,"It could be certainly a rule of thumb or a guideline, Your Honor, yes."
1997.97-215,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3258.029,3272.288,"You said in response to my question that if we did look to the effect on others, even if a more prompt recall, your case would still turn out favorably to you, and maybe you're right."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,3292.82,3299.575,"Well, certainly it is something before the Court, so it may be something that the Court may wish to consider."
1997.97-215,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3307.91,3313.765,"Yes, but did... well, because time is short, there's one thing that I wish you would address."
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,3348.629,3362.648,"I don't think that one need necessarily view the facts in that fashion, Justice Souter, the reason being that it appears that there was a discussion between the time the mandate returned to the circuit and was sent to the district court and the time that it was spread."
1997.97-215,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3444.049,3452.525,It's hard to conceive that wanting to conceal its own ineptitude takes priority over allowing the State to execute its criminal law.
1997.97-215,1,25669,gregory_a_long,,3452.525,3456.429,"--I don't think that was the trade off, Your Honor."
1997.97-215,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3500.149,3501.491,"Thank you, Mr. Long."
