1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.665,"We'll hear arguments in Number 927, Williams against the State of Florida."
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,30.363,34.36,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may I please the Court."
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,108.289,115.255,"In the State of Florida, does the statute require the prosecution to furnish this to its witnesses?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,115.255,131.16,"Your Honor we have a procedural rule which is the same affect as a statute which when I offer to disclose all of my witnesses, the state is then required to disclose all of their witnesses."
1969.927,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,131.16,132.762,It's conditional?
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,132.762,135.339,It is conditionally Your Honor on that I have.
1969.927,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,135.339,137.53,On defense counsel has been making that offer?
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,137.53,138.779,Yes sir Your Honor.
1969.927,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,153.098,157.9,"That would be the chief prosecuting witness, if he were the victim of the offense presumably?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,157.9,160.471,Presumably yes sir.
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,160.471,165.82,But you proceed only by information and the Florida not by indictment at all?M
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,165.82,170.858,"Your Honor, the statutes in Florida provide for indictment on capital cases."
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,219.668,222.772,Are you talking about it now on the context to the --
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,222.772,224.174,Alibi.
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,224.174,239.718,"Well, I am speaking of the defendant himself when you say it's absolute and subject to no qualifications, do you mean that no one can make him take the stand under oath and testify or not under oath and testify?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,239.718,248.867,"I mean Mr. Chief Justice, the Fifth Amendment says this, the cases of this Court I think of which I've cited in my brief."
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,248.867,251.458,I was wondering what scope you were giving it.
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,251.458,261.654,Only the scope that this Court has given it Your Honor because the state has argued in its brief that the reason for the alibi rule is to combat perjury.
1969.927,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,397.359,430.183,"Well, isn't it rather incumbent upon you to show us why this is constitutionally invalid, here is a statute or rule of law that state of Florida would use it quite rightly if it does violate the Fifth Amendment to the constitution, even if we might think it does a good or wise rule if it violates the constitution that violates the constitution, but that as I understand your argument is what you told us so far now isn't it incumbent upon you to tell us why it violates the constitution?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,430.183,431.938,Yes your honor I'm going to discuss --
1969.927,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,431.938,437.615,"Not up to Florida to find cases, it's rather up to you to find the precedence."
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,437.615,450.892,"I agree, I believe I've cited them in my brief but I'm going to discuss now the interpretation of these words in the Fifth Amendment compelled to be a witness against yourself and let's see what these words mean."
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,550.285,563.677,"The communist case of course turned to a large extent on the fact that there was incriminatory aspect to the registration, did it not?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,563.677,564.373,Yes sir that's --
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,564.373,570.425,What you see is the incriminatory aspect of furnishing the names of witnesses?
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,570.425,576.27,"Your Honor, the Fifth Amendment doesn't say incriminatory Your Honor."
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,581.21,586.188,"Well, doesn't against himself imply the same thing that might could be?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,586.188,587.988,Your Honor this is position that the state takes.
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,596.076,600.07,"You're going to bring the witness and to help you, aren't you?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,600.07,615.702,You're going to bring this witness into trial to help you anyway and the mere acceleration of the disclosure of notifying the state attorney is to when this witness is going to come in can only exonerate you.
1969.927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,616.759,633.111,"Mr. Kanner, assume a case where the defendant never talks to anybody, police or anybody else and does not testify at the trial."
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,637.839,638.24,Your Honor --
1969.927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,638.24,642.389,He has never been a witness by this.
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,642.389,643.823,The state says this --
1969.927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,643.823,646.54,He has never been a witness earlier.
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,646.54,648.578,"The defendant is never going to witness, the state --"
1969.927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,648.578,652.395,"Well, that's the only one he can put the claim on it."
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,652.395,656.391,"Your Honor, the state says this in answer to your question Mr. Justice Marshall."
1969.927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,711.835,716.665,"Well, suppose he is there (Inaudible)"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,716.665,717.347,"Yes sir, Your Honor."
1969.927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,717.347,719.686,Once he is done in this case?
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,719.686,721.097,"No Your Honor, it was not done in this case."
1969.927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,721.097,725.484,"Well, how does the court (Inaudible)"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,725.484,727.642,We only suggest this is what the --
1969.927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,727.642,733.132,(Inaudible)
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,733.132,745.318,"No Your Honor, I'm suggesting Mr. Justice Marshall that in answer to your question, if the defendant would not testify, how the alibi notice rule would be a witness."
1969.927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,764.171,771.382,That assumes that a prosecutor will say it and that a judge will let him say it and that the state court rule have said it.
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,774.38,777.973,These assumptions made by the state in its brief Your Honor.
1969.927,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,777.973,779.955,"Well, which side do you argue?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,779.955,795.266,I'm arguing my side Your Honor that the only possible way that the witness rule can apply is if the defendant does not testify as in the context that I have suggested.
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,803.776,806.238,"Well, that doesn't bind us anyway."
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,806.238,829.398,"No Your Honor but I only suggest the -- regardless of whether their brief buying support, I only suggest that in the communist case and then Schmerber versus California, this Court held that witnesses mean anything communication and I feel that the alibi notice rule is a communication within the Fifth Amendment scope of a witness."
1969.927,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,829.398,848.394,"Well this is what is requires the defendant to do as I understand it specify number of days before on trial to ten days is to give the prosecution, a list of people who are going to testify on behalf of the defendant and his behalf and then his favor."
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,848.394,848.795,Our only alibi.
1969.927,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,848.795,852.665,In support of his alibi defense that's what I mean.
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,869.176,869.778,No --
1969.927,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,869.778,872.819,Or constitutional right not to be a witness against him?
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,872.855,876.892,Your Honor as I read the cases.
1969.927,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,887.054,895.441,"What's that, perhaps that's true and that is true in many jurisdictions but what does that have to do with the self incrimination clause of the the Fifth Amendment?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,895.441,900.572,As I read the cases that I've cited in my brief --
1969.927,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,900.572,902.245,Schmerber doesn't decide that?
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,902.245,902.544,No!
1969.927,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,909.061,911.372,I would suppose you would.
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,922.292,924.326,Those words may have been used Your Honor.
1969.927,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,924.326,925.712,"They were, aren't they?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,942.984,949.353,"Your Honor, I have possibly used the term testimonial and communicative synonymously."
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,949.353,960.87,"How does this disclosure become testimony in any term, how does it become giving evidence or becoming a witness?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,960.87,961.641,Your Honor it's --
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,961.641,965.109,That's what you left me in the dark on so far.
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,965.109,972.409,"Your Honor, the test as I read the cases Your Honors is not whether the disclosure is incriminating."
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,985.094,989.45,"Well, I did not include in my question any incriminatory aspect."
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1002.415,1003.43,Yes sir Your Honor.
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1003.43,1007.618,Now how does it trespass that?
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1007.618,1013.194,I feel that cases here bring the notice of alibi statute within the term witness.
1969.927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1108.244,1118.239,But I gather for example finger prints that are taken before trial are used by the prosecution against the defendant at trial.
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1128.374,1130.742,Not in the list Mr. Justice.
1969.927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1130.742,1131.668,Nor blood test?
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1131.668,1133.521,Not in the list Your Honor.
1969.927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1133.521,1148.626,"So you really have to hear to establish that in giving the notice on the name of the witness, this is testimonial in the sense that we do a distinction between testimonial and non-testimonial Schmerber and the other case?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1148.626,1149.959,Yes sir Mr. Justice.
1969.927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1149.959,1153.752,"But the whole thing comes down to, does it?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1153.752,1157.305,"Well, I believe that the state is conceded that it's testimonial."
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1192.537,1197.264,You don't have to put them on because you disclosed his name though.
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1197.264,1198.429,Your honor --
1969.927,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1198.429,1224.731,"Your position is not impaired except on this hypothesis that you went around with, that it might be used in argument by the prosecutor but if Justice Marshall said that case isn't here today, how are you injured in this sense by disclosing the name when you come to the decision of whether you are going to put on witnesses?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1224.731,1228.505,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe that the Fifth Amendment requires that I be injured."
1969.927,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1312.021,1320.644,Your argument goes so far as to say that it will be now criminal discovery of any kind against himself?
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1320.644,1323.497,Not quite Mr. Justice but almost.
1969.927,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1384.377,1389.656,"Well, it's not what you might allow, it's which in your opinion the Fifth Amendment allows?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1389.656,1404.98,"Yes sir Your Honor, I'm sorry."
1969.927,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1404.98,1411.426,"Suppose the defendant refused to give the name, what could he then --"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1411.426,1434.018,"Mr. Justice Black, the statute provides that the alibi witness cannot testify, the defendant himself in Florida can testify at all times as also provision in the rule that the judge if the circumstance is warranted can excuse the defendant from the provisions of the alibi notice."
1969.927,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1434.018,1440.884,You mean they would decline to the familiar relevant witness to testify in its favor?
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1440.884,1469.594,"Well, Your Honor we are getting into the Sixth Amendment right here which I noticed in my brief of Washington versus Texas and I'd like to only make this comment that I raised the point and I suggested in my brief Washington versus Texas which was a case which a defendant try to subpoena a co-defendant who was not on trial and the Texas procedure apparently was that the co-defendant could not testify."
1969.927,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1524.521,1526.375,Which is happened in this case?
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1526.375,1550.954,"No Your Honor because I complied -- I received the notice of alibi form, I move for a protected order on the Fifth Amendment on grounds and also the Florida declaration rights ground and the Fourteenth Amendment and my motion for protective order was denied which is how this case got here."
1969.927,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1550.954,1552.5,And then you went to trial?
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1552.5,1552.832,"Yes sir, Your Honor."
1969.927,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.832,1555.377,"And you're convicted, did you present your alibi witnesses?"
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1555.377,1556.308,"Yes sir, Your Honor."
1969.927,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1556.308,1564.9,And so how did hurt you even if it did violate the Fifth Amendment?
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1564.9,1570.04,"Your Honor, we get down here to the -- I see here that my time is about running out, I'm going to answer your question Mr. Justice."
1969.927,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1570.04,1571.035,"Oh you're done, sorry."
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1574.776,1577.45,"Yes sir, Your Honor and I want to take five to argue the jury point."
1969.927,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1577.45,1578.624,Go ahead.
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1578.624,1588.936,"Your Honors my initial reaction on the jury point was that Florida being Spanish domain, our six-man jury came from that."
1969.927,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.827,1656.305,"I wonder why that should be, why is it fundamental, you mean just because historically has always been 12."
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1656.305,1657.18,"Yes sir, Mr. Justice --"
1969.927,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1657.18,1659.107,We know why 12 is --
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1659.107,1663.179,I did in -- during this period of time while this case was pending.
1969.927,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1671.962,1675.421,What was the size the jury in the original hundreds when the jury system got started?
1969.927,0,39656,richard_kanner,,1675.421,1683.126,"Your Honors as I read it, the jury was always 12 or more and that the reason, the 12 came out --"
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,1772.068,1773.668,May it please the Court.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1862.669,1865.444,Why does the state need that?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,1865.444,1874.322,"Your Honor, I think it's necessary during a time when we are trying to modernize criminal law in its search for truth."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1874.766,1875.814,Search the truth?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,1875.814,1876.102,Yes sir.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1876.102,1879.012,Or who's going to be a witness for the alibi?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,1879.012,1887.777,"Yes sir, I think it is because if Mr. Justice Black, I think it helps to avoid the popping up of phony alibis."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1887.777,1889.072,How would it?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,1889.072,1890.013,How would it?
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1890.013,1890.274,Yes.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,1890.274,1910.727,"Because if the state has an opportunity or the state knows of the witnesses that the defendant intends to use as an alibi and the alibi statute probably states that if alibi, the defendant was not at a particular place at a particular time, therefore he could not have permitted the crime."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1916.902,1926.965,I presume it wouldn't be looking forward to Mr. 3200 to investigating the witness and the people around it.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,1926.965,1936.606,"I think that you are correct sir, I think that the state is looking to find out the truth of the matter whether or not a person did commit a crime."
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1936.606,1941.09,Do you think the state has the right to talk to those witnesses?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,1941.09,1943.812,Your Honor I think the state does have the right to talk to those witnesses.
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1943.812,1945.892,But you think it's unethical?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,1945.892,1947.041,"No sir, I do not."
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1947.041,1951.601,For a lawyer to talk to the witness on the other side?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,1951.601,1954.45,I don't think it's unethical Mr. Justice Marshall.
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1966.091,1980.845,"Well, why would you say that a rule of the Florida that a defendant must 15 days before trial divulge the name and address of every witness he intends to use?"
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,1980.845,1982.394,Your Honor this is not the rule.
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1982.394,1991.254,"I agree but would that rule be alright when you get more truth, is that right?"
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,1991.254,1992.95,You may get more truth Your Honor.
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1992.95,1994.803,But you wouldn't call us --
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,1994.803,1997.327,I will not advocate that rule to the Court today.
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1997.327,2000.909,"But you don't think it will stand up either, do you?"
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2000.909,2001.859,I am not sure.
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.859,2003.946,You prefer to stick with the Alabama.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2003.946,2007.126,Yes sir.
1969.927,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2007.126,2027.649,"I suppose your position would be then that the Florida constitutionally could have a statute which simply says that the accused shall ten days before the trial provide the prosecutor with the names and addresses of all the witnesses he expects to call in his defense, would you?"
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2027.649,2031.244,"You Honor, I don't want to go that far over on the --"
1969.927,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2031.244,2034.908,"Why not, what's your theory that why can't you do it here?"
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2034.908,2041.864,I think we can do it here because we -- it's an attempt to modernize and it's reciprocal kind of discovery.
1969.927,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2048.077,2051.726,Then your answer is that constitutionally the state could go that far?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2051.726,2059.466,Yes sir but it just -- this does not abridge his right as he maintains under the Fifth Amendment to remain silent.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2064.509,2068.541,To remain silent about what?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2068.541,2071.911,He is not required in anyway to say anything that will incriminate himself.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2071.911,2073.163,About what?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2073.163,2074.609,About the crime or the offense.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2074.609,2076.402,About the trial.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2076.402,2078.042,About the trial.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2078.042,2080.467,They are the witnesses.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2080.467,2093.246,"Well, I don't think that talking about the witnesses Your Honor has anything to do with incriminating him or it's not testimonial to the extent that the Fifth Amendment would cover that situation."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2100.692,2104.089,But they wouldn't give them the right to remain silent.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2104.089,2105.211,He has that right.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2105.211,2115.584,"The state -- no he could remain silent as the state can go and say, now what witnesses you're going to bring in here to prove you are not guilty and they could force him to do it."
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2118.678,2122.256,Your Honor he has the right to remain silent as I understand.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2124.498,2125.303,About what?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2125.303,2130.921,He has the unfettered right to remain silent about incrimination and what he gives to the state in terms of witnesses does not incriminate him.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2139.628,2142.899,That weakens his hands of course.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2142.899,2144.981,Your Honor it does not weaken his hands.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2144.981,2152.331,"I would take, I take as a very valuable thing for a prosecutor to have in advance and they have been the alibi witness."
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2152.331,2161.246,"Your Honor, I think it is very valuable. Additionally, I think it's very valuable to a defendant to have the names of the witnesses that the state will use to rebut this testimony."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2161.246,2164.452,They may be allowed but the constitution requires that's help it.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2164.452,2165.082,Sir?
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2165.082,2170.587,I think maybe there are a lot of state law of our constitutions that do requires that the state give the names.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2170.587,2170.888,Yes sir.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2170.888,2171.019,In the Senate.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2171.019,2173.215,State of Florida does too.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2173.86,2187.805,But I presume that nothing in the constitutions says that state shall not be compelled to give any testimony on either side in advance.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2187.805,2208.316,I don't remember anything in the constitution saying that I -- as we discussed this I am reminded of Schneider versus Massachusetts where a former member this court Mr. Justice Cardoza said that while due process is due to the accuser it is also due to the accused and that's precisely what we are talking about.
1969.927,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2213.265,2224.244,"Mr. McCrary, Mr. Kanner suggested that you concede on that -- this information though this and remain the witnesses it's testimonial."
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2224.244,2230.075,"No sir, the state of Florida does not concede that it's testimonial."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2271.382,2278.856,Why don't you put him on the stand when you require that he give the names of the witnesses he intends to use?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2278.856,2287.073,"Your Honor, this would be a clear violation of all of the cases that this Court have decided, if we forced a man to testify and we are not suggesting that."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2287.073,2288.854,Won't this force him to testify?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2288.854,2290.207,No sir it does not.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2290.207,2301.779,That he is maybe not something relevant to the actual commission of the crime and certainly does make him testify and give the names of the witnesses he intends to use.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2301.779,2303.872,Your Honor I respectfully --
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2303.872,2309.344,"I'm not saying it is good or bad, I'm just saying it does make him do that."
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2309.344,2314.785,"Your Honor I respectfully disagree with the Court, Mr. Justice Black with you on that position."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2320.901,2322.462,What does it require him to do?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2322.462,2325.923,It simply requires him to disclose the names of the witnesses.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2325.923,2327.608,That he intends to use?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2327.608,2329.291,For alibi alone.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2329.395,2335.779,"Yes but suppose you said everything, why wouldn't he think good about alibi, why couldn't he do it about everything?"
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2335.779,2346.184,Then I suppose they could do it about everything and I don't think I'm in a position to discuss the constitutionality of that principle on this occasion.
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2346.184,2364.082,"But the real problem I have with the graph is that do you agree that in that stage, Florida has no right to ask him and require him to answer anything other than his alibi witnesses."
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2364.082,2365.706,I would agree.
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2365.706,2366.824,Why the alibi would?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2366.824,2371.023,Under this rule Your Honor.
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2371.023,2375.574,"I thought under all the decisions of this court, he doesn't have to tell you anything?"
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2375.574,2379.566,He does not have to give any information that would incriminate him and this --
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2379.566,2385.092,He doesn't have to tell you anything either he not to give you his name.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2385.092,2385.698,I would agree Your Honor.
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2385.698,2387.882,He can stand absolutely silent.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2387.882,2389.367,He can stand mute.
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2389.367,2393.663,But on this one question he can't stand silent.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2393.663,2398.399,"Your Honor, the rule -- if the rule does provide that he can stand silent."
1969.927,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2398.399,2401.257,But he can't use an alibi?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2401.257,2404.009,No the rule does not go that for us Mr. Kanner said.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2416.809,2428.056,I guess there's another provision in the constitution says that the man shall be entitled to summon witnesses with no things that are relevant to testify on his behalf.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2428.056,2454.322,"Mr. Justice Black, I would quite agree, I think that the same Court that decided this case, the Third District Court of Appeal is mindful of this and we cited it at page 14 in our brief, (Inaudible) versus State of Florida and Wilson versus the State of Florida where the defendant did not comply with the notice of alibi rule and the Court still let those witnesses testify so that the rule is not an un-reasonable rule where we say --"
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2454.322,2458.224,Well I know the next judge wouldn't do differently and make him.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2458.224,2465.536,"Your Honor, I have to assume from my position that judges are fair and that they are knowledgeable and reasonable that they will apply --"
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2465.536,2472.09,But then you'll be saying then that a fair thing a judge would do would be not to the enforce the rule.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2472.09,2472.348,Oh!
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2491.902,2494.143,Why they do that?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2494.143,2498.89,He thought that it was the proper thing to do.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2498.89,2501.085,That was violation of the rule.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2501.085,2508.775,"No sir it's not a violation of the rule Your Honor because the rule provides that the judge may exclude the testimony, it does not say he cannot."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2508.775,2510.6,He has the right to do it if we wants to.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2510.6,2511.936,Yes sir.
1969.927,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2511.936,2529.871,Your friend seems to have conceded if I heard him correctly that it does not violate the constitution to require the defendant to give advance notice of the claim of insanity by way of defense.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2548.936,2552.005,Your Honor I think that the -- they are both the same.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2566.644,2582.929,Or that law should be provide that he's compelled to give the state the names of all witnesses that he claims witness to the crime.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2582.929,2594.284,"Well, once again Mr. Justice Black I think this Court has decided that the defendant can remain absolutely mute and say nothing."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2594.284,2598.794,"But he can remain absolutely mute, he has to give the name of the witnesses he's going to use."
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2598.794,2604.372,"Yes sir, he could remain mute under the situation and we've had cases where it's been done."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2607.67,2612.275,The state court might tell him that he can't afford to put on these witnesses.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2612.275,2617.486,"Mr. Justice Black, -- once again I'm not in the position to say what those gentlemen would do."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2618.714,2618.999,"But they could, can they?"
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2618.999,2620.736,I can only go based on the decision --
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2620.736,2623.139,"They can under the rule, can't they?"
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2623.139,2629.661,"Mr. Justice Black, I assume that they could but I can only go by at this point of what they have done and I have to watch."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2629.661,2632.036,You mean they've always violated the rule?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2632.036,2633.495,"No sir, I'm not saying that."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2661.028,2667.965,You mean that we'd have to assume that they'll always -- he then have to give the name?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2667.965,2671.903,Your Honor I think that I have to assume at this point.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2671.903,2677.144,That they'll always never enforce it?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2677.144,2681.639,I can't go that far and I think that simply back myself in the corner and never get out.
1969.927,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2681.639,2689.77,"I should think in your argument that you would almost have to assume that if the names weren't, given the defendant couldn't use those witnesses on his behalf."
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2695.849,2695.972,Yes sir.
1969.927,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2695.972,2698.884,That might give us another case some other day.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2698.884,2699.323,Sir?
1969.927,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2699.323,2702.203,That might give us another case on a different point some other day.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2702.203,2711.499,"I did -- it very well may Your Honor but at this point I don't think that this is the question before this Court, I don't not understand it as being the question before this court."
1969.927,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2711.499,2715.298,Here the names were given and the witnesses were used.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2715.298,2715.698,Were used.
1969.927,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2715.698,2716.528,Isn't that correct?
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2716.528,2731.944,"Yes sir and if we talk about the trial strategy, there was nothing that prohibited the defendant from testifying in his own behalf if he wanted to at any time during the trial."
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2771.143,2777.211,"Well, that's quite a different argument the one you've been making up today, isn't it?"
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2777.211,2780.997,"No, I don't think it's a different argument but Mr. Justice Black I think that I --"
1969.927,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2780.997,2789.592,"It means to me to be entirely different say well even if that is rule, it wasn't broken and certainly he couldn't have been harmed by it."
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2789.592,2794.755,Your Honor what has happened here is that defendant did comply with the rule.
1969.927,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2796.58,2800.968,Maybe it's not an issue in this case at all.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2800.968,2802.611,May not be.
1969.927,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2813.902,2817.1,Maybe he did it because he thought he'd have to under the rule.
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2817.1,2826.026,Your Honor I can't -- Mr. Justice Black I certainly cannot stand here and say that I can make up counsel's mind.
1969.927,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2826.026,2834.231,"You only have about three minutes left and we haven't got to the six-man jury question, so after lunch we'll hope you will address yourself to that."
1969.927,1,32131,jesse_j_mccrary,,2834.231,2839.868,Yes sir.
