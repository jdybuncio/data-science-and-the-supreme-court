1986.85-1517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We will hear arguments next in No. 85-1517, Colorado against Spring."
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,53.718,56.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1517,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,215.138,216.571,I wonder about that last statement.
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,216.571,217.24,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1986.85-1517,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,217.24,220.109,Nothing in the record to show that he's less than average intelligence?
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,220.109,221.159,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1517,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,221.159,229.548,"Well... what was it he said, I shot some guy once?"
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,230.315,231.031,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1517,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,231.031,236.468,That's a pretty brilliant statement.
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,236.468,242.188,"The fact... the other factors would also show there was no long, intensive interrogation in this case."
1986.85-1517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,429.779,431.346,With what kind of waiver?
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,431.346,432.496,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1986.85-1517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.496,435.281,"They confused it with some kind of a waiver, you said."
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,437.282,440.317,"It's a wise waiver, Your Honor."
1986.85-1517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,543.385,545.337,"We'll resume there at 1:00 o'clock, Ms. Phelan."
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,545.337,563.132,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1517,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,563.132,573.971,"We'll resume argument where we left off, Ms. Phelan."
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,573.971,576.173,"May I proceed, Your Honor?"
1986.85-1517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,614.231,623.004,"Ms. Phelan, may I ask you, if the respondent had told police that he was willing to talk to them about the firearms offense--"
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,623.004,623.621,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,623.621,624.523,--but nothing more--
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,624.523,626.589,Yes.
1986.85-1517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,626.589,631.427,"--could the officers have then asked him about an unrelated offense, do you suppose?"
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,631.427,635.795,"No, Your Honor, I think that that would be a partial waiver."
1986.85-1517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,635.795,644.667,"Do we have any concern that that was implicitly what the defendant did here, or at least his understanding?"
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,644.667,646.952,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,646.952,662.379,"And what if the trial court were to find, or to think, that implicitly the defendant understood and intended to waive his rights only as far as the firearms was concerned?"
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,662.379,669.052,"Then I'm sure the trial court would find only a partial waiver, and suppress any statements concerning anything else."
1986.85-1517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,669.052,682.025,"And do you think that the mere fact that all he is told about and all that, as far as the circumstances indicate, he would think about was the firearms--"
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,682.025,682.559,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1517,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,682.559,685.311,"--offense, would not raise that kind of a question?"
1986.85-1517,0,36484,maureen_phelan,,685.311,686.294,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1517,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1320.096,1323.465,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1517,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1551.725,1555.16,Why wouldn't it affect the consequence of abandoning his rights?
1986.85-1517,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1565.516,1568.051,"In a sense, it refers to the consequences."
1986.85-1517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1621.935,1640.247,"Well, Mr. Robbins, does that mean that for example if the police officers falsely told him they had a lot of evidence that implicated him, and it was just totally contrived, that wouldn't affect his understanding of his Constitutional rights, but that would not be the kind of deception that would be implicated by Miranda?"
1986.85-1517,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1640.247,1641.349,It would not.
1986.85-1517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1641.349,1644.484,And you think that would therefore be completely permissible?
1986.85-1517,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1644.484,1646.667,"That may be a different question, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-1517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1647.267,1651.571,"It seems to me it's this question, because it's outside the Constitutional right waiver category."
1986.85-1517,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1651.571,1663.695,"--Well, there are limits, mandated by the due process clause, that may arguably be implicated by police conduct."
1986.85-1517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.051,1674.003,"But my example wouldn't fit the trickery, so forth, language in Miranda."
1986.85-1517,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1674.353,1675.103,I'm sorry?
1986.85-1517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1675.103,1680.673,"--The example I put would not fit the trickery language in Miranda; rather, it might be a due process violation--"
1986.85-1517,1,35022,lawrence_s_robbins,,1680.673,1681.94,It might in a proper case.
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,1806.321,1815.677,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1517,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2121.008,2130.764,"What do you think, though, the Miranda Court intended when it talked about knowing the consequences, Mr. Benezra?"
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2143.691,2152.612,"--This Court, in Miranda, indicated that the consequence of waiving the rights was that the statement would be used against you."
1986.85-1517,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2169.306,2173.526,"Well, surely, he's supposed to know that he can remain silent."
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2173.526,2174.31,That's correct.
1986.85-1517,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.31,2175.895,And that he can have an attorney.
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2175.895,2176.928,That's correct.
1986.85-1517,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.928,2184.168,"And isn't... isn't, as far as waiver is concerned, isn't there a new waiver everytime a question is asked and he answers it?"
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2189.785,2191.421,That's correct.
1986.85-1517,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2191.421,2202.629,And if it's perfectly... suppose that all the questions that were asked here were very relevant to the firearms charge; just suppose that.
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2233.564,2236.433,"It also went to... also went to the murder, is that the question?"
1986.85-1517,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.433,2243.539,"Also went to the murder, but he never suspected that he was suspected of the murder."
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2243.539,2246.158,I don't think that would be a problem in Colorado.
1986.85-1517,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2246.158,2246.558,Yes.
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2269.238,2272.023,That may very well be a valid waiver under the rule in Colorado.
1986.85-1517,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.023,2276.443,"Well, why is that different from this?"
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2297.257,2300.293,On this particular... on this particular day?
1986.85-1517,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2300.293,2302.911,"Yes, I thought that he--"
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2302.911,2304.678,I don't believe the record indicates that.
1986.85-1517,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2304.678,2306.594,"--Not that day, but on another day?"
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2306.594,2308.38,"Yes, on another day."
1986.85-1517,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2308.38,2309.163,"Well, he knew he could--"
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2315.45,2316.902,That's correct.
1986.85-1517,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2335.863,2339.998,"Well, does it make any difference whether it's a subtle shift or a dramatic shift?"
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2359.145,2364.899,--I think that would present a very different case.
1986.85-1517,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2409.077,2411.613,"Mr. Benezra, I'm not quite clear on what the argument here is."
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2434.46,2448.037,I think it is that the scope of his waiver did not extend to these questions; that he... there was no evidence that he waived his rights with regard to the homicide.
1986.85-1517,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2495.266,2495.916,xxx scope.
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2500.587,2506.206,"--Yes, it goes to the scope of the waiver."
1986.85-1517,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.208,2513.895,"I know, but may I just ask you, you've accepted Justice Scalia's suggestion that they just decided on the scope of the waiver."
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2532.289,2541.712,"--The court, in its opinion, indicated that he had not made a knowing and intelligent and voluntary waiver with regard to the homicide."
1986.85-1517,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2541.712,2542.414,"Oh, I see."
1986.85-1517,2,41000,seth_jeremy_benezra,,2546.449,2560.059,"The Colorado Supreme Court's decision is also supported by this Court's decision in Fare v. Michael C. In Fare, this Court, in upholding the validity of the respondent's Miranda waiver, noted that the respondent was aware that he was to be questioned about a murder."
1986.85-1517,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2703.568,2704.835,"Thank you, Mr. Benezra."
