1963.406,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,483.551,488.071,And he just isn't filling orders of the people he bought the sugar from.

1963.406,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2807.193,2819.301,Are you suggesting that if he hadn't been in the -- engaged in the livestock business at all that he would be in trouble here for transporting property for-hire?
1963.406,1,16508,amos_m_mathews,,2819.301,2824.684,"Well, if he hadn't been engaged in the livestock business at all, he wouldn't be hauling sugar back because --"
1963.406,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.684,2835.617,"Oh, I'm not sure of that, he might be -- he might be hauling -- you're just saying that what -- what was -- what he was really doing was hauling for-hire for his customers."
1963.406,1,16508,amos_m_mathews,,2835.617,2835.794,That's right.
1963.406,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.794,2839.034,But that's -- that doesn't depended at all on putting in the livestock business.

1963.406,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2839.573,2840.91,Where you put it?

1963.406,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2847.082,2849.167,Why do you have to if that's correct?
1963.406,1,16508,amos_m_mathews,,2854.849,2855.545,No.
1963.406,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2855.545,2857.807,-- he's really a carrying goods for-hire.

1963.406,1,16508,amos_m_mathews,,2860.719,2866.409,"Well, the -- the Interstate Commerce Commission found -- the phrasing was this."""
1963.406,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2918.779,2941.862,"But was it aimed at -- before his primary -- his bona fide, what you call entrepreneur engaged in a small business, discovering that he can buy and sell sugar for profits and that he can make more profit if he carries it for himself, bona fide, no shams, would you say he's forbidden by law to do it, by 208 (c)?"
1963.406,1,16508,amos_m_mathews,,2941.862,2945.287,He is forbidden by law to do it in the way it is done here.
1963.406,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2946.686,2948.745,"Well, is it because it's a sham?"

1963.406,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3205.996,3210.249,"But the man I'm talking about wasn't engaged in transportation, he was a merchant."

1963.406,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3223.834,3232.605,"Why didn't the language be cleared, did your Association have this -- get -- urged this to be passed for that purpose."
1963.406,1,16508,amos_m_mathews,,3232.605,3237.655,The Transportation Association of America whom I do not represent urged that it'd be enacted for this purpose.
1963.406,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3237.655,3242.06,"And that's -- well, why didn't they put a language that had fit it better, so we wouldn't be troubled with it."
1963.406,1,16508,amos_m_mathews,,3242.06,3242.634,Well --
1963.406,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3242.634,3244.121,I don't understand that.
1963.406,1,16508,amos_m_mathews,,3244.121,3263.253,"Well, if you -- if you read it -- if you read the -- the -- they're the language that's in parenthesis, no person shall engage in transportation in a -- in a business other than transportation -- in -- the -- the business to be exempt, must be a business other than transportation."
1963.406,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3263.253,3269.757,"Well, may I ask Mr. Mathews, is it as simple as this, speaking only of the 1958 Amendment."
1963.406,1,16508,amos_m_mathews,,3283.046,3284.143,That is correct.
1963.406,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3284.143,3297.948,"The second requirement is that he can't hold on anything for a business purpose for any business purpose unless that business purpose is in furtherance of a primary business enterprise in which he's engaged, is that it?"
1963.406,1,16508,amos_m_mathews,,3297.948,3298.221,Other than that --
1963.406,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3298.221,3302.305,That doesn't make him a -- that doesn't put him in the transportation business.
1963.406,1,16508,amos_m_mathews,,3316.105,3317.786,Other than transportation.
1963.406,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3317.786,3321.251,"Well, other than trans -- that doesn't put him in the transportation business."
1963.406,1,16508,amos_m_mathews,,3324.265,3330.657,He is when he -- he is when he takes a truck under the 1958 Amendment.
1963.406,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3337.201,3339.957,"Well, is it intended to make it illegal?"
1963.406,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3362.001,3363.921,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1963.406,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3363.921,3368.499,"Well if that -- if that's right, then it undoubtedly, you're -- you're correct."
1963.406,1,16508,amos_m_mathews,,3371.576,3371.83,Well --
1963.406,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3371.83,3372.499,-- to say that.
1963.406,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3372.499,3374.291,The jury here does not --
1963.406,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3374.291,3382.86,"The Interstate Commerce Act is phrased in general language, and that it has been left to the Commission to deal case by case with situations --"
1963.406,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3382.86,3386.471,But it doesn't -- in some language they had authorized him to do something in a case.
1963.406,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3386.471,3388.775,"Well, we have set this out more fully."
1963.406,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3418.073,3419.497,Mr. Wolff.
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3419.497,3423.804,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.406,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3670.809,3674.036,"Well, what -- what is sugar used for in the feed line?"
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3674.036,3674.752,It is not.
1963.406,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3684.312,3689.025,"Well, I know but the other items didn't have to be involved in this case."
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3689.025,3690.222,"No sir, however, the --"
1963.406,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3690.222,3691.474,But sugar was.
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3694.567,3694.935,"Yes, sir."
1963.406,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3694.935,3698.994,You sold it -- you sold it to dealers of sugar.
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3698.994,3699.58,That is correct.
1963.406,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3721.051,3734.833,"Yes, but the question was what if sugar was connected with either one of your other primary businesses and they wouldn't make any difference whether it was livestock business or the feed business, sugar wasn't related to either one of them, they have still made their point."
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3734.833,3750.542,"Well, to -- proceeding along that line, actually, insofar as many other products are concerned for example salt, there is no evidence in the record that salt a -- that particular salt involved had anything to do with feed."
1963.406,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3759.229,3767.029,"What you're saying is that (voice overlap) feed business of the live -- livestock business, that you're in a general mercantile business and that is your primary business."
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3767.029,3767.699,"Yes, sir."
1963.406,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3767.699,3774.082,And that that happens to include among other things that sugar and salt as well as grain and so forth.
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3774.082,3774.351,"Yes, sir."
1963.406,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3774.351,3775.107,That's what you're saying.
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3775.107,3793.684,"And further that the -- for example salt which is not in the record shown to -- to be the particular type of salt that's used in feed, the -- they purchased prior to pur -- purchasing sugar and at the time of the hearing in -- in the record, the salt in the same manner as a purchased sugar without any question."
1963.406,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3793.684,3810.163,"Well then you would say that within this 1958 Amendment, you don't have any primary business, you'd have only a single primary business enterprise namely a general mer -- mercantile business enterprise and if this hauling of sugar was incident to that single primary business of general mercantile, (Inaudible)?"
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3810.163,3811.099,"Yes, sir."
1963.406,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3811.099,3818.041,"Well, the trouble with that is that you have to -- the -- the Commission found against you as a matter of fact."
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3820.64,3831.504,"Yes, sir and -- but however, we believe that the evidence in the case that eventually no substantial evidence upon which to base the findings that the Commission made concerning the fact that we are not private carriers."
1963.406,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3831.504,3833.938,"And that's -- the three-judge court held, wasn't it?"
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3833.938,3835.311,"The -- yes, sir."
1963.406,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3835.311,3863.982,"Suppose -- suppose they had shown -- you had to agree with its own that your claiming to be in the mercantile business as a local -- local (Inaudible) but in reality, a sham and you're utilizing -- practically as running a transportation business and making your profit by altogether out of the fact that you do it in such a way that they pay you what your transportations were."
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3867.153,3870.146,I believe that is the entire point of the whole case.
1963.406,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3876.251,3882.673,"You agree that if it is a sham -- if it's a sham, if they found it and found on certain facts, then you would be covered."
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3882.673,3893.659,"Yes, sir and I believe that is what the -- the congressional amendment meant and in -- at a later point, I'll discuss some of the congressional hearings that were attached to the Interstate Commerce Commission's report concerning the intention of the Act."
1963.406,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3893.659,3905.437,Your argument is that they did intend to put a man out of business because he -- he was buying and selling different things simply because he transported them himself.
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3905.437,3932.324,"No, sir but that -- it's necessary to show that there are some sort of prearranged plans, some sort of sham, prearranged plans to -- between the -- the transporter and the ultimate purchaser, so to enable that purchaser to receive transportation at a reduced cost, and that is the exact language that the committee -- the congressional committee has used when the -- they were discussing the passage in the amendment of -- of the Acts pertaining to Section 203 (c)."
1963.406,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3932.324,3942.75,You deny that the act of your -- guilt in violation of this depends on how much you bought and sold of one product and how much you bought and sold of another.
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3946.181,3958.661,"Yes, sir and we also believe that the evidence shows that we do a considerable sugar business in comparison with other businesses, is not a large concern but the -- if sugar operations are on a parity with their other operations."
1963.406,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3958.661,3962.506,These -- do these figures show that you got a -- made it private on this?
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3962.506,3963.445,"Yes, sir."
1963.406,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3964.351,3976.984,Was there any efforts in the -- was there any effort to show that the profit you made was amounted in -- in the long run or any other time to the equivalent only of the -- what it cost to transport it.
1963.406,2,46589,walter_c_wolff_jr,,3976.984,4000.089,"We showed that what the going market profit was in San Antonio at the time of the hearing for a sugar merchant which was 25 to 35 cents per 100 pounds and according to the Exhibit which is the Interstate Commerce Commission's own selection of what they consider representative sales, it shows that we made about 35.7400 cents per 100 pounds for those particular sale."
