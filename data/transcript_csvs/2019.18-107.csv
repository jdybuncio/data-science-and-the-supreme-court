2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.88,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-107, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes versus the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Mr. Cole."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,10.88,58.84,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Aimee Stephens is a transgender woman. She was a valued employee of Harris Funeral Homes for six years, until she told her boss that she was going to live and identify as a woman. When Harris Homes responded by firing her, it discriminated against her because of her sex for three reasons: First, in firing her for failing to conform to its owner's explicitly stated stereotypes about how men and women should behave, it discriminated against her in the same way that Price Waterhouse discriminated against Ann Hopkins for failing to walk and talk more femininely."
2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,141.04,147.76,"I understand -- I understand that as the argument, and I -- I believe it's the same as in -- in the prior case."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,174.72,174.96,Yeah.
2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,174.96,185.64,"-- status as it were, maybe that's hiring and firing on the basis -- treating it as just on the basis of sex, but when you get to specific policies, does that hold true?"
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,185.64,192.16,"So, first of all, Your Honor, how one -- how you answer this case will not resolve how you answer that case."
2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,214.24,230.36,"I think you're -- I think you're missing my -- my point, maybe because it wasn't carefully expressed, but it's -- it's can the claim be -- I mean, I understand when you say you're dealing with transgender status and you can't discriminate on that basis with -- on the basis of status."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,244.12,244.56,So --
2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,244.56,261.92,"So if the objection of the transgender individual is that I want to use a bathroom consistent with my gender identity, rather than biological sex, do you analyze it as -- the affecting based on the transgender status or do you analyze it on the basis of biological sex?"
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,261.92,288.56,"So the -- the -- I -- I think our argument rests on biological sex or what we think is more accurately referred to as sex assigned at birth. But here's -- here's the thing: If there is a -- this -- this case asks whether when someone fires someone because they're transgender or because they fail to conform to sex-based stereotypes, is that because of sex? That's what this case asks. Obviously, a sex-specific restroom policy is because of sex."
2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,292.84,294.72,Just if I could interrupt so I can follow.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,294.72,294.92,Yeah.
2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,294.92,297.12,It's because of sex.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,297.12,297.6,Because of biological --
2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,297.6,302.24,"And so -- but if you analyze it because of sex, then I think, as has been pointed out --"
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,302.24,302.36,Yeah.
2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,302.36,325.36,"-- there's no disadvantage, whether you're a man or a woman. But if you analyzed it on the basis of transgender status, there is, because you want to use the women's restroom and be biologically male. So when it's analyzed on the basis of sex, there's no problem, but when it's analyzed on the basis of transgender status, it presents a whole different case."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,325.36,326.64,"So I don't think so, Your Honor."
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,361.6,362.16,Now --
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,362.16,362.76,And in most instances --
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,362.76,365.84,And that -- that's the question I posed to Ms. Karlan earlier.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,365.84,366.64,Right.
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,366.64,393.64,"And we went around the tree a bit, but ultimately came to, I believe, a submission that a reasonable person in the transgender Plaintiff's position would be harmed if he or she were fired for failing to follow the -- the bathroom rules or some sort of dress code that's not otherwise objectionable, along the lines of --"
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,393.64,394.28,Yeah.
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,394.28,401.48,"-- that were present in the facts of this case, where men and women had rather traditional options available to them."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,403.16,405.08,That is -- that is my answer.
2019.18-107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,445.52,446.64,Mr. Cole --
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,446.64,449.56,-- based on biological sex as Justice -- as Chief Justice Roberts said.
2019.18-107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,449.56,470.08,"Mr. Cole, let's not avoid the difficult issue, okay? You have a transgender person who rightly is identifying as a woman and wants to use the women's bedroom, rightly, wrongly, not a moral choice, but this is what they identify with."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,474.28,474.64,Yeah.
2019.18-107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,474.64,477.48,-- and -- and they want to use the women's bathroom.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,499.8,500.72,That --
2019.18-107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,500.72,511.28,And what in the law will guide judges in balancing those things? That's really what I think the question is about.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,511.28,515.0,"Well, that is -- that is -- that is a question, Justice Sotomayor."
2019.18-107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,517.16,519.0,"Mr. Cole, that's -- yes --"
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,519.0,519.64,And -- and --
2019.18-107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,519.64,527.08,"-- because the -- once we decide the case in your favor, then that question is inevitable."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,527.08,528.6,"No, I think even if --"
2019.18-107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,528.6,528.96,And it may not be--
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,528.96,530.0,-- you decide the case against us --
2019.18-107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,530.0,557.36,"It may not be in -- if there's single-sex bathrooms, there might be one answer, meaning what harm would the other women -- reasonable woman feel if a man is using a single-sex bathroom, might be another if it is two locker rooms, men and women, girls and boys and who walks in is something you can't control. That's what the question is saying."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,557.36,561.44,"But, Justice Sotomayor, the reason deciding this case will not decide that case is because --"
2019.18-107,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,561.44,562.68,It won't decide that case.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,562.68,579.0,"It won't decide -- but even if you rule against us, that case can arise, because it is a sex-specific rule, and anyone who is affected by a sex-specific rule can argue that it discriminates against them because a reasonable person in their shoes would experience a significant harm."
2019.18-107,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,579.0,590.32,"Well, I understood you -- I understood you to say -- maybe I didn't understand you correctly -- that if your client had been fired for using the woman's bathroom, that would be a violation of Title VII."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,590.32,622.52,"So I -- what I said was, yes, that -- that -- in our view, were we litigating that case here, which we aren't, they admitted that the -- the restroom was a -- was a hypothetical issue and not a -- a reason why she was fired, but were we litigating that case, I think the question would be not whether the -- the policy was because of sex, which is the question here, because obviously the restroom is because of sex. The question would be, does imposing that restroom policy, which is obviously because of sex, impose a discriminatory injury on an individual."
2019.18-107,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,622.52,622.96,And --
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,622.96,626.96,"And if you require me to go to the women's restroom, that's a serious --"
2019.18-107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,626.96,627.2,So what you're --
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,627.2,627.44,-- issue.
2019.18-107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,627.44,631.44,"-- saying is, we're stuck with that question regardless of how we decide this case."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,631.44,632.92,Whether you rule for or against us.
2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,633.2,651.72,"Well, but the difference is that part of the argument, at least, is that the term ""sex"" includes sexual orientation. And -- and if that is the case, if we analyze the bathroom case purely on the basis of biological sex, maybe you have one answer."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,692.64,705.68,"I -- Your Honor, for this -- for purposes of this case, all we are arguing is that Title -- Title VII's reference to sex at least includes what you're calling biological sex, what we call sex assigned --"
2019.18-107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,705.68,706.0,Mr. Cole --
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,706.0,706.12,-- at birth --
2019.18-107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,706.12,707.2,You can go further than that.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,709.2,709.88,"Yes, exactly."
2019.18-107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,709.88,712.0,-- is biological sex as well.
2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,725.88,728.4,"Then it's -- then it's an easy case, right?"
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,728.4,728.8,Yes.
2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,728.8,741.0,"Because if it's just biological sex, there's no problem because there is no disadvantage. But if you're looking at transgender status, there is a huge problem because it is not biological discrimination --"
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,741.0,741.12,No.
2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,741.12,742.12,-- or the claim is going to be different.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,748.16,748.44,Right.
2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,748.44,754.6,"But if the claim is it discriminates because I am a transgender individual, that's not your claim?"
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,754.6,764.12,But that's not -- the -- the -- the claim here is that you are treating -- that Harris Homes is treating Aimee Stephens differently because of her sex assigned at birth.
2019.18-107,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,772.92,773.6,What if they --
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,773.6,782.72,And that doesn't decide the bathroom question because the bathroom question -- there's no doubt that a -- separate sex bathrooms are because of sex.
2019.18-107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,782.72,784.16,Because of biological sex.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,784.16,786.96,"Because of biological sex, as you use it."
2019.18-107,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,807.12,808.12,But I imagine --
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,808.12,810.32,-- but a worker with kids it would be significant.
2019.18-107,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,810.32,822.48,"I -- I imagine you would say that excluding a transgender woman from the woman's bathroom would be far more than a de minimis burden on that person, but let me move -- move out of that."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,822.48,823.12,Exactly.
2019.18-107,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,823.12,825.44,Let me move beyond the bathroom to another example.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,840.76,852.24,So Title IX is a different statute with regulations that explicitly permit sex-segregated teams when competitive skill or -- or contact sports are involved.
2019.18-107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,853.16,859.96,But this is not -- this is a question of someone who has transitioned from male to female --
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,859.96,860.16,Right.
2019.18-107,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,860.16,863.72,-- and wants to play on the female team.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,882.44,882.68,Right.
2019.18-107,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1143.04,1166.76,"There -- there seems, Mr. Cole, to be this dispute among the parties in this case as to what the basis of the firing was, whether the basis of the firing was the -- the violation of the dress code, particularly, or whether it was broader than that, was being transgender. What -- what should we make of that dispute?"
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1166.76,1185.04,"Well, I think, I mean, the Sixth Circuit expressly said that the reasons for firing her extended beyond the dress code. Counsel for Harris Homes conceded at oral argument in the Second Circuit that she would have been fired if she showed up as a woman, even if she were following the dress code."
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1201.32,1201.56,So -- so --
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1201.56,1202.04,-- is a case --
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1202.04,1204.6,"So, Mr. Cole, though, your argument, though, doesn't turn on that."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1250.92,1251.2,Your Honor --
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1251.2,1257.4,Judge Lynch is a very thoughtful judge and -- and wrote a very thoughtful opinion that I -- I think he probably regretted having to write.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1259.4,1274.96,I -- I say that recognizing that transgender people have a right to exist in the workplace and not be turned away because of who they are does not end dress codes or restrooms. There are transgender lawyers in this courtroom today.
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1274.96,1275.6,"Of -- of course, there are."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1275.6,1275.92,And the --
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1275.92,1277.16,"That's not the question, Mr. Cole."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1277.16,1277.52,"And the -- no, but the -- this is --"
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1277.52,1288.68,"Mr. Cole, the question is a matter of the judicial role and modesty in interpreting statutes that are old. And that's the question he posed."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1288.68,1289.12,Right.
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1289.12,1295.68,"Nobody is questioning, and he certainly did not, the legitimacy of the claims and the importance of them."
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1295.68,1296.44,So -- so I think that two --
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1296.44,1298.4,The question is about judicial interpretation.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1298.4,1298.56,Yeah.
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1298.92,1299.92,If you wish to address it.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1299.92,1301.76,"Two -- two -- two answers to that, Your Honor."
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1317.96,1318.68,I agree with that.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1318.68,1319.16,Second --
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1319.16,1321.08,"The question, though, again, and I'm sorry to pose it --"
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1321.08,1321.32,Yeah.
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1321.32,1322.88,-- but I'm going to give you one more shot.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1322.88,1323.24,Yeah.
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1323.24,1331.92,"Right? When a case is really close, really close, on the textual evidence, and I -- assume for the moment I'm --"
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1331.92,1332.16,Yeah.
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1332.16,1333.4,-- I'm with you on the textual evidence.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1353.56,1353.84,So --
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1353.84,1359.92,-- and that -- that is more effective -- more appropriate a legislative rather than a judicial function? That's it.
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1362.88,1369.96,"So, first of all, federal courts of appeals have been recognizing that discrimination against transgender people is sex discrimination for 20 years."
2019.18-107,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1431.08,1433.64,Did you want to address Judge Lynch's arguments or not?
2019.18-107,0,20648,david_d_cole,,1433.64,1442.2,"I -- I thought I was. Number 1, it won't -- it's not disruptive that transgender people exist in this world and we still have sex-segregated dress codes."
2019.18-107,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1456.52,1468.96,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bursch."
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1468.96,1492.2,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Treating women and men equally does not mean employers have to treat men as women. That is because sex and transgender status are independent concepts. Now, in the context of this case, Title VII gives Tom Rost the ability to consider how enforcement of a sex-specific dress code would impact all his employees and grieving clients."
2019.18-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1596.04,1632.48,"The first part, you've made the argument which I call the parade of horribles argument, but you've heard, as I have for the last hour and a half, the response, which is that isn't this case, that many of the things that you are worried about would be taken care of by bona fide occupational qualification, that other of those things would be taken care of by the need to show harm, as well as to show difference, and that there could be, though we haven't done it, and I'm not advocating it, yes or no, the possibility of bringing into such cases comparative harms."

2019.18-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1670.52,1671.2,"Yes, of course, he --"
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1671.2,1671.92,That they were hurt.
2019.18-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1671.92,1672.44,-- he would say it's an injury.
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1672.44,1673.04,And there is no BFOQ.
2019.18-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1673.04,1679.84,And the other side would say: I'm sorry but there's serious injuries on the other side.
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1697.04,1709.96,"It's their answer, and here's why: If Stephens is right that you cannot apply a sex-specific policy to those who identify as the opposite sex, then you cannot apply that policy to anyone because that itself would be sex discrimination."
2019.18-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1709.96,1710.52,All right.
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1710.52,1710.92,It would be --
2019.18-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1710.92,1718.32,And just on the off chance that I feel we do not have to decide that matter in this case -- (Laughter.)
2019.18-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1718.32,1726.12,"-- have you other arguments that would favor your side? I know you do, and I'd just at some point to hear them."
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1726.12,1726.64,Certainly.
2019.18-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1756.48,1791.08,"And what they say is the reason we know you're wrong -- I'm not saying this -- nor am I assuming any other person thinks this, I'm just saying that this is what I hear -- that if you are right, then miscegenation does not fall within this statute, that Jews marrying Catholics does not fall within this statute, that any instance where people say or many instances where they say I fired this man because he wasn't a woman -- I fired the woman because it's a man's job, it's okay, as long as sometimes you'd fire a -- a -- a man because it's a woman's job."
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1791.92,1792.2,I do.
2019.18-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1793.0,1793.2,Okay.
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1795.28,1800.64,There is no non-racist reason why you would fire the employee in the interracial marriage.
2019.18-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1801.92,1803.32,There isn't? I happen to know people.
2019.18-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1806.16,1815.2,"-- in my life I have heard say being Jewish is fine, being Catholic is fine, just don't get married."
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1815.2,1816.6,But that's a religious reason.
2019.18-107,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1817.8,1818.64,Right.
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1827.24,1827.48,Yes.
2019.18-107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1846.64,1849.08,That's a ministerial exception that already --
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1849.08,1849.44,No.
2019.18-107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1849.44,1850.32,-- exists.
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1850.32,1854.16,"A ministerial exception if the employer is a church, but not if the employer is a Christian businessman --"
2019.18-107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1854.16,1854.6,But there's still --
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1854.6,1855.84,-- like Mr. Ross.
2019.18-107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1855.84,1861.12,But there are still religious exceptions that the Court has read into a lot of statutes.
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1908.16,1911.6,"Because under Mr. Cole's theory, BFOQs have to go too."
2019.18-107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1913.72,1914.88,But it's statutory.
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1914.88,1915.96,It -- it is --
2019.18-107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1915.96,1916.92,They can't -- they can't --
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1916.92,1918.56,If I could explain?
2019.18-107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1918.56,1921.64,-- wish it away. But go ahead.
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1921.64,1941.92,"If you have a BFOQ that says only a man can apply for this position, he would say that a woman who is transgender is a man, and, therefore, is eligible for that position, and no BFOQ in the world would be able to keep them out of that position. The problem is they're adding transgender classification to a statute where Congress has never added it."
2019.18-107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1941.92,1942.08,No.
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1966.88,1967.52,Let -- let's go --
2019.18-107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1967.52,1968.44,That's a very different --
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1968.44,1968.8,No.
2019.18-107,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1968.8,1969.28,-- proposition.
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1969.28,1971.16,But let's go back to the women's overnight shelter.
2019.18-107,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1979.28,1984.36,How does that fit with BFOQ? BFOQ is a very narrow category.
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,1984.36,1985.08,I -- I agree.
2019.18-107,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2015.32,2015.8,Do you wish to --
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,2015.8,2016.36,But in --
2019.18-107,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2016.36,2034.96,"-- address Judge Flaum's argument joined by Judge Ripple which, again is -- is a very thoughtful position too that there may be dual causes here, but the fact that sex is under consideration even as narrowly construed is enough to draw us within the statute?"
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,2034.96,2039.16,I think that line drawing inquiries happen all the time in Title VII.
2019.18-107,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2056.56,2061.56,"I think, Mr. Bursch, that that's not quite right, women should be treated less differently than men."
2019.18-107,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2068.28,2071.12,"That -- that's helpful, but I'm also curious what you have to say, Mr. Bursch."
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,2071.12,2081.8,"Yeah, let's put both of those together, individual and that concept. Say that you have a woman who identifies as a man and they're working at an employer and they get pregnant."
2019.18-107,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2120.32,2125.8,"I -- I -- I think, Mr. Bursch, maybe you answered Justice Gorsuch's question now."
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,2127.0,2127.68,Okay.
2019.18-107,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2127.68,2132.32,Title VII is a -- is a -- is a statute about individuals --
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,2132.32,2132.84,Correct.
2019.18-107,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2132.84,2138.24,-- and whether individuals are being treated differently because of his or her sex.
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,2192.84,2194.52,We agree with the individual treatment.
2019.18-107,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2225.64,2252.76,"Are you pinning your answer on the fact of a dress code? Would your answer be the same if there were no dress code and Ms. Stephens had just been fired for being transgender? Because all your arguments in your brief -- I mean, you keep talking in your brief, as you do here, about the dress code, but the arguments that you make are arguments that would allow the employer to fire Ms. Stephens for being transgender, irrespective of whether there was a dress code."
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,2252.76,2254.52,"Here's the reason why, Justice Kagan."
2019.18-107,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2254.52,2257.2,The why what? The -- that the arguments do go that far.
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,2257.2,2260.12,"Well, that the arguments apply in both situations."
2019.18-107,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2260.12,2261.72,"Yeah, if there's a dress code or if there's not a dress code?"
2019.18-107,1,29018,john_j_bursch,,2261.72,2273.8,"Because if this Court allows a sex-specific dress code because it acknowledges the differences between men and women, it's no different if an employer without a dress code impact -- imposes the same policy on an informal basis."
2019.18-107,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2391.52,2398.32,"Thank you, counsel. General Francisco."
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2398.32,2410.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to make three basic points aimed at basically addressing Justice Gorsuch's comment that this was -- this is a close textual case."
2019.18-107,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2415.28,2419.2,"Oh, neither side ever thinks a case is close. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-107,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2419.2,2421.2,"Judges always do, don't they?"
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2421.2,2434.6,"And the first, Your Honor, is the one that I was talking about earlier, that sex and gender identity, like sex and sexual orientation, are different traits. They're defined, they have different definitions, as my friend just said."
2019.18-107,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2534.6,2535.4,A great deal of --
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2535.4,2536.72,It's a different type of relationship.
2019.18-107,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2536.72,2548.56,"A great deal of -- of the arguments here could be cast as stereotypes, though, right? That the plaintiff in this case or that case doesn't conform to male or female stereotypes?"
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2548.56,2549.08,That is --
2019.18-107,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2549.08,2558.12,"And -- and as I understand your brief, you accept that argument and that those are good claims without respect to comparators of opposite sex."
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2563.68,2564.12,Right.
2019.18-107,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2564.12,2569.24,"I -- I accept there's some delta, but it seems smaller than might first appear."
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2569.24,2569.76,Sure.
2019.18-107,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2613.16,2613.32,General --
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2613.32,2615.48,-- to a straight woman for exactly the same reason.
2019.18-107,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2615.48,2631.4,"And I think one could argue just the opposite, that there is another trait in Price Waterhouse, and the trait is conformity to traditional gender roles. So your argument would suggest, no, we shouldn't look at the aggressive woman and the aggressive man."
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2636.28,2636.48,Right.
2019.18-107,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2636.48,2644.28,"We should really look at whether the employer treats the same the aggressive woman and the docile man, the docile effeminate man."
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2658.32,2658.72,Right.
2019.18-107,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2658.72,2662.56,-- that's double discrimination and the employer is on the hook twice.
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2685.32,2685.68,Right.
2019.18-107,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2699.96,2700.84,But I thought you --
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2700.84,2702.04,So in Price Waterhouse --
2019.18-107,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2702.04,2717.0,I thought you answered the question that -- that Price Waterhouse would not have prevailed if it had treated men who were not sufficiently macho in the same way that they treated women who were not sufficiently feminine.
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2717.0,2721.04,"No, Your Honor, I believe we said the opposite of that in our brief."
2019.18-107,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2721.2,2722.08,That that would be okay?
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2722.08,2724.28,"Yeah, we said the opposite of that in our brief."
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2724.28,2725.88,Then I could ask this --
2019.18-107,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2725.88,2727.12,And they could rely on the -- for both cases --
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2727.12,2727.52,Yes.
2019.18-107,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2727.52,2745.44,"-- they could rely on the stereotype that the woman doesn't fit, they can rely on the stereotype that the man didn't fit, although the cases have said that the object of Title VII was to get at the entire spectrum of sex stereotypes."
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2745.44,2771.16,"And so as we read Price Waterhouse, which I have no quarrel with in the slightest, if you treat an aggressive woman worse than an aggressive man, you are violating Title VII because you're treating similarly situated people differently. Applying that here, if you treat a transgender man exactly the same as you treat a transgender woman regardless of their sex, you're likewise not discriminating against them because of their sex --"
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2771.16,2771.68,I -- I --
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2771.68,2772.28,-- since they're similarly situated --
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2772.28,2772.68,I -- we got that.
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2775.8,2776.0,Yeah.
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2776.0,2789.04,"See, one, it's only my characterization, not anybody else's, but I do characterize one set of arguments that you've been through as trying to work with the language of the statute."
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2793.76,2793.96,Yeah.
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2793.96,2799.72,"-- and on the other hand, you have -- and the arguments that were made here and, on the other hand, arguments on the other side."
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2801.56,2802.68,Okay.
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2802.68,2804.84,Then there are the horribles.
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2808.8,2809.68,Okay.
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2809.68,2823.56,"Then I say, well, there seems to be a third set in some of these briefs, that regardless of the first two, Congress -- and that's what I think the dissenting judge was talking about, and Judge Posner, who had a good point."
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2826.36,2827.84,-- which is what I want to know.
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2827.84,2828.4,Yeah.
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2828.4,2833.4,That Congress wouldn't have dreamt of this when it passed the statute.
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2842.44,2845.0,"No, we are relying on it in this sense."
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2845.0,2845.72,"Oh, you are."
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2845.72,2848.04,"One -- one, we think it fortifies our other arguments, but I know --"
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2848.04,2848.96,"Of course, it does."
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2848.96,2852.48,"-- you don't -- I know you don't want me to push on that, so I'm not going to push on that."
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2866.16,2866.72,Yes.
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2866.72,2880.48,"And here, by updating it in the way that my friends on the other side would have you update it, they're actually undermining the manner in which Congress has traditionally considered updating it. If you look at ENDA, which I think --"
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2880.48,2880.76,ENDA.
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2880.76,2894.36,"-- refers to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, for nearly a decade now, when Congress has looked and considered expanding the scope of the liability provisions, it has acknowledged that there are religious liberty issues at stake."
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2903.36,2903.72,Got it.
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2903.72,2911.84,"-- groups of very different views. But if you resolve this issue judicially, you are essentially delivering -- and I hate to use these types of terms --"
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2911.84,2912.16,All right.
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2912.16,2915.88,-- but a complete victory to one side of the fight and nothing to the other side --
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2915.88,2916.0,All right.
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2916.32,2917.64,"-- of the fight, you're upsetting that --"

2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2917.68,2918.68,-- legislative balance.
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2918.68,2921.0,I -- I think that is an argument in your favor.
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2921.0,2921.2,Yeah.
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2921.2,2924.0,"Moreover, I think this whole category is the elephant in the room and --"
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2924.0,2924.92,That -- that was actually the --
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2924.92,2925.16,-- I think it is --
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2925.16,2927.04,-- third point point I was going to make to Justice Gorsuch.
2019.18-107,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2927.04,2928.36,"Well, all right, I think it is."
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3010.28,3015.2,"No, Your Honor, for a couple of reasons, I would argue against that."
2019.18-107,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3040.08,3040.76,No one ever --
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3040.76,3041.56,And when courts --
2019.18-107,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3041.56,3066.6,"No one ever thought sexual harassment was encompassed by discrimination on the basis of sex back in '64. It wasn't until a book was written in the middle '70s bringing that out. And now we say, of course, harassing someone, subjecting her to terms and conditions of employment she would not encounter if she were a male, that is sex discrimination but it wasn't recognized --"
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3066.6,3066.76,And --
2019.18-107,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3066.76,3068.28,-- to be such in the beginning.
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3068.28,3110.04,"And, Your Honor, I think that that is a straightforward application of Title VII's text. With respect to what I was talking about with Justice Breyer where we were putting the text aside, I think it is important to allow the democratic processes to resolve these issues so we have a stable resolution of the issue and one that takes into account what everybody would agree are legitimate interests on all sides. In Obergefell, this Court made very clear that there were good and decent people who had different views with respect to gay marriage and they should be respected. The legislative process is the process that allows those views to respect -- be respected as well as the very powerful views of my friends on the other side --"
2019.18-107,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3110.04,3110.28,May I --
2019.18-107,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3110.28,3110.68,General Francisco --
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3110.68,3111.88,-- which also should be respected.
2019.18-107,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3111.88,3175.56,"May -- may I just ask, at what point does a court continue to permit invidious discrimination against groups that, where we have a difference of opinion, we believe the language of the statute is clear. I think Justice Breyer was right that Title VII, the Civil Rights Act, all of our acts were born from the desire to ensure that we treated people equally and not on the basis of invidious reasons. And we can't deny that homosexuals are being fired merely for being who they are and not because of religious reasons, not because they are performing their jobs poorly, not because they can't do whatever is required of a position, but merely because they're a suspect class to some people."
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3213.28,3218.96,"I guess my answer, Your Honor, would be at the point when Congress actually addresses the issue."

2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3231.0,3231.8,-- are different traits.
2019.18-107,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3231.8,3243.44,"-- some thoughtful responses that you have given to this set of questions. But in responding to Justice Breyer, you said, if we thought that there was a clear application of the statute."
2019.18-107,2,37093,noel_j_francisco,,3262.44,3266.8,"Yes, Your Honor, if the statute is unambiguously against me, you have to rule against me."
2019.18-107,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3310.72,3317.84,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Cole."
2019.18-107,3,20648,david_d_cole,,3317.84,3323.96,Thank you. Interpreting a statute is not depriving the democratic process.
2019.18-107,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3444.68,3445.32,"Thank you, counsel."
