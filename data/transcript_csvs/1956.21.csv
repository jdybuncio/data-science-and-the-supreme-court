1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,24.849,28.023,May it please the Court.
1956.21,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,356.949,364.533,(Voice Overlap) -- does the Federal Reserve Bank cash this bond without mitigating that they issue of it?
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,364.533,369.492,The Federal Reserved Bank immediately cashed the bonds and --
1956.21,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,369.492,371.223,And then they're canceled at the --
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,371.223,384.871,They were then cancelled and the fact that they were stolen was apparently not discovered for several months later at which time agents of the FBI visited the parties.
1956.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,456.69,459.942,You mean it couldn't be anything else but debtors.
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,459.942,461.07,I don't say it couldn't be.
1956.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,478.486,479.717,But that is your position.
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,479.717,481.838,That is our position.
1956.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,484.089,484.763,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,484.763,488.375,-- was brought as a diversity case.
1956.21,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,773.968,779.031,"Is there any question about that, the question of great counsel?"
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,780.189,782.85,"No, I believe it is a fair statement to say that there is none."
1956.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,961.659,973.174,"Did the (Inaudible) Griswold, that although it may be governed by what is called federal law, the federal law may have sought the law of the State we should find that to be same."
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,973.174,978.738,"Well, Mr. Justice, that was essentially what I was trying to say with respect to my second alternative."
1956.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,986.213,988.809,That the third alternative permits variations (Voice Overlap) --
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,988.809,1005.434,"There is a third alternative which permits the variations and I would say that insofar as there are different constructions or perhaps alterations in Negotiable Instruments Law of the several States, that whatever the law is in the particular State should apply."
1956.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1005.439,1019.35,"Do you have -- do you have a case where while we ruled in this, what interest should be involved in a recovery by the Government itself, the money has vindicated to the assumption."
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1027.489,1027.494,Well that of course --
1956.21,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1027.494,1028.816,That is gives us --
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1028.816,1049.073,"-- that of course, that point was made very well by Mr. Justice Jackson in a -- in a case cited by Mr. Dumbauld, Davies Warehouse Company against Bowles where the Price Control Act, the Federal Price Control Act exempted public utilities."
1956.21,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1262.618,1264.895,Were these bonds mature?
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1264.895,1265.8,Were these bonds --
1956.21,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1265.8,1267.514,Mature?
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1268.963,1272.168,These bonds were due in 1952.
1956.21,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1324.701,1328.925,And is it your view that they call maturity of the bond?
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1328.925,1341.425,It is our view that a call was -- that a call made the bonds overdue at least within a reasonable time after the date of the call.
1956.21,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1341.425,1342.943,A part of the interest stopped on the call.
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1342.943,1349.956,"The interest stopped on May 1, 1944 and that was understood by both parties."
1956.21,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1392.202,1393.159,"Yes, I'm just wondering."
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1399.555,1404.693,"No, the - the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law has no provision dealing with this."
1956.21,0,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,1455.853,1457.708,"Just before that, may I ask one question?"
1956.21,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1469.463,1477.344,"Well, that seems obvious to me, Mr. Justice, and -- and as I say straight if the cashier testified that he knew they were called all the time."
1956.21,1,22176,edward_dumbauld,,2066.775,2069.117,May it please the Court.
1956.21,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2396.063,2397.209,Mr. Dumbauld --
1956.21,1,22176,edward_dumbauld,,2397.209,2397.214,Yes?
1956.21,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2397.214,2403.951,-- this status of the conduit bank a new status or is that a status that you firmly recognize in the decision?
1956.21,1,22176,edward_dumbauld,,2403.951,2427.153,"Well, I find that expression used in the Gruntal case in 254 New York, a decision in which Justice Cardozo was then Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals, the word is also used in the Goldberg case and my associate will discuss a greater length the Goldberg case."
1956.21,1,15127,harold_burton,scotus_justice,2437.639,2441.268,(Inaudible) things could have applied to other conduits along the line.
1956.21,1,22176,edward_dumbauld,,2441.268,2451.031,"Well, we contend that it applies to other conduits including the lawyer here who passed them on to the banks."
1956.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2521.033,2529.498,"Well that, that in that saying the holders due course are not in fact need better protection than those who are honest."
1956.21,1,22176,edward_dumbauld,,2529.498,2531.094,That would be true.
1956.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2584.456,2589.699,And did you say that there are suggested in the law of Pennsylvania gives a conduit that protection?
1956.21,1,22176,edward_dumbauld,,2589.699,2590.975,We do.
1956.21,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2600.133,2601.797,Which -- which one you said?
