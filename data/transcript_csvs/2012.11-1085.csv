2012.11-1085,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.439,"We'll hear argument next in Case 11-1085, Amgen, Incorporated v. The Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,10.489,13.724,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1085,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,73.428,74.928,Why is that -- why is that the case?
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,82.884,84.736,--That's exactly correct.
2012.11-1085,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,86.236,90.122,"Well, why isn't that common to all parties?"
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,90.122,107.166,"--Mr. Chief Justice, every one of the four predicates to the fraud-on-the-market theory, which is a shortcut that -- that excuses plaintiffs from proving that I heard the statement and relied on it -- every one of those predicates is common."
2012.11-1085,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,122.326,124.961,So is the falsity of the statement common as well?
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,124.961,147.643,"--The falsity of the statement is common, but it is not a predicate to whether or not you can prove reliance on a statement indirectly by relying on the integrity of the market price, because in an efficient market, material public statements, whether they are true or false, will presumably move the market price."
2012.11-1085,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,150.678,163.253,"Can an individual who has -- it has been deemed in -- in a cert certification that an issue is immaterial, could an individual claimant ever prove it's material?"
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,163.253,164.153,--Sure.
2012.11-1085,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,165.272,171.259,"On the truth-on-the-market -- the truth-on-the-market defense, which is the type of defense that you're raising here."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,171.259,171.809,--Yes.
2012.11-1085,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,246.474,246.89,I'm sorry--
2012.11-1085,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,246.89,252.996,"Mr. Waxman, that's just to say that a plaintiff can always relitigate the question of materiality."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,266.938,271.374,"The suit cannot -- that is, the suit cannot proceed as a class action."
2012.11-1085,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,273.007,275.159,"It can't proceed as an anything action, can it?"
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,289.217,291.585,--I -- I think that's wrong.
2012.11-1085,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,306.845,318.902,"Well, do you mean to say that a judge who has just ruled that a statement is immaterial is going to keep the case in his court litigated by an individual plaintiff, even though he's just ruled that the statement is immaterial?"
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,318.902,326.989,"--Well, I want to -- I'd like to come back to the question of why whether, even if your -- the premise of your question is correct, it doesn't matter for this case."
2012.11-1085,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,393.116,403.639,"So you're saying that a judge on a class certification stage can say: This is immaterial, the statement is immaterial; therefore, this can't proceed as a class action."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,416.149,428.89,"Well, in some cases if -- if the alleged fact is, you know, that Amgen's president got a haircut at 10:30, the judge presumably can say there are -- you know, this is immaterial as a matter of law."
2012.11-1085,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,452.655,463.427,"I guess the question, Mr. Waxman, is if it is not immaterial as a matter of law at the summary judgment stage, how could a judge possibly say it is material at the class certification stage?"
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,463.427,472.967,--The judge at the class certification stage is required to weigh competing evidence and -- and render his or her best judgment.
2012.11-1085,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,478.103,481.905,So the class certification stage becomes kind of a super merits inquiry?
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,481.905,482.924,"No, not at all."
2012.11-1085,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,482.924,487.559,--where the plaintiff has to -- has to surmount a higher burden on the merits?
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,487.559,488.161,"No, no, no."
2012.11-1085,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,525.434,544.498,"I thought we were talking about, Mr. Waxman, the materiality of the alleged misstatement; and I am really nonplussed by your answer that if the judge says it's immaterial, that doesn't end it for everybody."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,571.565,575.434,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, let's take an easier case."
2012.11-1085,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,598.899,599.982,--How could that be--
2012.11-1085,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,599.982,609.94,"Are you saying that there -- are you saying that there is a difference between materiality for the fraud-on-the-market theory and for direct reliance, or that there can be a difference?"
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,609.94,611.123,The standard of--
2012.11-1085,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,611.123,625.2,"And that if there was fraud on the market, that is a materiality question addressed at the certification stage, but if the class isn't certified, the investor can still show that he had had direct reliance that was reasonable?"
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,625.2,625.717,--Yes.
2012.11-1085,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,625.717,626.985,Am I right about that?
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,627.802,632.021,"You are -- You are either right or wrong, depending on how I understood you."
2012.11-1085,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,635.94,637.79,--Do the first part.
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,638.457,639.042,Okay.
2012.11-1085,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,738.622,741.908,Or you can take exactly what you said and phrase it the opposite way.
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,741.908,742.808,But I wouldn't.
2012.11-1085,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,742.808,745.626,"I know you wouldn't, but I suspect your opponents might."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,753.149,753.599,No.
2012.11-1085,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,753.599,754.282,"No, it's not."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,795.626,801.362,"Justice Breyer, the point of class certification is not to pre-try the merits of the case."
2012.11-1085,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,801.362,813.437,"No, but you are saying with a cert -- class certification here, if there is no materiality there is no class; and you are repeatedly faced with the question: You are absolutely right; in fact there is no case."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,828.097,842.189,"The point of the class certification, as this Court explained in Amchem and other cases, and as the Rules Advisory Committee notes, is the question of whether there is class coherence in the first place."
2012.11-1085,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,857.833,867.424,"Mr. Waxman, that is right, and that's what we said in Walmart recently, that the question is a question of coherence; it's a question of whether the class wins or loses together."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,904.83,912.667,"--Justice Kagan, this Court has explained more than once, and I am now quoting from Amchem, that “ class ” --"
2012.11-1085,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,928.376,929.726,"Mr. Waxman, I was saying that's right."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,929.726,930.276,--Okay.
2012.11-1085,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,930.276,932.661,There is class cohesion as to materiality.
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,936.363,955.859,"The -- there is class -- with respect, there is class cohesion, investors cohere into a class, only when the alleged misinformation was significant enough to affect the price, thus enabling the common claim of relying on the misinformation in the same way."
2012.11-1085,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,968.501,969.151,Mr. Waxman--
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,969.151,969.869,--is like letting--
2012.11-1085,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,969.869,974.755,"--Mr. Waxman, there is no question about 23(a), right?"
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,978.207,979.559,--Not challenged in this case.
2012.11-1085,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,979.559,993.318,"So the only thing is (b)(3), that is a question of law or fact common to the class members predominates over questions affecting only individual members."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1022.921,1034.978,"The answer, Justice Ginsburg, is that the question at the class certification stage, the predominance question is the reliance element, not the materiality element."
2012.11-1085,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1107.908,1110.026,"Mr. Waxman, you have a habit of not pausing between sentences."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1116.429,1117.146,--Not at all.
2012.11-1085,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1117.146,1118.798,--but you leave me no alternative.
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1118.798,1120.481,It's the red light.
2012.11-1085,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1120.481,1121.683,"Yes, I understand."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1121.683,1122.75,The purity.
2012.11-1085,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.75,1139.462,"Is it not the case that one of the other elements necessary for the fraud-on-the-market theory would also be decided conclusively for future individual litigants, namely the efficiency of the market?"
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1155.554,1156.271,Yes.
2012.11-1085,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1156.271,1170.498,So -- so you can say the same thing about the efficiency of the -- of the market being determined in this preliminary question as you can say about -- about the issue here.
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1170.498,1171.481,That's absolutely right.
2012.11-1085,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1175.968,1176.718,"What is that statement, Mr. Waxman?"
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1176.718,1177.504,--I'm sorry.
2012.11-1085,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1177.504,1192.162,"Because the difference is if there is an insufficient market, the case goes forward and people have to prove individual reliance, and that means that the class splits apart and you don't get a coherent class."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1216.629,1227.401,"That's not correct, and in any event, that analysis, that approach is, as I was trying to say, is like letting the fruits justify the search."
2012.11-1085,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1274.132,1290.176,"Mr. Waxman, the -- the Basic opinion that started all this off, on page 242, lists materiality as a common question."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1300.449,1305.436,"It makes perfect sense to me as well, Justice Ginsburg, and I'm not being sarcastic."
2012.11-1085,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1313.94,1318.493,So at certification you just assume that materiality -- you don't have to show it.
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1325.23,1331.484,"--Well, the question, Justice -- I mean, for -- if it worked for class certification, that would be fine."
2012.11-1085,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1370.794,1381.4,"Mr. Waxman, you seem to be setting out two determinations of materiality."
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1411.871,1420.561,"They differ temporally, they differ functionally, and they differ in terms of who decides it and with what level of finality."
2012.11-1085,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1465.756,1475.129,"But I still -- what does “ material ” mean at the trial level, what does “ material ” mean at the certification level?"
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1475.129,1490.621,"Material means at both, as this Court said, that there is a substantial likelihood that the information would have been viewed by a reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information available."
2012.11-1085,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1491.907,1492.557,So it's the same question.
2012.11-1085,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1500.077,1502.529,That's correct.
2012.11-1085,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1519.808,1522.259,"Yes, you may."
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1523.492,1532.548,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1085,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1542.237,1561.466,"Why don't you answer the question that was asked earlier, if Basic set forth a presumption, and are you disputing that at the class certification stage a defendant can prove that the market is inefficient?"
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1561.466,1562.318,--Yes.
2012.11-1085,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1562.318,1571.006,"So why shouldn't we hold Basic to its position that all of its presumptions can be rebutted as well, not just efficiency?"
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1576.558,1581.295,"There is a lot to said about Basic, and let me just start the ball rolling by making these observations."
2012.11-1085,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1641.418,1648.589,Doesn't -- doesn't that assume that the efficient market theory is always relevant to materiality?
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1661.731,1664.116,"Only in a hypothetical case, Justice Kennedy."
2012.11-1085,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.735,1760.447,"Mr. Frederick, you -- you say that, you know, it's a flukey hypothetical where -- where the -- the issue here would -- would come up again in a different context in an individual suit."
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1827.289,1832.841,"Right, precisely because we have to know are all the investors standing in the same position."
2012.11-1085,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.232,1844.815,You could say the same about materiality.
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1848.703,1853.154,They all lose on the merits if there is no materiality.
2012.11-1085,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.174,1897.866,"So -- so the difference you assert is that, with respect to the issue here, it will be an issue in all individual cases, whereas with regard to the efficiency of the market it will only be an issue in what, 95 percent of -- of the individual cases?"
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1897.866,1905.789,"No, the question is, does efficiency serve as a means of determining are all the investors similarly situated?"
2012.11-1085,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1940.212,1940.845,Could we--
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1940.845,1941.878,Publicity serves the same function.
2012.11-1085,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1941.878,1955.572,"--Could we get a hypothetical that I actually think could occur, which is not a truth-on-the-market defense, but a known truth to the individual person seeking certification."
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1971.415,1991.642,"I think it -- where it gets appropriately done is the adequacy and typicality prongs of Rule 23(a), because that person has a different factual basis for attempting to assert a securities fraud, and that person is not typical of the class and so therefore would not meet the typicality requirement of 23(a)."
2012.11-1085,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2023.113,2035.655,"This is true, but I'm -- I'm -- I'm trying to work out what, as I understand it now, Mr. Waxman's point is -- is basically this, that -- that why do we use an efficient market theory?"
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2097.812,2102.299,My direct answer to that is that materiality still serves as a common answer.
2012.11-1085,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2111.671,2112.671,"Well, that -- that--"
2012.11-1085,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2112.671,2116.54,The issue -- the issue is not whether -- whether it's a common question or not.
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2116.54,2117.059,--Well--
2012.11-1085,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2117.059,2124.146,The issue is whether there's any reason to believe that the -- that the market reflects reality.
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2124.146,2124.613,--Right.
2012.11-1085,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2124.613,2125.496,That's the issue.
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2125.496,2137.271,"But, Justice Scalia, I think that the issue that you want to decide or you think that you want to decide is what constitutes the efficiency of the market, and that is a hotly litigated issue in many securities cases."
2012.11-1085,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2153.779,2154.112,All right.
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2174.525,2174.992,Right.
2012.11-1085,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2190.752,2204.128,"--You -- you are saying that if everyone loses, if it's not material, that's a common issue and therefore, the trial court at the certification stage does not have to determine it."
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2204.128,2210.882,"--No, what I'm saying is that it is -- because it is a common question, it is not one to be decided at class certification."
2012.11-1085,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2211.749,2214.068,I'm not sure how that's different from what I said.
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2237.683,2238.783,--That's not our position.
2012.11-1085,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2250.074,2261.131,"Mr. Frederick, you say -- you say, you point out quite rightly that the efficiency of the market was conceded -- was conceded below."
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2261.131,2262.064,Yes.
2012.11-1085,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2262.064,2263.0,It was not challenged.
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2291.251,2315.016,"It's a new concoction they have not argued before this stage of the briefing in this case, and it's wrong because all investors will rise or fall based on whether or not those statements that may have some subsidiary materiality effect are going to be able to show that there was some consequence to the market."
2012.11-1085,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2322.455,2322.855,Right.
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2333.745,2334.53,--Correct.
2012.11-1085,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2334.53,2336.497,--that is something special to get into this theory.
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2336.497,2337.381,That's correct.
2012.11-1085,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2337.381,2343.968,"The publicity of the matter, that is not traditionally a common element of the tort, that is something special to get into this theory."
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2343.968,2344.668,Correct.
2012.11-1085,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2344.668,2359.128,"With materiality, it is a common element of the tort always; it is traditionally there; it will be litigated, so there is no special reason to or desirability in or need for litigating at the outset."
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2359.128,2359.895,That's correct.
2012.11-1085,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2384.279,2395.318,"But there is -- there is a reason for deciding it earlier, and the reason is the -- the enormous pressure to settle once the class is certified."
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2440.615,2450.138,"--Well, Justice Scalia, you would consign district court judges to having many trials on the merits because the fact that materiality is such a highly contextual inquiry--"
2012.11-1085,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2450.138,2454.84,"Well, you have the -- you have the burden of justifying class certification--"
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2454.84,2455.292,--True.
2012.11-1085,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2455.292,2455.808,--is that not correct?
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2455.808,2456.408,That's correct.
2012.11-1085,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2456.408,2456.908,All right.
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2470.551,2471.167,Yes.
2012.11-1085,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2471.167,2472.351,At the certification stage?
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2472.351,2486.675,"Yes, but that's where efficiency comes in, Justice Kennedy, and that's why, when efficiency is contested at the class certification stage, what comes in are proofs of does information end up having an effect?"
2012.11-1085,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2505.505,2508.357,You say it's material even though there is no cause in fact?
2012.11-1085,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2510.274,2521.082,"--What I'm saying is that the efficiency question goes into the individual stock's ability to absorb information, both material and nonmaterial information."
2012.11-1085,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2637.992,2639.375,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1085,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2646.079,2650.547,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2012.11-1085,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2675.848,2680.133,"But as Justice Scalia pointed out earlier, so is efficiency or nonefficiency."
2012.11-1085,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2680.133,2680.833,--And the difference--
2012.11-1085,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2680.833,2685.454,"So that -- that differentiation, articulating it that way, doesn't move the ball."
2012.11-1085,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2685.454,2689.822,--I would disagree with that because the difference is with efficiency and with publicity.
2012.11-1085,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2705.784,2707.918,What's the difference between 100 percent and 95 percent?
2012.11-1085,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2720.31,2726.114,--The -- the purpose of the class certification stage with respect to predominance is to weigh the common issues against individual issues.
2012.11-1085,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2741.374,2750.729,"There are preconditions -- there are preconditions, not related to the merits, that do, in fact, justify the use of a special reliance theory."
2012.11-1085,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2753.948,2754.614,But--
2012.11-1085,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2754.614,2764.989,"But materiality, unlike the other two, is part of the element of the basic case where it is a common issue in this case -- and in most -- to everybody."
2012.11-1085,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2764.989,2766.689,--And that is exactly right.
2012.11-1085,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2767.691,2768.474,Is that exactly right?
2012.11-1085,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2778.314,2789.205,"--I am going to say it's exactly right, because the confusion here is that materiality in a fraud-on-the-market case serves two purposes: It is a predicate to the fraud-on-the-market theory, but it is also an independent, separate element."
2012.11-1085,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2802.864,2806.899,"If you have the same question, then maybe we shouldn't have this fraud-on-the-market theory."
2012.11-1085,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2833.966,2836.668,"--The fraud-on-the-market theory, however, is a substantive theory."
2012.11-1085,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2877.912,2880.697,Materiality is a common issue.
2012.11-1085,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2903.397,2906.349,"With all due respect, the two really do collapse into one."
2012.11-1085,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2914.954,2935.166,"Well, that then -- that imparts the question of 24 years of economic scholarship -- I think that's how long it's been since Basic was decided -- has shown that the efficient market theory is -- is really an overgeneralization."
2012.11-1085,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2939.32,2940.936,"No, I -- a couple responses to that."
2012.11-1085,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3075.122,3082.927,Do you -- do you agree that you have to show materiality to rely on the fraud-on-the-market theory to establish reliance?
2012.11-1085,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3082.927,3085.629,"--As a substantive matter on the merits, yes."
2012.11-1085,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3086.762,3088.831,I don't understand why that is.
2012.11-1085,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3101.472,3112.464,"I think in terms of transaction causation, what you're -- and reliance is referred to as transaction causation -- what you're trying to show is whether or not the information affected or distorted the market price."
2012.11-1085,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3120.135,3127.389,"Or, to put it differently, an efficient market is a market that takes account of material factors, right?"
2012.11-1085,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3127.389,3128.306,--I -- I would say it's--
2012.11-1085,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3128.306,3132.193,"It's not an efficient market if it's, you know -- it's, who knows, random?"
2012.11-1085,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3135.145,3136.145,--I would make a minor quibble on that.
2012.11-1085,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3254.138,3255.288,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1085,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3257.757,3261.042,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-1085,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3368.544,3369.294,"Traditionally, how did that work?"
2012.11-1085,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3380.619,3381.136,--Right.
2012.11-1085,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3381.136,3382.904,--So the materiality was not part of reliance.
2012.11-1085,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3387.456,3388.308,Exactly right.
2012.11-1085,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3435.437,3442.193,It sounds like you are saying you have to win on the merits of the materiality question in order to get the class certified.
2012.11-1085,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3442.193,3456.016,"--You have to prove that there -- the Court explained correctly in Basic, and this -- this actually goes to -- anticipates my next point, Justice Ginsburg, the Court in Basic didn't say: Well, we're going to allow you to--"
2012.11-1085,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3456.016,3457.202,Excuse me.
2012.11-1085,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3457.202,3458.252,--we're going to allow you to--
2012.11-1085,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3458.252,3461.004,You -- you don't have to prove it to get the class certified.
2012.11-1085,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3468.276,3469.026,--Correct.
2012.11-1085,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3469.026,3472.128,"Which is a shortcut to getting the class certified, right?"
2012.11-1085,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3472.128,3472.662,Yes.
2012.11-1085,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3472.662,3474.497,So this is just a condition to the shortcut.
2012.11-1085,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3474.497,3475.414,Yes.
2012.11-1085,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3519.609,3541.289,"And the reason that we want to prove it upfront in the 23 rather than wait till the merits, where it will be argued anyway in exactly the same way -- the reason that we want to do it first is since it's going to be there anyway and going to be litigated anyway, unlike publicity, unlike efficiency."
2012.11-1085,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3548.712,3549.645,--Of course not.
2012.11-1085,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3549.645,3550.178,Okay.
2012.11-1085,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3551.164,3575.295,"The answer is that this is the -- that the point of Rule 23 is to say, you get to use this very useful and powerful device if you have the key to the gate, and the key to the gate is showing that the answer to the question, will reliance be proven commonly -- not lost commonly, but proven commonly -- is in fact yes."
2012.11-1085,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3575.961,3576.611,"Thank you, counsel."
