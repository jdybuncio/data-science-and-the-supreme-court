1970.84,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.581,Mr. Huntington you may proceed whenever you are ready.
1970.84,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,15.581,19.617,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,2736.453,2743.092,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1970.84,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2921.145,2924.755,"On vagueness grounds, all of this decisions are not?"
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,2924.755,2926.274,"No Your Honor, they vary."
1970.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2961.743,2965.441,You mean she has the right to dispose of it as she sees fit?
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,2965.441,2969.288,"Yes Your Honor, the court in the Wisconsin --"
1970.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2969.288,2971.155,To kill it?
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,2971.155,2972.355,"No, Your Honor."
1970.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2983.311,2985.922,But suppose its after that?
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,2985.922,3004.504,"Your Honor various statutes have held on the basis of medical knowledge that had since overtaken it that after quickening, an abortion should be performed only for the utmost and consequential health, a mental health as well as physical health reasons."
1970.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3013.311,3014.417,To dispose of?
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3014.417,3018.996,Not to have the embryo continue to a point of birth up to 20 weeks.
1970.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3018.996,3023.732,"But if you use ordinary language, you mean to dispose of the child?"
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3023.732,3030.24,"To have an abortion which in effect disposes of a fetus, Your Honor."
1970.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3030.24,3032.101,It would have disposed of the child?
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3032.101,3033.18,Your Honor I do not --
1970.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3033.18,3041.949,I'm not saying its wrong but I just don’t care to be cluttered up in a maze of words that means something else?
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3041.949,3046.337,Mr. Justice Black I'm not trying to offer an escape to my answer.
1970.84,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3053.162,3055.882,"No whatever it is, right to dispose of it as she fits?"
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3055.882,3073.088,"Of the fetus, yes Your Honor that is correct and in fact that the more modern American Penal code statutes provide for terminations of pregnancies under therapeutic conditions up to 20 and 24 weeks."
1970.84,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3102.187,3105.662,Mr. Nellis may I interrupt you to ask you this question?
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3105.662,3106.852,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.84,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3106.852,3129.078,"In this evolving, developing stage of medical knowledge on the subject that both of you have alluded to, how would we form any, how would we have any basis to pass on that absent a record of testimony as to what is the present state of medical knowledge on time and the term?"
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3129.078,3131.726,"Your Honor, my answer would be two-fold."
1970.84,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3255.352,3257.196,"Mr. Nellis, may I interrupt you?"
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3257.196,3257.908,Yes Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1970.84,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3257.908,3275.156,You referred to pending cases in Wisconsin and another three-judge cases and indicated that those statutes were undergoing severe strain and had been held unconstitutional for vagueness.
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3280.352,3283.413,Mr. Justice Blackmun in your home state of Minnesota --
1970.84,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3283.413,3284.525,I have this in mind.
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3284.525,3286.959,"Yes sir, I’m sure you did."
1970.84,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3296.425,3298.64,What about the state court there?
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3298.64,3299.179,I beg your pardon sir?
1970.84,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3299.179,3300.413,What about the state court?
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3300.413,3303.502,"Yes, held otherwise as well."
1970.84,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3340.819,3356.705,"Well, my intimation there merely is that that is a case, if it ever comes here, which is fully developed because there has been a trial with testimony, medical and otherwise, in contrast to this one."
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3356.705,3358.035,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.84,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3416.031,3421.788,"Now this certainly goes to your point of, this is a good way to get rid of these statutes, which is what you’re arguing?"
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3421.788,3423.421,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3423.421,3430.143,"Well, Mr. Nellis, how about the ground on which the District Court proceeded, namely vagueness?"
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3474.455,3486.129,"Mr. Justice White, if I may say so, the factual circumstances you put would only be applicable in my judgment to a non-medical practitioner, in other words, “a quack.”"
1970.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3503.2,3508.34,"No, you just -- I’ll just have to pursue you further then."
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3540.981,3542.16,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3551.241,3557.332,"Well, by on the facts I said, he said there is no health reason whatsoever for you not having a child?"
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3557.332,3566.829,"But if you want to restrict me to the fact that you put Mr. Justice White, I would have a difficult time, may I have one fact of my own?"
1970.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3566.829,3567.002,Go ahead.
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3567.002,3580.305,"Oh, not that that the doctor suggests that you can have an abortion just because she wants it, but that she says, “I’ve been married for 10 years and I have four children and we can't afford another child.”"
1970.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3592.176,3594.134,"Strange health argument, isn't it?"
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3594.134,3596.222,"Your Honor, I think it is fair to say --"
1970.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3596.222,3597.431,Based on those facts --
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3597.431,3602.879,"Your Honor, I think it is fair to say and I don’t feel cornered if I may say so sir --"
1970.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3602.879,3606.453,"No, you shouldn’t.[Laughter]"
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3606.453,3618.202,"I think it is fair to say that socioeconomic reasons in modern days apparently approach health reasons, that it takes money to raise children."
1970.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3619.767,3636.105,"Yes, well now you’ll have to deal with the case of the first child, no problems in money whatsoever and the doctor says “It’s going to be a wonderful child, no health reasons whatsoever,” and she says, “Well, by the way I don’t want it.”"
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3636.105,3637.853,And your question is sir?
1970.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3637.853,3639.083,Vagueness?
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3639.083,3639.29,Oh!
1970.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3641.481,3642.951,And that's after --
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3642.951,3644.061,"Oh, certainly."
1970.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3644.061,3645.49,Did he claim he didn’t know --
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3645.49,3660.29,"Your Honor, I think that he could give no reason, he could do the job, although I can’t perceive of any such circumstance occurring, could do the job on the request of the mother."
1970.84,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3676.718,3692.143,"Mr. Nellis, I detected in one of your responses a suggestion that you were contemplating one rule under this statute for reputable doctors, I think you use that term and another for doctors who are not reputable."
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3695.142,3697.628,If I gave that impression Mr. Chief Justice --
1970.84,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3697.628,3698.902,These reputable doctors have declined.
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3698.902,3702.541,"I apologize, that is not what I meant to say."
1970.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3757.107,3774.368,"Well, your argument on vagueness and the court below's judgment or opinion would mean that -- well, it wouldn’t make any difference how the law was drafted in terms of the time of the pregnancy?"
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3774.368,3776.06,I’m sorry.
1970.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3776.06,3787.349,"I mean the law would be as just as vague if they provided that abortions could be performed after three months, but not afterwards."
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3787.349,3789.672,"Yes, provided there were no other criteria."
1970.84,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3789.672,3790.227,Yes.
1970.84,1,32206,joseph_l_nellis,,3790.227,3793.692,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.84,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3900.082,3901.208,Mr. Dorsen.
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3901.208,3903.034,Thank you.
1970.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3970.438,3972.104,What do you mean in the abstract?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,3972.104,3990.642,"Well, it can be interpreted to mean that the doctor is attempting to preserve the life of this particular individual as distinguished from the person’s health at a particular time."
1970.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4030.663,4032.04,You have the brief Mr. Dorsen?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4032.04,4034.006,Yes sir.
1970.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4045.706,4046.575,It’s not a separate brief?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4046.575,4046.822,No.
1970.84,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4245.903,4252.575,"Mr. Dorsen, (Inaudible) all those words regarding malpractice generally?"
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4252.575,4260.893,"No I would say that malpractice which of course an important problem to physicians, perhaps as important to problem as this, raises a different question."
1970.84,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4296.169,4299.863,Professor there is got to be many --
1970.84,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4299.863,4331.552,"It is difficult for me to accept your explanation because and I shouldn’t draw on my own experience, but I’ve seen physician after physician after physicians say the same thing about malpractice that you have just said and I might also say, drawing on my own experience that I have known of many physicians who are not concerned about so sword of damocles in these decision making and who are courageous and make the decisions, they have to do it."
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4341.558,4350.289,That‘s right and I think it applies to doctors who take on the burden of making a medical judgment and be forced to -- in the face of the statute at this kind?
1970.84,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4350.289,4358.257,"What I wanted to do in the contrary to illustration is take, pursue Justice Blackmun’s client."
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4378.13,4379.027,That’s correct.
1970.84,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4379.027,4391.933,"And if he makes the wrong decision as the patient sees it later, the patient dies or is pretty disabled, he risks what has just Blackmun was talking about the malpractice, doesn't he?"
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4391.933,4399.149,"He may do so and I think that is a very fair question Mr. Chief Justice, but I think there is this difference."
1970.84,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4477.381,4479.497,Is that different from the malpractice case?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4479.497,4481.214,The difference is in the standard.
1970.84,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4485.219,4503.505,"You’re speaking of the caution Professor Dorsen, if he wants to be this very cautious practitioner and cautious in the sense of protecting himself and he would simply say it’s too risky to this surgery and then he refrains from doing the surgery."
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4505.918,4519.915,"The difference I think is, the difference I think is, that in the malpractice case there is a well established standard by which the professional judgment of the physician is being evaluated."
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4526.28,4540.387,"Mr. Dorsen, this is one of the standards of the medical profession and with respect to surgeons that surgeons are not to perform operations that are not required but they help the patient?"
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4540.387,4541.62,That’s correct.
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4541.62,4551.72,"And the risk of that if the doctor performs, he must make the judgment at the risk of being suspended if he’s wrong --"
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4551.72,4552.712,Perhaps --
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4552.712,4557.177,-- with respect to the whether the health of the patient requires the operation?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4557.177,4560.513,I don’t think in most cases that will be a realistic.
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4560.513,4565.106,"Well, isn't that a standard though for medical profession with respect to surgeon?"
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4565.106,4566.657,I think it is.
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4576.028,4583.012,"Well, I don’t care whether its gross or not, but the standard is the health of the patient requiring the operation?"
1970.84,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4583.012,4585.944,"Suppose if he does, the real difference is not a criminal offense?"
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4585.944,4586.623,That’s right.
1970.84,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4590.093,4593.504,He can’t get insurance against criminal offenses?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4593.504,4624.499,"I might add, I am not sure our brief covers this fully, but to indicate the difference between the conventional malpractice situation and the very special kind of situation that physicians are faced with here that this past summer, both the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist, as well as the American Public Health Association all voted in favor of having criminal penalties for abortions removed."
1970.84,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4659.289,4666.861,Mr. Dorsen may I interrupt you one more and I hope that neither you nor Mr. Nellies nor Mr. Huntington regard these questions as hostile.
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4721.952,4734.225,"We are making -- they certainly do have significance, and we are making no suggestion, I hope none has read into what even Mr. Nellies or I said regarding the continued applicability of professional standards."
1970.84,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4752.42,4767.731,"But I would suggest that in the abortion area probably, investigation by AHA and AAMA teams is probably more acute than in almost any other area?"
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4767.731,4789.325,A further consequence of statutes of this kind is what seems to be the unfortunate application of the laws concerning abortion in a way which operates differently against the poor from the rich.
1970.84,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4879.373,4882.799,"At any stage, at any stage?"
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4882.799,4887.453,I could myself not taking firm position on that.
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4901.448,4908.104,(Inaudible) do you think it is not necessary to go through --
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4908.104,4910.601,"Pardon, I didn't --"
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4910.601,4917.329,Do you think it is not necessary to go so far as -- insofar as it (Inaudible)
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4917.329,4925.329,As far as vagueness is concerned but not in the terms of ultimate question of whether or not a woman is entitled to abortion at every point up to birth.
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4939.256,4944.605,So somewhat of a different problems occurs so that fundamental right of the women not to bear a child?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4944.605,4949.346,Now that is a question I would not have an answer to in this particular case.
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4949.346,4950.705,It is difficult?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4950.705,4951.33,Yes it is.
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4951.33,4953.435,To draw any distinction?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4953.435,4971.6,"It is and we are making the claim as spelled out at some length in our brief, that certainly up to the traditional lines of 20, 22, 24 weeks that is a right of a woman to have an abortion."
1970.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4971.6,4973.155,You mean a constitutional right?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4973.155,4976.419,That's correct sir.
1970.84,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4977.551,4979.872,Under which provisions of the constitution?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4979.872,4985.617,Well I would rely on the liberty of the women in the Federal case of the Fifth Amendment.
1970.84,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4985.617,4995.324,"Well the liberty of what, not to be deprived of life, of property, or liberty without due process of law?"
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4995.324,4996.031,That is correct.
1970.84,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4996.031,4998.501,It's not unrestrained absolute liberty --
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,4998.501,4999.244,That is correct.
1970.84,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4999.244,5001.68,It's liberty that cannot be taken away without due process of law.
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5001.68,5020.091,"That is correct and if our position more explicitly Mr. Justice Stewart, is that if there is -- if there were a compelling state interest, which the state could come forward with to justify a restriction on this fundamental right, you might have a different case."
1970.84,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5020.091,5023.254,I don't understand what the right derived under the constitution?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5023.254,5048.811,"Well, the right comes from the liberty of the individual or for example, cases like Skinner in Oklahoma, specifically talked about the right to bear a child, Meyer in Nebraska discusses that, then of course there are other privacy cases, the Griswold case which at great length in three opinions on prevailing side, discuss of the right of privacy."
1970.84,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5055.795,5059.237,What this really have to do with the right of privacy?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5059.237,5060.856,Well I would suggest that --
1970.84,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5060.856,5062.232,There is any constitutional right to woman?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5062.232,5085.203,"I would suggest that if a woman wishes to have to use of her body in a way which would mean disposing up the embryo that, that is a choice that she can make, and that the doctor in the exercise of his professional judgment can make upon her request without the intervention of the criminal law."
1970.84,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5085.203,5090.498,"It's not then the right of mother, or to be a mother or not to be mother?"
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5090.498,5102.044,"Well, it's certainly related to that, but if in the more narrow sense, it's the use of the woman's body, which she has the domain over and which this court should protect."
1970.84,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5102.044,5107.952,You give any status there or a posture to right of the father?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5107.952,5116.496,I've given a great deal of thought to that and I reluctantly come to the conclusion that it's the women’s right and not the father's right.
1970.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5126.952,5129.988,Either the way that you're also saying --
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5129.988,5130.437,Yes.
1970.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5130.437,5134.021,-- that she can delegate that right to a doctor?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5134.021,5135.276,Yes.
1970.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5135.276,5139.331,A constitutional right that she can delegate?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5139.331,5143.23,"I would myself not use the word delegate, she could consult the physician."
1970.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5143.23,5147.086,That's what we wouldn't do.
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5155.363,5160.615,I would not permit the doctor to make that judgment against the woman’s will.
1970.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5164.507,5167.457,She can convey the right on him?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5167.457,5168.133,"Yes, yes."
1970.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5168.133,5168.879,Constitutional right?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5168.879,5170.409,Yes.
1970.84,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5170.409,5187.098,"Mr. Dorsen, does your argument about her right to do with her body what you have suggested, have as it's ultimate conclusion, the right to commit suicide?"
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5187.098,5189.185,"I'm not sure, I'm not sure."
1970.84,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5192.421,5200.429,So that the next step is a challenge to the statute which makes suicide --
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5200.429,5202.086,There may well be such a statute.
1970.84,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5220.796,5233.736,"Well, it just seems to me your argument has this logical conclusion that if she can do this with the fetus, can she come in to the doctor and say saw off my right arm because I want it off and saw that off."
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5235.957,5252.704,"Well, I think if the doctor is exercising medical judgment, if there is a disease situation, if there is a situation where he would feel that he should do it, I then would say that she could do so in unrestrained way."
1970.84,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5252.704,5263.002,"But previously you have suggested that there need be no diseased condition, no other factor except the direction of the woman to authorize the abortion?"
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5263.002,5264.296,"Well, that is correct."
1970.84,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5264.296,5271.195,Then why should it be different on amputating the arm?
1970.84,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5273.43,5274.594,Just doesn't want the arm.
1970.84,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5274.594,5278.338,She just wants to mutilate herself and she wants to do it in a safe sort of way?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5278.338,5282.689,"Well, I do have problems with that, I do have problems with that."
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5282.689,5285.864,Why do you have problems with that Mr. Dorsen if you're not take the position?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5285.864,5298.103,"Well, I take the position because the abortion is a well recognized medical operation and that the operation without any indication at all perhaps traces out the question."
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5298.865,5310.379,"Then I am talking -- if you have the trouble with the arm, I think you would have trouble with the abortion, especially and a fortiori if you recall -- and you even thought that the unborn child had some rights?"
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5310.379,5311.771,I don't think that this court --
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5311.771,5313.603,Certainly an arm doesn't?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5313.603,5314.856,That's right.
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5366.705,5368.425,You mean that there isn't life?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5368.425,5369.726,That's correct.
1970.84,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5417.1,5420.259,It shouldn't be determined on medical branch (ph)?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5420.259,5422.442,It should be determined on the medical branch (ph).
1970.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5422.442,5426.044,I see your brief relying on Griswold against Connecticut?
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5426.044,5428.64,"Yes Mr. Justice, among other cases, it does."
1970.84,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5428.64,5432.818,But I notice that it doesn't have any page; that says passage.
1970.84,2,37075,norman_dorsen,,5434.281,5445.746,"No I've been prepared, but -- I suppose it's because it's cited frequently in the brief almost every page, but I would like to go back in concluding."
1970.84,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5475.742,5478.053,Thank you professor Dorsen.
1970.84,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,5487.524,5497.837,At first I’d like to refer to the question of Mr. Justice Blackmun at the end of my argument that the question of rubella.
1970.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5580.801,5587.623,"Isn't that necessary, under the (Inaudible) statutes, is that a necessary construction?"
1970.84,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,5587.623,5593.164,I believe it is a possible construction and the logical construction which we are offering --
1970.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5593.164,5595.696,But is it necessary for health?
1970.84,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,5595.696,5597.077,Necessary for health.
1970.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5597.077,5601.384,And the juror is not capable of determining that from evidence?
1970.84,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,5601.384,5616.579,"Well, we believe that a reasonable interpretation is that the word health is a medical test, in that if a doctor concludes in good faith that health grounds exist that that should be the end."
1970.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5618.261,5628.288,It's rather an unusual criminal act to let the man charged with the crime to determine whether in good faith that crime ought to be performed?
1970.84,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,5628.288,5635.0,"Well, we don’t believe it would be a crime, provided that he exercises the judgment."
1970.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5689.057,5691.771,And good faith?
1970.84,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,5691.771,5696.749,On demand without making a determination in each instance that health grounds exist.
1970.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5696.749,5702.108,"On any chance that you have leave if he thought it was was in good faith, usually."
1970.84,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,5702.108,5705.98,"If he thinks that it’s in good faith, then he is protected."
1970.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5732.013,5733.315,Who determine it?
1970.84,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,5733.315,5739.428,"The psychiatrist or the doctor, those in medical tests and we believe that their judgment on that issue should be protected."
1970.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5739.428,5748.533,It seems to me that when you concede that I guess I -- you have always conceded as the too ambiguous to be administered.
1970.84,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,5748.533,5754.793,"No, we believe that it can be administered against those who do not -- for against people --"
1970.84,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5754.793,5759.487,"I can – how can they prove it, he said its in good faith and not judge to them out --"
1970.84,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,5759.487,5775.643,"I think if a physician said it was in good faith and it was shown by the Government that at every single case where a woman requested an abortion, he performed it that that would place an issue his good faith in meeting the grounds of the statute."
1970.84,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5775.643,5775.909,But you don’t --
1970.84,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5775.909,5780.714,For all you research have you found any instance where the doctor was acquitted?
1970.84,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,5780.714,5781.858,A doctor was acquitted?
1970.84,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5781.858,5783.95,Yes sir.
1970.84,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,5783.95,5786.509,"No, I’m afraid I’ve haven’t determined."
1970.84,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5793.514,5803.789,"When you speak of good faith you link that up with medical judgment, do you not, a medical judgment made in good faith, not good faith in the abstract?"
1970.84,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,5803.789,5807.109,"Yes, a medical judgment made in good faith."
1970.84,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5807.345,5808.859,Very well.
