1982.81-2125,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.262,We'll hear arguments next in Bell against New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,72.656,76.341,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-2125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,270.385,273.899,At least with respect to Pennsylvania the sum was substantially cut down?
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,273.899,274.866,"Oh, yes."
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,360.097,363.816,"Mr. Geller, before you get into your argument, could you help me on one thing?"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,372.31,375.858,It was an order essentially defining the amount that was due to be paid.
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,375.858,377.808,Because they end us saying this is how much should be paid.
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,377.808,378.214,Yes.
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,398.066,402.535,"There really isn't any order outstanding requiring anybody to pay anybody else any money, is there?"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,402.535,407.952,"Well, there is an order requiring New Jersey and Pennsylvania to pay, but the Secretary hasn't yet--"
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,407.952,409.703,"Well, I thought you said it did not require them to pay."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,409.703,411.11,"--Well, it sets the amount and obviously--"
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,411.11,412.062,"It sets the amount, right."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,412.062,418.386,"--It sets the amount and obviously the Secretary would be most delighted if the states would pay that full amount, but--"
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,418.386,422.933,"Well, what happens if they just say, well, that is very nice, we owe you that money, but--"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,422.933,440.738,"--Well, I think that the Secretary would have the authority under the Federal Claims Collection Act either to use administrative offset, if that would be feasible, and we submit that it would be feasible under Title I, or to bring an action in District Court for suit on the prior judgment to recover that amount of money."
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,440.738,443.971,"--But, neither of those actions is before us now, is that correct?"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,443.971,444.486,That is correct.
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,449.419,455.903,And surely the Secretary could terminate the state's participation in the program I suppose?
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,455.903,458.543,"Well, it is not so clear under the statute."
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,469.209,473.412,Part of its duty though is to repay and it refuses to repay.
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,473.412,477.409,"Well, whether in theory that is a possibility--"
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,477.409,485.563,"What if the state just says, well, if this is the way you are going to interpret the statute and our agreement, we just want to quit."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,486.577,487.326,--The states can--
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,487.326,489.794,And then the Secretary would have to sue.
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,489.794,493.983,--Would have to sue because there would be no offset possible presumably in that situation.
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,493.983,520.362,I take it your position is that whether or not... whether or not the states' position is arguable in the sense that arguably and reasonably it might have believed it was not violating the statute; that you have the right to recoup if you decide retrospectively that is what the contract means or that statute means.
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,520.362,520.877,"Well, yes."
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,543.615,547.632,Is this the kind of program where the state initially submits a plan and it is approved?
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,547.632,554.861,It submits an application simply saying that it will abide by the assurances... It will abide by the conditions in the statute and regulations.
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,557.377,571.029,"Another thing, would you think that, to put it crudely, would any fool have known that the state was not in compliance or is it a close case?"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,572.542,578.446,"Well, in this case particularly I don't think there are any gray areas as to the states' non-compliance."
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,580.118,582.492,"So, you say the states should have known."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,582.492,584.364,"--Well, there are two separate questions here."
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.074,617.667,"Well, what if it just so happened that a majority of the Court thought that if the state should have known why then it should pay the money back?"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,629.848,638.362,That issue is not... The substantive issue of whether the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania violated the statute is not before the Court.
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.892,639.75,--I understand that.
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,645.061,645.856,--That is correct.
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,694.713,705.394,"If I understand what you are arguing now, you wouldn't take it in this then if the Court... Suppose we held for you in this case--"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,705.394,705.862,Yes.
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.862,716.777,--what if we reserved the question... What if we said this is the kind of a case where the state knew or should have known that it was violating the statute and they admitted they violated the statute?
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,716.777,718.045,They have admitted they have violated it here.
1982.81-2125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,728.179,742.798,"Well, is it any part of your position that the state would have a defense to repayment of the money if, in fact, they were found to have violated the statute but neither knew or should have known that they did?"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,744.876,765.1,"No, there certainly is no intent element, but there is an element of discretion on the part of the Secretary in determining whether to pursue his recoupment remedy and there have been instances, including one that is cited in the Education Appeal Board's decision in this case, in which a state may have relied on certain program directives of the Secretary in doing certain thing."
1982.81-2125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,771.506,775.316,Do you think the Secretary's discretion in that regard is reviewable by the courts?
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,775.316,784.328,--I would think that the Secretary's discretion to recoup would be reviewable like any other administrative decision on an arbitrary or carpricious basis.
1982.81-2125,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,796.542,821.283,"Is there anything, Mr. Geller, to prevent the states when it approaches some project involving expenditure of these funds and they think they might be in the gray zone, is there anything to prevent them from submitting the question to the secretary in charge of the grants and saying, may we spend the money for this project or this program?"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,821.283,823.202,"No, there certainly is nothing and that is to be encouraged."
1982.81-2125,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,854.937,857.982,"Well, Mr. Geller, it is a little hard to understand."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,871.151,876.992,"Well, we are here... I think there is some confusion on the part of one of the states at least as to what its concession is."
1982.81-2125,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,880.584,881.395,New Jersey does.
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,881.395,886.534,"--Well, New Jersey has in its brief a very peculiar suggestion as to what setoff is."
1982.81-2125,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,971.36,973.673,"Thank you, that helps clarify it."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,987.711,997.756,"We have argued that Section 414, which provides the audit authority, and Section 415, which is the section to which you have just referred, together do provide explicit authority."
1982.81-2125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1013.28,1035.616,"Mr. Geller, in analyzing New Jersey's setoff position a little further, what if the Secretary followed your advice and said we are going to give New Jersey $990,000 this year on the condition that New Jersey puts up $10,000 of its own and New Jersey says, no, we won't put up $10,000 of our own."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1037.067,1039.052,"Well, first of all, let me say the situation never come to that."
1982.81-2125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1039.052,1039.66,"Well, but--"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1039.66,1041.754,"I understand, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-2125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1065.244,1066.477,--To recover on what judgment?
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1066.477,1073.192,--The judgment of the Education Appeals Board which presumably would have been an appeal to a court of appeals and affirmed such as in this case.
1982.81-2125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1073.192,1078.659,"Well, do you think that is something that simply can be filed in a district court or registered and sued on like a judgment on other states?"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1078.659,1079.346,"Yes, I think it can."
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1097.779,1112.959,"Mr. Geller, I still am not clear in my mind why the Secretary couldn't do exactly what you suggested in answer to Justice O'Connor, namely, say you want to stay in the program we are sure and you are just going to have to pay $1 million to get $990,000."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1118.863,1120.22,I would assume that it would never come to that.
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.3,1123.032,"Well, why doesn't that answer the whole lawsuit?"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1129.357,1137.074,"Yes, but the Third Circuit found that prior to 1978 we had no right to do that and that is why this case is here and why this case is of tremendous importance."
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.074,1142.306,"--And, Judge Higginbotham in dissent, as I understood him, said, well, that issue really isn't presented because you haven't tried it yet."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1145.367,1149.24,I think that the Third Circuit misunderstood what the Secretary was trying to do.
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.24,1151.599,I think they misread the Secretary's orders.
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1156.598,1165.451,"Well, I think... The Third Circuit said that the Secretary could not use his common law recoupment authority in this class of case for two reasons."
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1165.451,1168.516,"But, why isn't all that dicta as Judge Higginbotham said?"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1168.516,1176.743,I think it is not dicta because Judge Higginbotham assumed that the Secretary was not proceeding under his common law recoupment authority.
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1176.743,1178.058,And they clearly weren't.
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1180.276,1182.538,"I believe they were, Justice Stevens."
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1187.77,1189.833,--He didn't enter an order requiring any payment.
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1189.833,1211.746,"Well, that is because the Federal Claims Collection Act requires the Secretary to consider a number of options in determining how to recovery the money and that was the question that the Secretary hadn't yet decided... Hadn't yet had to reach because the states had not yet said that they were not going to pay the money if, after they had had their administrative proceedings, it was found that they owed it."
1982.81-2125,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1211.746,1219.9,"Mr. Geller, isn't this like collecting on an I.O.U. which I always thought you couldn't collect on?"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1219.9,1223.895,It is more than an I.O.U. I think it is like collecting on a contract that has been breached.
1982.81-2125,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1223.895,1230.724,"I thought that the only ruling was was that you owe this money, not that you must pay it."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1230.724,1232.159,"No, I think the Secretary--"
1982.81-2125,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1232.159,1232.611,Am I wrong?
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1232.611,1236.207,--The Secretary's administrative ruling obviously was a ruling that this money had to be paid.
1982.81-2125,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1253.104,1254.917,That to me is an I.O.U.--
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1254.917,1273.284,"I am not certain, Justice Marshall, what you mean by an I.O.U. There has been an administrative determination here after full evidentiary proceedings that the money was owed and what the states have done is taken an appeal of that administrative ruling to the Court of Appeals under the statutory procedure that Congress set up in 1978."
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1292.902,1300.366,"--Mr. Geller, the order that the Secretary entered was that New Jersey should make the following payments and lists dollar amounts."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1310.816,1315.956,"I understand that, Justice Stevens, but there had been a final administrative ruling that the amounts were owed and--"
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1315.956,1317.188,"That the amounts were owed, right."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1317.188,1322.125,"--And that is what we are reviewing here, whether, in fact, the Secretary had any power to order these states--"
1982.81-2125,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.125,1323.373,To decide how much was owed.
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1327.448,1339.287,"--Well, as an audit matter, but certainly not as a matter of power to order a recoupment of that amount of money and that is what is before the Court at the moment."
1982.81-2125,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1339.287,1353.797,"Well, Mr. Geller, the Court of Appeals' opinion certainly can be interpreted as holding that it permits that offset against perspective grants is permissible under Section 415."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1357.594,1358.203,Yes.
1982.81-2125,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1366.263,1372.573,"I said that direct recoupment was impermissible, but it indicated that the offset would be all right."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1372.573,1375.681,"--No, I believe not, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-2125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1394.391,1399.639,What is the difference between direct recoupment and offset as it has been used by the various parties to these conversations?
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1399.639,1403.309,"Well, I think... There are really two questions here and they are separate."
1982.81-2125,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1436.7,1439.683,What is the difference between offset and recoupment?
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1439.683,1443.884,I think offset is just one manner of achieving a recoupment.
1982.81-2125,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1500.364,1514.027,"Suppose a state has received all of the money, has it in hand, has spent it and has misspent some of it and then informs the Secretary that they want to withdraw from the program."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1517.026,1524.053,"Well, at that point, offset would not be available because no future funds would be going to the state under the program."
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1693.342,1700.435,"Mr. Geller, does the Secretary audit every single program?"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1700.435,1702.713,The Secretary audits every state.
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.713,1703.465,Every year?
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1703.465,1704.713,Every three years.
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.713,1705.868,Every three years.
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1705.868,1706.573,Every three years.
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1706.573,1715.086,So that a state may not even know that it is in violation until there is an audit which may be three years?
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1715.086,1723.283,That may well be although the provisions of the statute and regulations are not as obscure as the respondents would have the Court believe.
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.283,1724.878,I understand in this case--
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1724.878,1725.471,Yes.
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1725.471,1729.733,--But what if they really were obscure?
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1729.733,1731.64,"I don't... Well, let me say this."
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1734.046,1737.122,"And, I don't suppose every auditor has the same view as another auditor."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1737.122,1758.004,"--I understand that Justice White, but it is important to understand, especially in light of the submission respondents have made to this Court, that there really are very, very few requirements, important requirements, imposed on the states by Title I in the statute and regulations and even as to those requirements, there are very few that the auditors are concerned about and the violation of which would lead to a recoupment."
1982.81-2125,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1869.693,1880.235,"Mr. Geller, I do have one more inquiry, if I may, because I still don't understand what it was that CA-3 was talking about."
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1906.458,1906.879,Yes.
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.203,1961.657,"Mr. Geller, suppose the Third Circuit had said that you could recoup by offset?"
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1963.079,1964.546,--It depends what they mean by recoup.
1982.81-2125,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.295,1975.261,Suppose they had held that you could recoup by offsetting these misspent funds against future funds?
1982.81-2125,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1975.261,1985.333,As long as the offset is what New Jersey takes the offset to mean which is simply to reduce the amount of Title I funding in the future but not requiring the states to make up the difference.
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,1993.862,1996.393,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-2125,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2030.611,2038.921,"Well, isn't a state, when it receives a grant from the federal government under an explicit statute bound to know the law?"
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2038.921,2041.732,"Your Honor, we agree with that."
1982.81-2125,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2127.027,2131.386,"You wouldn't regard half a million dollars as petty, would you, despite--"
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2131.386,2133.04,"The amounts are not petty, Your Honor."
1982.81-2125,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2139.723,2140.928,"--It still is not petty though, is it?"
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2140.928,2150.298,"But, the disputes themselves can result in petty bickering which divides us on the question of interpretation and makes administration of the program extremely difficult."
1982.81-2125,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2261.251,2262.736,Are these details before us?
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2262.736,2276.042,"Your Honor, I wish to give you this characterization of our case in order to refute some of the challenges that have been made and some of the language that has been used, that we have converted funds, that we have squandered money, because this is certainly not the case."
1982.81-2125,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2277.243,2278.479,Do you have to worry us with that?
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2278.479,2281.041,--I will go on with my next point.
1982.81-2125,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2281.041,2287.007,Did you take the position you are now taking before the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit?
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2287.007,2288.864,"We took the same position, Your Honor."
1982.81-2125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2314.978,2324.521,"Ms. Hunting, what in your view should the federal government do if the procedures had been fair... I know you disagree... and if you really had misspent money and clearly misspent the money?"
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2327.255,2331.614,"Your Honor, I think the remedy is contained in the statute for the way the federal government should handle that kind of case."
1982.81-2125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.614,2332.831,"--And, what should it do?"
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2332.831,2337.798,It should follow the statutory penalties of withholding or application disapproval.
1982.81-2125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.452,2351.763,"Do you think it is a proper remedy to say you spend a million dollars and we will give you $950,000 or whatever, you know, just give you the amount less that they claim you have misspent?"
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2352.917,2363.554,"No, Your Honor, and it is particularly improper because they want to couple that with... that power to offset with an order that the state make up the difference and that the--"
1982.81-2125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2363.554,2364.849,"Well, I still am not clear then."
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2376.532,2377.437,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-2125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.236,2379.796,So the facts are really irrelevant then?
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2379.796,2384.078,"--Well, I don't believe they are irrelevant because in this case it is a case of good faith."
1982.81-2125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2384.078,2388.106,"If it is a matter of law, you win no matter what the facts are under your argument?"
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2388.106,2393.851,"Under our argument, we would win no matter what the facts are, Your Honor, because there was no assignment of liability in that statute."
1982.81-2125,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2436.866,2440.988,You have left me somewhat confused as to the obligations of the state.
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2477.476,2483.364,"Your Honor, the state... We would dispute that the state's treasury was responsible for that misexpenditure."
1982.81-2125,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2492.219,2496.091,"How about just withholding the next grant, from the next grant that they receive?"
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2496.091,2503.605,"Well, if the program continued to be misadministered, then they could withhold from the next grant."
1982.81-2125,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2526.235,2544.04,"Ms. Hunting, before you get to another point, how is it that you think that Section 415 couple with the Claims Collection Act provided no remedy for the federal government before 1978?"
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2544.04,2545.744,Section 415 is the--
1982.81-2125,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2545.744,2549.351,Of the General Education Provisions Act.
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2549.351,2550.867,--That is the payment provision of the--
1982.81-2125,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2550.867,2564.329,It expressly allows adjustments for overpayments and that coupled with the Claims Collection Act would appear to have provided some pre-1978 remedies.
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2564.329,2583.385,"--We have to agree with the Third Circuit and with Mr. Geller's position on that, that that relates to overpayments, meaning accidental payments to the states that were in excess of what the state was entitled to or perhaps a situation where a program did not need to expend all of its funds for some reason, a teacher didn't show up or something."
1982.81-2125,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2588.771,2595.397,Do you think there is anything in the legislative history to put that kind of a gloss on it?
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2595.397,2602.236,The Third Circuit noticed that there was some confusion in the legislative history on this point as to exactly what legislative history attached to that.
1982.81-2125,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2610.901,2612.2,"Well, is there any reason why it shouldn't?"
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2620.526,2632.972,"--Your Honor, I think that provision, as the Third Circuit noted, is talking in terms of adjustments of grants in a bookkeeping kind of situation like that."
1982.81-2125,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2654.338,2665.536,"If there was an invasion as you call it that way, wasn't there an invasion by the state into the pockets of the federal taxpayers?"
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2665.536,2700.602,"Your Honor, initially I want to point out that this case is not a case of willful disregard of the regulations; that this case is a case where we attempted at all times to put on a good program and I do not believe that it is a... I believe that Congress has the right to decide and its decision should be given authority that when it assigns liability for a program, and in this case it did not assign liability to the state, that that decision should be put in effect."
1982.81-2125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2874.796,2879.464,"Ms. Hunting, may I ask you a question about your understanding of exactly what is before us?"
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2904.643,2911.155,It looks... The document that we received is a letter that compels... It states the amount that is owed.
1982.81-2125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2915.311,2916.981,"It does assess interest, does it?"
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2916.981,2917.495,Yes.
1982.81-2125,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2917.495,2919.293,I see.
1982.81-2125,1,35966,margaret_hunting,,2919.293,2934.599,"So, in conclusion, I would like to make just three basic points; that when a state accepts a grant, it is entitled to rely upon the statute in effect at the time it accepts the grant to determine its liability and to determine the extent of its liabilities."
1982.81-2125,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2941.767,2942.488,Very well.
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,2952.154,2954.669,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-2125,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3044.974,3051.221,"Mr. Cole, are the letters enclosing the orders and which the letters said we expect you to pay interest, are they in the record?"
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3051.221,3052.91,"--I believe they are, Justice."
1982.81-2125,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3053.846,3055.332,Because the orders themselves don't say that.
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3055.332,3060.452,The orders themselves... you are quite right... say their determination is New Jersey should pay.
1982.81-2125,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3060.452,3061.204,"Should pay so much, yes."
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3061.204,3066.325,"But, the letters that accompany them... And I think we may have quoted from the letters in our brief."
1982.81-2125,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3085.162,3097.641,Do you think the state... the federal government could refuse to honor any future grants until the debt was satisfied?
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3097.641,3104.497,"I think you would strain the language of the statute as it existed in 1978, Chief Justice."
1982.81-2125,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3121.974,3124.193,Just correct it for the future and not worry about the past?
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3124.193,3125.725,--That is correct.
1982.81-2125,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3168.94,3181.844,Do you think it would make any difference whether you were dealing with a yacht case or misapplying funds from one program to some other perfectly legitimate program of the state?
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3184.936,3187.089,Not for the purposes of our argument.
1982.81-2125,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3219.809,3232.896,"Would it be... In your view, it would require an affirmative, explicit statute to create that and that common law or debtor/creditor standards would not apply, is that it?"
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3232.896,3251.732,"That is correct, Chief Justice, because we are dealing in a grant area and we are dealing with a principle, if not directly on point, at least sufficiently analogous to the principle this Court adopted in the Pennhurst decision, that the conditions... We are dealing in an area that makes it like a contract."
1982.81-2125,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3302.931,3303.742,Mr. Cole?
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3303.742,3304.569,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-2125,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3304.569,3310.223,It strikes me that your analogy to the Pennhurst situation is by no means a complete one.
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3333.621,3334.713,You are quite right.
1982.81-2125,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3339.305,3340.506,Not identical.
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3340.506,3344.788,"It is not directly on point, because you are talking about imposition of an affirmative obligation."
1982.81-2125,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3355.645,3378.195,"Well, if the focus is on what would the state expect in getting into this thing, don't you think it is far more likely that most people, if they accept a million dollars on certain conditions, that they do a particular thing with that million dollars, would expect to be held to it, then if they accept a million dollars and one of the conditions that they put in another $5 million of their own, but the condition is somewhat vague?"
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3378.195,3396.453,"The answer to your question is I don't think that is clear, Justice, because this allocation of risk to the states, either by way of liability of a private action as the Court addressed in Rosado or in liability in order determination."
1982.81-2125,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3399.887,3409.399,"But, you say allocation of risk as if this were kind of a joint venture and each... you participated in the employment of someone who made off with some funds."
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3423.94,3434.859,"If I may, Justice Rehnquist, here is where I think you should understand what is involved in the New Jersey case and why we are talking about it in terms of risk."
1982.81-2125,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3546.181,3547.837,Do we have to decide that?
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3547.837,3551.99,"--No, you don't, Justice, but what I am pointing out--"
1982.81-2125,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3551.99,3555.004,I think there is something we do have to decide.
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3571.078,3583.168,"--Justice Marshall, our position on that is that the federal government made the choice initially that there should be no recoupment in the sense--"
1982.81-2125,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3583.168,3589.429,Do you mean the federal government gave New Jersey the money to do with as they pleased?
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3589.429,3594.678,"--Without exposing the New Jersey treasury to risk, yes, that is our position."
1982.81-2125,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3594.678,3598.394,That is your view of the pre-1978 matter?
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3598.394,3599.661,"That is correct, Chief Justice."
1982.81-2125,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3599.661,3614.219,"So, in your view, must this Court now decide whether you are right about that 1978 amendment and the legal rights of the two parties prior to 1978?"
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3614.219,3626.118,"If the federal government is not pursuing a course of action that would affirmatively impose obligations on the state treasury, the answer is no."
1982.81-2125,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3636.817,3638.895,I don't think the federal government is going after the state treasury.
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3643.906,3648.031,"With respect, Justice Marshall, that would be true if we had that money."
1982.81-2125,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3697.466,3708.79,"Well, we don't need to reach that question if we were to find that the statutory authority before 1978 authorized some kind of recovery, do we?"
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3708.79,3710.459,"No, you do not, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-2125,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3710.459,3726.798,"And, I guess the main thrust of the Court of Appeals' reason for not finding the pre-1978 authority was its view that if it had existed the 1978 legislation would not have been necessary."
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3726.798,3728.108,That is correct.
1982.81-2125,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3738.232,3750.367,"And, perhaps that argument isn't correct either if there is a difference between offset and outright recovery in some other fashion."
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3750.367,3766.685,"That is true, but from our standpoint, we take the view that the Third Circuit probably concluded that there were no affirmative funding obligations on the state prior to 1978."
1982.81-2125,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3879.218,3881.623,"May I ask you just one more question, Mr. Cole?"
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3881.623,3882.435,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1982.81-2125,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3882.435,3894.727,"Would you agree that if, as a condition of future grants by the federal government, they said we are not going to give you any more money unless you first repay the amount that was determined to be misspent under this audit, would they have that power?"
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3894.727,3896.446,Not prior to 1978.
1982.81-2125,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3898.291,3903.504,They couldn't even say we will eliminate you from future programs unless you repay?
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3903.504,3908.566,I don't think the withholding or suspension... I think that would be an abuse of that provision.
1982.81-2125,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3919.22,3924.249,But then could they subtract from the reimbursement under such a program the amount that they found due under this audit?
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3924.249,3930.215,"Well, the position that we took in our brief is that they have some offset authority."
1982.81-2125,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3930.215,3932.539,"The answer is yes, they could do that?"
1982.81-2125,2,35571,michael_r_cole,,3932.539,3935.242,"Under that position, yes."
