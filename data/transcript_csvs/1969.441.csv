1969.441,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.897,"Number 441, Toussie against the United States."
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,19.847,24.256,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.441,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,55.766,67.635,"Now Mr. Gurfein, when you say he failed to register for reasons of conscience, he did not make any record or take any step or did he at that time to record that fact?"
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,67.635,75.307,"He took no steps but if I may, Your Honor in connection with my argument on the First Amendment, I shall try to expand that a little further."
1969.441,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,83.697,84.751,Very well.
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,84.751,119.102,The first statement I want to make on that is that I will not get involve at this time in the reasons why the record indicates that there was a sincerity of belief on the part of the petitioner that he could not take part in the registration process itself because his was a pristine religious view that the registration process itself was merely an extension of the war making in which he was against.
1969.441,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,358.854,362.407,Are you raising a constitutional question on that fact?
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,362.407,365.481,"In this face, I'm not raising a constitutional question, Your Honor, except --"
1969.441,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,365.481,366.445,The questions.
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,366.445,367.038,"I beg your pardon, Justice Black?"
1969.441,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,367.038,372.511,Are you raising any question about the government’s policy to have different statute of limitation?
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,372.511,372.966,No.
1969.441,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,399.443,404.422,"And your 13 years is, you get by adding five years after his 26th birthday?"
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,404.422,405.57,That is correct.
1969.441,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,568.728,574.899,What would be the impact of that regulation if you omitted the word immediately in your view?
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,574.899,581.746,"Well, I think immediately if just to gloss and I can’t read the mind of Congress not of the drafters of the regulation, Mr. the Chief Justice."
1969.441,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,581.746,584.564,But suppose we took it out now.
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,587.399,593.359,"Well, I think the purpose of it is not to catch willful offender to violate the law that beyond the pale."
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,781.863,796.549,"What do you say Mr. Gurfein, if the Court of Appeals view that these whole things are to be determined on the basis of the statute itself applies only between age of 18 and 26."
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,798.479,799.723,Cannot do more.
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,799.723,802.645,"Well, it can’t do anymore but at least it goes five years."
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,811.999,812.705,Late year and yet on --
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,812.705,815.219,But in fact as to this fellow’s brother --
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,815.219,815.84,That’s right.
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,815.84,817.765,-- dismissed an indictment that rather be --
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,817.765,819.483,Judge (Inaudible) did.
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,832.073,832.401,I appreciate that --
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,832.401,833.833,And we say they’re both wrong.
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,833.833,848.109,"No, but I was interested in your answer to the what the Court of Appeals said and saying, now you have to read this really as -- since the statute applies only between ages 18 and 26."
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,854.208,855.166,Correct.
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,855.166,856.526,-- is age 26.
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,860.387,860.473,Rational.
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,860.473,862.799,-- as I understand the gist of the view of the Court of Appeals.
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,862.799,863.083,Correct.
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,863.083,865.519,"And that is what I am addressing myself to now, Your Honor."
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,865.519,865.634,Oh!
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,866.786,869.779,"No, it’s right on line with my thinking if I may suggest."
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,869.779,871.171,Yes.
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,871.171,880.394,"When you have a continuing duty statute, that does not mean that you have a continuing offense by legislative enactment."
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,980.478,987.605,"Well, you don’t think Mr. Gurfein that the statute being applicable from ages 18 to 26?"
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,992.848,993.543,Oh!
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,999.763,1000.272,Well I know.
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1012.585,1023.354,"Because under normal rules of statute of limitations and of continuous offenses, I believe the rule is and should be that once the crime is completed."
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1023.354,1024.479,Well when is that completed?
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1028.56,1029.55,I’ll put it to you this way.
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1056.725,1059.356,"Well, this then is an argument Mr. Gurfein that the --"
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1059.356,1060.003,I beg your pardon?
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1060.003,1068.428,"This is -- your argument then is that the crime for purposes of the statute of limitation, it was completed on his 18th birthday when he failed that day to register."
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1068.428,1068.656,That’s correct.
1969.441,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1068.656,1069.119,Five days.
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1070.166,1070.835,In five days.
1969.441,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1070.835,1071.912,"Right, whatever that is."
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1074.343,1075.56,That’s the statutory obligation.
1969.441,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1076.815,1078.248,Or you’re guilty of an offense?
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1078.248,1078.434,Yes.
1969.441,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1078.434,1079.939,"On the sixth day, you’re guilty of an offense."
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1079.939,1085.35,"And I can’t defend myself by saying no, I have seven more years or five years, I’m through."
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1092.914,1102.793,"So you would say I gather that when he came -- he'd be 23, he could not be prosecuted?"
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1102.793,1104.86,I would say that when he became to be 23 he could not.
1969.441,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1104.86,1107.878,And further more he had no duty to register between 23 and 25.
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1107.878,1111.747,"No, I say he may have a duty to register but that doesn’t have to be a criminal sanction."
1969.441,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1159.132,1165.748,"Mr. Gurfein, are there any analogies with respect to registration of securities that shed any light on this?"
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1165.748,1167.315,"None that I know of, Your Honor."
1969.441,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1188.732,1200.81,Is it not exactly parallel in terms of a government’s resources to go out and find the people who are directed by statute to register?
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1200.81,1202.265,You mean that it in fact everything?
1969.441,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1202.265,1203.556,The difficulty of a system?
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1203.556,1203.689,Oh!
1969.441,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1232.006,1240.168,"But there you have in as in most statutes of limitation, you have a problem of the handicaps of defense after a long lapse of time."
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1241.928,1242.828,That is true.
1969.441,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1242.828,1245.298,This is a mathematical equation you’re dealing with here.
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1245.298,1246.125,That is true.
1969.441,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1387.772,1388.775,"Mr. Gurfein, now that --"
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1388.775,1388.878,"Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall?"
1969.441,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1388.878,1398.561,"Now, that it’s particularly involved in this case but suppose they just ask, let me see your draft card, what will happen?"
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1398.561,1398.913,Who asked them?
1969.441,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1409.352,1409.714,"No, no."
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1411.78,1412.571,Yes.
1969.441,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1412.571,1421.902,"And for some reason asking for identification and say, I want to see your draft card, and he says I don’t have one."
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1422.959,1426.847,"That’s a violation of law and if its 25 years, he’d be arrested."
1969.441,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1426.847,1428.278,They’d be prosecuted?
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1428.278,1429.671,Jointly be prosecuted.
1969.441,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1429.671,1432.428,Within five years?
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1432.428,1432.516,Oh!
1969.441,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1433.953,1435.101,That’s what the --
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1435.101,1435.802,Ay anytime they asked him.
1969.441,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1435.802,1438.828,But it would be yours if that would still be a five-year limit?
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1438.828,1440.218,That’s right.
1969.441,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1599.057,1600.629,"Is that really the issue, Mr. Gurfein?"
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1616.745,1618.134,"There’s no doubt that makes it easy, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.441,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1618.134,1626.272,"And has it not also provided, has not Congress also provided with the conscientious objector may have another evident?"
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1626.272,1632.807,But what does that do to the truly conscientious objector who believes at the process of registration itself?
1969.441,0,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,1742.635,1751.037,I think there’s (Inaudible)?
1969.441,0,35873,murray_i_gurfein,,1751.037,1760.721,"I think that under the free exercise clause on the First Amendment, Mr. Justice Harlan that there is very little history to support the idea that there is no conscientious objection."
1969.441,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1842.327,1850.237,Mr. Beytagh.
1969.441,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,1850.237,1854.415,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.441,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2000.613,2002.758,I don’t get that.
1969.441,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2026.941,2027.624,"Your Honor, the --."
1969.441,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2027.624,2034.154,"I don’t understand that 26, there’s nothing in there saying that you have between the ages of 18 and 26 to register."
1969.441,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2034.154,2034.629,No.
1969.441,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2037.512,2041.756,You have to register within five days after your 18th birthday period.
1969.441,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2041.756,2044.454,But it says that all people between 18 and 26 are to register.
1969.441,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2044.454,2052.527,Registration statute itself Section 453 says that every male person now here at the United States --
1969.441,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2052.527,2055.123,Where are you reading?
1969.441,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2055.123,2061.511,From page 2 of our brief with subsection 3 of the statute.
1969.441,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2077.07,2082.103,"(Voice Overlap) over 18 at the time of enactment of the law, isn’t it?"
1969.441,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2082.103,2096.715,"That is one of the purposes of that, Your Honor but the way we read it is that reading it in pari materia with Section 4 which makes people between 18-1/2 and 26 liable for training service."
1969.441,1,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,2118.624,2124.792,"This was maybe up to non residences of people, Americans who have never been in United States?"
1969.441,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2124.792,2149.856,"No, there’s a whole list that’s provided by Section 454 and it’s set out in the regulations that people are essentially are in the Armed Forces at that time of people will reserve components, people serving a certain government capacity things like that and aliens and certain kind."
1969.441,1,15137,john_m_harlan,scotus_justice,2149.856,2153.716,"If it all becomes naturalize at age 25, I suppose you have to register."
1969.441,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2153.716,2154.813,That’s correct.
1969.441,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2157.37,2160.515,"Registration applies to people other than citizens, isn’t it?"
1969.441,1,23552,francis_x_beytagh_jr,,2160.515,2161.212,That’s correct.
