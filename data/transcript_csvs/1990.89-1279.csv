1990.89-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.307,"We'll hear argument first in Number 89-1279, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Cleopatra Haslip."
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,10.218,13.212,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,102.982,109.484,"Now, I suppose we do not know the breakdown of compensatory and punitive damages here?"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,109.484,134.151,"Justice O'Connor, under Alabama law, the punitive damage award to Mrs. Haslip would have been at least $840,000, because the maximum... she had a prayer for $3 million of punitive damages, and a prayer for her actual damages, plus emotional distress damages of $200,000."
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,160.257,160.417,Excuse me.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,168.615,178.102,"--Yes, and under the cases that were cited, in fact by the Respondents here, that would be the computation of the award."
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,189.338,193.189,Are there Alabama cases that set aside judgments for more than what is prayed for?
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,193.189,198.705,"--It is my understanding that there are, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,201.979,204.861,"I think it makes sense to say she asked for so much, and--"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,204.861,205.062,--Yes.
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,205.062,206.814,--and you subtract that from the total.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,214.771,220.324,"That could happen, but they would then have been limited to the prayer under Alabama law."
1990.89-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,222.806,227.558,Are you going to supply the Court with citations to establish that proposition?
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,227.558,253.276,"--I will do that, Justice O'Connor, and I would cite the Court to the case cited by the Respondents in the Respondents brief, which laid out their position that the award would have been $840,000 and not more, because as I stated, the respondents... the plaintiffs presented this court case to the Alabama Supreme Court as an award of $1,040,000."
1990.89-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,253.276,263.292,"Does that mean that we should sort of treat the case as though the actual damage... I guess there were some actual pecuniary damages, a few thousand dollars, too, weren't there?"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,269.055,282.926,"All of the... all of the plaintiffs in the case had a total of economic damages something of about $3,900, and the total award was something in the area of $1,077,000."
1990.89-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,282.926,291.964,"Right, but as to this particular respondent, it's roughly... we can treat the case as though the punitive damage was roughly four times the actual damage?"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,291.964,293.615,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1990.89-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,351.684,359.588,"You say, not a constitutional... constitutionally permissible basis for imposing punishment on Pacific Mutual."
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,366.223,368.554,Just the punitive award.
1990.89-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,368.554,375.35,"You... there's a different constitutional standard for respondeat superior, in your view, when you're talking about punitive damages?"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,375.35,377.503,"Petitioner submits that that is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,409.073,417.849,"I guess that argument... well, supposing you have a corporation, and the president of the corporation does a lot of things secretly."
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,424.787,436.024,There's... there is... that is a different situation than we have here.
1990.89-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,490.229,493.462,Maybe they... maybe they fixed prices at a level that caused them to lose money.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,494.533,500.527,--But they were still acting to benefit the corporation and seeking to increase its profits by violating the law.
1990.89-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,519.371,525.565,But wouldn't that also... that argument also justify saying you can't recover civil... even actual damages?
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,525.565,536.641,"But there you have, again, an innocent third party and the innocent company, and the company put the agent in a position to cause the harm."
1990.89-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,551.953,559.119,"Mr. Beckman, do you have any case authority from this Court to support this rather curious position?"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,559.119,567.444,Only the... the authority that we have cited in the briefing that has been submitted.
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,567.444,603.767,"Mr. Beckman, if I understand the position you're taking on this point, if... if an officer of a corporation is secretly... secretly favors polluting the environment, and at great expense to the company... not in its interests, but at some expense to the company... pollutes... intentionally causes the company to pollute the environment, a penalty could not be imposed upon the company because the officer was not acting in the company's interest?"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,620.78,633.918,"That is a somewhat different case than those that we have been relying on, such as the Standard Oil of Texas v. The United States case, where you had the three employees stealing oil from Standard and then selling it back."
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,633.918,635.651,"It's different from those cases, but it's--"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,635.651,635.801,Yes.
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,635.801,640.336,--But it tests what I understood to be your response to Justice Stevens.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,655.839,657.86,"Yes, and... and if you're--"
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,657.86,657.98,All right.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,657.98,658.921,--If you are suggesting that--
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,658.921,662.934,So then your answer to my hypothetical has to be that you cannot punish the corporation.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,662.934,683.569,"--I would suggest that's correct, Justice Scalia, and that would be because if you had, in effect, a disloyal employee trying to sabotage the company by putting in procedures which would in fact be causing emissions beyond EPA standards, for example, it would really not forward the goals of retribution and deterrence to punish the company because it had that employee doing that."
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.569,686.731,"It would deter the company from putting such a nut in such a position, wouldn't it?"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,686.731,703.943,"That would be direct liability, not respondeat superior liability, if you're suggesting that the basis of the punishment then would be that the company had not controlled or was... this agent, or had not properly monitored them."
1990.89-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,703.943,709.567,"Mr. Beckman, we've been questioning you about what you say was your third point."
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,712.519,715.821,"I would indeed, Your Honor... Justice... Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,749.785,755.918,Assume that we're just talking about punishing the agent himself.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,767.518,771.86,Yes.
1990.89-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,873.466,890.828,"Mr. Beckman, the Alabama court has handed down in the Green oil case a list of factors to be used on appellate review of punitive damages cases."
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,892.53,893.8,"That is correct, Justice."
1990.89-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,893.8,908.659,"Now, in your view, if the Green Oil factors were spelled out to the trial jury that fixed the punitive damages, would that adequately serve to guide the jury's discretion?"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,908.659,910.702,"No, Justice O'Connor, it would not."
1990.89-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,937.293,947.059,"Well, do you take the position here today that the only possible way to meet the due process concerns that you express is to set a dollar limit?"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,947.059,956.285,"--Not necessarily a dollar limit, if a multiple plus a cap approach were taken, as I suggested in answer to Justice Kennedy's question."
1990.89-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,957.076,959.058,That's a form of a dollar limitation.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,959.058,961.141,"--Yes, Justice... Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,961.141,962.44,That's all you're saying would suffice.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,962.44,962.621,Yes.
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.488,1080.099,"Mr. Beckman, suppose I had a criminal statute that said for this offense the court may impose a fine up to full confiscation of all property of the defendant."
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1093.741,1093.951,I think I--
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1093.951,1095.981,"--It's up to the judge to decide, you know--"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1095.981,1109.43,"--Yes, I think I understand your question, and that is that you have a penal code section which specifies in advance, and says that the maximum penalty for that specified offense is up to... in a sense, a... action."
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1113.644,1114.015,--Um-hum.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1114.015,1128.824,"Yes, I would suggest that that would meet due process, but that is different than punitive damages situation, because there the legislature has acted to tailor a remedy to a defined offense."
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1136.5,1149.8,"But the legislature has, in effect, said for each of those offenses, for any... for any civil offense, you are on notice that what you can be penalized is all of your assets."
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1149.8,1150.861,I'd suggest that that--
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1150.861,1152.07,Why isn't that... you know.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1162.78,1180.302,"--That would be as if... and the situation really is as if, for example, the Alabama Penal Code, which would cover everything from minor traffic offenses to first degree murder, had a single penalty section which said, for any violation of this code the maximum penalty is capital punishment."
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1185.507,1186.547,"Well, let's take that out of it."
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1186.547,1187.248,--Or even notice--
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1187.248,1189.251,We've place some limitations on capital punishment.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1196.698,1198.912,--Up to life imprisonment--
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.912,1199.132,Um-hum.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1199.132,1218.116,"--And I would suggest that that would not be a meaningful or realistic penalty for 99.9 percent of the offenses in the code; similarly, that confiscation of all the assets would not be a meaningful or really reasonable penalty for 99.9 percent of the offenses in punitive damages."
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1218.116,1219.949,Because... because it... because what?
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1223.12,1228.306,Because it is so high that it wouldn't be fair notice of what the actual penalties would be.
1990.89-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.768,1254.713,"Mr. Beckman, can I ask kind of a long-run, long-range question?"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1269.254,1276.628,I suggest that in any case in which the jury was instructed as it was in this case--
1990.89-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1276.628,1276.778,Right.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1276.778,1282.564,"--that due process requirements would not be met, and to that extent, the answer to your question would be yes."
1990.89-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1282.564,1300.514,"Then the other thing that's running through my mind, to the extent that you've suggested that maybe we could craft rules like a ceiling and special procedures and all, are you suggesting that those procedures... that we would write a rule for the future that would not be retroactive to past awards, or... you don't have a retroactivity problem?"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1300.514,1306.37,I would suggest there would be no retroactivity problem and even that this Court would not have to craft rules.
1990.89-1279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1311.494,1315.856,"But until they meet the minimum that you think are required, all these awards would be invalid?"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1315.856,1318.547,"--Yes, Justice Stevens, but that is our position."
1990.89-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1318.547,1329.016,"I take it you have no problem with the theory of punitive damages, then."
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1355.097,1370.798,"I would suggest not, Justice Kennedy, if in fact guilt is personal and... and if penalties are to be imposed because of guilt, as they in fact generally are not in punitive damages cases."
1990.89-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1370.798,1389.662,"So you have... you have no trouble with the proposition that, in the second case, where there was an intentionally substitution of an inferior fabric, or piece of equipment, you have no trouble at all with that child recovering substantially more, even though his injuries were the same?"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1389.662,1407.152,"No, Justice Kennedy, and that is because punitive damages are not a matter of compensation, and... and I suggest that it is not the perspective to look at them from any entitlement of someone injured to recover them."
1990.89-1279,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1415.097,1417.969,And you have no quarrel with that element in the law?
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1417.969,1430.559,"Well, I have a quarrel with it, but to... to seriously quarrel with it would require a position that there could be no civil penalties in any case, and that is not in the history of the decisions of this Court."
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1469.244,1469.685,Excuse me.
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1491.389,1530.776,"--I suggest, Justice Scalia that the situation here is... is essentially the same as it was in Williams v. Illinois, when you have the practice which had extended from medieval England down through the United States from the time of the Revolution and the adoption of the Constitution to the time of that decision, of... of increasing penalties of prisoners beyond the maximum allowed by statute when they were unable to pay fines or court costs, and there, as here, if that had been analyzed and looked at, the Court would probably have found that it violated due process, just as I submit that punitive damages... the procedures--"
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1530.776,1533.989,What was the basis of that decision?
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1533.989,1567.311,"--That... the basis of the decision was that it was a violation of due process to sentence... to allow a prisoner to be required to serve time beyond the maximum allowed by the statute because he was unable to pay a fine or court costs, and the court recognized that even though that had been the practice from medieval England through all the history of the United States, it still violated due process, and recognized that it had only come to the attention of the Court because that practice's impact on society had changed radically."
1990.89-1279,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1568.663,1576.778,"But this one has come to the attention of this Court before, and this Court has... has opinions that... that have approved it before, doesn't it?"
1990.89-1279,0,17476,bruce_a_beckman,,1576.778,1586.746,--The... the due process validity of punitive damages has not been decided by the Court and been directly before it.
1990.89-1279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1605.098,1606.33,"Very well, Mr. Beckman."
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1608.543,1616.148,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1809.268,1821.977,"Well, let's say a jury is instructed by the trial court to... that it may find punitive damages and it's within their discretion to make that determination."
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1821.977,1825.811,--Purely... wholly within their discretion?
1990.89-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1825.811,1826.332,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1826.332,1828.202,"Well, that... that would be more--"
1990.89-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1828.202,1834.607,Do you think that would raise any due process concern about standardless discretion?
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1834.607,1843.983,"--I think, Justice O'Connor, that even such minimal instructions as that would satisfy the due process clause as that clause is constructed."
1990.89-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1843.983,1847.315,"Well, that is a very strange notion of what due process means, then, isn't it?"
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1847.315,1847.786,I think not.
1990.89-1279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1847.786,1861.646,Doesn't the clause suggest to us that wholly standardless discretion in these matters is unauthorized?
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1861.646,1864.259,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I think not, for two reasons."
1990.89-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1939.451,1939.601,Excuse me.
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1965.019,1966.168,Yes.
1990.89-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.829,1969.921,"It's just like telling them, don't punish too much, and don't punish too little."

1990.89-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1993.021,1994.361,"Well, of course."
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,1999.827,2000.946,Yes.
1990.89-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2014.206,2017.178,I would rely more on the 200 years than I would upon the standard.
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2018.51,2021.812,"--Justice Scalia, let me turn to the next level of protection."

1990.89-1279,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2050.625,2052.134,But suppose it were?
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2052.134,2061.101,"--Well, if it were, then that would be a different question entirely, about an arbitrary and unequal application of a supposedly neutral principle of law."

1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2073.349,2076.882,I think it would be a different issue from the issue posed by the facts of this case.
1990.89-1279,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2076.882,2078.214,Would there be a due process problem?
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2078.214,2103.839,"I think, Your Honor, that if it could be shown through empirical evidence that there wasn't just an occasional aberrational decision, but that, in a substantial number of cases it was entirely arbitrary and fortuitous whether a particular defendant got hit with a punitive damage award or not, that would raise a due process question with respect to conduct that can subject one to a punitive damage award."
1990.89-1279,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2105.331,2117.139,"Wouldn't it raise due process standards because we've lost confidence in the operation of the system to operate with predictability, with fairness--"

1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2141.465,2143.598,--In Alabama today--
1990.89-1279,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2143.598,2152.895,"--are all some indices of due process, and you indicate at the outset you don't think there's any due process standard, I had thought, with reference to the jury."
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2163.654,2172.48,--I think there is a due process component that requires predictability with respect to the nature of conduct that can trigger a punitive award.
1990.89-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2193.533,2199.398,What about ex post facto cases?
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2199.398,2203.168,"Well, Your Honor, I am talking right now with respect to civil cases."
1990.89-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.069,2241.774,"Mr. Ennis, would you apply your principle that unpredictability produces a violation of the due process clause to substantive liability as well, so that if one can show that, gee, lawyers really never know what's going to happen when you send a case to the jury, except to the extent that it hinges upon factors that really should have no bearing... like whether the defendant has deep pocket or not."
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2256.443,2260.336,"Well, Justice Scalia, I'm not entirely sure I understand your question, but--"

1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2270.484,2271.142,--I don't think that's true.
1990.89-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2271.142,2276.257,"--I thought that was your answer to Justice Kennedy, that if the system were entirely unpredictable--"

1990.89-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2282.053,2282.171,--Right.
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2282.171,2284.475,--whether every fourth defendant gets punitive awards against them--
1990.89-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2284.475,2284.865,Right.
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2284.865,2289.019,"--that would go to the conduct that would trigger a punitive award, and I think that would implicate a due process concern."
1990.89-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2289.019,2294.174,And the same would be true about whether the jury finds liability at all?
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2294.174,2296.885,I think the same would not be--
1990.89-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.885,2299.347,"I mean, did you think jury verdicts are predictable in that sense?"
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2301.96,2305.841,--I think that it's not a requirement that jury verdicts be predictable.
1990.89-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.307,2314.98,But they have to be just nonarbitrary?
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2314.98,2318.753,"They just have to have some rational basis, and not be arbitrary, that's correct."
1990.89-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2364.406,2366.607,Was that test applied in this case?
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2366.607,2367.268,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1990.89-1279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2367.268,2376.043,Do you think the trial judge's memorandum really reflected what the test is supposed to reflect?
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2376.043,2386.462,"Well, the trial judge's memorandum does refer to the Hammond opinion and does state that the award was reviewed by the trial court under Hammond."
1990.89-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.335,2449.875,"The argument is that punitive damages don't need all these protections, these specific factors that Alabama Supreme Court has imposed, and that there doesn't need to be appellate review."
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2449.875,2451.618,Justice White--
1990.89-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2451.618,2454.279,There's just no due process problem at all.

1990.89-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.195,2473.632,"Well, what is... is there... is there some due process requirement that the punitive damages not be excessive?"
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2473.632,2482.428,"--Yes, Your Honor, I think that there are decisions of this Court that do impose an outer limit regardless of the fairness of the standard of procedure."
1990.89-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2482.428,2483.73,"What, there's not a limit like, excessive?"
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2483.73,2488.763,"The outer limit would be, under the substantive component of the due process clause--"
1990.89-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.763,2489.123,Yes?
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2489.123,2497.66,--that the punitive award not exceed an amount that would rationally further the State's legitimate objectives.
1990.89-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2506.105,2510.557,"And you say this excessiveness comes out of the due process clause, this... you say?"
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2519.193,2527.959,--I think that the due process clause does not apply to whether... to predictability of the amount of the punitive damage award.
1990.89-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2528.579,2531.312,"But it does apply, you say... it can be too great?"
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2531.312,2536.066,"There is, perhaps, a substantive component of the due process clause."
1990.89-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2536.066,2537.365,"Well, you said there was awhile ago."
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2537.365,2549.784,"Well, Your Honor, I think that the cases that established such a substantive limit on what is State economic regulation are very old cases and may not be good law today, but for purposes of this case."

1990.89-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2578.055,2583.566,"Have they put down some overall limits, or some proportionality rules?"
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2583.566,2597.317,"--Your Honor, in the past... since 1986, a majority of the States have actually legislatively revisited their punitive damages systems, but only nine States today impose caps on the upper limit of punitive awards."
1990.89-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.317,2604.352,"Well, what about... nine States put caps on, but how about others that have set some standards, other than just these vague... rather vague standards?"
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2604.352,2612.088,We have cited in our... actually in our opposition to certiorari... the four States that have legislatively established some standards.

1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2747.795,2751.928,"--Your Honor, there are at least two parts of an answer to that question."

1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2780.839,2781.45,That's right.
1990.89-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2781.45,2781.7,Okay.
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2781.82,2782.592,It's a societal judgment.
1990.89-1279,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.222,2783.413,Right.
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2786.934,2787.775,Well--

1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2972.306,2972.957,That's correct.
1990.89-1279,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2973.899,2976.309,Is that... that's just the standard the jury has?
1990.89-1279,1,17601,bruce_j_ennis_jr,,2981.122,2983.403,"--No, that's not quite as simple as that, Justice White."
