1969.282,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,32.578,"Number 282, United States against Davis."
1969.282,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,40.613,64.818,"May it please the Court, this is a tax case what we might call a regular tax case, not a criminal case nor a land case as the last two were which comes here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit."
1969.282,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,209.396,217.267,"Is there any question as to whether or not the time of the redemption of the preferred stock, there were earnings and profits?"
1969.282,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,217.267,223.628,"No, there's no question about that Mr. Justice, there were adequate earnings and profits to cover this."
1969.282,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,446.814,453.953,"What is it, that statute really, this attribution provision really means what it says if by –-"
1969.282,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,453.953,454.723,"Mr. Justice Stewart, --"
1969.282,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,454.723,467.974,"--assume the father is 75-years old and the son 50-years old and they hadn't seen each other for 30-years, and one lived in Europe and the other lived in California, is it supposed there's still be attribute?"
1969.282,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,467.974,479.199,Yes Mr. Justice because I think the very purpose of the statute is to remove the questions of degree which could be raised by that kind of questions.
1969.282,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,516.804,520.528,And you don't think children -- I mean minor children or anything like that
1969.282,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,520.528,524.656,"No, I'm sure that that does not apply."
1969.282,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1352.736,1360.084,"Mr. Solicitor General, would it make a difference if the $25,000.00 transaction would be taken in the form of a note?"
1969.282,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1360.084,1376.44,"Yes Mr. Justice, I think that if he had lent the money to the company and if the circumstances were such that the note would not be held to be essentially an equity in this month and a subordinated capital, it would have made a difference?"
1969.282,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1376.44,1378.273,On this factual situation.
1969.282,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1378.273,1390.232,"On this factual situation, it seems to me it would have been somewhat difficult for the Government to contend that a note for $25,000.00 was not legitimate debt."
1969.282,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1390.232,1397.623,But the -- he wouldn't gotten involved either because I think if the condition was that he put his money for the rest of the business.
1969.282,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1397.623,1403.736,"It would have had to have been a subordinated note, a note subordinated to the RFC's claim."
1969.282,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1403.736,1406.979,"I thought, at least at the risk of the business."
1969.282,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1406.979,1413.7,"As I understand it, he would have got the, could have got the loan by making a loan to the company."
1969.282,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.458,1442.007,In the light of the facts of this particular case?
1969.282,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1442.007,1455.609,"On the facts of this particular case, if it was subordinate only to the RFC, it seems to me the Government might have had some difficulty in contending that this was equity rather than a dead investment."
1969.282,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1559.139,1565.863,What is your judgment as to the standard necessary to determine the case under?
1969.282,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1565.863,1567.688,Standard as necessary to determine?
1969.282,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1567.688,1569.099,Yes.
1969.282,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1569.099,1569.905,Determine what Mr. –-
1969.282,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1569.905,1574.26,Whether it is the equivalent of a guilt?
1969.282,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1574.26,1585.181,"I think in this case, I would say that the standard is what would have been the case if he had surrendered nothing?"
1969.282,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1753.854,1756.624,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,1759.473,1764.114,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1857.792,1859.937,What would it be treated as?
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,1859.937,1862.75,Treated as a return of capital.
1969.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1862.75,1864.274,You mean as a sale?
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,1864.274,1890.41,"A sale, that's what this was, a sale of stock to the corporation but the minutes provided, the director's minutes that Mr. Davis offer the sale of stock back to the corporation, $25,000.00, the offer was accepted, the stock was bought, the stock was redeemed, so everybody was in exactly the same position after the transaction, great taking the transaction as a whole, the two poll of the transaction."
1969.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.988,1992.399,What would you say if one partner decided to put up all the money they needed for the new plant itself?
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2013.892,2019.278,"I say that's a return of capital also, that's a return of capital."
1969.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.575,2026.602,Of course he deliberately chose to --
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2026.602,2027.179,Yes.
1969.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.179,2035.62,"--put it up in his preferred stock and to, and to put it in the risk of the business rather than making any subordinated note."
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2035.62,2043.874,"Well, a subordinated note would also have been at the risk of the business if it was subordinated as the usual subordinated note is, that is to -- to the RFC loan, to bank --"
1969.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2043.874,2044.734,The preferred --
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2044.734,2045.599,-- bank debts and --
1969.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2045.599,2047.76,"Nevertheless, would it be shown as a liability?"
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2047.76,2050.449,"Oh yes, yes it would, that's true."
1969.282,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.449,2052.016,And he preferred not to have that stock --
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2052.016,2057.467,He preferred not to do it because that made the balance sheet better for all the business purposes in general.
1969.282,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2520.37,2532.099,"I haven't followed this part of your argument Mr. Wallace that you say that the attribution that Section 318, attribution provision do not apply to this case?"
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2532.099,2532.822,Do not apply.
1969.282,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2532.822,2533.805,And why is it?
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2533.805,2536.876,"Alright, I'll say it for this reason Your Honor."
1969.282,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2604.184,2607.656,"Now, I'm looking at pages 43 and 44 of the Government's brief."
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2607.656,2611.332,Yes sir.
1969.282,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2611.332,2611.779,In which –-
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2611.779,2632.411,"Look at page 41 in the middle of the page, constructive only surplus stock, except as provided in paragraph two of this subsection, Section 318 (a) shall apply in determining the ownership of stock for purposes of this Section."
1969.282,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2658.952,2680.881,"But the, going back to 43 and 44 in pages and then look at 318 (b) on 44, the provision to which the rules contained in subsection (a) applies to Section 302 relating to redemption of stock, and that it would apply that you'd suppose to see the whole section?"
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2680.881,2682.628,"Well yeah, and that's why I, that's why I have just raised."
1969.282,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2682.628,2684.428,That is not inconsistent I suppose with your argument.
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2684.428,2685.805,"That's what I've been reading, yes."
1969.282,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2685.805,2692.551,It should be read as applying only to those parts of the section that referred exquisitely to ownership of stock.
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2692.551,2693.796,"Yes, that's my point."
1969.282,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2713.706,2715.836,Has any Court ever accepted this argument which you're making?
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2715.836,2724.655,"Well, no Court has accepted it whole heartedly, they have only said we think there ought to be exceptions where this family and strange one and other things like –-"
1969.282,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2724.655,2726.841,"Well, that's not your argument to hear at all?"
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2726.841,2732.157,"I agree with the Solicitor General that the veto applies, it didn't apply but I say it doesn't apply and he says it does apply."
1969.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2732.157,2735.988,"Where is the history, legislative history in your brief to which you refer –-"
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2735.988,2736.316,Yes –-
1969.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2736.316,2739.633,--by that argument?
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2739.633,2740.831,My brief –-
1969.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2740.831,2742.504,Page what?
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2742.504,2754.792,"Starting on page 10, well, there's a part of it, the main part of it is yes, pages 10 and 11."
1969.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2770.144,2775.428,Are you having this as though the man had just loaned the money for the company?
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2775.428,2778.228,"I'm not arguing that he just loaned it, no Your Honor."
1969.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2782.842,2784.056,They purchased a preferred --
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2784.056,2785.747,Purchased or preferred stock from the corporation --
1969.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2785.747,2787.928,With an agreement that they would buy back?
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2787.928,2792.474,Agreement they would buy it back when the RFC loan was paid off.
1969.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2806.404,2807.672,Did the Court found out about that?
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2807.672,2807.906,Yes.
1969.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2809.33,2810.283,That's what it found?
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2810.283,2811.525,"Yes, yes."
1969.282,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2811.525,2812.569,On what page?
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2812.569,2814.602,Both lower courts.
1969.282,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2844.418,2845.601,Against 39 doesn't it?
1969.282,1,46570,william_waller,,2845.601,2857.957,"Well, yes, but I'm thinking about the place, well, he quotes the, the Court of Appeals Court's on pages 45 and 46 of the appendix."
