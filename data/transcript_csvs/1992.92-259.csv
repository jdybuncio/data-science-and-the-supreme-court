1992.92-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.876,"We'll hear argument now in No. 92-259, the Oklahoma Tax Commission v. the Sac and Fox Nation."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,12.108,15.842,"Thank you, Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,62.074,67.216,But this involves State taxation of tribal members.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,67.216,69.369,"--This involves State taxation of tribal members, yes."
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,69.369,71.32,Who are living where?
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,71.32,77.534,Who... some of the tribal members live on Indian country and some do not live on Indian country.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,77.534,83.759,And the... but it involves both... all of those members.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,83.759,84.941,All tribal members.
1992.92-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.318,115.541,What are you including in the term Indian country when you refer to it?
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,115.541,126.598,"That would be trust land, that is, land that is held in trust by the United States of America for the benefit of the tribe itself or for the benefit of an Indian tribal--"
1992.92-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,126.598,126.759,An individual.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,126.759,127.87,--An individual person.
1992.92-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,127.87,137.887,Are all of the so-called allotted lands here lands that are held in trust by the Government for tribal members?
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,137.887,142.77,"Yes, they would be or they'd be held under an allotment deed, but the allotment deeds are quite old."
1992.92-259,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.025,157.521,"If it's allotted, deeded, and not held in trust, do you count that as Indian country as well?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,157.521,157.769,Yes.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,168.407,169.677,That's as long as the--
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,172.091,173.2,The Government.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,173.2,178.433,--Until they... if it has been transferred to a non-Indian.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,178.433,179.835,"Now, that's true."
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,187.329,187.97,"So, that's not--"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,187.97,188.581,--and BIA--
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,188.581,189.553,--That's not Indian country there.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,189.553,190.284,--Correct.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,191.135,193.386,"So, it still has to be in the hands of a member."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,193.386,194.237,--Correct.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,199.663,206.795,"What if the Government has conveyed the patent to the allottee, but the allottee is an Indian?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,210.118,225.088,"Well, if the Indian tribal member owns deed land, just the fee title to the land, and there is no trust or restricted status to the land, then that would not be Indian country just because the Indian would own it."
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,225.088,231.613,"So, when you refer to Indian country, you are not referring to fee lands owned outright by individual Indians."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,231.613,232.164,Correct.
1992.92-259,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,260.956,261.136,Go ahead.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,275.557,279.761,"Well, I don't think the distinction... we can make a distinction."
1992.92-259,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,305.441,314.616,"So, you're saying the criterion strictly is a territorial jurisdiction criterion, and therefore you would not have to lose with respect to those nontrust lands."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,314.616,316.919,"Correct, but--"
1992.92-259,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,316.919,319.25,Is there any other competing theory of jurisdiction?
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,319.25,338.0,"--Well, here the tribe does not have exclusive jurisdiction because I think we've got to look at the Federal statute, the relevant Federal statute, so that in this case even on Indian country within Oklahoma, individuals living on Indian country are taxable by the State in Oklahoma."
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,391.038,392.026,Or the tribe.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,392.026,395.379,The tribe got about 800 acres.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,395.379,395.639,"Yes, all right."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,396.18,400.151,This is a fairly... this was a fairly large reservation in central Oklahoma.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,433.355,439.928,"So, you say this case only concerns Indians that are living on trust lands?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,439.928,442.582,"Well, it concerns--"
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,442.582,447.695,"In terms of what the State is... you think that if they're living off the trust lands, the State may--"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,447.695,448.984,--Well--
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,448.984,450.426,--impose taxes?
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,450.426,451.147,--Correct.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,456.721,456.911,Right.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,456.911,457.382,They work for--
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,457.382,457.843,Right.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,457.843,463.517,"--various places, and they... there is no argument that they are taxable, but here we have tribal members--"
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,463.517,466.278,Who are not living on trust lands who are working for the tribe.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,466.278,468.351,"--Who are working for the tribe, and some--"
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,468.351,469.951,And they are at issue here.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,469.951,478.546,"--They are at issue because the lower courts held that if you... if the Indian or the tribal member works for the tribe, they do not owe taxes."
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,479.126,493.626,"Now, what about tribal members who do not live on trust land, but who are working for the tribe But does the same... you run into the same problem about the automobile tax?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,493.626,494.197,Right.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,495.469,495.937,You do.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,495.937,497.089,That's correct.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,504.736,504.853,"Well, I know."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,505.314,507.407,But the--
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,507.407,516.611,"Unless you're a tribal member, the State has no barrier to insisting on their paying the excise tax."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,516.611,517.013,--Right.
1992.92-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.986,545.295,"What is the significance of... as to the first tax, income tax, why is it significant that the Indian who is living on the trust land works for the tribe?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,551.332,551.972,Well.
1992.92-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,557.217,557.886,"Yes, I thought they would."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,557.886,564.881,"I would argue that... well, and the Tenth Circuit did not see it so broadly."
1992.92-259,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.053,601.475,"It seems to me that the theory of getting off is either a tribal self-government theory, in which case you ought to get off whether you're on or off trust land so long as you're working for the tribe, or else the theory is a territorial theory, in which case you ought to get off so long as you're living on trust land whether or not you're working for the tribe."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,601.475,620.169,"Okay, but this case does not fall very neatly into the on/off dichotomy because people are constantly going on and off the Indian country because you cannot conduct your daily affairs of life in Oklahoma on strictly Indian country."
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,662.84,669.962,"What does the tribe say about people who don't work for the tribe, but who live on Indian country and go off and buy an automobile?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,669.962,679.149,"--Well, they would say that just because they live on Indian country, they're within the tribal jurisdiction, you see, and that they would not be responsible for--"
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,679.149,680.431,"Well, how about on income tax?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,680.431,682.09,--On income tax--
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,682.09,698.794,"Do they claim that Indians who live on trust lands, but who don't work for the tribe, and... but live off of trust lands, away from trust lands... do they claim that the State may not tax those Indians... income tax those Indians?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,698.794,702.704,"--Okay, now, income for a person who... a tribal member who lives off of Indian country?"
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.704,704.677,Who lives on the trust lands--
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,704.677,704.867,Who lives on.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.867,706.378,--but works off of trust lands.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,706.378,707.169,Works off of trust lands.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,707.169,708.131,And not for the tribe.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,708.131,709.463,Not for the tribe.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,718.048,721.44,Is that issue in... is that at issue in this case--
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,721.44,722.569,"Well, no."
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,723.22,723.511,--among other things?
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,723.511,738.022,--The Tenth Circuit did not... the Tenth Circuit ruled that only those tribal members who work for the tribe were eligible for this exemption in this case because I believe they were having a little trouble with the fact that we can't find an existing reservation here.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.698,759.889,Sure.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,759.889,763.091,--the State was not allowed to come in and tax her.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,769.686,777.171,"Well, under McClanahan, what if that person who lived on the reservation, the Navajo reservation, earned his or her income off the reservation?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,777.171,784.885,"Off the reservation, they... I believe it's... in Arizona they would pay the State income taxes."
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.885,788.558,"Well, is there... did McClanahan rule that or another case?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,788.558,790.68,McClanahan did not--
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,790.68,790.97,Yes.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,790.97,792.062,--did not hold that.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,792.062,794.062,Did some other case?
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,799.145,799.856,"No, I--"
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,799.856,806.781,"--control the issue in this case of Indians who lived on trust land, but who were earned their income off trust land."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,806.781,810.682,"--Well, I can't think of a case right offhand that--"
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,810.682,811.193,"Yes, all right."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,811.193,813.066,--does that.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,813.066,813.686,Go ahead.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,813.686,856.445,"But in terms of the income tax here, I believe this Court has already ruled... well, the Supreme Court has ruled in the 1930's that... in the case of Leahy v. State Treasurer, which relied on Choteau v. Burnet, where you had the situation of an Indian, an Osage Indian, who lived on Indian country and earned income from the tribal mineral resources, and he was taxable on the income that he earned on those tribal mineral resources in that case because there was not this type of reservation that you have in the Navajo cases."
1992.92-259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,881.542,886.415,Just one more question on this preliminary part of your argument.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,910.203,914.245,"Well, I don't--"
1992.92-259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,914.245,917.786,"I mean, because if you don't have civil or criminal jurisdiction over Indian country--"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,917.786,917.987,--Yes.
1992.92-259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,917.987,927.564,"--which I take it you don't, and McClanahan says that's that the key for taxation, and if the Tenth Circuit didn't reach that, we don't necessarily have to reach that issue in this case, do we?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,928.675,939.632,"Well, I don't think I agree with your reasoning that you've got to have civil and criminal jurisdiction."
1992.92-259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,971.534,971.715,All right.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,973.646,974.467,"Yes, I do."
1992.92-259,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,974.467,974.647,All right.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,974.647,998.804,"So, I think, though, that one of the things that the lower courts did not... declined to do was resolve the reservation issue of whether what... to what extent the reservation exists, and I believe that is a necessary part of a finding in this case."
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1065.165,1068.508,--Mescalero case?
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1081.487,1082.268,--Correct.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1084.569,1091.762,Do you suppose that would cover... that would control a case of an individual Indian working off the reservation earning income?
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1091.762,1093.214,"--Well, that's correct."
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1107.994,1109.617,"Yes, well, I'm talking about--"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1109.617,1110.926,--and an individual--
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.926,1115.22,"--an individual Indian, and certainly the tribe is located on the reservation."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1115.22,1115.999,--On the reservation.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1115.999,1124.056,"An individual Indian living on the reservation goes off the reservation that's his... and his regular work place, where he earns income, is not on the reservation."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1124.056,1125.005,Correct.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.266,1150.014,"What does it mean if working for the tribe is a... was a big factor in the decision below, which you think it was--"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1150.014,1150.545,Yes.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1150.545,1154.099,--What does it mean working for the tribe in terms of residence?
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1160.042,1164.414,"Well, in this case, the headquarters building is on Indian country."
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.414,1168.528,"Well, I know that, but are those the only people who can be said to be working for the tribe?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1168.528,1174.171,I believe some employees would probably perform some duties off of Indian country in this case.
1992.92-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1183.027,1187.15,What do you understand the Leahy case to stand for?
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1187.15,1202.411,"Well, in that case, I believe it stands for the fact that when Indians within Oklahoma... the tribes do not have the autonomy that reservation tribes in other States do."
1992.92-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1229.635,1232.577,Did you cite Leahy to the Tenth Circuit?
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1232.577,1233.426,"Yes, I did."
1992.92-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1233.426,1236.218,And did they deal with it at all in their opinion?
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1236.218,1238.271,They did not deal with it in their opinion.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1292.437,1307.205,"Well, don't you think the tribe on the 800 acres that it was allotted... and it's held in trust by the United States?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1307.205,1307.516,Yes.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.516,1317.611,Don't you think the tribe can control who is permitted to enter that piece of trust land?
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1317.611,1320.694,"As much as any private landowner would, yes."
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1320.694,1321.946,"Well, that's pretty big, isn't it?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1321.946,1322.426,Uh-huh.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1322.426,1326.968,"You could... they can put of a fence around the whole thing, can't they?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1326.968,1327.689,Right.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1327.689,1331.881,"And so, isn't it dedicated to their exclusive use?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1331.881,1334.323,"Yes, it is, but--"
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1334.323,1348.152,"So, how does that differ from the notion that some person who lives and works and earns money on the Navajo reservation is not subject to State income tax?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1348.152,1365.314,"--Well, the Federal statute that allotted the land to the tribe in this case did not provide that there would be any type of exclusive jurisdiction for this tribe."
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1365.314,1375.231,"Well, it may not, but you just said that it... you just said that the tribe has complete control of this land and can keep people off of it."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1375.231,1375.962,Well--
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1375.962,1377.984,"So, where did that come from?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1377.984,1379.245,--Well--
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1379.245,1381.365,It doesn't come from State law apparently.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1381.365,1381.525,--No.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1381.755,1383.025,It comes from Federal law.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1383.025,1383.535,--Federal law.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.946,1396.225,"Well, then maybe the allotment act didn't expressly provide for it, but somewhere under the atmosphere, you say Federal law gives the tribe complete control of that land, that 800 acres."
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1396.225,1401.468,"Yes, that 800 acres, subject to the... you know, BIA's oversight."
1992.92-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1401.468,1406.731,"Well, I thought you said it had... the tribe had the same rights as a private property owner would have--"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1406.731,1406.881,Correct.
1992.92-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1406.881,1407.101,--to exclude.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1409.833,1410.945,No.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1435.751,1455.393,"Well, the only difference between the Navajo reservation example I just gave you and this is that it's very likely that most of the Indians, or is it... very likely that most of the Indians who work for the tribe on their 800 acres do not live on the 800 acres?"
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1455.393,1456.465,Most likely they do not.
1992.92-259,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1456.465,1457.156,They do not.
1992.92-259,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1457.156,1458.065,Thank you.
1992.92-259,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1458.065,1459.176,"Thank you, Mr. Miley."
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1460.869,1476.108,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1482.182,1484.083,"Well, could I ask you just at the outset--"
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1484.083,1484.253,--Yes.
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.253,1487.646,--do you support and defend the decision of the Tenth Circuit?
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1487.646,1489.306,"Not in its entirety, Justice White."
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1489.306,1490.137,I didn't think so.
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1490.137,1490.318,No.
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.318,1490.898,"So, go ahead."
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1490.898,1491.399,Yes.
1992.92-259,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1567.77,1573.895,"Is that... Mr. Kneedler, is that something that has been ruled upon or is that just practice that you're referring to?"
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1573.895,1584.581,"--It's... Oklahoma's own tax code provides that, and the amicus brief filed in this case by a number of States identifies that as a common practice."
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.581,1599.26,But it's never... you don't know of any case that says that Oklahoma automatically does that for the person who is taxed by an Indian tribe.
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1599.26,1600.933,Oklahoma does not do that for an Indian tribe.
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1622.157,1624.427,What's your view if they don't?
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1624.427,1626.44,--If they--
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1626.44,1631.232,"If they don't live on the... they work for the tribe on Indian country, but they live off of it."
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1631.602,1639.839,"--In that event, we believe the State could tax them, although we think on remand, the court could examine this question of whether a credit should be given for the income tax paid--"
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.839,1640.08,Exactly.
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1640.08,1641.272,--to the tribe.
1992.92-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1641.272,1641.793,On what basis?
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1643.956,1648.849,I would... I think general Indian law principles in the Indian commerce clause.
1992.92-259,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1660.095,1667.271,"It seems to me, Mr. Kneedler, in that case the tribe could tax them 100 percent, and then get a 100 percent deduction from their... because they all work for the tribe."
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1677.579,1680.18,"Well, I think the... I think there may be some resistance on the part of the Indian--"
1992.92-259,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1680.18,1680.611,"Well, maybe 50--"
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1680.611,1685.093,--The political process within the tribe I think would limit the amount of tax on that.
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1685.093,1690.338,--But you wouldn't say the State had to give that kind of a credit under Federal law.
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1692.56,1705.926,"I think there's a substantial argument that it should, given its tax structure with respect to off reservation, but I think one of the things the Court should examine is the extent to which the failure to give that credit would interfere with the... with tribal self-government."
1992.92-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1705.926,1712.421,"--In any of our recent cases, have we said there was kind of a dormant Indian commerce clause?"
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1714.364,1716.865,The Court has not relied on the Indian commerce clause.
1992.92-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.865,1718.197,"Well, why should we here?"
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1718.197,1741.933,"It's not really necessary to because we think it's sufficient to look both to the Indian country status of the land at issue... and it is Indian country status, not reservation status that we think is the starting point of analysis in this case... and look at the question of whether the tribe is... whether there's tribal self-government actually working in the area, whether there is a government-to-government relationship between the United States and the Indian tribe."
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1741.933,1742.875,"Mr. Kneedler, you said there were two theories."
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1746.548,1747.259,Right.
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.259,1749.801,--property theory.
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1749.801,1750.392,"Right, the territorial based one."
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.392,1751.413,"Yes, territorial, and what's--"
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1751.413,1753.053,And the second one--
1992.92-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1753.053,1755.284,--Except your last remarks didn't sound like territorial based.
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1761.39,1769.174,"--The... on the credit point, I was simply saying that that's a common accommodation of States, both of who have some territorial jurisdiction."
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1779.521,1780.222,This is your second theory?
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1780.222,1780.833,--This is the second theory.
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1799.216,1808.922,"Well, I thought you just said a while ago if the tribal member is living off of... is not living on the trust land, the State could tax him."
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1808.922,1811.223,--Under the McClanahan territorial theory.
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.223,1811.493,Right.
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1811.493,1819.22,What I was suggesting is there may be a separate theory that we think should also be examined on remand in... because here the individuals are actually employees of the tribe itself.
1992.92-259,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1819.22,1823.321,"Mr. Kneedler, would that theory apply equally to a nonmember employed by the tribe?"
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1823.321,1835.328,"It might, but we think that the interference with... that question is not before because the Tenth Circuit rejected that, but the interference with tribal self-government we think would be much more pronounced--"
1992.92-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1835.328,1839.111,"Well, how does it interfere with tribal self-government to have them pay an income tax?"
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1840.403,1863.35,"--Well, because just as a matter of economics, we think that in order to compete in the labor market, if the individuals whom the tribe employs have to pay both a State tax and on top of that a tribal tax, the tribe's ability to operate a government in the same way that a local government or a State government would be operated outside the reservation, they would be competitively disadvantaged."
1992.92-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1863.35,1868.313,"So, ruling for the tribe here would enable them to keep a kind of a cheap labor source."
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1868.313,1868.754,"Well, no."
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1876.179,1882.103,"This business of interference with tribal self-government is sort of common law, isn't it?"
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1882.103,1882.543,"Yes, it is."
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1882.543,1886.335,"The courts have been making it up, including--"
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1886.335,1886.525,No.
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.289,1895.772,"--Well, I know, but the courts have been... I don't... do you read it in some statute?"
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1895.772,1896.763,"No, but the--"
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1896.763,1899.885,"Well, then it's common law and the courts have been making it up."
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1899.885,1902.006,"--Well, but it goes all the way back to Worcester v. Georgia."
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.006,1906.17,"Well, it may be, but that was a court decision."
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1906.17,1914.034,"Yes, but again, when the Indian activity takes place in Indian country, that is the historic touchstone, not reservation."
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.849,1941.423,Do you think this second theory would touch upon the automobile excise tax?
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1941.423,1941.543,--No.
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.067,1953.992,"So, it would just be territorial, but you would say that the State may not put the excise tax on Indians who are living in what kind of a community did you say?"
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1953.992,1955.033,A dependent Indian community.
1992.92-259,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1955.554,1956.315,What is that?
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1956.315,1961.206,--It's one of the three definitions of Indian country under 1151.
1992.92-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.06,1986.134,"Mr. Kneedler, why wouldn't your first theory, your territorial theory... why wouldn't that apply to someone who's not employed by the tribe?"
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1986.134,1986.775,It would.
1992.92-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.168,1990.358,Okay.
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1990.589,1990.689,"--No, that does not--"
1992.92-259,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.689,1994.182,"--So, you're free from income tax whether you're employed by the tribe or not."
1992.92-259,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1994.182,1995.574,--Under McClanahan.
1992.92-259,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2056.077,2056.967,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."

1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2174.648,2177.981,"--Your Honor, I don't believe there's anything exactly on point."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2177.981,2179.083,What is your position on that?
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2179.083,2185.718,"My position on that is that the line, if you will, or the bright line rule that should be applicable here, is the Indian country line."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.92,2187.969,"Well, Indian country."
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2189.461,2189.721,"--Yes, sir."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.721,2191.091,--or if he's living in Indian country?
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2191.091,2192.102,If he's working in Indian country.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.55,2202.5,"Well, does that cover the automobiles too?"
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2202.5,2212.866,"It covers the individual, for instance, who would go to a automobile dealership and have a car delivered to him and title transferred within the Indian country."
1992.92-259,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2225.074,2244.208,"What if the Indian in this particular case lived on nontribal land, went to an automobile dealer that was on nontribal land, not Indian country, bought an automobile, and said I'll take delivery of it at the 800-acre reservation?"
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2244.208,2260.467,"I think the answer to that is when he brings that automobile from the reservation or from his allotment back out, let's say, to Norman outside the Indian reservation, outside the Indian country, at that point, since he's a resident there, he becomes obligated to pay the State tax there."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2300.456,2304.427,But he could drive his own car up there without being taxed by a State.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2304.427,2305.168,"He could, sir."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2305.168,2305.609,Yes.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2312.294,2317.097,The key... excuse me... the key is the conduct of the Indian in the Indian country.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.437,2341.172,"But we have no... but you've got no... we haven't got any square cases on that, living off the reservation, but working on."
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2345.684,2346.876,--Not to my knowledge.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.876,2347.046,--Yes.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2350.609,2351.991,It's the converse of Mescalero v. Jones.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.991,2352.902,Who did you mention?
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2354.252,2356.223,The Kansas Indians and the New York Indians.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2357.975,2362.087,--They were living on and working on.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2362.087,2368.41,--What we had there was a situation where the tribe's reservations had been abolished.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2368.41,2368.72,Right.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2368.72,2373.674,And the claim made there was basically the same claim that's being made here.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.702,2402.464,But they were living in Indian country.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2402.464,2404.107,--I believe that they were.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2404.107,2404.948,Yes.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2404.948,2406.711,"I mean, that's the outgrowth of those cases."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.988,2421.37,And stayed and continued to live off of it.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2421.37,2422.65,That's correct.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2422.65,2426.412,But your position is that the same rule ought to apply.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2426.412,2442.484,"My position is the same rule of McClanahan should apply because what McClanahan, when you get back to page 179 and 180 of the opinion down at the bottom, basically says that this person was an Indian and the income they earned came from the Indian reservation."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.448,2450.679,Yes.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2464.72,2467.541,Insofar as--
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.541,2468.84,Taxing--
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2468.84,2473.125,"--the use of a tax could be used to regulate conduct, I believe yes, it is."
1992.92-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2473.125,2481.42,"--Are you... you're claiming this exemption not just for income received from the tribe, but any income?"
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2481.42,2486.502,I believe that any income that an Indian earns in the Indian country is exempt from State taxation.
1992.92-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2486.502,2496.641,"And with respect to the car, I'm not sure whether you said the car... the Indian has to reside on... in Indian country and also the car has to be garaged there, both?"
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2496.641,2501.242,"The position is that the property has to be garaged, located in the Indian country."
1992.92-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2501.242,2501.433,Okay.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2508.671,2510.54,I believe it would be... could be.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2510.54,2515.094,Could you give us a citation of the Kansas and New York Indians?
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2515.094,2522.538,"The Kansas Indians, Your Honor, is 72 U.S. 667, and the New York Indians follows that immediately."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.538,2528.683,"It was 72, 767?"
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2528.683,2531.835,72 United States 667.
1992.92-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2634.435,2648.743,"Mr. Rice, I don't... how is this possibly administrable in a State, especially like Oklahoma, where there are just a lot of isolated pockets of Indian territory?"
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2690.653,2693.656,I don't think it's that difficult to identify what the Indian country is.
1992.92-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2693.656,2694.567,"Well, that's true."
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2694.567,2698.971,That's a fairly a simple analysis based on 18 U.S.C. 1151.
1992.92-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2698.971,2699.33,Right.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2699.33,2706.165,"You can identify a reservation, a dependent Indian community, or an Indian allotment, and you immediately know where that is."
1992.92-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2706.165,2706.345,Okay.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2713.782,2714.259,Okay.
1992.92-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.259,2719.535,Part of my delivery is in Indian country and part of my route is outside of Indian country.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2722.285,2729.258,"Well, no more than you would if you were selling things inside the State and outside the State, for instance."
1992.92-259,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.477,2741.748,--Yes.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2750.476,2756.13,"Well, it's not really a case I think of driving in and out of the Indian country all the time."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2805.304,2828.2,"Mr. Rice, did I gather you said that the State may not only not tax Indians who live off Indian country and work on Indian country, but they also may not tax non-Indians who live off the Indian country and work on Indian country?"
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2828.2,2833.773,I'm not sure I quite understand the question.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2833.773,2841.728,"Well, let's assume there's a non-Indian who lives off the reservation or lives off Indian country, but works on Indian country."
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2850.024,2850.593,No.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2852.416,2853.177,--All right.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2854.409,2854.599,Well--
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2854.599,2856.712,A non-Indian living off but working on?
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2856.712,2858.353,--I think there's two answers to that.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2860.413,2866.159,"Well, I know, but you can either say the State may tax him or may not."
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2866.159,2870.35,"--Well, I think the State may not tax him for two reasons."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2885.35,2887.49,Did the Tenth Circuit decide against you on that?
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2887.49,2888.091,"--No, they did not."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2890.823,2892.175,That's what I said.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2893.457,2894.288,Yes.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2894.288,2895.52,And we denied cert on that.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2895.52,2896.021,You denied cert on that.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.021,2896.211,Yes.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,2900.232,2903.285,That's the position that we had because of the treaties and the other.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3001.979,3002.949,Who brought this suit?
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3002.949,3004.08,Excuse me?
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3004.08,3005.951,Who brought this suit?
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3005.951,3008.174,"The Nation brought this suit, the Sac and Fox Nation."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3008.174,3011.725,"Well, did you... and was part of your claim that the reservation had never been--"
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3011.725,3012.596,"Yes, sir, it was."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3012.596,3012.816,--destroyed?
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3018.029,3019.731,They did not decide that issue at all.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3088.788,3092.632,"But you lost half your... you lost some of your case in the Tenth Circuit, and we denied cert.--"
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3092.632,3094.222,"--Yes, sir."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.222,3103.669,--And it might have come out differently if they had decided that the reservation had not been abolished.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3103.669,3107.981,"No, I don't think under their analysis that it would have come out any differently--"
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3107.981,3108.291,"Oh, I see."
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3108.291,3117.007,"--because what they simply said is they drew a distinction between tribal members and nontribal members, and that was the basis of the distinction there."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3117.007,3117.207,"Yes, all right."
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3117.337,3120.219,It wasn't an Indian country decision.
1992.92-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3120.219,3126.323,Could you tell me just a little bit more about the nation itself?
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3130.767,3131.148,"Yes, sir."
1992.92-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3131.148,3133.49,Trust for the tribe or for individual Indians?
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3133.49,3140.413,That is... the 800 acres is land which was explicitly reserved out of the operation of the allotment agreement by the agreement itself.
1992.92-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3140.413,3141.263,I see.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3141.263,3147.297,"It was to be held as the tribal land had always been held, in other words, under the 1867 treaty."
1992.92-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3147.297,3149.88,It's held by the United States in trust for the tribe.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3149.88,3150.199,"Yes, sir."
1992.92-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3150.199,3153.882,And roughly how many... how big is the nation?
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3155.214,3157.194,"About 2,500 members of the--"
1992.92-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3157.194,3157.605,I see.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3158.006,3159.966,--They don't all live on the 800 acres.
1992.92-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3159.966,3161.919,--But some of them live on the 800.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3161.919,3162.918,"There's a few of them that do, yes."
1992.92-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3166.721,3169.553,What is the 800 acres primarily used for?
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3170.264,3173.926,"That is where the center of the tribal government is, the tribal administrative offices."
1992.92-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3180.839,3181.109,And--
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3181.109,3183.102,--plus a couple hundred that has been added to it.
1992.92-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3183.102,3187.635,--And is there a large number of employees working for the tribal government?
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3187.635,3188.686,Most of them work there.
1992.92-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3199.905,3204.427,"If we took all of the employees of the tribe together, how many people would we be talking about roughly?"
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3204.427,3207.69,--Roughly 140 to 150 people.
1992.92-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3207.69,3208.541,"There's quite a group, yes."
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3212.892,3215.964,I would say the large majority of those live on Indian country.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.006,3326.127,"Well, yes, but your bright line rule I think would cover Indians who live on Indian country and work on Indian country, but it doesn't cover Indian... tribal members who don't live in Indian country."
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3326.127,3329.55,It would seem to me it covers conduct of an Indian in the Indian country.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3329.55,3330.181,"Well, I know, but--"
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3330.181,3330.351,And let me--
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3330.351,3336.344,"--none of the cases just cover... clearly cover that, and you indicated that--"
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3336.344,3336.565,--Well--
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.565,3338.315,--you didn't know of any case that covered it.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3338.315,3340.576,--Not in the income tax situation.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3340.576,3340.767,"Yes, right."
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3340.767,3343.03,"There are criminal cases, for instance--"
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3343.03,3344.049,"Well, I'm talking about--"
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3344.049,3345.28,--or other cases.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3345.28,3346.73,--We're talking about income taxes.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3362.211,3362.982,That's exactly right.
1992.92-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3362.982,3364.494,--or discover an oil well or something like that.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3364.494,3365.483,That's exactly right.
1992.92-259,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3365.483,3365.744,Yes.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3365.744,3370.939,"If it's the Indian conduct in the Indian country, then that is what Congress has put behind the law."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3370.939,3377.784,"But if the tribe is running a business off... out of Indian country, I suppose Mescalero controls."
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3377.784,3378.595,That would be Mescalero.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3393.474,3416.101,"Suppose the Indian... suppose the reservation... even if the reservation wasn't formally abolished, all of the land, other than that which has been held in trust and allotted to Indians, all of that has already been patented to non-Indians or to somebody else."
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3416.101,3417.02,True.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3417.02,3424.245,"So, it would be... you might say, well, here's where the reservation used to be, but there's--"
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3424.245,3432.53,"Well, there's still a real solid Indian presence in that area, and I think we've taken the position in--"
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3432.53,3442.908,"--Well, I know, but you wouldn't say that you could exclude anybody you wanted to any... within the bounds of the old reservation now."
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3442.908,3446.131,"--Well, no, I wouldn't say that we would exclude the landowners, no."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3448.732,3448.912,Yes.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3448.912,3450.333,--and a couple of other cases.
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3450.333,3450.523,Yes.
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3450.523,3468.795,"The difference, though, with the Indian conduct in those areas that have still retained reservation status is Mattz v. Arnett, and those cases say that the Indian work... the Indian activity there, their actions, are still within the Indian country."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3491.722,3492.902,But--
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3492.902,3495.784,"--we've got a diminished one, not a big one."
1992.92-259,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3495.784,3507.48,"--But if the reservation were still there and was not abolished, you wouldn't say that every acre of ground within the bounds of the reservation would be Indian country."
1992.92-259,2,25992,g_william_rice,,3507.48,3522.21,"Yes, sir, it is Indian country because 1151(a) says that it includes all Indian reservations notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and Seymour v. Superintendent says a patent to anybody, whether that's a patent to an Indian or a patent to a non-Indian."
1992.92-259,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3522.21,3523.662,"Thank you, Mr. Rice."
