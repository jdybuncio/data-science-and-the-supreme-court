2015.14-510,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.415,"We'll hear argument next in Case 14-510, Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin v. the United States. Mr. Strommer."
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,12.415,23.83,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: The facts in this case are very complex, but the legal question that is presented to you today is relatively straightforward to state."
2015.14-510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,103.9,105.55,Are you talking about the Ramah?
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,105.55,106.07,Yes.
2015.14-510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,107.05,114.925,"And -- and that was a -- a decision, unpublished decision by a district court. It never went any further."
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,114.925,135.96,"Well, it is still a certified class, Justice Ginsburg, and the Menominee Tribe not only is a member of that class but has, to date, received a portion of several settlements that were entered into in that class action and, in fact, is poised to receive another large payment in a settlement that the class and the United States --"
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,135.96,136.47,The issue --
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,136.47,137.5,-- has asked the Court to approve.
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,137.5,145.27,The issue that that case settled or addressed was whether exhaustion was required at all.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,182.975,194.525,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, I have a couple of answers to your question. First of all, the United States did not challenge the certification of the class in the Ramah case."
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,202.42,203.91,But they raised the argument just lost.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,218.07,229.44,"Oh, they argued, but the district court judge in the Ramah case reasonably, we think, concluded that, because of the unique nature of the claims that the Ramah class was seeking --"
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,229.44,240.38,"I know that's what you believe, but every other court up until that time had said no, you needed to exhaust. Now, we can go to a separate question of exhaust-when later."
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,248.16,250.76,"Well, the Menominee Tribe didn't rely just on that case."
2015.14-510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,306.31,306.89,Mr. Strommer --
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,306.89,307.14,But then --
2015.14-510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,307.14,314.035,-- all of this goes to deciding whether the legal advice they received was reasonable legal advice.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,328.66,330.49,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,332.16,341.66,"So you're really -- you're really arguing a -- a remarkable proposition, that if you get bad legal advice, that justifies equitable tolling."
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,341.66,342.39,"Well, that's --"
2015.14-510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.39,365.269,"You -- you mentioned extraordinary circumstances, but our -- our cases refer to extraordinary circumstances that stood in the way and prevented timely filing. I -- I would not qualify erroneous legal advice as preventing time -- timely filing."
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,369.24,378.67,"Well, Your Honor, in the context of class-action tolling, there is always a legal judgment call made about whether or not class-action tolling applies."
2015.14-510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.46,431.265,You -- you want us to -- to limit our principle of erroneous legal advice justifies erroneous equitable tolling only in class-action cases?
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,431.265,431.53,No.
2015.14-510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.06,445.69,But your limiting it to class actions.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,449.1,450.98,Because the party still has to show the circumstances.
2015.14-510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,450.98,456.785,"-- if erroneous legal justifies equitable tolling, why should it be limited to class actions?"
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,456.785,460.58,"Well, the Holland test still has to be satisfied, Your Honor."
2015.14-510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,462.405,462.69,Right.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,462.69,464.43,Have to show extraordinary circumstances.
2015.14-510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,465.28,467.335,That prevent -- that prevent the test prongs at all.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,467.335,467.905,Right.
2015.14-510,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.905,481.435,"But -- but if legal advice prevents tiling -- timely filing in class-action situations, I don't know why bad legal advice doesn't prevent tile -- timely filing in every other situation as well."
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,487.3,492.97,"Well, Justice Scalia, the circumstances in this case are extraordinary and are -- are very rare."
2015.14-510,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,512.1,519.89,"What was the length of time between the denial of class certification and -- and the presentment? It was a long time, wasn't it?"
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,519.89,525.53,"The total amount was 707 days, Your Honor."
2015.14-510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,525.53,543.875,"So why was that due diligence -- I mean, I know that we're not arguing about due diligence, but it seems to me that, when there was -- certification was denied in the Cherokee case, you had two years to present and you would have been home free."
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,560.17,566.95,"Well, in the context of reliance on class-action tolling applying, Your Honor, it is due diligence."
2015.14-510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,576.17,577.24,But the class action is over.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,578.52,579.485,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2015.14-510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,579.485,581.815,The class action has been denied.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,581.815,582.51,Correct.
2015.14-510,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,582.51,585.58,So at that point you know you're on your own.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,593.62,602.155,"Well, Your Honor, under class-action tolling rules, you're entitled to the entire period that the class-action certification was pending."
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,603.79,604.05,Actually --
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,604.05,604.75,-- you're automatically allowed.
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,604.75,605.96,-- that's not quite true.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,654.415,656.455,All right.
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,666.24,667.06,"Well, let's go back to Justice --"
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,667.06,669.04,-- reliance is found ineffective because class-action tolling.
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,669.04,670.05,-- Scalia's question ask you a question.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,670.05,670.38,I'm sorry.
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,670.38,687.355,"All of these decisions, were they made with the advice of a lawyer? And I have a sense that the Tribe was concerned about its resources and that they were just getting together and talking about this and deciding, we're not going to win under the law, so we're not going to file."
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,698.39,712.735,"They relied on legal advice provided by class counsel, who communicated with all putative active class members, and made it clear that the tolling period would apply during the pendency of the certification."
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,714.19,724.735,"If we disagree that that was -- if we think that was unreasonable, what -- your reading of what class counsel said, what would happen?"
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,724.735,748.01,"Well, we still think the backdrop against which the Tribe was making the decision -- which is as a member of a class that had been certified where presentment had not been found to be an obstacle because of the unique nature of the claims at issue in the case -- should be an important factor that this Court will factor into whether or not equitable tolling should apply."
2015.14-510,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,748.01,762.24,"But it has not been found by a single district court, right? I mean, you're saying that that single district court should have had such power in the Tribe's mind that they didn't do the presentment."
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,773.12,774.36,"That's true, Your Honor."
2015.14-510,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,807.53,812.88,"They benefitted, but the point is there is one court that says your Tribe can be a member."
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,901.695,904.54,"Well, I -- I would not agree with one of your premises."
2015.14-510,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,904.54,906.04,You probably wouldn't agree with any of them.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,906.59,937.115,"Not -- not your conclusion or one of your premises. But the premise that I disagree with -- that I think is very important is that the Cherokee Nation complaint alleged the same kinds of system-wide short-fundings by the United States that were contained in the Ramah complaint. The Ramah complaint initially, when it was certified, only included one category of claims, called ""miscalculation claims."" But later on, during the pendency of the Cherokee Nation case, additional claims were added."
2015.14-510,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,988.85,997.88,"You're not making that kind of claim here, are you? I mean, you're not challenging the general practices of the government."
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,1003.09,1004.05,"That's correct, Your Honor. We're --"
2015.14-510,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1004.05,1005.08,If that's correct --
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,1005.08,1005.34,Well --
2015.14-510,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1005.34,1026.085,"Well, then the fact that the second case emphasized the general -- you know, the general attack, which lacks in your case, is more reason for thinking that we better file our claims quickly because what had -- they held in those two cases are not going to help us, who have an individual claim."
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,1037.53,1051.355,"I would disagree with part of what you're suggesting, Your Honor, which is that the Tribe only had one option, which was to file, essentially, after the Cherokee Nation's certification decision was issued."
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1092.875,1093.54,But wait.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,1107.38,1108.405,In Cherokee Nation?
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1108.405,1110.18,"No, in the prior case."
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,1110.18,1110.945,No.
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1112.7,1113.01,Yes.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,1113.01,1114.38,-- the Tribe is a member of the class.
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1115.69,1116.22,"No, no, no, no, no."
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,1123.43,1125.93,"That's in the second case. That's in the Cherokee Nation case, Your Honor."
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1125.93,1127.015,Yes.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,1127.015,1129.86,And they said that when they filed the complaint.
2015.14-510,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1157.31,1159.14,But you haven't answered my question.
2015.14-510,0,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,1163.34,1177.445,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct, that's the only advice in the record. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."
2015.14-510,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1177.445,1187.975,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Eisenstein."
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1187.975,1198.145,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Sotomayor, you stated the Tribe determined that it was not going to win on the law, and so it decided not to file."
2015.14-510,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1253.905,1266.11,"How did it know that, in Cherokee Nation? He claims that the only decision was on -- under Rule 23, and that presentment and tolling was not at issue there."
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1266.11,1279.135,"Your Honor, the -- the Tribe confuses the definition of the class and the class certification decision with its own -- whether the -- the court's own jurisdiction over its claim."
2015.14-510,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1300.235,1305.44,"Well, let's talk about the American Pipe tolling."
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1324.97,1327.4,"I agree, Your Honor, that they can present --"
2015.14-510,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1327.4,1327.61,All right.
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1369.065,1370.64,"That -- that's correct, Your Honor."
2015.14-510,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1434.96,1437.015,"Well, this is a slightly different argument."
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1444.175,1445.06,"Your Honor, I'm saying --"
2015.14-510,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1445.06,1448.355,Even if they could get tolled for filing a lawsuit.
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1448.355,1449.55,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-510,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1576.165,1590.76,Can you explain something in -- in your brief that would seem to make all of this beside the point? You several times referred to a release form that covered the years in question.
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1612.005,1622.55,"Well, Your Honor, certainly on the merits, we agree with you, that the release would foreclose the right of the Tribe to collect on these particular years."
2015.14-510,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1645.81,1652.785,Did the Indian Health Service have the authority to require the Tribe to release those claims during the contract closeout process?
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1652.785,1655.49,"Your Honor, there's no specific statutory authority."
2015.14-510,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1681.41,1684.985,What would have happened if they refused to sign the release?
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1684.985,1697.28,"Well, the -- the declaration of the contracting officer that's in the record speaks to that point which said that there would be no adverse consequences to a tribe that refused to sign the release or that signed the release with exceptions."
2015.14-510,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1713.945,1717.305,So it turned out there were consequences after all.
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1717.305,1728.37,"Well, there weren't consequences in terms of its ability to contract with his, or -- or the terms on which it could contract with his going forward."
2015.14-510,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1782.98,1794.77,Are there any circumstances in which reliance on legal advice could constitute the extraordinary circumstance required for equitable tolling?
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1794.77,1798.79,"Your Honor, I think it's -- this Court has never recognized as such."
2015.14-510,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1812.475,1817.78,That it's settled in all 13 circuits.
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1829.285,1863.22,"Well, Your Honor, I think in that -- in your hypothetical, it would be the reliance on the binding circuit precedent, not the reliance on counsel's advice per se, especially if counsel's advice was -- was poor -- poorly rendered. But in the case -- if you're asking if there was a situation where binding precedent afforded more time to a litigant but yet later was determined that less time was available, that may be -- may be a circumstance that could qualify for tolling, but only where other factors are met."
2015.14-510,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1864.5,1877.21,"So how about it's not 13, it's 12, but you're in a circuit that hasn't ruled. You mean that it's -- it wouldn't be an extraordinary circumstance in that situation?"
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1877.21,1890.94,"Well, Your Honor, that was the case in Pace, for example, where the litigant in that case claimed that he was relying on then binding and existing Third Circuit precedent in believing that his time for filing a Federal habeas action was tolled."
2015.14-510,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1890.94,1891.91,That's one circuit.
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1894.415,1894.99,Right.
2015.14-510,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1894.99,1896.015,12 out of 13.
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1896.015,1904.02,"And even in those cases, like in Duncan, this Court overturned a large number of circuits in terms of the tolling standard."
2015.14-510,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1920.05,1920.385,Fair.
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1921.68,1922.285,Yes.
2015.14-510,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1984.48,1989.299,Was the government harmed in any way by the -- the lack of presentment?
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,1989.299,1992.64,"Well, Your Honor, in some respects it remains to be seen."
2015.14-510,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2046.795,2056.465,"The D.C. Circuit said this is presentment, this is just paperwork, easy -- easy to do."
2015.14-510,1,56068,ilana_eisenstein,,2078.97,2103.345,"Your Honor, there's no doubt that perhaps the D.C. Circuit's envelope-and-a-stamp may have been a bit of hyperbole. But that said, what the Tribe's argument, that it was the subsequent deadlines that would have led it to delay, is really an astounding proposition, which is that their basis for tolling is the existence of the statutes of limitation."

2015.14-510,2,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,2174.7,2188.4,"Thank you, Your Honor. I'll start with a few comments on the last point that counsel made. The stamp-and-an-envelope quote is more than hyperbole; it's just flat wrong."
2015.14-510,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2302.58,2308.79,There -- there are so many people who don't have resources to pursue a litigation.
2015.14-510,2,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,2346.9,2366.02,"Well, the -- the primary basis, Your Honor, for the Tribe's position that equitable tolling should apply is its reasonable reliance on class-action tolling. The other factors, such as the cost of litigation, such as the United States' fiduciary responsibility and trust responsibility towards the Tribe --"
2015.14-510,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2366.02,2369.805,"If it was reasonable, why didn't you litigate that?"

2015.14-510,2,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,2377.125,2389.94,"Well, there were two cases. Both the Federal circuit and the D.C. Circuit ruled just about the same time on that issue, and both concluded the same, that class-action tolling was not available because of the presentment requirement."
2015.14-510,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2389.94,2391.48,To seek cert. on that question?
2015.14-510,2,26091,geoffrey_d_strommer,,2391.48,2412.16,"The Arctic Slope, the other case, did, so -- so there was no split in the circuits, and the Arctic Slope case did, in fact, petition this Court, and this Court didn't take the case. So the Menominee Tribe chose not to throw bad money after -- after a bad result, which was guaranteed, by preparing a petition cert., which this Court had already denied in the Arctic Slope Native case."
