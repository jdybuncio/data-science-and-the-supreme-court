1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,23.277,"We'll hear next in argument No. 90-762, Thomas Freytag v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,52.396,65.643,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-762,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,229.347,231.018,"Well, it precludes... it precludes making the decision of the court."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,231.018,231.84,--That's correct.
1990.90-762,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,232.4,240.957,"I'm not sure if it precludes making the decision, which is subject to the review of the court, in de novo proceeding."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,240.957,243.291,"--That may be right, Justice Kennedy."
1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,318.003,318.704,What page of the... this is--
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,318.704,321.896,--Cert. petition appendix A92.
1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,321.896,322.867,--A92.
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,323.267,331.933,"Specifically, Mr. Chief Justice, the last sentence of that paragraph (c) on A92."
1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,404.177,415.384,"When you say... when you say de novo review, Ms. Sullivan, you mean complete examination of every question of fact without any presumption of correctness at all?"
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,415.384,417.898,"Not necessarily, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,445.754,449.508,"Well, you... do you mean demonstrate by some sort of a written opinion of his own?"
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,449.508,456.202,"Not necessarily, but at least by the operation of a general rule that provides that this engagement will take place."
1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,459.525,470.974,"Well, but you're saying as I understand it that this particular tax court rule which we're talking about here ensures that the special judges will end up deciding the cases."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,480.919,481.299,That's right.
1990.90-762,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,515.212,515.693,Ms. Sullivan--
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,515.693,516.323,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1990.90-762,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,516.323,523.99,--Did the... did the petitioners here agree to the assignment to the special trial judge?
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,524.411,531.253,"Look... there are three key moments in the case, Justice O'Connor, in answer to that question."
1990.90-762,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,616.624,618.797,"So, your answer is, yes, there was consent."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,618.797,619.057,Yes.
1990.90-762,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,619.057,627.673,"I... if that's the situation, I'm not sure that we would reach any problem with the rule."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,627.673,635.978,"Justice O'Connor, let me be clear on a distinction between this case... the Freytag case... and the Peretz case which you just heard."
1990.90-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,724.692,727.025,You're going to tell us now what's wrong with that?
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,727.025,728.665,"Yes, Justice Blackmun."
1990.90-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,752.721,754.343,What if... what if it were 5 days?
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,754.343,769.583,"Justice Blackmun, as I've said before, we rely on the presumption of administrative regularity under the tax court's own rules, even if you should indulge the Government's speculation that it might have been 5 days."
1990.90-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,812.945,818.24,"Well, that... that's the very reason why I wonder why you're making such a big point out of the same day."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,818.24,820.031,"Ah, yes."
1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.334,862.014,Reading from page A91?
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,862.014,871.12,"--Page A91, rule 183, paragraph b, final two lines of the rule... final three lines."
1990.90-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,901.43,903.033,The first... Judge Sterrett was chief judge.
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,903.033,903.711,--That's right.
1990.90-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,903.711,904.642,He knew what was going on.
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,904.642,905.634,Well--
1990.90-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,905.634,906.843,He must have known what was going on.
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,906.843,907.754,"--Actually, Your Honor--"
1990.90-762,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,907.754,908.285,I'd like to ask him.
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,912.879,917.283,"--Like the line in Annie Hall where Woody Allen says, I just happen to have Marshall McLuhan right here."
1990.90-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,949.614,950.455,Ms. Sullivan.
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,950.455,950.836,"Yes, Justice?"
1990.90-762,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,950.836,966.086,"Would you be satisfied with the usual expression that I think you and I have seen of an appellate court judge who says, I have reviewed all of the objections of appellate and find no merit in any of them?"
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,968.708,970.601,"I believe we might accept that, Justice Marshall."
1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1050.745,1051.597,Ms. Sullivan--
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1051.597,1052.237,"--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.237,1060.953,--I wonder if questions of these rather detailed facts are fairly subsumed under the questions presented in your writ of petition... writ of certiorari?
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1060.953,1074.482,"Mr. Chief Justice, we think clearly so and in haec verba, our first question was not contrary to the Government's suggestion, does the statute permit assignment of special trial judges only to preside at (b)(4) cases."
1990.90-762,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1255.775,1265.311,"Well, have we really gone into any depth in defining who is an inferior officer and who is an employee?"
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1265.311,1278.28,"The cases that we cite in our brief of Germaine from the late 19th century and Burnap, a Justice Brandeis opinion from the early 20th, are perhaps helpful in resolving the question of who is and isn't an officer."
1990.90-762,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1316.453,1318.153,Plus your argument here is at--
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1318.153,1318.744,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
1990.90-762,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.744,1320.304,--cross purposes with your argument earlier--
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1320.304,1320.474,How's that?
1990.90-762,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1320.474,1320.834,--your argument earlier.
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1334.164,1335.896,"That's right, Your Honor."
1990.90-762,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.642,1409.417,"--How about the... all these other courts that Mr. Griswold describes in his brief... the claims court, the territorial courts, the land courts, the District of Columbia courts."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1411.127,1422.834,"Territorial courts we think are unreached by any appointments clause constraint, because when Congress exercises its territorial authority, it is acting in effect as a State."
1990.90-762,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1427.829,1431.212,"What is the District of Columbia, by the way, in your particular dichotomy here?"
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1431.212,1435.153,--I... I'd have to put it over with the territorial courts for purposes of the last remark.
1990.90-762,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1435.364,1435.634,I see.
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1439.017,1443.16,--You need not reach the question whether they're a department because separation of--
1990.90-762,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1443.16,1444.642,"Well, I know, but I'm curious about what your answer would be even if we don't have to reach it."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1444.642,1448.244,--Not a department if you had to reach it.
1990.90-762,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1449.283,1452.375,So they are courts of law within the meaning of the appointments clause.
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1452.375,1455.238,Not courts of law or executive departments.
1990.90-762,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1456.74,1456.88,What are they?
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1456.88,1460.593,--they are out... you need not decide that.
1990.90-762,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1464.464,1465.486,No we... assume we want to.
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1467.786,1474.571,Assuming you wish to issue... I can't assume you would wish to issue an advisory opinion on the status of the fourth branch.
1990.90-762,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1481.268,1482.478,"Yes, but what I'm... I'm asking--"
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1488.552,1498.379,--We argue that they are not empowered under the appointments clause to appoint officers because they are... you need not reach it but if you had to... they are neither courts of law nor--
1990.90-762,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1498.379,1500.42,"Well, they were empowered by statute to appoint clerks, who are inferior officers."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1500.42,1501.582,--Maybe employees.
1990.90-762,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1504.744,1506.267,"Well, let's assume for a moment they were inferior officers."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1526.903,1536.76,They are not courts of law because they lack the independence guaranteed article III courts through the salary and tenure clauses of article III.
1990.90-762,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1540.413,1543.295,Do they exercise the judicial power or are--
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1543.295,1543.896,They may do so.
1990.90-762,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1553.957,1562.252,"--Well, we're asking what is a court, and you're saying it exercises part of the judicial power, and Congress calls it... calls it a court."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1565.984,1568.766,--Absolutely for appointment clause purposes.
1990.90-762,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.86,1575.921,Which you and the Government now agree.
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1575.921,1584.698,"--Now agree after many changes of heart on the Government's part, which is why you cannot rely on the executive branch to preserve and champion the appointments clause in this case."
1990.90-762,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.059,1588.872,And that's why maybe the appointment was if... with the courts of law then.
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1588.872,1600.673,--On courts of law... to be... courts of law and heads of department make sense if the goal of the Constitution is to distance from Congress the awesome power to appoint executive officers.
1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1631.923,1639.059,"Well, Ms. Sullivan is it your position that in the case of a territorial court, Congress could provide that the Speaker of the House would appoint the judges?"
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1639.059,1642.27,They might raise in... certain... certainly not.
1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1649.237,1652.52,The appointments clause just wouldn't apply in your view?
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1652.52,1653.138,--The appointments clause would not apply.
1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1653.138,1655.561,"Well, what's our closest case to support--"
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1655.561,1658.784,"The answer to your question is yes, that our argument would permit Congress to make that--"
1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1658.784,1660.194,--And what's the closest case--
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1660.194,1660.334,--hiring decision.
1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1660.885,1664.938,--What's the closest case from this Court that supports that position do you think?
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1664.938,1678.546,"There's no case I know of that supports that position, so long as Congress is not appointing itself officers of the United States, as you ruled it couldn't do in Buckley, an appointments clause is not presented."
1990.90-762,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.079,1684.601,"Well, let me ask you one other question though."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1684.601,1684.881,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1990.90-762,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1684.881,1690.935,"If they're... if they're not courts of law and they're an executive department, as you agree with the Government, why then isn't the chief judge the head of the department?"
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1690.935,1695.539,"Not a department, can't be a department, no executive functions whatsoever."
1990.90-762,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1697.509,1697.699,What are they?
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1699.712,1712.071,--It may be that Congress should not... in the Government's view perhaps in other view... people's view... perhaps Congress should not create entities that are outside the tripartite structure of Government but it has.
1990.90-762,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1712.071,1712.191,"Well, maybe they shouldn't have."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1715.163,1719.457,Congress moved it out of the executive branch in 1969.
1990.90-762,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1732.076,1739.461,That... that's like the FCC and the independent regulatory agencies who are considered... who are considered heads of... heads of departments.
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1740.643,1740.803,--They might well be.
1990.90-762,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1780.165,1780.485,"Thank you, Ms. Sullivan."
1990.90-762,0,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1780.485,1781.276,--regular tax court judge.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1784.199,1789.441,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-762,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1882.988,1901.65,"Well, Mr. Roberts, I guess the first part of the argument here today went to the statutory argument, and as to that it was asserted that there was no waiver of the argument that the tax courts own rules are improper."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1901.65,1907.376,"--Your Honor, the petitioners did waive that argument as well in a sense that they did not raise it before the tax court."
1990.90-762,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1918.653,1933.454,"So that question is before us, and do you... are you going to address yourself to part (c) of the rule that says the findings of fact recommended by the special trial judge shall be presumed to be correct?"
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1933.454,1941.511,"--I'll do so right now, but before I do so would point out that that issue is a very good indication of why we have a waiver rule."
1990.90-762,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1969.229,1970.591,At what point would it have done so?
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1974.053,1981.119,"--Well, petitioners today argue that rule 183(c) prevents the tax court from exercising de novo review."
1990.90-762,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2002.434,2014.19,"Mr. Roberts, before you get into the substance, what about the argument that you didn't cross appeal... that the... that the court of appeals did decide the waiver point, decided against you, and you didn't cross appeal?"
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2014.19,2016.574,It decided two waiver points.
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2108.447,2112.541,"Mr. Roberts, surely what matters is what he must do, not what he may do."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2119.216,2120.325,--He is--
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.325,2123.217,"It seems to me, to support your position, you have to say he must."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2123.217,2124.789,"--He must, and--"
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2124.789,2128.772,I know all this is... all the sentence you rely on just says he may.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2128.772,2129.582,"--No, section--"
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2129.582,2140.32,"Whereas the last sentence says, due regard shall be given to the circumstance of the special trial judge had the opportunity to evaluate... blah, blah, blah... and the findings of fact shall be presumed to be correct."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2140.32,2146.594,"--The sentence that I read says may because it lists a number of things, including some that are inconsistent that he may do."
1990.90-762,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2163.069,2196.339,"Well, Mr. Roberts, just... if we thought that the last sentence of that rule required the tax court division to which the report is assigned to give the special trial judge's recommendations a presumption that they are correct... a clearly erroneous standard of review... now, if that... if that is our reading of it, is that consistent with the authorizing statute?"
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2196.339,2200.242,"--Well, with respect, there are two different points in your question."
1990.90-762,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2205.067,2206.356,Take them both.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2206.356,2206.686,I--
1990.90-762,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2206.686,2209.148,Is... are they consistent with the statute?
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2209.148,2210.2,--The first is.
1990.90-762,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2259.455,2262.927,Are the proposed findings of the parties submitted to the special trial judge?
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2262.927,2263.508,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2264.92,2265.13,Mr. Roberts--
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2265.13,2270.555,"--And they're, of course, available and go on to the regular judge when he's reviewing."
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2270.555,2273.016,"--At a minimum, Mr. Roberts,"
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2284.755,2288.608,"If it's... if it's a straight tie, then that's what it... that's what it means."
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2288.809,2289.019,Right.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2290.591,2297.997,"Yes, I believe it is, because I don't think that type of review is abdicating responsibility in any way for a decision."
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2299.76,2301.56,He in effect decides the case then.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2301.56,2301.92,--Well--
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2301.92,2303.993,If what he says goes.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2303.993,2304.382,"--Well, no--"
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2304.382,2304.873,If everything else is in--
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2304.873,2308.735,--because it also has to be evaluated with the... with the... the burden of proof.
1990.90-762,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2317.37,2328.887,"--Suppose the tax court judge said in exercising my determination whether to reject or accept this depart... this report, I must keep in mind that it is presumed to be correct."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2332.07,2332.751,--Certainly.
1990.90-762,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2337.165,2342.67,So that he... so that he must presume it correct before he exercises his discretion to reject it or adopt it?
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2342.67,2348.004,"--The question is what weight is given the presumption, and that's not a uniform rule."
1990.90-762,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2421.699,2425.303,Of course you don't submit proposed findings to a law clerk.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2425.303,2438.279,"Well, I suppose in the district court it's not unusual to have proposed findings submitted to a court, and then a law clerk could do a draft of those and submit it to his judge, who of course has the responsibility for decision."
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2438.689,2445.505,What does it mean... due regard shall be given to the circumstance of the special judge have the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of witnesses?
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2445.505,2445.825,--Well--
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2445.825,2447.995,What does it mean to give due regard to that?
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2452.299,2453.11,--No.
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2453.11,2454.24,"If it doesn't mean that, it's meaningless, isn't it?"
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2454.24,2461.055,"Well, it may well be meaningless in the sense that the regular judge always the retains the responsibility to decide the case."
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2468.15,2468.311,"Oh, I see."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2468.431,2469.914,--their responsibility to decide the case.
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2469.914,2470.064,I see.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2472.237,2474.621,"No, I think due regard means due regard."
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.755,2494.479,But he's not... he's not going to interview the witnesses.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2503.536,2507.87,"Well, with respect, Your Honor, the tax court has, and the Rosenbaum decision is a good example."
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.821,2524.335,"But the good [inaudible], which their rule requires, I'd reverse them, too."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2526.606,2532.709,"--Absolutely not, Your Honor, because the tax court has not acquiesced in the Stone decision."
1990.90-762,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2548.86,2557.675,"--Well, Mr. Poberts, to get back to my question, which you never did answer, suppose it does mean it's reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2561.769,2563.742,"I think it might well, Your Honor."
1990.90-762,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2563.742,2563.892,Okay.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2563.892,2574.21,In the sense that a clearly erroneous standard is closer... the statute requires that the regular tax court judge in this category of cases make the decision.
1990.90-762,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2574.21,2574.49,Yes.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2574.49,2579.895,And I think under a clearly erroneous standard that may be abdicating too much of his statutory responsibility.
1990.90-762,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2579.895,2582.177,"Well, what if it's just a presumption?"
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2582.177,2595.336,"Well, if it's a presumption of the sort that it is here, as the tax court has told us... essentially that means that's where you start... now, let me see what the evidence is, let me review the matter... then it's perfectly consistent with the statutory language."
1990.90-762,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2639.618,2644.781,"Well, I take it there would be some concern if there was a rule that the law clerk's draft was presumed correct."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2647.365,2651.446,--I recognize I'm... as treading on sensitive grounds but--
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.733,2731.976,"I'm trying to think, Mr. Roberts... and not since I've been here anyway... but do we ever, when we have a special master here in original case and the parties don't agree with the disposition of the special master, do we ever adopt the decision of the special master without giving a hearing?"
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2731.976,2735.977,"I don't know either way, Your Honor."
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2737.51,2738.271,I think we don't.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2738.271,2741.243,"--Well, in this case, of course--"
1990.90-762,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.243,2742.625,Before the Court.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2742.625,2743.825,--Before the Court.
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2847.87,2848.48,May I back up just a second?
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2872.038,2883.318,--Because the duties that are required... that require an officer of the United States... an officer of the United States can perform duties that do not require an officer that may be performed by a mere employee.
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2887.178,2888.33,"Oh, I see your... I see what you're saying."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2888.33,2896.995,"--does not require an officer... and therefore, that he may do other things which he did not do in this case that require an officer... don't give them standing to complain about those."
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2952.221,2957.216,Now the Government take... now take the same position with respect to all these other courts that I referred to before?
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2960.819,2963.45,"Your Honor, each case has to be considered on--"
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2963.45,2963.7,I understand.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2963.7,2964.269,--on its merits.
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2973.044,2973.395,Right.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2973.395,2976.009,So the clause may not apply directly.
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2988.215,2998.443,"Well, tell me again why the different power of Congress is exercising... creating the District of Columbia courts and territorial courts... but why does that make the appointment clause issue any different?"
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2998.443,3010.291,"Well, because we don't... because Congress in those instances has the authority to establish a local government, and a local government that need not comply with the tripartite separation of powers in the Federal Government."
1990.90-762,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3014.424,3018.037,"Well, you don't think that Congress could... or maybe you do... appoint a territorial governor?"
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3018.037,3018.458,--No.
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3048.803,3052.776,But I don't understand your answer to Justice Kennedy.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3058.75,3066.414,"Well, I think it does apply in that instance, because it would do violence to the... to the separation of powers that is at the base of the appointments clause."
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.237,3089.949,Then Congress could appoint the staff of the governor and the staff of the court.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3089.949,3098.885,"No, Congress could authorize the court to appoint its staff even though we may have trouble saying that that's an executive department or a court of law."
1990.90-762,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3104.859,3110.733,"Well, are you resting on the appointments clause or just a concept of congressional power?"
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3110.733,3122.961,"Well, it's an... it's an interplay between the appointments clause and Congress' powers with respect to the territories and the District of Columbia which gives rise to creatures that are hard to fit into the terms of the appointments clause."
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3124.153,3128.116,"Well, the appointments clause gives some power of courts of law to make appointments."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3137.124,3139.146,"--I don't see any objection to that, no."
1990.90-762,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3205.128,3218.529,"Well, is it absolutely certain and... and have... has this Court ever decided that the term courts of law in the appointments clause is of necessity the same as an article III court?"
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3218.529,3221.121,"--No, it is an issue of first impression before--"
1990.90-762,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3221.121,3221.291,Right.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3221.291,3222.22,--this Court as I understand it.
1990.90-762,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3321.478,3321.708,What are--
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3332.825,3333.736,It may--
1990.90-762,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3333.736,3337.279,--the Freedom of Information Act and so forth and so on?
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3337.279,3337.618,--Those--
1990.90-762,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3337.618,3340.991,All the things Congress tried very hard to prevent.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3340.991,3349.367,"--Well, they may or may not, Your Honor, and it depends on an evaluation of the statute in '69 and of the Administrative Procedures Act."
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3371.112,3373.363,May I ask how is the chief judge of this court appointed?
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3373.363,3376.476,The chief judge is elected by the regular judges on a--
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3376.476,3380.088,And is that... is that a valid method of appointing a head of a department in the executive branch?
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3380.088,3384.623,--No challenge has been raised to that--
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3384.623,3390.256,"Well, I know no challenge has been raised, but under your argument it is clearly invalid, is it not, because the appointment was not made by the head of a department?"
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3390.256,3398.23,"--Well, it would have to be considered, not only a separate office, but what the chief... the... the attributes of the chief judge that are different from--"
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3398.23,3400.033,"Well, surely the chief judge is an officer of the United States."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3400.033,3401.122,--The chief judge is an officer of the United States.
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3406.357,3409.65,"Well, it gives him the authority to appoint assistant trial judges."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3409.65,3411.46,--Yes.
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3411.46,3412.712,"That's pretty importance difference, I guess."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3412.712,3415.283,"Well, it is... it is a difference."
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3418.167,3423.09,But under your argument it is clear that the present appointment of the chief judge of the court is invalid I think?
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3423.09,3426.082,"--Well, with respect, Your Honor, I'm not sure that that is clear."
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3427.121,3431.335,"I know it hasn't been raised, but I'm trying to think of the implications of accepting your argument."
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3431.335,3434.677,"--Well, we would have to look at all the added authority--"
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3434.677,3442.832,"Can you give me a reason why, consistent with your argument, that the appointment could be valid... the appointment by his colleagues as chief judge?"
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3442.832,3447.646,"--Well, one question would be is whether or not his additional authorities are such as require a separate appointment."
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3447.646,3448.195,I see.
1990.90-762,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3448.195,3458.142,"And it may be, for example, that the head of a collegial body does not have to have a separate appointment particularly here where the collegial body acts together in electing him."
1990.90-762,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3463.636,3466.687,But not a head of a department with authority to appoint assistant trial judges?
