2015.14-6166,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.524,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-6166, Taylor v. United States. Mr. Jones."
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,10.524,19.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Hobbs Act has two elements."
2015.14-6166,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,74.735,107.085,"One of the things you say in your brief is that you were not even given the opportunity to show that the victims dealt exclusively in home-grown marijuana. If you -- if you had that opportunity, how will you have shown that this, the marijuana in question, was grown in Virginia rather than some other place, some other State?"
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,107.085,136.755,"Your Honor, they're -- in all likelihood, I would either call as a witness a retired DEA agent or an ATF agent or a retired local police officer who had years of experience in that field qualifying that person. Virginia is -- is a State, like all the other States, that has the ability to grow marijuana in-State."
2015.14-6166,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,172.43,182.0,"And that could show that it could have been grown, but you could say that for every State in the Union."
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,202.72,208.83,"We're -- for one thing, it could have cross-examined him on -- on that point."
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,219.465,222.35,"Well, Mr. Jones, suppose you had been able to show this."
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,233.59,245.13,"Under the -- under the terms of the Hobbs Act, the government would have borne the proof of going forward and -- and showing an effect on -- on interstate commerce with -- with that --"
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,245.13,246.23,"Well, you see, that's the thing."
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,293.99,331.7,"I think the difference between -- I think what Hobbs addressed -- excuse me -- what Raich addressed was, of course, the Controlled Substance Act. Controlled Substance Act is -- is a matter of regulation of -- of interstate commerce and not so much -- did not address, as a -- as a separate issue, the effect on -- on commerce. So what the Hobbs Act in our view addresses is the effect, not so much the regulation. A -- a reading of -- of the Raich case, the -- the words --"
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,331.7,344.18,But -- but doesn't the Hobbs -- doesn't Raich say that the government has -- the United States has jurisdiction over intrastate drug trafficking?
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,344.18,345.385,"It does, Your Honor."
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,345.385,352.95,"So why isn't that enough? Because this statute, again, does not require that there be an effect on interstate commerce."
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,373.565,381.08,"Raich does say that, but the plain language of the Hobbs Act and the -- the essence of the crime itself is the effect."
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,394.31,395.41,Well --
2015.14-6166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,395.41,400.735,"Well, then you could make the same argument if it was conceded that these drugs were an interstate."
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,403.9,404.8,"Yes, sir."
2015.14-6166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,404.8,410.389,"Based on your answer to Justice Kagan, doesn't make any difference whether it's local or interstate."
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,410.389,411.26,Well --
2015.14-6166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,411.26,413.17,There is still a failure of proof somehow.
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,413.17,414.7,There is a failure of proof here.
2015.14-6166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,414.7,416.965,That's -- that's very hard -- that's very hard to comprehend.
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,416.965,419.59,"Your Honor, there was no proof here."
2015.14-6166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,430.44,436.22,Do you -- do you think robbery of an item in interstate commerce has an effect on that commerce?
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,436.22,448.305,Do I think robbery of -- of goods in interstate commerce have an effect on interstate commerce? Or does the government in every case have to show that there is an effect?
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,448.305,449.99,I think if the goods are --
2015.14-6166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,449.99,464.645,"The government in every case in your submission has to show that if there's a robbery of goods in interstate commerce, that it has to put on an economic expert to show that there's an effect on interstate commerce when there's been a robbery. That's your position?"
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,464.645,465.79,"No, Your Honor."
2015.14-6166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,466.05,466.42,All right.
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,471.545,472.13,Well --
2015.14-6166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,472.13,474.1,You just concluded that it isn't.
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,474.1,486.725,"In -- in the numerous cases that have been cited in our -- our brief, as well as the government's brief, you take for example the Tillery case that -- that is out of the Fourth Circuit."
2015.14-6166,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,548.72,582.325,"Suppose -- suppose the victims of this robbery, the drug dealers, -- suppose the police had a warrant to go into the house and they -- there is marijuana there and they take it. Could the victims -- who were they? They were Worley or Lynch -- could they be prosecuted or could they not be prosecuted because the government was unable to show that the marijuana they possessed came from out of State?"
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,582.325,586.13,Could Worley or Lynch have been prosecuted as a drug dealer?
2015.14-6166,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,586.13,586.22,Yes.
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,586.22,586.73,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-6166,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,587.875,594.64,"They could have been, even though -- even though all of the marijuana came from Virginia?"
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,594.64,602.77,I think they could have been under -- under the Controlled Substance Act under Title 21.
2015.14-6166,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,602.77,612.739,"When Congress enacted the Hobbs Act, did it intend to exercise the full measure of its authority under the Commerce Clause?"
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,612.739,618.71,"History tells us that it did, I think, and this Court's precedence tells us that it did."
2015.14-6166,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,618.71,619.1,All right.
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,641.76,642.72,Excuse me.
2015.14-6166,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,643.925,654.899,"Could it enact a statute that makes it a crime to steal a controlled substance, exercising its Commerce Clause authority under the reasoning of Raich?"
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,654.899,661.41,"It could have, but with -- from our view,"
2015.14-6166,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,672.195,693.95,"On a case-by-case basis, then, why can it prohibit the growing of marijuana across the board without proving anything about the particular marijuana in question, but according to you, it cannot prohibit the sale of -- I'm sorry, the theft of marijuana?"
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,693.95,710.305,"Well, I -- I think our position is that it's -- it's the effect, and -- and the -- the effect can -- can come about in -- in many ways that's been addressed."
2015.14-6166,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,733.77,742.455,Why is that needed -- why is that not needed in a situation in which the person is growing marijuana? For personal use?
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,742.455,754.195,"From our view, the -- 21 U.S.C. 801 regulates all drugs."
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,830.16,830.59,Mr. --
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,830.59,831.08,-- prohibit.
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,831.08,836.03,"Mr. Jones, I guess I'm trying to figure out what we're disagreeing about."
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,851.795,852.905,I disagree with that.
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,852.905,871.535,"But why is that? Because that's what I was saying at the beginning, that it seems clear to me that under the terms of the Hobbs Act, the Hobbs Act does prohibit robberies that affect commerce. Raich says commerce includes both interstate and intrastate marijuana trafficking."
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,883.165,901.34,"I -- I agree from the standpoint that the Controlled Substance Act under Raich regulates. But beyond that point, what the Hobbs -- if Congress had wanted to use the word ""regulate"" rather than ""affects"" --"
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,901.34,901.78,Well --
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,901.78,903.62,-- Congress could very easily have done that.
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,903.62,913.775,"Well, but I said -- I used the word ""affects."" I didn't use the word ""regulate."" I said the Hobbs Act prohibits robberies that affect commerce."
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,938.33,938.63,Yeah.
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,938.83,941.01,-- it's the current of the statute plus Raich.
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,941.01,941.65,Right.
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,980.75,983.9,"Well, I guess this goes back to Justice Kennedy's question."
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,991.225,991.84,Yes --
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,991.84,998.73,"I mean, I don't think that the word ""affects"" is doing a whole lot of work here, because of course a robbery of a business affects a business, right?"
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,998.73,999.695,"Yes, ma'am."
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,999.695,1000.475,Okay.
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,1038.425,1039.8,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-6166,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1043.075,1071.93,"What -- what is the -- the standard of proof that you hold Congress to when it exercises jurisdiction over intrastate businesses with an effect on interstate commerce or interstate commerce? Somebody challenges Congress's exercise of jurisdiction because it doesn't fit within the interstate commerce or effect on interstate commerce, and the statute's evaluated according to what standard?"
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,1071.93,1075.79,I'm not sure that I understand the question.
2015.14-6166,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1075.79,1089.59,"Well, somebody says -- you know, challenges -- as we've had challenges, in cases like Lopez and others -- that, Congress, you don't have authority to regulate this matter, because it doesn't involve interstate commerce, doesn't have an effect on interstate commerce, and so on."
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,1099.265,1138.235,"In -- in congressional hearings, the congressional hearings that we have, and the conclusions that they come to after they go through that process and there's satisfaction of that, they promulgate the law. But if they create in -- in the passage of -- of that acts; for example here, the Hobbs Act is what we're saying is the -- is the plain reading of it, is that if -- if in their wisdom the element is to establish this element, then it becomes an element of the criminal offense. And it's not so much the element of the regulation, but it's the element of the criminal offense."
2015.14-6166,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1160.35,1165.65,I don't think there's any question that this is a jurisdictional element and the jurisdictional element has to be proven.
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,1222.145,1244.305,"In this case I think they were instructed that our -- our view of that instruction was that it was a per se or strict liability instruction; that if -- if -- because in that instruction, it's my recollection that Judge Conrad said, I tell you that if this happened, this is satisfied."
2015.14-6166,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1244.305,1262.26,"Yeah, well, that's -- that's the -- that's what Raich -- that's the interpretation of the Commerce Clause. Do you want the jury to decide what the Commerce Clause means? It would be an interesting -- under those who -- who think that juries once upon a time had the authority to decide legal issues."
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,1268.225,1269.75,"No, sir, I would not."
2015.14-6166,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1351.14,1354.73,"Well, that seems to me a different kind of argument that you're making now."
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,1368.325,1379.985,"That's -- that's where we got here on this case, was -- was the absence of particularized evidence as to what was -- what was taking place here."
2015.14-6166,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1386.38,1403.05,"Wasn't there evidence that this gang, that they were in -- in the business of trying to rob drug dealers because they thought they'd find either the drugs or the money?"
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,1403.05,1415.61,"Mr. Fitzgerald, who, from the evidence of this case, I believe to be an organizer or certainly one of the leaders in this group of individuals."
2015.14-6166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1454.0,1456.145,I don't -- I don't understand where we're going here.
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,1465.505,1467.28,I'm -- I was trying -- I --
2015.14-6166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1467.28,1469.51,So we know that there's a drug dealer here.
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,1471.68,1472.62,"Yes, sir."
2015.14-6166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1472.62,1473.05,All right.
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,1480.5,1481.515,"Well, what --"
2015.14-6166,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1481.515,1482.845,It's not in your petition.
2015.14-6166,0,62668,dennis_e_jones,,1482.845,1527.395,"Our -- our point in our petition was -- is that there was a failure to present particularized evidence of the impact or the effect on -- on interstate commerce as a result of the activities of these people, and we were precluded from addressing that. The whole theory of the case in -- when it was presented in the district court, was -- was twofold; number one, that this interstate -- that the interstate commerce element had -- had not been met, and that there was no particularized evidence to show that this influence or this impact on commerce. May I reserve?"
2015.14-6166,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1527.395,1536.755,"Certainly, Mr. Jones. Mr. Yang."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1536.755,1565.91,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three characteristics of Petitioner's robberies underscore that this case falls within Congress's Commerce Clause power. Petitioner's robberies targeted, first, the inventory in a commodity; two, that inventory belonged to a commercial participant; and third, it was a commercial participant in an established interstate market in marijuana that is a Federally-controlled substance over which Congress has exercised jurisdiction."
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1565.91,1572.76,"So if there weren't the commercial aspect, then you wouldn't -- you wouldn't -- you would have to demonstrate jurisdiction beyond a reasonable doubt?"
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1572.76,1573.57,No.
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1646.35,1657.15,"Well, except that Congress doesn't have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt before exercising its jurisdiction that there's an affect on interstate commerce."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1657.15,1657.65,That -- that's what --
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1657.65,1663.1,"But if you're prosecuting somebody, you do have to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the elements of the crime have been satisfied."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1663.1,1668.06,"Well, what you do need to show is that the robbery affected commerce over which the United States had jurisdiction."
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1668.59,1669.605,Beyond a reasonable doubt.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1669.605,1689.075,"Beyond a reasonable doubt. But we do know that Congress -- that -- from Raich, that Congress does have jurisdiction over the entire marijuana trade. Now, the reason Congress has jurisdiction, as Raich explain -- Raich explained, was it now analyzed under the rational-basis review that often occurs in this type of context."
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1697.47,1716.885,"Yes, I -- I suppose it's a -- maybe an academic question, but your conclusion that Congress has jurisdiction over the marijuana trade is based on a different standard of proof than the criminal one. So yes, you can say of course Congress has jurisdiction here, but that has been established only under, I guess, a rational-basis standard."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1723.96,1726.09,We're not shying away from the standard of proof.
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1790.0,1804.905,"So what's -- what's the instruction that the Court should give to the jury with respect to this jurisdictional element? ""Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard evidence that there was a robbery of a drug dealer."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1807.82,1809.21,"You are -- JUSTICE KENNEDY -- ""that"" --"
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1809.21,1810.67,-- that the marijuana trade --
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1810.67,1821.08,"-- ""that the marijuana trade is a subject over which the Congress has jurisdiction and this statute controls""? That's not a very good interpretation."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1821.08,1824.35,"Well, I think you would -- I think that -- I think that goes a long way there."
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1831.74,1834.38,And there's -- there's nothing for the jury to find on this point?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1834.38,1842.04,"Not on that point. But the jury must determine that there was -- the robbery affected jurisdiction, of which --"
2015.14-6166,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1842.04,1845.965,"Was it -- was there a jury involved in this case, or that -- was this on a plea?"
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1845.965,1847.15,There was a jury.
2015.14-6166,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1847.15,1849.78,There was a jury? So what -- so we don't have to speculate.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1851.09,1855.7,"Well, the judge's instructions, I think, could have been more clear."
2015.14-6166,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1861.265,1862.16,"Well, what was the --"
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1862.16,1866.255,But the jury instructions are -- are basically on page 8 of our brief.
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1916.01,1923.495,"Well, it -- it seems to me that this instruction is much more defendant-friendly than the one you indicated that is a minimum."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1925.0,1925.51,Friendly --
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1925.51,1932.16,"-- I read this -- if -- if I'm the juror, I read these instructions as saying that I have to find that this affects interstate commerce."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1932.16,1936.1,I think the judge could have done -- had a much more government-friendly instruction in this case.
2015.14-6166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1949.81,1963.715,But -- but if -- if -- if I can make sure I understand. The jury is told that you have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant affected commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1963.715,1963.92,Correct.
2015.14-6166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1963.92,1964.455,Is that right?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1964.455,1964.94,That is correct.
2015.14-6166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1964.94,1965.21,Does that have --
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1965.21,1965.54,The jury could --
2015.14-6166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1965.54,1967.3,-- to be found beyond a reasonable doubt?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1967.3,1969.83,It has to find that jurisdiction element beyond a reasonable doubt.
2015.14-6166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1970.6,1981.165,"But whether the United States has jurisdiction over the marijuana trade, be it inter- or interstate, has already been decided by Raich."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,1981.165,1981.8,Correct.
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2000.77,2000.93,Is --
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2000.93,2002.03,-- element beyond a reasonable doubt.
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2002.03,2005.39,Is the defendant allowed to present any evidence to the contrary?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2005.39,2006.66,"Well, on our --"
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2006.66,2009.37,It would be kind of silly to say they've got to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2013.78,2033.17,The defendant is entitled to present evidence that contradict all the relevant facts. But the -- I think what you're asking about is whether the fact that this particular marijuana might have been grown in-State -- right? I think that's what you're saying -- would somehow undermine the jurisdictional element.
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2034.575,2034.88,What --
2015.14-6166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2034.88,2035.16,Is it --
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2035.16,2045.09,"-- in any -- in a marijuana case, what evidence could a defendant put on that would prevent the establishment of the jurisdictional element?"
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2045.09,2050.15,The defendant could show that there was not an attempt to rob a drug dealer of marijuana.
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2050.15,2050.27,No.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2058.26,2058.71,Right.
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2058.71,2063.94,Is there any evidence that a defendant could be allowed to introduce going to the second element?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2063.94,2069.93,"Well, if they were targeting marijuana in that robbery, as was the case here, from marijuana dealers who were trading --"
2015.14-6166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2069.93,2075.05,"But that's the question, Mr. Yang: From marijuana dealers. I mean, it seems to me the defendant could say, ""no."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2089.025,2092.495,"Or, I was just robbing a house, and I happened to stumble upon this. I mean, there are --"
2015.14-6166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2092.495,2092.66,There are --
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2092.66,2095.335,"Yes, but those are two very different things."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2106.47,2126.82,"I mean, I think home consumption raises different issues, and I'll -- I'll tell you why. The Hobbs Act governs robberies that have an affect on commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction. There's some question whether just growing marijuana for your own use by itself is commerce, or whether it's an activity that affects commerce that would bring it within --"
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2126.82,2127.33,Let's say --
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2127.33,2127.925,-- the element of Raich.
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2127.925,2133.43,Let's -- let's say that this Court had a decision that home-grown marijuana has an affect on interstate commerce.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2138.71,2141.68,"Well, if the Court had said that just growing marijuana --"
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2141.68,2145.605,Is contested commerce part -- part of the indictment?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2145.605,2153.27,I -- I think if you're -- if you're asking whether the Court has decided that growing marijuana is itself commerce over which the United States has --
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2153.27,2155.63,Let's -- let's assume -- let's assume the Court has decided that --
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2155.63,2156.28,"Well, then there -- there's --"
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2156.28,2162.23,-- and then there's a trial. Is -- is the defendant entitled to introduce any evidence on that point?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2162.23,2163.355,No.
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2163.355,2164.32,So --
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2164.32,2164.82,Because that's a legal --
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2164.82,2178.679,So does the jury have any discretion to -- to return a verdict of not guilty if it finds that there was a robbery of a drug dealer -- of -- of -- of drugs that have been home grown?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2178.679,2181.94,"Under your predicate, no, there would not."
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2182.73,2182.88,What --
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2182.88,2186.735,"This is not new in the law, right? I mean, juries are instructed on the law."
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2195.74,2215.74,"Well, it may -- that may be familiar in the law, but I'm not aware of any case where the burden is on the government to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt, an element of the crime, and you're saying there's no way that the defendant -- no evidence that defendant could introduce -- could rebut the government's showing, in any case."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2215.74,2217.485,I don't --
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2217.485,2220.2,What -- what's your best authority for that proposition?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2220.2,2233.63,I guess it depends on what you consider to be the element of the offense and how you define it as a legal matter. What we're -- what we're saying is the jury does have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the jurisdictional element was met.
2015.14-6166,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2290.98,2302.915,Does the government have to prove anything in this case different from what it would have to prove if this was a charge of robbery under State law?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2302.915,2304.84,"Well, yes."
2015.14-6166,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2340.99,2344.335,"Still, it's very odd that this is a Federal case."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2352.94,2367.6,"What you're seeing is part of the whole Federal investigation here, if you remember that this was an investigation into the Southwest Goonz, which was a gang that was engaged in particularly violent and dangerous robberies in Roanoke."
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2398.575,2401.63,"The tagalong, he got 20 years."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2401.63,2405.09,"Well, and he was involved in some very serious crimes."
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2406.85,2409.5,"Actually, I think got 21, my chambers was telling me."
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2410.23,2410.65,A year's a year.
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2410.65,2442.485,"Which is, to me, one -- one year too many, but whatever. Going -- going back to this case, the example that you gave with reference to the maritime jurisdiction, what you tell the jury is, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you find that the incidents that have been considered in this court occurred on the high seas, then the jurisdictional element is satisfied."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2442.485,2443.6,Yes.
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2446.075,2446.64,Pardon me?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2446.64,2449.06,You'd also have to define what the high seas were for the jury.
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2449.06,2449.83,Okay.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2459.435,2461.93,We think it's a little easier than that in this case.
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2473.805,2484.48,And the only defense evidence that could be introduced in the case is that the -- that the drugs were not involved? The defense could show that drugs were not involved.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2484.48,2486.93,"They could, and that would target direct -- there were other --"
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2486.93,2491.47,But that's about all they can do with reference to the jurisdictional element?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2491.47,2497.7,I think that's right in this particular case because that's the only factual question that's really relevant.
2015.14-6166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2497.7,2499.67,"Well, maybe the person wasn't a dealer."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2499.67,2502.605,"Yes, that's -- yes."
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2502.605,2503.27,I'm sorry.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2508.825,2511.46,"Well, I didn't concede it."
2015.14-6166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2513.55,2515.14,You said it was a very different thing.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2515.14,2515.85,It was a different thing.
2015.14-6166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2516.21,2517.675,And it would be a much harder thing.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2517.675,2518.64,It would be harder.
2015.14-6166,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2518.64,2527.499,"And it would be at least an awfully good argument by the defendant that if the person was not a dealer, it's not affecting commerce in the regular -- in the relevant way?"
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2527.499,2529.365,That's correct.
2015.14-6166,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2529.365,2534.31,Even though Congress can regulate that transaction?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2534.31,2536.43,"Well, there -- there would be a question."
2015.14-6166,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2565.405,2576.6,"I asked Mr. Jones whether the Hobbs Act exercises the full measure of Congress's Commerce Clause, an authority which I thought a number of cases have said."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2577.745,2578.81,It does.
2015.14-6166,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2581.61,2588.275,"Because then you do run into these limitation -- in the search for a limiting principle, which you seem to be addressing."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2598.91,2599.47,That's correct.
2015.14-6166,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2599.47,2607.625,"So if one person steals a marijuana cigarette from another person, robs that person of one marijuana cigarette, that's a violation of the Hobbs Act?"
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2607.625,2611.46,"Well, there's a different argument there, and let me tell you why."
2015.14-6166,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2626.055,2629.22,"It falls within the Commerce Clause, doesn't it?"
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2629.22,2637.21,It falls -- certainly the possession is something that Congress can regulate as Raich teaches.
2015.14-6166,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2687.25,2697.63,Suppose someone robbed the farmer in Wickard v. Filburn of the wheat that the farmer was growing for personal consumption.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2699.46,2713.59,"Wickard is a little bit more complicated because it was personal consumption but in the context of a commercial enterprise, right? He was growing wheat for his animals and growing wheat -- he also grew wheat for sale."
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2738.36,2746.439,What is your understanding of what the defendant wanted to -- the evidence the defendant wanted to introduce?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2746.439,2755.8,I think the defendant wanted to introduce evidence that not all marijuana in Virginia is coming from out of State.
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2760.69,2766.66,Was there any challenge to the status of these victims as dealers?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2766.66,2772.61,"I think there might have been indirectly through cross-examination, but what we're talking about here is, remember, is an attempt."
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2774.22,2774.91,I understand that.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2774.91,2776.62,-- not only -- not only covers --
2015.14-6166,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2776.62,2780.28,It was an attempt against persons who were in the drug trade?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2780.28,2788.04,"And at least at a minimum who the defendants believed were in the drug trade, and that's really what the relevant question is here."
2015.14-6166,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2819.46,2835.1,"Mr. Yang, I'd like to -- for you to explain to me what the difference in charges are between this robbery and a regular robbery, let's say of a business."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2853.06,2857.92,"Well, it will depend, I think, in part on the government's theory of the case."
2015.14-6166,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2863.55,2864.54,"I understand the charges, counsel."
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2864.54,2884.57,"So in the normal case, and this is the -- this is kind of the -- the mind run of cases that all the courts of appeals have accepted are as kind of a depletion-of-assets theory case. Now, in those types of cases when you're involving the robbery of a business, the government puts on evidence -- this could be any type of business pretty much -- that the business engages in some kind of interstate commerce."
2015.14-6166,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2889.29,2892.32,"Engages how, either by buying goods in commerce --"
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2892.32,2900.26,"Buying goods from out of State, selling to out-of-State customers, buying equipment from out of State, all types of things."
2015.14-6166,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2900.26,2902.07,Let's assume that that's true.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2902.07,2902.775,Uh-huh.
2015.14-6166,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2902.775,2908.99,Is the jury charged that this particular robbery had to affect that?
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2908.99,2921.545,"Yes, because what they end up -- the theory, depletion of assets theory, which again, this has been established in all the courts of appeals for quite some time, is that even if you're robbing not -- something that has not moved in commerce, say, money --"
2015.14-6166,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2921.545,2922.1,Right.
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2922.1,2928.135,-- what you're doing is you're depleting the assets of an enterprise that is engaging in interstate commerce.
2015.14-6166,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2934.96,2945.59,"So -- so the jury is charged to make that determination, that this act of robbering the money hindered the commerce in some way?"
2015.14-6166,1,17293,anthony_a_yang,,2945.59,2947.22,Or has the potential to.
2015.14-6166,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2947.22,2952.2,"So how is that different than his argument, your adversary's argument that --"
