1979.79-424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,50.255,"We will hear arguments next in 79-424, Board of Regents v. Tomanio."
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,53.146,57.401,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,453.911,469.19,"Mr. Meserve, I notice that in your brief you rely on the full faith and credit statute enacted by Congress, 20 U.S.C. 1738, saying that full faith and credit --"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,469.19,470.728,Yes.
1979.79-424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,470.728,478.367,I didn't see any treatment of that issue in the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals.
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,485.894,489.512,"In substance but not by name, Your Honor."
1979.79-424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,496.358,509.516,And did you argue that the broad New York rule of estoppel by judgment was litigated or might have been litigated and was barred in the subsequent New York proceeding?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,509.516,511.714,"I'm sorry, I don't understand the question."
1979.79-424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,511.714,523.148,"Well, my understanding of the New York rule of collateral estoppel is that anything that was litigated or might have been litigated is barred in a subsequent lawsuit."
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,523.148,533.621,"Yes, we did make that argument."
1979.79-424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,834.834,848.048,"Well, do you see new asking for a hearing to give the reasons for denial or is she asking for a hearing to give the reasons for failure to give her a waiver?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,848.048,860.633,"I think she is now belatedly asking that we give her a hearing on her 1971 application and start all over again, followed I suspect by three more state courts and three more federal courts."
1979.79-424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,860.633,867.987,"Well, what did the federal court order, a hearing on what subject?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,867.987,874.141,The District Court decision merely said that we should have given her a hearing.
1979.79-424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,874.141,876.637,On what?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,876.637,883.275,"On her application for a waiver, on her argument that she had the substantial equivalent of the New York requirements."
1979.79-424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,883.275,892.061,Isn't that the whole focus or is it more than that?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,892.061,894.588,I think it is more than that.
1979.79-424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,894.588,900.04,Did the Court of Appeals expand what the District Court ordered?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,900.04,922.576,"No, the Court of Appeals in the appellate division decided that -- this was argued before them, there is no question about this -- that the evidence that she had submitted on her application was not the substantial equivalent, and also, Your Honor, that the statute under which she applied did not apply to this type of an application."
1979.79-424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,922.576,925.219,And counsel never asked for a hearing?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,925.219,925.874,Never.
1979.79-424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,925.874,927.649,She never did ask for a hearing?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,927.649,929.481,No.
1979.79-424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,932.33,936.139,"Well, isn't it true that it wouldn't have been granted if it had been asked for?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,936.139,937.539,"I don't know that that is true, Your Honor."
1979.79-424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,937.539,938.64,"You don't know, I see."
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,938.64,959.179,The argument made in the complaint in the District Court was not that she wanted a hearing but that because she had never been given a hearing the District Court should give her a license.
1979.79-424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1048.837,1060.252,You contend in effect that there was no state interest which she had under New York law that would have warranted a hearing as to whether she should be granted it or not?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1060.252,1062.943,"No, we contend that the statute was never intended to apply to this."
1979.79-424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1069.832,1070.977,Of a waiver?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1070.977,1072.612,-- of a waiver.
1979.79-424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1072.612,1081.009,And you say the New York courts have construed the statute relating to waivers so as not to apply to this type of situation?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1081.009,1083.66,It has never been applied to this type of situation.
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1148.959,1161.83,"Well, have the New York courts ever subjected a waiver decision to review?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1161.83,1171.332,"Yes, we have had a number of cases in New York involving applications for waiver, not waiver of an examination that has been failed."
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1172.663,1179.82,"Well, would the board have had power to waive in this case?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1179.82,1181.258,No.
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1202.201,1215.614,"Well, that may be so but that implies that there are circumstances under which a waiver in these circumstances might not be arbitrary."
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1215.614,1218.033,I couldn't agree in these circumstances.
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1220.909,1228.682,"Well, are there any standards supplied by the statute on which waiver is to be granted?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1228.682,1230.021,"Not in the statute, no."
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1230.021,1230.309,Why was that?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1230.309,1239.227,"The Court of Appeals -- the appellate division said and the Court of Appeals affirmed, but you cannot waive an examination that has been failed."
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1239.227,1250.087,"Well, has the Board ever in any circumstances ordered the Board to give a waiver that the Board refused?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1250.087,1257.499,"I can't recall one offhand, but I suspect that they probably have."
1979.79-424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1265.38,1267.46,Because it has held that the statute simply doesn't --
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1267.46,1268.294,It doesn't apply.
1979.79-424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1268.294,1269.091,-- it doesn't apply.
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1269.091,1275.891,It was not intended as an end-run whereby somebody who can't pass an examination can get around it.
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1275.891,1288.755,"It doesn't sound like the Court of Appeals majority agreed with that interpretation of the New York law, does it?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1288.755,1290.8,I think they did.
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1290.8,1291.982,The Court of Appeals here?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1291.982,1295.475,"Yes -- oh, no, no, I'm sorry, I am thinking of the New York Court of Appeals."
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1295.475,1296.065,The federal court.
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1296.065,1300.383,"Oh, no, they ignored it, and this is my argument."
1979.79-424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1300.383,1302.31,I tried to get at this before.
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1302.31,1303.522,Yes.
1979.79-424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1303.522,1305.5,Here is the Court of Appeals majority opinion.
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1351.481,1352.028,Mr. Chief Justice --
1979.79-424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1352.028,1355.043,"Now, we have to decide whether that is a correct statement, whether that is correct or not."
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1355.043,1365.549,"No, my argument is that that is not a correct statement because the New York state legislature did not provide for the waiver of an examination that has been failed."
1979.79-424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1365.549,1367.548,Where did that originate?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1372.258,1376.959,"The waiver comes -- the waiver statute is general, it can apply to any profession, it can apply to any requirement."
1979.79-424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1384.444,1394.431,"But as a matter of New York law, I take it, we are bound by the way the New York courts have interpreted that particular statute as to when a waiver may be given and when it may not be given."
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1394.431,1396.366,Right.
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1407.073,1419.037,"Mr. Meserve, I understood you a moment ago to say that in this very case, in ringing language, some New York Court said that there was no waiver available, in these circumstances."
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1419.037,1421.596,They said that it would have been an abuse of discretion.
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1421.596,1422.563,Is that in this case?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1422.563,1423.916,"Yes, that is in this case."
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1429.889,1433.545,"I know, but is it in the appellate division opinion?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1433.545,1436.876,It is the appellate division of the New York state courts in her state court action.
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1436.876,1440.564,"Well, we have that in the petitioner for certiorari, do we not?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1440.564,1443.15,"Yes, you have it in the appendix, too."
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1443.15,1445.181,"Yes, at page D-1."
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1451.929,1454.127,"What are you in, Your Honor?"
1979.79-424,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1454.127,1458.074,"Petition for certiorari, page D-1."
1979.79-424,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1458.074,1461.215,"What have you got in you hand, you have got the record?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1461.215,1461.54,I've got the appendix.
1979.79-424,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1461.54,1461.738,You've got the appendix.
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1463.569,1465.462,"Yes, A-5."
1979.79-424,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1465.462,1470.521,A-5.
1979.79-424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1470.521,1477.99,"Well, look at D-3 - ""Had the Board waived the requirements on the record here, it would have abdicated its delegated responsibility."""
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1477.99,1487.001,That is the language I have in my --
1979.79-424,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1487.001,1488.924,"Now, how do you read that?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1491.802,1502.884,"Yes, I read that as a construction by the New York appellate courts that section 6506 under which a waiver application was made could not be applied to this situation."
1979.79-424,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.381,1506.095,State law.
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1506.095,1508.351,"-- state law, the application had to be denied."
1979.79-424,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1508.351,1511.941,"And then what did the Court of Appeals do, deny appeal."
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1511.941,1513.017,Affirmed.
1979.79-424,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1513.017,1513.764,They affirmed?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1513.764,1516.825,"Yes, the appellate division decision."
1979.79-424,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.825,1520.685,So they affirmed that part of the appellate division?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1520.685,1522.024,Yes.
1979.79-424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1522.024,1523.294,"You mean the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court of New York."
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1523.294,1525.455,The New York Court of Appeals.
1979.79-424,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.455,1526.17,"Yes, I understand that."
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1526.17,1527.215,I apologize.
1979.79-424,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1527.215,1533.918,"And you suggest that the Court of Appeals, the federal Court of Appeals just ignored that?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1533.918,1534.928,Yes.
1979.79-424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1542.671,1549.585,"But the United States Court of Appeals has said this violates federal due process, if I read their opinion correctly."
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1551.133,1552.519,Yes.
1979.79-424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1552.519,1559.115,"And that is the issue before us, and that is the only issue before us, isn't it?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1559.115,1563.79,"No, it is not the only issue, Mr. Chief Justice, but it is one of the issues certainly."
1979.79-424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1563.79,1566.866,"If they are wrong on that, you prevail, don't you?"
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1566.866,1568.373,I hope so.
1979.79-424,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1568.373,1580.792,There is also the issue of whether the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit should have permitted this matter to be relitigated at all after she had had her chapter 78 proceeding in the New York courts.
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1580.792,1581.166,Yes.
1979.79-424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1619.075,1620.917,Let me ask one question.
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1627.99,1629.314,That was never alleged.
1979.79-424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1629.314,1630.932,I say how would you raise that?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1630.932,1632.981,You could raise that --
1979.79-424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1632.981,1633.939,But it could be raised?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1633.939,1637.954,"It could be raised, absolutely, Article 78 proceedings in a state court or through a federal action."
1979.79-424,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1637.954,1639.322,So it could be raised?
1979.79-424,0,21272,donald_o_meserve,,1639.322,1642.486,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-424,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1642.486,1644.731,Mr. Mutari.
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,1644.731,1646.872,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court --"
1979.79-424,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1646.872,1654.437,"If the Court were to decide that this was res judicata, that would be the end of the case, if this Court were to decide."
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,1654.437,1657.335,"Yes, it would, Your Honor."
1979.79-424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1808.497,1811.07,"She could have raised her constitutional claims in that proceeding, couldn't she?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,1811.07,1830.537,"Yes, she could and a federal res judicata doctrine which is formulated by the Second Circuit said has even enlarged the federal res judicata concept in the New York State res judicata concept."
1979.79-424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1844.106,1850.165,"But isn't the Second Circuit bound by the act of Congress of 1790, 28 U.S.C. 1738 --"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,1850.165,1852.178,In fact they are supporting the act of Congress.
1979.79-424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.355,1888.88,"I'm talking about the act of 1790, the third section, which says with respect to proceedings in state courts, such acts, records and judicial proceedings shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States and its territories and possessions as they have by law or usage in the courts of such state or possession."
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,1888.88,1896.458,The state res judicata is broader than that in the State of New York.
1979.79-424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1896.458,1901.297,Then doesn't the statute require the Second Circuit to observe the New York rule?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,1901.297,1935.198,"And the New York rule for res judicata is that to say Mary Tomanio may not bring her due process case, an entirely different case, a constitutional case, into federal court if she didn't bring it in the state court, provided that the cause of actions were the same, and they quote Winters v. Lavine and misquote it by leaving out that last sentence, provided that the cause of action is the same."
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.096,1988.517,"But you didn't appeal to the higher court, did you?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,1988.517,1989.714,"No, we went on a --"
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1989.714,1993.742,I mean the state court proceeding was over when you went to the District Court.
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,1993.742,1994.853,"Yes, it was, sir."
1979.79-424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1994.853,2005.538,"Well, isn't the New York rule that not only anything you actually litigated in that proceeding but anything that might have been litigated cannot be relitigated?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2005.538,2007.684,"No, it is not the New York rule."
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2015.953,2021.125,"So when the Court of Appeals ruled, you could have come here, couldn't you?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2021.125,2022.414,Directly to the Supreme Court?
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2022.414,2023.405,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2023.405,2025.583,We went to the District Court.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2025.904,2028.803,I said you could have come to this Court.
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2030.896,2033.195,Yes.
1979.79-424,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2033.195,2038.304,"No, you couldn't have come here, you raised no federal question I understood in the state proceeding."
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2038.304,2039.988,There were no federal questions in the state court.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2039.988,2041.486,"Well, how could you come here?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2041.486,2054.456,"Well, I was thinking that maybe we could have come in on some kind of an injunction proceeding or something like that against the lower court, but we tried that already because they arrested Mary Tomanio at one time along the line and we tried and we couldn't get an injunction."
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2054.456,2057.466,When did you ask for a hearing?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2057.466,2060.841,We asked for a hearing in 1971.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2060.841,2061.853,Where?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2061.853,2063.984,We asked the Board of Regents of the City of New York.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2065.775,2068.411,Where is that in the record?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2069.446,2073.478,"Yes -- oh, when we asked them for a hearing."
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2077.303,2078.17,So you never did ask for a hearing.
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2078.17,2091.849,We never asked for a hearing and the Supreme Court has said that there is no need to ask that a waiver -- a hearing may be given even although it is not asked for under certain circumstances.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2091.849,2093.342,But does it have to be given?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2093.342,2095.058,It does not have to be given.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2095.058,2096.4,Why should it be given in this case?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2096.4,2100.578,We think the circumstances are so extreme here that it should be given.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2100.578,2102.829,"What is the extreme, that she failed seven times?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2102.829,2110.827,"The extreme is that she has been practicing chiropractics since 1958 without a blemish, this is her livelihood, her only source of living --"
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2110.827,2113.515,But she failed seven times.
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2113.515,2126.393,"Our contention is that if she failed 107 times and she closely passed the 108th time, we are talking about the one time that she failed just by six-tenths of one percent."
1979.79-424,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2132.3,2135.965,Would your position be the same if she failed by five points?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2135.965,2137.876,I don't think it could be.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2164.299,2165.156,Weren't you there?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2165.156,2165.649,Pardon?
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2165.649,2167.533,Weren't you there?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2169.155,2171.206,"Yes, I was there, sir."
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2171.206,2174.639,"Well, did you offer to put on evidence?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2174.639,2179.569,We asked them for a waiver as the law required and they said no.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2179.569,2181.736,Did you offer to put on witnesses?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2181.736,2185.216,"No, we didn't because the law did not require it or --"
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2185.216,2188.165,"If you had been given a hearing, what would you have done?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2188.165,2196.09,"If we were given a hearing, I believe that we could have brought forward her peer group, eminent people qualified in chiropractic who would testify --"
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2196.09,2198.282,"Well, why didn't you bring them?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2198.282,2199.823,We were never given a hearing to bring them.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2199.823,2202.147,"Well, did they tell you you couldn't bring them?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2202.147,2204.338,They just said no.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2204.338,2205.885,They said no to you?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2205.885,2208.567,They said no to me and I said they were arbitrary and capricious.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2208.567,2209.973,I thought they listened to you.
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2209.973,2210.359,Pardon me?
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2210.359,2211.245,Did they listen to you?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2216.061,2219.914,I put most of this in a letter to them when I asked them for the waiver.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2219.914,2221.592,I'm talking about when you were there.
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2221.592,2222.338,I was never there.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2225.179,2226.418,You were never present?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2226.418,2232.525,"In the regents' home office, no."
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2232.525,2236.619,Did you submit affidavits?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2236.619,2239.457,I submitted our arguments.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2239.457,2241.092,You submitted oral arguments?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2241.092,2243.942,Written arguments and a letter saying we would like a waiver --
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2243.942,2244.996,You submitted written arguments?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2244.996,2248.258,-- that we feel we come under 6506 subdivision (5).
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.258,2253.174,Did you offer to submit the affidavits of these people you were talking about?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2253.174,2255.206,"No, I did not."
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2255.206,2257.747,Were you denied that right?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2257.747,2259.193,"No, I was not denied the right."
1979.79-424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2274.292,2289.67,"Mr. Mutari, your theory about their being arbitrary and capricious as I understand it was given the facts that she had almost passed the exam and her history of practice and the like, that it was arbitrary and capricious given those facts to deny her the right to practice."
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2289.67,2290.801,"That's right, Your Honor."
1979.79-424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2290.801,2297.441,So didn't you have before them substantially everything you would have put in if you had had a hearing?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2297.441,2323.378,"The reason we hold hearings here in the United States Supreme Court and in other courts -- or we would all be mailing letters to each other -- I did give it to them in the form of writing, but you have an opportunity to come in, though I didn't ask for it, and bring in witnesses who could or could not impress the jury or the set of judges that were there, bring in her patients who could have attested to her professionalism and caring."
1979.79-424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.378,2332.853,"Well, how do you respond to your opponent's argument that as a matter of New York law if she fails the examination they simply could not have given her a waiver?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2332.853,2334.199,It is not New York law.
1979.79-424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2334.199,2334.787,Oh.
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2334.787,2340.8,"6506, subdivision (5) says that you may waive examination requirements."
1979.79-424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2348.742,2353.874,"But they say, if I remember the argument, is you may not do that for someone who has failed an examination."
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2353.874,2355.328,That is not so.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2360.401,2368.927,Does it say specifically that you can waive the examination requirement --
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2368.927,2377.861,"Yes, 6506, subdivision (5), the Board of Regents shall supervise the admission to and the practice of professions."
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2409.583,2411.342,"They could waive the examination, couldn't they?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2411.342,2412.328,Yes.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2412.328,2414.934,"They could waive the examination, couldn't they?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2414.934,2416.666,The examination requirements.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2416.666,2418.107,"They could waive the whole examination, couldn't they?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2418.107,2420.696,Exactly.
1979.79-424,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2420.696,2423.592,And you think that is what it means?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2423.592,2424.322,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-424,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2424.322,2431.899,You've just made an analogy to the American tradition of hearings and said as a hearing in this Court.
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2439.719,2446.353,"No, I don't, but the only reason we are here is because the Board of Regent's sought certiorari and you admitted us here."
1979.79-424,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2446.353,2447.604,But do they have any right?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2450.462,2451.169,"No, sir."
1979.79-424,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2451.169,2454.762,The majority in some terms of our cases are --
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2454.762,2455.321,A vast majority.
1979.79-424,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2455.321,2457.131,"-- are decided without oral argument, are they not?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2457.131,2459.471,"I agree, Your Honor."
1979.79-424,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2459.471,2465.888,What does that do to your claim that due process requires a hearing in your situation?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2465.888,2499.493,"The Board of Regents is an administrative agency, the Board of Agents should be very close to the people to whom they are administering, they have a responsibility to the State of New York in handing out these licenses and they should be cognizant and sensitive to giving them to people who have been proven proper practitioners for a long time, and that Mary Tomanio has proven that she is a worthwhile practitioner, and that is why I think a hearing ought to have been granted to her."
1979.79-424,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2499.493,2510.586,"Suppose they had a rule that after you had taken your examination six times and failed you could not take it any longer, and she failed six times, did she not?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2510.586,2515.921,"And if they did have 6506 on the books, I would say she is done, it is over."
1979.79-424,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2523.346,2536.069,"Well, my hypothesis was that in addition to your existing statutes there was a provision that five times was the limit, as some state licensing boards do have."
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2536.069,2541.89,"I would believe it to be constitutional, she would have had her due process, as long as there was nothing else on the books."
1979.79-424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2541.89,2555.262,"I take it your position is that you could have come here directly from the board, you could have gone into federal court under 1983 without ever going into the state courts at all?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2555.262,2555.674,I --
1979.79-424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2555.674,2562.341,"You could have gone and filed a suit under 1983 when your waiver was denied directly, without ever --"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2562.341,2563.818,Yes.
1979.79-424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2580.928,2590.158,"But the statute doesn't set any standards for the granting of the waiver and none of the cases do, do they?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2590.158,2595.356,"No, and that if one of the reasons we are here in the federal court now, because there is such a broad discretionary power."
1979.79-424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2596.556,2601.228,What expectation under state law did you ever have that a waiver would be granted?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2601.228,2602.618,"Well, we were really testing it."
1979.79-424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2618.544,2631.31,My real question is where do you find in state law any limits on the discretion of the board to deny your request for a waiver?
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2631.31,2632.447,The ordinary --
1979.79-424,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2632.447,2638.151,It sounds like this might be a decision just left to the complete discretion of the board.
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2638.151,2648.559,"It is left to the discretion of the board but they must arrive at whatever decision they do in a constitutional manner, and we are submitting to you now that they did not arrive at it."
1979.79-424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2648.559,2657.179,"But if it is left to the complete discretion of the board, they can go either yes or no and they will be wrong in neither event, I take it."
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2657.179,2666.445,"Well, they will be wrong if their yes or their no is founded on a procedure that is unconstitutional and that is why we are here."
1979.79-424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2672.914,2680.171,"But if there are no factors that they have to consider, what would they be hearing about?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2680.171,2685.247,"They would be hearing her background, her qualifications, her long years of practice --"
1979.79-424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2685.247,2694.636,Which is what you say ought to entitle her to a waiver but maybe the board just doesn't feel that any of those are relevant.
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2694.636,2711.324,"If they did, then we would have lost there but we were never given an opportunity and the constitutional decisions have held that a person ought to be given this hearing or ought to be given reasons before they come up with their yes or no."
1979.79-424,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2718.772,2737.735,"Then your answer to Justice White's question must be that there are some standards in New York law because otherwise there would be no reason for them to come up -- why they couldn't simply say no, it is a matter completely confined to our discretion and we have decided not to grant it."
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2737.735,2750.92,I believe the majority of the standards -- and this is why this is a civil rights act -- are here in federal procedure and they didn't follow them.
1979.79-424,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2750.92,2760.5,"Mr. Mutari, before you finish, would you be good enough to make a comment or two on the statute of limitations here?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2760.5,2760.89,Yes.
1979.79-424,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2760.89,2777.191,"It has hardly been mentioned in oral argument by either side and you didn't cite Johnson v. Railway Express Agency which involved 1981 rather than 1983, but I wondered generally your approach to the statute of limitations."
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2777.191,2785.781,I would submit that the cornerstone of the statute of limitations is the concept of repose.
1979.79-424,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2807.138,2809.679,I want to know why it was tolled.
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2809.679,2822.13,"It was tolled in the interest of federalism, the concept that a case ought to be tried in a state court to its fullest before you ever come to the federal court."
1979.79-424,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2827.393,2832.068,"A little while ago, didn't you indicate that you could have come directly into federal court?"
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2832.068,2832.82,"Yes, I could."
1979.79-424,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2886.957,2891.458,"Of course, we have that very situation in some EEOC cases."
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2891.458,2891.913,Yes.
1979.79-424,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.913,2895.131,Precisely.
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2895.131,2902.144,It is in the interest of federalism that this kind of tolling takes place.
1979.79-424,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.943,2920.113,"Well, I just suggest that in the Johnson v. Railway Express Agency we reach the opposite conclusion."
1979.79-424,1,43637,vincent_j_mutari,,2924.762,2931.592,"I didn't put it in my notes, so the case may come to a different conclusion."
1979.79-424,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2998.73,3000.39,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Meserve?"
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3002.225,3005.636,To sum up very quickly a couple of things.
1979.79-424,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3044.039,3052.57,Are you saying in effect that there is nothing that was not before the board that could have been brought before the board except oral argument?
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3052.57,3053.918,Yes.
1979.79-424,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3053.918,3057.523,They knew that she had failed the examination six times.
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3057.523,3057.676,Right.
1979.79-424,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3057.676,3063.302,They knew that she had been in this activity for a good number of years.
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3063.302,3068.707,"Not too many at that time, two to five, I think, but she has been going on."
1979.79-424,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3114.084,3122.119,Do you say that the Board of Regents did have the authority to waive the examination requirement?
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3122.119,3123.853,"No, they had the authority --"
1979.79-424,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3123.853,3126.466,If it determined that the New Hampshire examination was substantially the equivalent?
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3126.466,3127.186,Right.
1979.79-424,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3127.512,3137.214,"Well, if she argued that it was the substantial equivalent, it seems to me to suggest that you did have the authority as a matter of New York law to grant the waiver you say you didn't have the authority to."
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3137.214,3143.033,We have the authority to waive an examination requirement if we believe that it has been substantially been met.
1979.79-424,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3149.111,3149.483,Well --
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3149.483,3153.169,We may believe that if an equivalent examination is taken somewhere else.
1979.79-424,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3153.169,3157.641,"Well, she did take what she contended was an equivalent examination elsewhere, didn't she?"
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3157.641,3158.502,"Yes, and that --"
1979.79-424,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3158.502,3164.258,"And you disagreed with her, but had you agreed with her you would have had the authority as a matter of New York law to grant the waiver."
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3164.258,3165.515,Yes.
1979.79-424,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3165.515,3174.195,So I think really your argument before that you had no authority as a matter of New York law really wasn't quite right.
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3174.195,3177.883,I think it was right if you coupled her failure and her out-of-state examination.
1979.79-424,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3185.015,3186.794,Without requiring the New York examination.
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3186.794,3188.118,Without requiring the New York exam.
1979.79-424,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3191.554,3194.169,This would be a reciprocity type of admission.
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3194.169,3195.806,Yes.
1979.79-424,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3195.806,3199.291,And that is one of the things she argued you should have done in this case.
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3199.291,3205.709,And she argued that in the state courts and that was one of the issues which was specifically argued and determined against her in the state court.
1979.79-424,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3205.709,3216.563,"So it was determined, as I understand the statement of reasons quoted on page four of your brief, on the ground that as a matter of fact you decided the examinations were not substantially the equivalent of the New York exam."
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3216.563,3217.431,Her foreign examination.
1979.79-424,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3217.431,3217.642,Right.
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3217.642,3218.355,Yes.
1979.79-424,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3218.355,3222.997,But you would have had discretion to rule otherwise is all I am saying.
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3222.997,3223.496,Yes.
1979.79-424,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3223.496,3226.258,All right.
1979.79-424,2,21272,donald_o_meserve,,3226.258,3242.852,"On the statute of limitations and on res judicata argument, the rule in the Second Circuit is contrary to the generally accepted rules and we believe the interests of justice would require a uniform rule in that respect."
1979.79-424,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3244.161,3244.883,"Thank you, gentlemen."
