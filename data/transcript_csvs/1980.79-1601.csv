1980.79-1601,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.153,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Summer v. Mata.
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,12.84,27.536,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,56.306,62.162,"You mean evidence, in-court identifications, or evidence about a pretrial identification?"
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,62.162,64.459,"--As I read the opinion, Your Honor, it would apply to both."
1980.79-1601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,64.459,66.442,"Well, which was it?"
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,69.503,82.171,"It is my reading of the opinion that it excluded both identifications, both evidence of in-court identifications and evidence of identifications from a group of photographs."
1980.79-1601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,82.171,90.276,At the state trial there was evidence introduced with respect to the pretrial identifications?
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,90.276,90.651,That is correct.
1980.79-1601,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,151.063,151.829,Where did that take place?
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,151.829,158.999,It occurred in one of the inmate dormitories at the California Correctional Institution at Tehachapi.
1980.79-1601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,780.342,795.32,"Mr. Brady, the procedural history of this case is that these was a trial in the Superior Court, appealed to the Court of Appeal, the judgment of conviction affirmed, and then federal habeas sought."
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,796.022,796.506,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,796.506,807.987,Did the State Court of Appeal pass on the eyewitness identification issues that you've been discussing?
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,807.987,809.44,"Yes, sir, it did."
1980.79-1601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,814.328,822.543,And the 9th Circuit disagreed with the State Court of Appeal?
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,822.543,824.903,"With the State Court of Appeal, and also with the district court."
1980.79-1601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,824.903,829.15,"Did the district court hold a hearing, or rely on the state record?"
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,829.15,837.147,"The district court, as did the 9th Circuit, relied solely on the state record."
1980.79-1601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,837.443,841.785,Did they apply the same standards?
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,841.785,851.892,"Well, it's our position the 9th Circuit did not apply the same standard that apparently the district court did, or the state courts."
1980.79-1601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,862.107,869.496,"Assume you agreed with the standard, the legal standard that the 9th Circuit applied."
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,870.151,872.448,"I believe we would, Your Honor."
1980.79-1601,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,872.448,881.677,"You think they're... whatever else there is, you think the 9th Circuit disregarded state courts' findings without--"
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,881.677,882.396,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1601,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,893.891,900.498,"--Mr. Attorney General, what about the possibility of a lineup?"
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,906.778,908.371,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1601,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,910.089,912.244,It wasn't for the lack of people.
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,912.244,913.963,No.
1980.79-1601,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,953.805,956.71,"Well, that wouldn't have stopped them from getting in a lineup."
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,956.71,970.25,"No, it would not physically stop them, but it is one reason why a decision may be made that the use of photographic identification procedures--"
1980.79-1601,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,970.25,971.969,But the question was never gone into by anybody?
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,971.969,975.593,"--No, there was no objection to the admission of the identification."
1980.79-1601,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,975.593,979.732,I thought one of the three did ask for a lineup.
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,979.732,982.574,One of the three men mentioned that.
1980.79-1601,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,998.475,1004.565,But it never was explained in this record why his request was refused.
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1004.565,1009.078,--It was alluded to at one time only by--
1980.79-1601,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1009.078,1009.735,"My question was, was it ever explained?"
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1009.735,1012.077,"--No, sir, not in so many words."
1980.79-1601,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1012.077,1018.966,"What did the district court, the federal district court hold on the habeas corpus hearing?"
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1055.264,1061.573,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct, although the state trial court was not expressly called on to resolve the issue."
1980.79-1601,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1061.573,1066.26,"And although the federal district court talked about irregularities, didn't it?"
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1066.26,1067.353,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1601,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1067.353,1078.068,"But neither the federal district court nor the United States Court of Appeals dealt with your 2254(d) argument at all, did they?"
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1081.458,1084.893,"No, Your Honor, they did not."
1980.79-1601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1084.893,1086.158,When did you first raise that argument?
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1086.158,1093.75,"The 2254(d) argument was first raised in the district court, in our return."
1980.79-1601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1120.145,1128.111,Did the trial court... I understand there was no objection to the testimony about the photo identification procedure.
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1128.846,1129.876,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-1601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1129.876,1137.811,"But you didn't argue as a matter of California procedure that they therefore could not raise this whole problem in the Court of Appeal, did you?"
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1142.481,1148.573,"Well, let me approach this this way."
1980.79-1601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1194.21,1199.114,"And the state Court of Appeal here did treat the matter on the merits, did it not?"
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1199.114,1216.342,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe that... well, it passed on the constitutional validity of the identification procedures but it's our position that by so doing it did not forgive any procedural default."
1980.79-1601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1248.844,1268.947,"But, so far as raising the matter beyond the state Court of Appeal, say to bring it to this Court, the defendant would have been perfectly free, I take it, to petition for certiorari on the merits, since the state Court of Appeal had discussed the merits."
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1268.947,1274.35,"Well, that is one of the questions in this case, Your Honor, whether he would be, or would have been."
1980.79-1601,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1274.35,1276.35,Isn't your position a little bit inconsistent?
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1284.611,1287.797,"No, Your Honor, I don't think so."
1980.79-1601,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1322.564,1351.475,"This is a totally inconclusive discussion, and even if the state Court of Appeal had found the identification procedures wholly improper and unconstitutional, your present submission is it had no power to reverse the conviction, and therefore why is 2254(d) applicable at all if this is just an inconclusive, meaningless discussion?"
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1351.475,1357.848,"--Let me say, it had the power to reverse the conviction but not the right."
1980.79-1601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.603,1394.177,"Well, then, if that's the case, the procedural waiver of failure to object is almost meaningless in the Superior Court."
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1416.279,1428.99,In my previous answer I attempted to make the distinction between the power to reverse the judgment and the right to do so.
1980.79-1601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1428.99,1430.459,I don't understand it.
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1462.461,1477.346,"Yes, I relieve that is what I mean, that the court... this is the state Court of Appeal... would be able to reverse it."
1980.79-1601,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1550.77,1553.504,But that's not because of Wainwright v. Sykes.
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1555.737,1556.128,That's correct.
1980.79-1601,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1570.763,1579.884,"Well, the net result is that your California Court of Appeal chose not to follow its own contemporaneous objection rule."
1980.79-1601,0,42415,thomas_a_brady,,1580.65,1583.914,"Well, that is--"
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1655.838,1663.507,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1601,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1716.94,1721.767,I thought Mr. Brady said it was in a response that they filed.
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1721.767,1728.357,--I think what he said was that their 2254(d) argument was in the brief which they filed.
1980.79-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1815.231,1823.148,"Mr. Hendon, is there not a federal interest, even assuming for the moment there were no California contemporaneous objection rule at all?"
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1857.87,1862.774,"Not as a matter... it would not bar the federal court, procedurally to bar--"
1980.79-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1862.774,1863.212,I understand.
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1869.772,1870.038,"--On the merits, yes."
1980.79-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1881.751,1886.014,"Well, what is there in the record to indicate that it was not a tactical decision here?"
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1889.122,1892.496,"--Yes, this is one of the unresolved issues of this case."
1980.79-1601,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1921.657,1929.449,"But that's not to say that that's not their 2254(d) argument that you're talking about now, is it?"
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1929.449,1938.492,"No; no, that's not their 2254(d)."
1980.79-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1956.892,1957.705,"No, I'm not sure that that follows."
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1964.171,1964.748,"--Oh, I see."
1980.79-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1964.748,1968.153,--By letting this evidence into the record.
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,1988.488,1991.596,"Well, it seems to me that there are two separate questions."
1980.79-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2004.655,2010.699,"Yes, but even if it's improper, no denial of due process takes place unless it's put into the record of the trial."
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2023.958,2024.489,Yes.
1980.79-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2024.489,2029.567,So that it seems to me the critical point is when the evidence is offered.
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2033.72,2034.22,Yes.
1980.79-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2034.22,2040.452,But it's hard to find a denial of due process by the admission of evidence to which competent counsel doesn't make any objection.
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2040.452,2044.668,"Well, I think that assumes the ground of the--"
1980.79-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.668,2045.793,You don't challenge the competency of counsel?
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2045.793,2046.247,"--We did, below."
1980.79-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2046.965,2047.465,I'm sorry.
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2047.465,2049.043,"--We did, below, yes."
1980.79-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2050.931,2051.806,I see.
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2051.806,2056.632,It was not resolved in the 9th Circuit because the 9th Circuit decided that the identification was improper.
1980.79-1601,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2120.811,2130.134,Don't you concede the possibility that 2254(d) may impose an obligation upon federal courts regardless of whether or not anybody raises the point?
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2130.134,2134.945,That may well be.
1980.79-1601,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2140.787,2144.317,"Well, but if the Court of Appeals didn't even mention 2254(d)--"
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2144.317,2145.879,--Yes?
1980.79-1601,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2145.879,2169.307,"--And if 2254(d) does impose some obligation upon federal courts to consider it, and to find an exception to its generalized application... and it lists various exceptions; eight of them, I think... what does it matter if anybody raised it?"
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2169.307,2176.351,"Well, if this Court is prepared to hold that in every federal--"
1980.79-1601,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2176.351,2182.349,"Well, do you concede the possibility that 2254(d) might impose some obligation upon federal courts, in federal habeas corpus courts?"
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2182.349,2182.895,--I suppose so yes.
1980.79-1601,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2182.895,2194.813,"And following up Justice Stewart's question, certainly the phraseology makes it virtually an element of the federal habeas cause of action, does it not?"
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2228.971,2236.593,"No, I don't think that they would be precluded from reaching it."
1980.79-1601,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2258.287,2261.286,Isn't it virtually jurisdictional?
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2293.258,2297.992,"Well, if the conclusion is that it is jurisdictional, then you are correct."
1980.79-1601,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2344.112,2357.342,"Well, what troubled me about Judge Ely's opinion was that there was absolutely no reference to 2254(d) in it."
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2384.424,2391.859,"Well, with all due respect, Your Honor, I think they had no knowledge of it, and didn't think of it, because counsel never brought it to their attention."
1980.79-1601,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2432.248,2440.994,"You are suggesting, then, that 2254 just doesn't address itself to mixed questions of fact and law?"
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2440.994,2441.401,"Yes, I am."
1980.79-1601,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2441.401,2445.118,It's just purely historical facts that it relates to?
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2445.118,2445.681,That's right.
1980.79-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2448.336,2453.552,But you also contend it only applies to determinations by the finder of fact who actually saw the witnesses?
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2457.629,2459.034,--Yes.
1980.79-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2470.498,2476.73,But wouldn't you contend that 2254(d) simply doesn't apply unless there's a determination by a trial court?
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2476.73,2477.058,Yes.
1980.79-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2477.058,2478.105,I thought you'd made that argument.
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2488.319,2489.975,Yes.
1980.79-1601,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2489.975,2499.097,"--Find that there was, it was perfectly proper to admit the evidence, and therefore that the evidence... it was not unconstitutional to admit the evidence?"
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2499.097,2507.532,"Yes, but in addressing the question of which primary facts we ought to defer to, which we are not to defer to--"
1980.79-1601,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2507.532,2510.437,"There was no discussion, there were no findings of fact as such."
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2510.437,2512.356,"--There was no discussion, so that's why it's difficult to identify them."
1980.79-1601,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2582.61,2594.385,You're suggesting then that basically the 9th Circuit and the state Court of Appeal applied the same legal test for eyewitness identification?
1980.79-1601,1,22505,ezra_hendon,,2594.385,2602.351,"The same as each other, each... as each other?"
1980.79-1601,2,42415,thomas_a_brady,,3315.46,3316.255,Very briefly.
1980.79-1601,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3373.997,3383.572,Did the 9th Circuit show a lack of deference to anything other than the ultimate conclusion of district court?
1980.79-1601,2,42415,thomas_a_brady,,3383.572,3384.415,"Yes; yes, Your Honor--"

1980.79-1601,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3393.818,3396.74,"Your colleague doesn't agree with you, does he, on that?"
1980.79-1601,2,42415,thomas_a_brady,,3396.74,3398.051,--He apparently does not.
1980.79-1601,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3477.223,3493.169,"Mr. Brady, if we agree to the 9th Circuit with respect to the necessity part of its opinion, would we reach this other issue?"

1980.79-1601,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3494.809,3500.167,"You don't think the necessity ruling was dispositive, or independently dispositive?"
