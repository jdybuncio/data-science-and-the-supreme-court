1973.72-1118,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,33.638,37.196,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.101,220.153,"Mr. Friedman, I read through the record in the case that the appendix and I noticed that government supplied a number of affidavits and the like in connection with its motion to dismiss."
1973.72-1118,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,220.153,220.187,Yes.
1973.72-1118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,220.187,233.677,"And now looking through the docket entries in the District Court, it was not clear to me since there are none included in the appendix whether that government had those same affidavits carry over for consideration on the motion for summary judgment."
1973.72-1118,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,233.677,236.077,"I would think there were before, it isn’t explicit."
1973.72-1118,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,255.298,258.765,But it would have to have been evidence that was before the court had said?
1973.72-1118,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,258.765,259.394,"Oh, yes."
1973.72-1118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,506.478,511.273,We will resume there after lunch.
1973.72-1118,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,520.078,522.727,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.72-1118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,555.047,556.868,"Mr. Friedman, may I interrupt you for a moment?"
1973.72-1118,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,556.868,558.18,Yes.
1973.72-1118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,558.18,561.534,Early at the state.
1973.72-1118,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,568.692,571.357,"I think Mr. Chief Justice, the reasons are important."
1973.72-1118,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,571.357,579.009,"I can understand you are illustrating the need for expeditious action but otherwise, it isn’t relevant."
1973.72-1118,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,579.009,584.632,"Well, I think it is relevant to this extent Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.72-1118,1,18541,charles_barnhill_jr,,1872.08,1875.726,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court."
1973.72-1118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1920.121,1922.32,Where do we find that in the record?
1973.72-1118,1,18541,charles_barnhill_jr,,1922.32,1929.447,"That is in the appendix to our brief Your Honor, we asked the government to include that in the joint appendix and they refused to do so."
1973.72-1118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1929.447,1933.153,Are these events occurring since the indication?
1973.72-1118,1,18541,charles_barnhill_jr,,1933.153,1937.589,They are.
1973.72-1118,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1970.218,1976.571,"Mr. Barnhill, maybe you can try to answer the same question I asked Mr. Friedman."
1973.72-1118,1,18541,charles_barnhill_jr,,1998.654,2002.648,"Well, to be perfectly honest, it is not wholly clear."
1973.72-1118,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2029.245,2038.187,"Well, I suppose if you take the lower court’s view, neither side would be entitled to state any facts since the factual background was irrelevant."
1973.72-1118,1,18541,charles_barnhill_jr,,2050.63,2056.279,"Well, I think like I said and I think the matter is irrelevant."
1973.72-1118,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2062.722,2067.304,Did you contradict them in the administrative hearing or the administrative process?
1973.72-1118,1,18541,charles_barnhill_jr,,2067.304,2068.293,We did not.
1973.72-1118,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3787.901,3790.311,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
