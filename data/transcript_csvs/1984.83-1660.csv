1984.83-1660,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.686,We will hear arguments next in Atkins against Parker and the consolidated case.
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,676.009,696.252,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, my argument is promised on the assumption that the Constitution requires some form of notice, and our argument is essentially that the notice that the Department of Public Welfare sent out in December, 1981, in fact met and exceeded the constitutional requirement of due process."
1984.83-1660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,696.252,702.976,"Ms. Janos, may I ask, there is a regulation, isn't there, that requires you to give some notice?"
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,702.976,704.437,"Yes, there is, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,704.437,712.19,And also I gather that same regulation makes provision for continuing benefits in certain circumstances.
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,712.19,713.281,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,713.281,717.415,Are those provisions going to have any relevance to your argument?
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,717.415,729.243,"Only insofar as Massachusetts exceeded those regulatory requirements and we allowed, if someone appealed, we continued their benefits, if they appealed for any reason."
1984.83-1660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,740.701,742.632,They were continued in all instances?
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,742.632,743.082,Yes.
1984.83-1660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,743.763,744.364,I see.
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,744.364,753.617,"In December, 1981, the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare mailed a notice to 16,000 food stamp recipients that were affected by the change in federal law."
1984.83-1660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,817.21,819.582,"I am sorry, Ms. Janos."
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,828.378,829.019,Yes.
1984.83-1660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,829.019,831.31,--until their appeals had been resolved.
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,849.662,850.092,We did not.
1984.83-1660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,850.092,851.221,I see.
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,851.221,852.042,We did not.
1984.83-1660,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,852.042,852.814,Thank you.
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,852.814,870.346,"Finally, even if... if someone had a question or wanted to challenge the application of this legislative action to their particular case, the procedural safeguards that were afforded to all of the people that received this notice were extensive."
1984.83-1660,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,908.03,917.546,"Ms. Janos, are the reproductions of the notices in the appendix substantially as the notices actually were?"
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,917.546,920.828,"--They are the size and the exact format, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,929.226,930.245,Is identical.
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,933.798,941.692,"There may have been some people that had difficulty reading it, Your Honor, but it was clearly written."
1984.83-1660,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,946.546,950.297,It is like reading income tax instructions.
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,950.297,952.591,"--It was easier than that, we submit, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,974.224,978.578,What was the theory of the District Court's ruling that unconstitutional?
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,978.578,987.644,"The District Court applied a mechanical reading test to this notice That reading test is based on a list of 3,000 words, so-called familiar words."
1984.83-1660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,998.53,1002.463,"Where did the District Court get the idea of a 1948 3,000-word test?"
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1002.463,1011.83,That is a reading test that is used routinely to examine the readability levels of textbooks used by educators.
1984.83-1660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1018.902,1021.373,Is that the Dale-Chall test?
1984.83-1660,1,22543,ellen_l_janos,,1021.373,1025.287,"--That is the Dale-Chall test, and it is based on a list of 3,000 words."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1514.228,1523.144,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are three major points that the plaintiffs would like to make in their presentation today."
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1563.039,1564.769,"Well, is this what the court below held?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1564.769,1566.011,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1566.011,1568.943,Did they articulate those very grounds?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1568.943,1571.574,"They did not articulate the first ground, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1585.024,1605.858,"Mr. Hitov, do you agree with respondents that as they administer this program, the filing of an appeal automatically results in the resumption of the payments at whatever they have been until the appeal has been decided?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1605.858,1617.596,"I can't say for certain, Your Honor, in each case of the record, but it is the common law stated policy that they will, as Ms. Janos stressed, reinstate, not continue--"
1984.83-1660,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1617.596,1619.265,Reinstate.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1619.265,1628.743,"--but reinstate benefits if they have already terminated them and then somebody requests an appeal, within a specified... within a very short specified time, within ten days of whatever date is on the notice."
1984.83-1660,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1628.743,1642.18,"But if you do, the payments are reinstated, and then the end result is a reduction of the... I think Ms. Janos told us there may be an effort to recoup benefits."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1642.18,1642.652,That's right.
1984.83-1660,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1650.007,1655.42,I gather the effort to recoup is rare.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1655.42,1656.752,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1669.391,1676.607,"--May I, before you leave the first point, you said the statute required the notice to help in planning and to correct errors."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1678.837,1679.498,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.459,1686.163,That is on Page 1A of the government's brief.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1688.544,1693.757,"I know for certain that it is included on Page 1A of our brief, the red covered brief, of the appendix."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1693.757,1696.95,--Do you think there is language in there that explains all that?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1696.95,1698.061,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1703.785,1705.524,All right.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1705.524,1713.9,"So our second point in the overall presentation is its prospective injunctive relief, Number One, was quite conservative, and Number Two, was entirely justified."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.926,1745.679,"Well, Mr. Hitov, how much of that prospective injunctive relief remains after the opinion of the First Circuit?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1745.679,1748.581,"None, Your Honor, absolutely none."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1754.335,1758.769,Which were the declarations that this would be... this was required by law?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1758.769,1768.376,"That's correct, Your Honor, that Section 2020(e)(10) of the Food Stamp Act requires advanced notice of any reduction or termination except in the one specified exception right there in the statute."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1768.376,1772.718,So that the governments are subject to a declaratory judgment but not to an injunction.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1772.718,1784.947,"That is correct, Your Honor, and since that point, without a stay of the First Circuit's mandate, the Department of Public Welfare has issued another notice under exactly the same circumstances which did not comply with that mandate, but I will get to that also in the main body of my argument."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1827.796,1834.578,"Well, sound policy reasons based on something other than the statute?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1834.578,1839.583,"No, Your Honor, sound policy reasons that derive directly from the statute."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1888.764,1896.2,"You say that 16,000 people received determinations based on facts unique to their case."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1896.2,1896.799,--Exactly.
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1896.799,1899.523,What sort of factual determinations were these?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1903.794,1904.736,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1962.753,1966.446,And it is those two determinations that you say were unique to each individual?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1966.446,1973.25,"Absolutely, Your Honor, each... I mean, that is not to say that two members of the class didn't have the same income, but that is, of course, a coincidence, and nothing specific to this change."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.853,1984.458,"But is it not true that if those two errors existed or either of them existed, that even without the statutory change, they would have been receiving an incorrect amount?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1984.458,1985.968,"--A different incorrect amount, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1985.968,1987.33,"Yes, but an incorrect amount."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1987.33,1990.161,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and that is not... that is absolutely correct."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1990.161,1995.164,"Had there been no statute, would that error have given rise to any statutory or constitutional right?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,1995.164,1996.656,"No, Your Honor, not under the statute."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2009.633,2021.391,"But the individual determination that you talk about is a preexisting error that causes this effect on the statute is put into effect, or a preexisting inaccuracy in the records as to certain individuals?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2021.391,2022.633,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2047.558,2049.691,There are two things that worry me.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2057.955,2059.185,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2062.908,2067.192,You mean some people never knew that they got $5 less than they got the month before?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2067.192,2067.732,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2078.209,2082.462,"They go to the office, and it would have been explained to them."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2082.462,2083.751,"In this case, Your Honor, that did not happen."
1984.83-1660,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2098.822,2102.695,"Well, then you get to my second point."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2121.429,2128.672,I am not certain if I am following--
1984.83-1660,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2128.672,2132.114,I just want to know that the average recipient understands percentages.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2132.114,2133.376,"--I can't answer that, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2134.726,2135.717,You can't?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2135.717,2139.19,--There was no evidence in the record as to people's mathematical--
1984.83-1660,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2139.19,2140.362,Outside of the record.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2140.362,2145.385,"--Outside of the record, I would assume that some people are proficient at math and other people are not proficient at math."
1984.83-1660,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2174.783,2180.218,"Well, I don' t understand yet how an average recipient can tell the difference between 18 and 20 percent."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2180.218,2181.298,I am not certain that that is necessary--
1984.83-1660,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2181.298,2182.379,To the dollar.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2184.44,2188.704,"--Your Honor, I am not certain that that is necessary in this case."
1984.83-1660,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2213.51,2219.024,"Mr. Hitov, would you be satisfied... well, with what in the notice would you be satisfied?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2219.024,2220.426,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2271.589,2274.012,"Mr. Hitov, would it affect the timing of the notice?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2274.012,2275.422,"--Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2275.422,2279.235,You couldn't get out a simple notice saying the statute has changed more quickly than making all the individual determinations?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2279.235,2279.866,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2288.211,2291.762,"I take it it is all a computerized operation, isn't it?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2291.762,2293.643,In Massachusetts it sometimes is and sometimes isn't.
1984.83-1660,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2293.643,2295.123,"In some states it is not, is it?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2295.123,2295.904,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2296.905,2301.197,"In states where it is not, it might take a little longer, might it not?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2301.197,2302.159,--It shouldn't.
1984.83-1660,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2307.144,2314.177,"Well, I mean, the notice you got out, if you have a computer, you can put this additional information on, I gather, without taking much time."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2314.177,2315.128,--As long as it takes the printer.
1984.83-1660,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2315.128,2321.551,"But if it is not on there, and you have to go through records and put it on in ink or something, that may take a little longer, may it not?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2321.551,2331.287,"There, Your Honor, again, only as long... the difference in time would be the difference in time that it take a printer to print it and the time it takes a person to write it, like it used to be done before."
1984.83-1660,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2381.14,2388.716,"How much are we talking about with the individual family with which you are concerned, $5 a month?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2388.716,2389.958,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1984.83-1660,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2389.958,2395.99,How much in actual benefit are we talking about for the average family with whom you are concerned?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2395.99,2414.893,"The average monthly benefit, which is all I can speak to, because different families have different certification periods, the average monthly benefit was reduced anywhere between apparently $1 and $10, and that could have been for a certification period of either one month or up to 12 months, although the vast majority were approximately--"
1984.83-1660,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2414.893,2416.062,Ten dollars is the maximum?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2416.062,2419.505,"--That's the maximum that can be established from the record, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2427.242,2429.072,Ten dollars a month.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2429.072,2439.668,"A month, Your Honor, and I should point out that we are talking about a 2 percent reduction in the earned income disregard, which I suspect Your Honors have already discovered is not the easiest concept to apply to the actual outcome of the food stamp grant."
1984.83-1660,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2460.521,2466.866,Is $10 a substantial percentage of the food stamps a given household may receive?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2466.866,2471.791,"--From the sheet in the record, Your Honor, $10 would be a very substantial percentage."
1984.83-1660,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2475.421,2477.114,Fifteen to 20 percent.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2477.114,2486.721,"But there were, of course, reductions of all sizes and the average for that page comes out to 4.78 percent, so the average family on that page lost 5 percent of their benefits."
1984.83-1660,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2506.934,2508.994,But it is a statutory change.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2508.994,2514.678,"--Your Honor, Congress changed the provision about the earned income disregard."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2542.347,2544.266,Didn't the First Circuit first look at the Constitution?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2544.266,2546.017,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2546.017,2548.04,Do you defend their doing that?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2548.04,2559.147,"No, in our briefs, we specifically said that we believe that was a mistake, that they were presented... of course, as counsel, we presented them with both, because we couldn't be certain that they would agree on the statutory interpretation."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2582.351,2586.025,"But your answer to my question is going to be based on the statute, as I understand it."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2586.025,2587.557,"Word for word on the statute, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2595.191,2596.941,Where do you find that?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2596.941,2599.573,"--That is the second clause of Section 2020(e)(10), Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.286,2617.875,"Such a hearing, but the hearing then takes you back to the first clause, which is, a state plan of operation shall provide for the granting of a fair hearing and a prompt determination to any household aggrieved by the action of the state agency, right?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2617.875,2619.746,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and what that says--"
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2619.746,2628.934,But isn't the... the government's argument is that the action which caused the change was the action of the United States.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2628.934,2635.206,"--The statute, though, Your Honor, if Your Honor reads the statute through, does not speak to the cause of the state--"
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2635.206,2638.188,It says by the action of the state agency.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2638.188,2640.649,"--Right, the action of the state agency here was to reduce a person's grant."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2658.741,2664.675,"But it says, by the action of the state agency under any provision of its plan of operation."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2664.675,2665.887,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2665.887,2668.208,"Well, doesn't that limit the generality?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2668.208,2668.919,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2680.667,2682.587,"Well, that sounds very circular to me."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2687.202,2688.541,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.541,2692.575,"It doesn't say that you must give advance notice saying you must give a fair hearing, does it?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2692.575,2699.918,"If I might, Your Honor, it says, any household which timely requests such a fair hearing after receiving individual notice of agency action reducing or terminating its benefits."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2699.918,2700.869,"Oh, I see your point."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2701.701,2704.562,"Within the household certification period, shall--"
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2704.562,2709.265,--You are saying after receiving individual notice assumes that there is a notice requirement.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2709.265,2710.527,--It explicitly assumes.
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2750.792,2764.55,"Yes, but it seems to me if you say after receiving individual notice of agency action, and so forth and so on, that that implies that there must be notice because there is a hearing, and it also implies there must be a hearing for every one of these cases, if you read it literally."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2764.55,2767.833,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, because it starts with, for any household that timely requests it."
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2769.545,2773.226,But timely requests a hearing after receiving individual notice.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2773.226,2775.399,"--Right, so that presupposes individual notice--"
1984.83-1660,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2775.399,2780.862,"It is after he requests such a fair hearing, which takes you back to the first, which would make the hearing requirement apply to every family."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2782.294,2782.401,--I am sorry.
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2897.698,2902.583,"--Well, how do you define when notice is required?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2902.583,2910.536,Notice is required by the Food Stamp Act whenever the agency proposes to reduce or terminate a person's food stamp benefits.
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.536,2911.708,And where is that in the statute?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2911.708,2913.18,That is in Section 2020(e)(10).
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2913.18,2914.142,What does it say?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2914.142,2918.844,It says that any household which timely requests a fair hearing after receiving an individual notice--
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2918.844,2919.465,I know.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2922.357,2924.868,"--Your Honor, it presupposes notice whenever--"
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2924.868,2925.99,"Well, you imply it."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2938.936,2940.809,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2943.981,2948.523,"Well, it may not, but certainly they couldn't buy pig shanks with it."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2948.523,2950.123,"That's correct, Your Honor, but that would not--"
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2950.123,2956.077,"So there are some kinds of limits, new limits that can be imposed that you wouldn't have to send a notice for."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2956.077,2956.938,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2958.28,2966.735,"Well, the government's contention is that why should you have to send a notice just to carry out a mathematical calculation."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2966.735,2967.857,"Your Honor, that--"
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2967.857,2968.757,That is their position.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2968.757,2969.758,--I understand that.
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2969.758,2971.548,Let's assume that that's all that was going to happen.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2978.673,2981.405,"Under the statute, Your Honor?"
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2983.906,2984.607,It does.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2984.607,2986.137,"--If it does, you need notice."
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2986.137,2990.02,Even though it absolutely could not possibly be a mistake?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,2990.02,2991.731,"That is what the statute says, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.731,2992.732,"Well, it isn't what it says."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3011.348,3017.011,"Your Honor, I do not believe it can be gainsaid that it presupposes notice, that it doesn't say, you shall send notice."
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3023.045,3030.54,"It certainly assumes that in some cases there is going to be notice sent, but it doesn't tell you which cases are those."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3030.54,3037.865,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but then if you move to the last clause of Section 2020(e)(10), it lists a specific exception."
1984.83-1660,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3056.435,3068.594,It still doesn't tell you... you disagreed a while ago that there are some cases that imposes some limit on... that didn't exist before in which there wouldn't have to be a notice.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3068.594,3070.426,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3077.35,3099.986,"The however language that you just read it seems to me is quite consistent with limiting the notice to an individual action type of thing where information is proposed that this particular recipient may no longer be qualified, rather than a very generalized situation where, say, Congress says all food stamp recipients shall be cut 10 percent."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3104.858,3112.094,"That would go more to what would be necessary in that notice, Your Honor, to allow somebody to know whether or not they should request a hearing."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3112.094,3116.847,What on earth would they request a hearing about when their benefits have been cut 10 percent?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3116.847,3117.859,"They almost definitely would not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3119.08,3120.71,So what is the point of the notice?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3120.71,3129.018,If there are no factual issues in dispute as a constitutional matter... I believe that what we are looking at is constitutional underpinnings here.
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3132.058,3137.013,"Certainly, but we don't ordinarily think of Congress as having imposed a perfectly irrational requirement."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3137.013,3137.691,No.
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3138.452,3146.627,What would be the point of requiring a notice in a situation where Congress says every single food stamp recipient shall be out by 10 percent?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3146.627,3150.3,"For example, Your Honor, 10 percent presumably of their preexisting grant."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3150.3,3150.811,Yes.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3150.811,3169.283,"If the preexisting grant... if ther department then out somebody 50 percent, or if they took their preexisting grant which was $50, let's say, and assumed it was $75, both of which are entirely possible, the person would in fact be out a wrong amount of benefits."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3174.476,3180.469,"They can challenge that, I would think, after they receive the amount of their benefit."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3188.907,3189.876,--And that is what we have here.
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3189.876,3193.93,--not because we intend to cut your payments because Congress told us to cut everybody 10 per cent.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3193.93,3199.363,"Your Honor, what we have here is an individual action in each one of these cases."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3210.519,3219.137,"Well, but as Justice Stevens pointed out, one of the factors of what you say are the two factors involved is preexisting determination."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3222.147,3228.831,"Your Honor, Congress itself recognized that exactly those times were the times of greatest error."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3229.442,3235.316,"Well, when you say Congress itself recognized that, are you relying on the language we have already talked about?"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3235.316,3244.132,"--No, Your Honor, we are relying on legislative history, the statements of Senator Dole, who you probably know is very active in the food stamp program, and Representative Foley, who at that time was very active in the food stamp program."
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3244.132,3251.186,But the closest thing in point so far as actual law as opposed to legislative history is the language we have discussed in 2010(e)?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3251.186,3256.7,"There is one other, Your Honor, which I would like to get to, which is 7 CFR of the Secretary's own regulation, the one that--"
1984.83-1660,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3256.7,3258.052,I was talking about the statute.
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3258.052,3261.432,"--In the statute, Your Honor, 2020(e)(10) is the section."
1984.83-1660,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3265.766,3273.841,"The statute also does not attempt to spell out what must be contained in an individual notice, does it--"
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3273.841,3274.702,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3274.702,3275.524,--even if that is required?
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3275.524,3276.513,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3296.908,3310.055,"Well, but the Committee report in 1977 of the House Committee said hearings would, of course, be unnecessary in the absence of claims of factual error and individual benefit computation and calculation."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3310.055,3310.545,--That's right.
1984.83-1660,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3311.277,3320.143,"And you are saying and the court below said the only way they would ever know that is if they had these figures in front of them, the recipients."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3320.143,3321.846,"That legislative history, Your Honor--"
1984.83-1660,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3321.846,3323.836,"That is the crux of it, I gather."
1984.83-1660,2,41499,steven_a_hitov,,3323.836,3348.212,"--That legislative history, Your Honor, was in fact written in 1976, not in 1977 when the language at issue here was not in the statute, was not even proposed for the statute, and that following that... the insertion of that language in the statute is when the Secretary then issued his regulation, his individual notice regulation that said you can only appeal if you are challenging the calculation, and that is language that requires, that you have information to challenge that calculation."
1984.83-1660,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3349.444,3351.725,Do you have anything further?
1984.83-1660,3,22543,ellen_l_janos,,3351.725,3352.566,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1660,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3352.566,3353.568,"Thank you, counsel."
