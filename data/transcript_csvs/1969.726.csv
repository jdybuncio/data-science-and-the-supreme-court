1969.726,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,50.317,"Next case for argument is Number 726, Mitchell against Donovan."
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,78.013,81.746,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,367.552,370.518,What did you ask for?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,370.518,375.031,"In the prayer for relief, we ask both for a temporary and permanent injunction."
1969.726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,375.031,376.164,Against what?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,376.164,383.02,Against the state officials requiring them to place the party candidates on the ballot.
1969.726,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,383.02,384.884,When?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,384.884,387.056,In the June '68 Election.
1969.726,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,387.056,388.99,Is that the only injunction you asked for?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,388.99,391.127,That is the only injunction at that time.
1969.726,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.362,412.385,And then what?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,417.277,417.746,I'm sorry?
1969.726,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,417.746,419.254,Did you amend your complaint?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,419.254,425.853,"Yes, we amended our complaint and the three-judge court granted the motion to amend the complaint."
1969.726,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,444.04,455.895,"Well in the prayer, you amended the complaint to allege that the Communist Party of the State intended and hoped to participate in future elections that I assume was not in the prayer"
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,455.895,458.028,That is correct.
1969.726,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,458.028,460.146,How if at all was the prayer amended?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,460.146,461.866,The prayer was not amended.
1969.726,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,472.619,485.229,"The only injunction you ask for, as I understand it explicitly, was an injunction to an election that is now passed and an election in which your clients were placed on a ballot in that time."
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,485.229,486.922,That's correct.
1969.726,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,486.922,497.064,"And that thereafter the only explicit relief demanded either in the original complaint or in the complaint that's amended was one for declaratory relief, is that right?"
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,497.064,510.225,"That is correct, although we feel we were not able to come back to Court because of the disposition of the motion of the state to dismiss as moot to ask for a permanent injunction which we feel we are entitled to by this party."
1969.726,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,510.225,519.133,"Well, yes, you were entitled to ask for it and then the dismissal would have been a denial of it but you did not in fact ask for it, did you?"
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,519.133,519.589,"No, we did not."
1969.726,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,519.589,537.417,"An injunction is strong medicine and generally the rules of pleading required that if you want an injunction you have to ask for an injunction and then it is not incorporated in the ordinary boilerplate language of such other further relief that maybe appropriate in circumstances etcetera, etcetera."
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,537.417,538.395,We did see --
1969.726,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,538.395,556.008,You know that is on my mind I suppose to these questions and that is whether or not this Court has jurisdiction under Title 28 of the Code Section 1253 whether or not in other words there was here a denial of an injunction and there was a denial of an injunction only if you asked for an injunction that was denied?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,556.008,561.324,"We feel that the relief asked for, we did ask for a permanent injunction."
1969.726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,576.911,582.324,What necessitated three-judge court?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,582.324,598.938,We sought to enjoin the both by the temporary relief requested the permanent injunction and the declaratory relief to stop to enjoin the execution and enforcement of the Communist Control Act of 1954.
1969.726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,609.446,617.388,I don't see any request for an injunction for restraining and enforcing of the Communist Control Act.
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,617.388,620.082,The United States is not a party.
1969.726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.227,649.606,You did not -- even not ask them a Court injunction against --
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,649.606,664.324,"Well, we asked for the relief which the Court held below entitled us to a three-judge court, to restrain the state officials from preventing the Communist Party from being on the ‘68 ballot."
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,952.576,956.501,Do you want us to declare that Act unconstitutional?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,956.501,960.516,"We also -- yes, we also want a permanent injunction."
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,960.516,968.557,And we are to declare that statute unconstitutional without the United States Government having anything to do with it?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,968.557,973.997,We believe the United States Government has had a clear position over the years.
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,973.997,979.53,"What position, who is now speaking for the United States Government?"
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,979.53,982.15,The United States has not appeared on this case.
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,982.15,993.21,How can we declare an Act of Congress unconstitutional without the Attorney General of the United States or somebody representing him being here?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,993.21,998.516,It's my understanding that the Court did not request the appearance of the United States.
1969.726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,998.516,1000.183,You mean it's the Government?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1000.183,1000.762,Yes.
1969.726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1001.563,1004.471,"He gave the statutory notice to the Attorney General, didn't I?"
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1004.471,1009.762,Not only gave statutory notice but teletyped an order requiring him to appear.
1969.726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.762,1010.438,True.
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1010.438,1014.859,The response to which was the appearance of the U.S. Attorney as amicus curiae.
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1014.859,1033.339,"Well, as I understand the judgment of the lower court was that there was no case in controversy because the Attorney General in his amicus brief had suggested that the law did not apply to Minnesota."
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1036.423,1038.268,That is one of the points relied upon.
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1052.221,1055.419,"It wasn't moot, was it?"
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1055.419,1055.952,We do not --
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1055.952,1059.69,If it wasn't moot why did you amend?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1059.69,1061.163,"Well, we did not anticipate --"
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1061.163,1064.492,You amended because it had been moot up till that time.
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1067.353,1072.078,We amended because the Court granted the relief of the party to appear on that ballot.
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1072.078,1075.316,That is right.
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1081.639,1083.158,We believe we do.
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1083.158,1084.087,How do you --
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1084.087,1085.078,The Attorney General.
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1085.078,1088.159,Who is the next Secretary of State?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1088.159,1091.935,The next Secretary of State will be elected in the coming elections?
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1091.935,1094.777,How do you know what he's going to do when you don't even know who he is?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1094.777,1102.402,But we feel Mr. Justice that this case is going to be presented again before that man leaves office.
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1190.878,1201.895,"We are speaking about lack of case and controversy, I mean what Connecticut does in somebody else that's not before us."
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1207.191,1210.517,"Yes, we believe we are entitled to a permanent injunction."
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1210.517,1217.049,What authority do you have for that?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1240.111,1244.639,"No, and the state can continually present us with the same situation."
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1244.639,1248.827,Is there anything in the record that says the State intends to?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1248.827,1250.133,There is.
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1262.114,1263.976,Appellants brief.
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1263.976,1282.411,And in the appendix -- on page 69 of the appendix.
1969.726,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1290.179,1291.699,"Just a deferment, Mr. Castner."
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1301.375,1304.599,"Yes, that is correct."
1969.726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1347.024,1348.455,And who's Mr. Kyle?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1348.455,1354.865,Mr. Kyle was the Solicitor General in the case and he is appearing for appellees today.
1969.726,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1354.865,1357.486,The representative of the Attorney General?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1357.486,1364.19,He was the -- the Chief Officer Solicitor General of the State of Minnesota.
1969.726,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1364.19,1367.08,"Oh, he is a subordinate of the Attorney General, was he not at that time?"
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1367.08,1370.391,That is correct.
1969.726,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1370.391,1372.964,And he is no longer assistant?
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1372.964,1375.428,"No, he is not."
1969.726,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1376.6,1380.938,"He's present in the courtroom but in the office, is that what you mean?"
1969.726,0,34217,lynn_s_castner,,1380.938,1392.207,"Well, I misspoke I -- he did leave the office of Solicitor General who I understand that came back to it and is presently serving that institution now."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2147.221,2151.967,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2197.471,2199.227,(Inaudible)
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2199.227,2199.86,Excuse me?
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2199.86,2201.635,(Inaudible)
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2201.635,2204.479,"Yes, as of now."
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2212.413,2213.975,The statement what?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2213.975,2239.565,The statement Your Honor which was found in the record concerning the position of the Attorney General with respect to a future election and made by me -- was made by and the statement as such stands now to the extent that the Attorney General will see fit to follow what I or someone else on the staff may tell him to do with respect to a given election.
1969.726,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2239.565,2241.852,The Attorney General of your states have elected officers?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2241.852,2242.512,"That is correct, Your Honor?"
1969.726,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2242.512,2243.686,"For a what, a four-year term?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2243.686,2245.228,Four-year term.
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2276.689,2281.99,You will have new officers after January of 1971?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2281.99,2282.725,That's correct.
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2282.725,2286.654,The Governor and the Attorney General take office in January.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2286.654,2289.614,"Right, in January, Your Honor."
1969.726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.926,2365.132,Did the action of the Secretary of State in refusing for nominating petitions purport to be got under a state statute or wasn't that presumably in the federal court?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2365.132,2369.861,It was done -- the legal authority -- there was a dispute on this Your Honor.
1969.726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.663,2398.205,It purports to preempt absent Congress was elected except –-
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2398.205,2399.486,"No, question about that, Your Honor."
1969.726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.486,2403.958,On the face of the -- of your state statutes would prevent it.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2403.958,2406.106,There would be no disabling state statute.
1969.726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.106,2407.897,So this is good.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2413.221,2415.354,"Federal Law requires us to do this, this was --"
1969.726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.354,2419.733,These are our state law?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2419.733,2420.218,That is correct.
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2453.405,2455.232,"Mr. Kyle, I don't --"
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2455.232,2457.687,"May I ask you a question, I want to get it."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2461.773,2465.841,"They filed -- no, Your Honor they presented to the Secretary of State --"
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2465.841,2466.318,Alright.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2466.318,2470.056,-- a nominating petition on behalf of the Communist Party of the United States.
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2470.056,2471.36,And what did he do?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2471.36,2472.653,He refused to accept it.
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2472.653,2473.944,On what grounds?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2473.944,2476.336,That the Attorney General told him to refuse to accept it.
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2476.336,2478.477,You mean the Attorney General of the state?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2478.477,2479.89,Of the State of Minnesota.
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2479.89,2484.23,And you say he did it on the ground that this federal law barred it?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2484.23,2486.018,On the ground of the Communist Control Act?
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2486.018,2491.418,"That doesn't get your state out, does it, to say that the federal law bars it."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2495.766,2497.13,We said no.
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2497.13,2497.839,"You said, no."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2502.066,2503.431,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2503.431,2506.217,You did it on the grounds that the Federal Law prohibits it.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2506.217,2507.035,That is correct.
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2507.035,2509.691,What did you tell him about the First Amendment?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2509.691,2510.441,We didn't tell him anything about the First Amendment.
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2510.441,2511.44,You didn't mention that?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2511.44,2512.695,"No, we did not."
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2512.695,2514.643,Do you think it had anything to do with it?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2514.643,2523.5,"At the time that we were presented with the petition, Your Honor the situation arose in this manner."
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2539.642,2542.983,That was an issue between you and the people who wanted to get on the ticket.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2542.983,2543.613,Yes.
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2543.613,2551.458,"Between the State of Minnesota, not between the Federal Government but between the State of Minnesota and the people who wanted to get on the ticket list?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2551.458,2553.665,"Well, I don't -- I don't know where that follows, Your Honor."
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2553.665,2559.081,"Well doesn't it, who objected, who denied it except the state."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2560.192,2561.729,"Well, the state, the state you're right."
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2574.321,2576.981,You did not let him get on?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2576.981,2577.605,That is correct.
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2577.605,2579.708,And let him get on here?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2579.708,2581.371,"Well, they have not."
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2581.371,2581.912,Say what?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2581.912,2583.474,They've been not.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2629.039,2652.455,"Mr. Kyle, would it be possible to your mind as Solicitor General to apprise that since the three-judge court has already ruled on the 1968 election that you see no reason why they shouldn't follow that in later elections and let the party on the ballot."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2652.455,2663.182,"Well, I would have no difficulty with it except that the basis of the three-judge court's ruling Your Honor was to specifically reserve the question of the constitutionality of the Act."
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2663.182,2664.486,And they haven't passed it on yet.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2664.486,2666.129,And they haven't passed it on yet.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2669.398,2689.303,"Well, my point is that you feel obliged to follow an Act of Congress which has no means of enforcing it you if you don't follow it and you have the opinion of a three-judge constitutionally set up Court that you did not have to follow it."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2696.887,2700.229,I'd like to say yes but I can't Your Honor.
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2708.973,2713.075,"You have a further impediment, have you not, you are not the Attorney General of Minnesota."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2713.075,2713.778,That is correct.
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2713.778,2717.406,But one of his subordinates who can't give opinion.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2717.406,2718.259,"Sir, that is pleasure --"
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2718.259,2728.129,"Well, can't we get somebody in that can give us opinion for the State of Minnesota if you are not authorized to do it, why were you sent here for if not to make a statement?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2728.129,2732.7,"I think I am authorized, no I'm authorize to make statements on behalf the State of Minnesota."
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2732.7,2739.189,"Well, you're authorized to make statements in this argument but you're not authorized to give an opinion that hasn't been asked for yet."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2739.189,2739.688,That is correct.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2739.688,2741.574,We were asking you for one?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2741.574,2743.812,"Well, you're asking me to enforce an argument, Your Honor."
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2743.812,2752.663,We are asking you on the ground that you are here purporting to be the representative of the Attorney General of the State of Minnesota.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2757.611,2760.484,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2760.484,2765.939,But you have no authority to give an opinion about the ballots in next September's election.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2765.939,2769.903,"Yes, he has not asked me for my opinion concerning the matter."
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2769.903,2775.284,Do you deny having that authority?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2775.284,2776.654,"I'm not sure, I understand your question?"
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2776.654,2781.034,Do you deny having the authority which the Chief Justice asked you about?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2794.249,2796.172,"I have given you statements, Your Honor?"
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2796.172,2809.817,"But you don't deny them that you have authority to determine for the State of Minnesota, speak for him now and say whether you are opposing this party getting on the ticket?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2809.817,2811.727,"Yes, I am opposing this party getting ticket."
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2811.727,2812.318,What?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2812.318,2820.08,I am opposing this party on the ticket this is the position which we took earlier and this position which we have taken this litigation.
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2820.08,2826.224,You do it on the ground that you -- that the state does it of its own will or because it does it.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2826.224,2834.255,I do it on the ground with an Act of Congress has said as I read that Act of Congress that the party shall not go on the ballot.
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2834.255,2836.704,And what did the Court tell you?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2836.704,2846.801,The Court put them on ballot because the Court said we do not have enough time to resolve what they consider to be the difficult grave constitutional issues which we presented.
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2846.801,2850.722,But why should this case not be met on its face?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2859.498,2867.944,"Well, whether it is going to be met on the merits or not Your Honor is a decision which this Court is going to make right now which I have no control."
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2867.944,2872.484,You have no control over it but you have control over the safe case?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2872.484,2875.482,But I -- as I read the decisions of this Court.
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2875.482,2887.493,Do you say that you have in a less authority than the Attorney General of the State of Minnesota has to state views on this particular case when you are now representing the State of Minnesota.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2887.493,2888.146,No.
1969.726,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2888.146,2897.65,You do not claim any less authority than the Attorney General.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,2897.65,2930.121,"Now, it is our position on this appeal that jurisdiction is also lacking in addition to the fact that a three-judge court in our view was not required below but that there was no denial of permanent injunction in this litigation and that is a requirement of Section 1253, a section which recently was reviewed in analogous context in a Goldstein decision by this Court about two months ago."
1969.726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3046.024,3048.729,What request for a permanent injunction?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3048.729,3049.652,"Excuse me, I see."
1969.726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3049.652,3054.831,Only if we read the dismissal as denying you say there a request for a permanent injunction for my request.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3054.831,3059.611,Only if you read it as having the effect of denying whatever their prayer for relief.
1969.726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3059.611,3061.128,"Well, what was it?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3061.128,3063.132,That the Communist Control Act declared unconsciously.
1969.726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3063.132,3064.322,For declaratory judgment?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3064.322,3064.859,That is correct.
1969.726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3064.859,3065.756,Not for an injunction?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3065.756,3067.541,"No, there was no request for an injunction."
1969.726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3067.541,3070.125,That's what I thought.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3070.125,3071.053,No request at all.
1969.726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3071.053,3074.528,"On the injunctive request, it was respect to what election."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3074.528,3078.006,All with the respect to the 1968 Election.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3078.006,3081.48,What prayer did they grant then on?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3084.838,3087.654,"A motion for a temporary, mandatory --"
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3087.654,3090.116,Where is that in the appendix?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3090.116,3091.615,"The motion, Your Honor?"
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3091.615,3094.475,"Yes, where is the request for an injunction that they granted?"
1969.726,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.475,3097.533,"It was page 14, on page 14."
1969.726,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3113.658,3119.809,"Paragraph two on page 14, isn't that correct?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3119.809,3123.908,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1969.726,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3123.908,3126.779,And that was granted you did not take an appeal from that.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3126.779,3127.531,That is correct.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3127.531,3132.391,"What is that, would you read that line?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3134.691,3138.925,That the Court issues a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3138.925,3143.629,And what does that word permanent injunction mean?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3143.629,3145.531,It means they permanently tell the second.
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3154.944,3155.72,For what?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3155.72,3157.432,For the 1968 election.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3157.432,3163.597,"What would permanent injunction, request for a permanent injunction mean to you?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3163.597,3168.181,It means that he does it for all time with respect to the 1968 election.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3176.363,3178.615,Where does it say with reference to that particular election?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3178.615,3197.655,"Well, because it says to accept and file the aforesaid petition and that aforesaid petition only refers to the 1968 election and require the defendant Donovan include upon the ballot for the general election to be held on November 5, 1968."
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3198.448,3207.134,"What Section 5 as to where, on the next page, what is usually required in bills for injunction?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3207.134,3211.208,For such further and all relief that the Court may deem equitable and proper.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3211.208,3213.422,What do you think about that now?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3213.422,3219.526,"I think it is a standard boilerplate phrase, which is put in every -- well, I don't think it has any meaning in of it self."
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3219.526,3222.852,"Well, but I have used it many times in complaints."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3222.852,3223.305,I don't think it is.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3223.305,3233.261,I always thought it meant that you are asking not only for that relief but for any other relief that is necessary to protect the rights they complained of.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3235.606,3242.063,"But if it does means that Your Honor, it means that to protect the rights within the context of the this case."
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3244.64,3247.708,"That is rather technical construction, isn't it?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3247.708,3248.16,I don't think so.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3250.974,3257.461,It might be and Court sometimes are liberal in protecting First Amendment rights.
1969.726,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3257.461,3266.017,You mean it's not as quicker this time.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3266.017,3281.134,"In any event, Mr. Castner made a statement during his argument to the effect that they could have or couldn't or unable to make an amendment to the complaint which would have amended the prayer for relief."
1969.726,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3336.492,3338.937,"Well, we reach that -- we reach even that question."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3341.17,3343.611,"You do not have jurisdiction, Your Honor, that is correct."
1969.726,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3343.611,3345.95,You don't even reach this first question.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3345.95,3348.309,"That is correct, that is correct."
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3348.309,3355.932,"One of the point of our proceedings according from all 14, there was no pleadings subsequent to that, wasn't it?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3358.636,3360.405,"No because the -- that's correct, Your Honor."
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3373.365,3379.039,Are you complaining that we don't have jurisdiction or that the court below didn't have jurisdiction?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3379.039,3381.293,Complaining that you do not at this stage have jurisdiction.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3381.293,3382.057,Pardon?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3382.057,3384.05,Complaining that you do not have jurisdiction?
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3384.05,3385.746,That we do not.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3387.103,3399.832,Because this Court to have jurisdiction it must be an appeal from a decision of a three-judge -- from an order required to be heard by a three-judge district court.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3399.832,3401.673,Did it make an order?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3401.673,3402.336,"Yes, there was an order?"
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3402.336,3403.795,What was it?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3403.795,3414.091,That the communist candidates be placed upon the ballot but it is our position that if we did not need a three-judge district court below.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3414.091,3416.951,Or is that your ground that there should have been one judge instead of a three-judge?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3416.951,3418.115,That's right.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3420.191,3421.173,What is the other ground?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3421.173,3426.823,The other ground is that this is not an appeal from an order granting a permanent injunction.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3429.603,3434.487,Does it -- suppose it denies that?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3434.487,3437.284,"Excuse me, that's denying a permanent injunction?"
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3437.284,3438.752,"And you said, it does not grant?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3438.752,3441.304,"I meant, it denied, I stand corrected."
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3443.123,3448.332,Whether it amounts -- it amounts for that almost doesn't it into the dismissing?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3448.332,3453.86,"No, I don't think it is does because I don't see how it can amount to anything if there is no request for it, to begin with."
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3453.86,3457.179,That's going back to another question as well in that request.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3457.179,3457.581,"Well, but it's --"
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3457.581,3465.094,"From my viewpoint, that depends on paragraph five not on paragraph two?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3465.094,3468.216,"Well, that -- that could be although I don't think --"
1969.726,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3468.216,3474.843,"Well, Mr. Kyle, assuming that the three-judge court would have turn this on ground that there was no request for an injunction."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3490.407,3492.93,That is correct.
1969.726,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3492.93,3500.031,We don't have the benefit of any view of the three-judge court whether an injunction was requested.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3500.031,3502.842,"No, no because they simply viewed the --"
1969.726,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3502.842,3515.233,And if we think that it was sufficiently requested that there was a denial here then I take it what we have to decide as whether they were right or wrong in holding that there was no case of controversy within Golden and Zwickler.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3515.233,3522.831,Assuming you also conclude that this was a type of case required to be heard by a three-judge court.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3522.831,3531.329,"And now this amended position of yours, what do you mean -- what do you mean by “there's no case of controversy”?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3531.329,3543.55,I mean that as I read the decisions of this Court that it is required and under the declaratory judgment action that there must be a live controversy between --
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3543.55,3544.918,And there's not any here?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3544.918,3551.528,"I don't think there is, Your Honor, notwithstanding the fact that we are standing before this Court."
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3573.751,3578.422,"Did they purport to make this a class action in the pleadings, I have not -- (Voice Overlap)?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3578.422,3589.196,"Yes, they did Your Honor, with respect to class action, with respect to those who signed the nominating petition and those who did not sign the nominating petition."
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3589.196,3593.18,But as to future candidates and future elections?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3593.18,3599.166,"No, there's no reference, see there is no reference any place to future candidates or future elections."
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3654.077,3668.003,Are you familiar with the case earlier this term of the Court's I think arising out of Ohio in which we dismissed perhaps without much explanation but I wonder if we could indicate.
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3668.003,3669.249,Brockington v. Rhodes?
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3669.249,3683.94,"-- and then give some indication that this was a dismissal because there was no indication that these people were going to be candidates in the next election, is that something you have before you?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3685.395,3693.186,"Yes, if it's the case that I am thinking it is one in which he did not bring it as class action, it's Brockington v. Rhodes."
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3693.186,3694.931,"Yeah, that's the one I'm thinking."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3694.931,3696.458,In which the Court does --
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3696.458,3697.847,What's the name of it?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3697.847,3698.687,Brockington.
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3700.313,3710.177,Where is that in your brief? Do you know at the moment?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3710.177,3716.08,"I'm not sure that it is cited in the brief, Your Honor but it is 90 Supreme Court 206."
1969.726,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3716.08,3717.686,What was the volume?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3717.686,3728.733,90 Supreme Court at page 206.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3728.733,3738.485,"Well, in this case, if there is evidence in formal letter that they do intend to keep doing for the Communist Party?"
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3738.485,3753.357,There is evidence in the form of an affidavit by the Secretary of the Minnesota Communist Party that they intend to participate in future Minnesota local election.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3753.357,3755.67,Is there anything in the record that contradicts that?
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3755.67,3756.375,No.
1969.726,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3756.375,3762.276,"So, that's not in the writing, which is different from Rhodes case."
1969.726,1,39701,richard_h_kyle,,3762.276,3769.588,Yes sir.
1969.726,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3783.983,3785.196,Thank you Mr. Kyle.
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,3797.621,3802.597,I would like to speak first of the question of 1253 jurisdiction.
1969.726,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3840.878,3845.654,But what's the statute say 28 United States Code Section 1253.
1969.726,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3892.385,3898.537,"The statute says for granting or denying an injunction, that's what the statute says."
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,3898.537,3899.621,Right.
1969.726,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3899.621,3901.81,Interlocutory or permanent.
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,3901.81,3902.542,We asked --
1969.726,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3902.542,3908.24,What injunction was denied in this case?
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,3908.24,3914.335,The original injunction that we asked for was a permanent injunction prior to the election.
1969.726,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3922.161,3925.646,The injunction but rather the injunction you asked for was granted.
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,3925.646,3928.254,It was one of three types of injunctions we asked for.
1969.726,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3936.81,3942.731,What was the permanent injunction that you asked for and please show it in the record?
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,3942.731,3944.926,Prior to --
1969.726,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3944.926,3946.931,On page 14 is your injunction.
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,3946.931,3947.609,-- of the appendix.
1969.726,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3947.609,3956.098,What you asked for in paragraph two.
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,3956.098,3975.316,The Court issues a permanent injunction requiring the Defendant Secretary of State Joseph Donovan to accept and file the petition for nomination as required by the statutes and required that Donovan include upon the ballot the names of Mitchell and Zagarell.
1969.726,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3981.254,3984.671,Aren't you bound on what you ask for here?
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4031.332,4032.741,That is what we asked for prior to the election.
1969.726,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4032.741,4035.488,And you wouldn't deny it.
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4041.385,4042.886,We did not.
1969.726,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4042.886,4044.37,"Well, then how are you here?"
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4044.37,4056.865,We amended the complaint and we feel that rule 54 is broad enough and clear that for such other and further relief that we are entitled to a permanent injunction.
1969.726,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4056.865,4068.645,"Well then, if you filed a case in which you asked for a two declaratory judgments and for such of them further relief, you think you'd get under this Act?"
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4086.177,4089.218,We are at this Court to issue the permanent injunction.
1969.726,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4089.218,4093.95,"Oh that is, I guess was that under the All Writs statute."
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4093.95,4094.353,"Pardon me, Mr. Justice?"
1969.726,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4094.353,4096.448,"Under the All Writs statute, I guess."
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4096.448,4097.126,Yes.
1969.726,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4097.126,4098.381,Yeah.
1969.726,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4101.981,4131.292,"Now, tell me Mr. Castner, I noticed that the opening sentence the three-judge court decision is that we considers ourselves here with the propriety entertaining that which the plaintiffs seeking declaratory relief based on issues arising, are we doing first that to at least the three-judge court would not regard it but was there any law before them in the application for some mootness."
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4131.292,4139.514,And at that point in time the issues before them were a motion to amend the complaint and a motion to dismiss.
1969.726,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4212.481,4238.175,"That is to say that even that the three-judge court have not reached the conclusion with no cases actually, he would have concluded that there was a case and that they may have limited relief to the declaratory relief and under the courtroom, that was perfectly proper if it attack the fact that it was the three-judge court."
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4238.175,4248.006,"That is correct, we feel more and Ogelvie stands for the same proposition."
1969.726,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4261.593,4263.596,This Hall and Beals is the Colorado case?
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4263.596,4264.716,"Yes, it is."
1969.726,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4296.093,4299.578,"Beside the feeling up here, do you feel that the Court of Appeals."
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4299.578,4301.545,"No, we did not."
1969.726,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4336.157,4337.12,But that didn't happen to you.
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4353.505,4360.989,"No, we asked for a declaratory judgment, they refused to reach the merits because of a want of an actual controversy."
1969.726,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4360.989,4363.866,Relief you wanted to get the names of your people on the ballot.
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4369.869,4373.971,"No, but we disagree as to the effect of that type of relief."
1969.726,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4380.77,4385.302,"No, I'm not, I was merely talking about that."
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4385.302,4394.4,Let me make one or two more points.
1969.726,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4433.345,4438.964,Would you mean they don't have to be identified in advance except by class.
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4438.964,4439.542,That is correct.
1969.726,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4439.542,4451.013,I just wanted to be sure.
1969.726,2,34217,lynn_s_castner,,4451.013,4465.676,"One last point, we feel that the question of granting of declaratory relief after the need for an injunction is passed is founded in the number of decisions."
1969.726,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4494.104,4495.497,"Thank you, Mr. Castner."
