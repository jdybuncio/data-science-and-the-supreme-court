1962.37,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,10.635,"Number 37, Hewitt-Robins Incorporated, Petitioner, versus Eastern Freight-Ways, Incorporated."
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,13.237,18.448,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.37,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,633.672,638.942,And the Commission held that that was an unreasonable practice?
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,638.942,640.471,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.37,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,640.471,641.925,What happened to that rule?
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,644.312,649.263,"Well, that ruling remains at this time and we have intended to --"
1962.37,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,649.263,653.07,Is it before a judge of the District Court?
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,653.07,662.04,"Well, it is before the District Court of New Jersey with respect to whether or not that ruling is supported by evidence or record before the Commission."
1962.37,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,662.04,666.268,"Yes, but -- I mean, has the District Court decided that case?"
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,666.268,667.257,Not yet Your Honor.
1962.37,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,742.021,756.469,"Did you happen to file an action in the District Court in resolving the complaint in New Jersey, held that the Commission wrongful [Inaudible]"
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,756.469,760.608,"In this case, we would not have an action Your Honor."
1962.37,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,783.185,785.279,But your case was not something new?
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,785.279,787.981,That is true sir.
1962.37,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,787.981,792.616,You have to go before the Commission in the first instance since you recognize the first (Voice Overlap) --
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,792.616,825.094,"Under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction Your Honor, I had to go to the Commission for the reason that the carrier was contending that the route over the intrastate line was an unreasonable one and that of course presented a question for administrative adjudication for the sake of uniformity and the expertise of the Commission to decide whether or not that route was an unreasonable one."
1962.37,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,827.186,838.107,"[Inaudible] if you shouldn’t prevail here, what happens to that New Jersey one, a suit pending in New Jersey District Court, it doesn’t have to be decided then?"
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,838.107,839.236,That will be decided Your Honor.
1962.37,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,839.236,840.513,That’s to be decided anyway.
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,840.513,842.194,It will be decided Your Honor.
1962.37,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,842.194,848.67,"Well, what's the New Jersey Court to gain by holding it up until they hear from us?"
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,848.67,866.932,"Well, the Jersey Court was asked to hold in abeyance its decision until this Court decides this matter because there too, the question arises as to whether or not the Interstate Commerce Commission has any jurisdiction on the matter."
1962.37,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1129.776,1150.592,"Of course T.I.M.E. involved that kind of the situation, but what do you find in T.I.M.E. to suggest that the reason of the decision, the reason of the opinion was limited to a so-called inherently unreasonable rates?"
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,1150.592,1151.051,Well --
1962.37,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1151.051,1155.465,Do you think that -- do you think that was the rationale of the case?
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,1155.465,1165.903,"Well, I believe Your Honor that that was the set -- the only question involved in the case, the reasonableness of rates."
1962.37,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1165.903,1167.563,That’s what put the issue.
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,1168.928,1178.304,Yes sir and we feel that the decision should be confined to its own facts.
1962.37,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1227.355,1231.443,But may the shipper direct the route?
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,1231.443,1231.896,I beg your pardon?
1962.37,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1231.896,1235.498,May the shipper direct the carrier to take a particular route or not?
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,1235.498,1237.849,"No, not in motor carrier practice, sir."
1962.37,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1237.849,1244.889,"I wouldn’t suppose it was a practice, I just wondered whether a shipper might say, ""I want you to go by the intrastate rather than the interstate."""
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,1244.889,1249.464,He has no right at all to route a motor carrier shipment.
1962.37,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1261.376,1270.237,"Do you say he has no right to specify a route, but you do say he's got a right to pick this certain route with the --"
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,1270.237,1271.298,Yes sir.
1962.37,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1271.298,1275.042,-- and he has got a right to inspect the carrier that [Inaudible]
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,1275.042,1276.725,"Oh, the cheapest route, that is --"
1962.37,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1276.725,1283.346,"So, he doesn’t have a right to direct a route -- the cheapest -- it’s just automatically the shortest route, you say?"
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,1283.346,1293.117,"Well, under common law he is entitled to have the cheapest route, but he has no right to say to the carrier, ""I want you to ship via this route."""
1962.37,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1298.289,1303.713,And there's no way the Commission could make him hold that he’s going to put it in this route?
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,1303.713,1304.233,"No, sir."
1962.37,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1354.765,1362.391,We'll recess now.
1962.37,0,28222,harry_teichner,,1362.391,1367.737,-- Your Honor I have concluded my argument.
1962.37,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1370.497,1373.036,Very well. Mr. Caron.
1962.37,1,44127,wilfred_r_caron,,1373.036,1375.834,May it please the Court.
1962.37,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1553.735,1555.793,[Inaudible]
1962.37,1,44127,wilfred_r_caron,,1555.793,1561.323,302 ICC page 173 Your Honor.
1962.37,2,28222,harry_teichner,,2702.646,2726.291,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think it was the concluding paragraph of the majority opinion in T.I.M.E. which adverted to the malice we have just discussed whether or not the shipper would have a right to attack the rate as being unreasonable anti shipment and at the time when the rate was first proposed to be put into effect."
1962.37,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2742.846,2744.65,Is that mentioned your brief?
1962.37,2,28222,harry_teichner,,2744.65,2745.511,No sir it is not.
1962.37,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2750.646,2752.17,[Inaudible]
1962.37,2,28222,harry_teichner,,2752.17,2772.082,"Its Section 15, subdivision 8 of part one of the Interstate Commerce Act which provides that with respect rail carriers, a shipper may designate the route and that it would unlawful for the rail carriers to deviate from such route."
1962.37,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2848.685,2850.167,What were you reading from?
1962.37,2,28222,harry_teichner,,2850.167,2854.381,I was reading from the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission in this case.
1962.37,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2854.381,2855.527,In this particular case?
1962.37,2,28222,harry_teichner,,2855.527,2856.601,Yes sir.
1962.37,3,44127,wilfred_r_caron,,2913.125,2919.483,"Mr. Chief Justice, under these circumstances, do you still require an additional brief with respect to that point?"
1962.37,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2919.483,2920.741,Did you want to --
1962.37,4,28222,harry_teichner,,2920.741,2922.386,I would like to submit something Your Honor.
1962.37,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2922.386,2923.116,You may if you wish if you don't --
1962.37,4,28222,harry_teichner,,2923.116,2924.026,And to clarify --
1962.37,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2924.026,2926.356,"-- care to submit anything more, it's not necessary."
1962.37,4,28222,harry_teichner,,2926.356,2929.211,Thank you.
