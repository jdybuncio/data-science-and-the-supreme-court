1963.329,1,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,33.135,38.399,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1963.329,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1008.376,1023.264,"Mr. Yancey, does the respondent make anything that the point that this property was not purchased as -- and --and Article 1, Section 8, cl. 17 refers only to property which is purchased."
1963.329,1,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,1023.264,1023.932,"Yes, Your Honor."
1963.329,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1023.932,1026.41,But all this property was donated or given to the Government.
1963.329,1,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,1026.41,1026.882,"Yes, Your Honor."
1963.329,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1652.187,1656.047,Mr. O'Quin.
1963.329,2,34912,leon_oquin,,1657.655,1660.754,If the Court please.
1963.329,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1880.816,1886.386,"Of course in -- one meaning of the word purchase is any acquisition other than by inheritance, I suppose."
1963.329,2,34912,leon_oquin,,1886.386,1887.871,"1Yes, Your Honor."
1963.329,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2295.86,2298.354,Mr. Cashio.
1963.329,3,23687,ferdinand_a_cashio,,2298.354,2302.306,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,5878.536,5880.445,I should like to use the --
1963.329,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5880.445,5883.187,"Mr. Yancey, you may proceed."
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,5883.187,5884.781,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1963.329,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5891.693,5893.187,Very well.
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,5893.187,5908.209,"Beginning with the -- the idea that the argument, that there must be a purchase -- of course we realize that time is used in the -- in Clause 17 of the Constitution we've been talking about."
1963.329,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6160.763,6173.33,"The section of Appropriation Act that is quoted in -- on page 3 of the Government's brief, lend any force to that."
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6201.061,6206.985,"Yes, Your Honor that was -- he was the officer of the Government designated to accept title in fee simple on behalf of the Government."
1963.329,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6206.985,6214.933,"So with that, I suppose that would limit the Government to accepting title in fee simple."
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6214.933,6215.893,I -- I would think so.
1963.329,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6221.185,6221.58,Yes.
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6221.58,6223.315,Meaning that requirement of the Government.
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6223.315,6238.01,"Suppose -- suppose instead of taking the lease, the convener had bought this unconditional sale be paid yearly over a certain number of years."
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6239.096,6242.043,I think Your -- I think Your Honor perhaps has in mind S.R.A. versus Minnesota --
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6242.043,6242.499,(Voice Overlap)
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6242.499,6244.189,-- which has been discussed here.
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6244.189,6244.338,As we have --
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6244.338,6248.224,But we have -- we have no quarrel with that case whatever.
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6281.926,6288.148,You wouldn't think the Government had given a lease that Louisiana could tax?
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6291.434,6296.718,"Had -- had the Government -- had the Government departed with title, yes Your Honor, I would say that."
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6296.718,6310.333,"Suppose that it had departed with title said that in the period -- after it spent 50 years, the title shall revert to the Government."
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6310.333,6311.466,I -- I don't' quite understand.
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6311.466,6313.313,Suppose it had conveyed the land --
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6313.313,6314.923,The -- the -- is the Government conveying?
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6314.923,6330.834,"The Government conveys the land to the company saying that conveying, with all the rights of pertinency thereto and so forth, but said that it's conveyed for the understanding that within 50 years, title will revert to the Government."
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6330.834,6344.344,"I would think that when the title does revert, then the situation would be governed by the statutes of Louisiana which says that the Government is granted exclusive jurisdiction if it acquires land in the State for -- for any purpose whatever."
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6344.344,6347.035,Would it not the Government giving a deed?
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6347.035,6347.502,The -- you -- you said the Government --
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6347.502,6348.656,They have leased to (Voice Overlap) --
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6348.656,6350.748,You said the Government --
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6350.748,6360.886,"-- deed, in all respect, is like a deed except that the deed provided at the end of 50 years, the title should revert to the Government."
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6363.145,6366.085,You mean until -- until the Government gets title back.
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6366.085,6367.346,That's' right.
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6367.346,6376.419,"I -- I'm not -- yes, we believe that -- that it could tax because the State has departed absolutely within it vested your title, it seem to me during that time."
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6376.419,6382.644,It points to some of the difficulties of the numerous cases we've had.
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6388.65,6407.982,"That was contested in the -- in the cases that the counsel has referred to and those -- the State of Louisiana held in that case that we had to pay those taxes because there's the -- the Federal Government has given up exclusive jurisdiction and we think it's an erroneous holding, if Your Honor please."
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6526.329,6540.059,Your argument (Inaudible) the invalidation of Louisiana's rights to severance tax?
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6540.059,6541.105,"Would you repeat your question, Your Honor?"
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6541.105,6553.675,"Would it -- your -- if your argument were accepted on this tax -- ad valorem tax, would it require an acceptance going further and saying that Louisiana could not tax -- (Voice Overlap) --"
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6553.675,6558.434,We -- we say Louisiana have -- does not have the right to levy any tax on this enclave.
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6563.933,6565.769,I'm talking about severance tax and --
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6565.769,6566.761,And that -- that would --
1963.329,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6566.761,6568.202,(Voice Overlap) on fugitive oil.
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6568.202,6575.26,That -- that would apply if the fugitive oil is captured on the air base.
1963.329,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6575.26,6591.232,"As I understood Judge Hutcheson in that Fifth Circuit case, distinguishes severance tax and he said it would -- that tax as a matter of state law or as a matter of fact was not -- was not imposed on the property within the enclave but in any event we don't have that --"
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6591.232,6591.884,We don't have it before us today and --
1963.329,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6591.884,6594.038,-- severance tax here that may or may not be distinguishable.
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6594.038,6594.279,It is --
1963.329,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6594.279,6596.93,This is -- this is clearly a tax on personal property.
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6596.93,6597.057,That's correct.
1963.329,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6597.057,6598.285,Ad valorem tax on personal property --
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6598.285,6598.545,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1963.329,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6598.545,6599.927,"-- within the enclave, is it not?"
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6599.927,6600.553,That is correct.
1963.329,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6600.553,6608.57,"So, whether or not the Fifth Circuit was right in this in describing that other kind of a tax, that question is not before us now."
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6608.57,6608.757,That is correct.
1963.329,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6608.757,6611.146,Isn't that right?
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6611.146,6615.585,Because this -- the property talked about here is definitely located within the confines of the enclave.
1963.329,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6615.585,6617.567,But the tax is directly on that personal property.
1963.329,4,20430,clarence_l_yancey,,6617.567,6619.251,"That is correct, Your Honor."
