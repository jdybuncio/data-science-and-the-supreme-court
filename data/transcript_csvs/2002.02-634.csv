2002.02-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.655,"We'll hear argument now in Number 02-634, the Green Tree Financial Corporation versus Lynn W. Bazzle."
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,9.764,12.736,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,29.027,37.294,"Well, Mr. Phillips, now, the contract presumably can be interpreted in accordance with the law of the State with jurisdiction."
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,37.294,46.77,"Oh, to be sure, Justice O'Connor, but this contract was not interpreted in accordance with the understanding of the parties, with... with respect to the parties."
2002.02-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,53.609,62.414,"Well, there was no express provision in the arbitration agreement saying that you can't have class-wide arbitration."
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,62.414,74.091,"--To be sure, there was no express provision to that effect, but if you look at the South Carolina Supreme Court's decision in this case what it says is, first, the parties were absolutely silent with respect to class arbitration."
2002.02-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,106.492,106.492,"Well, but the--"
2002.02-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,106.492,110.173,"--Well, how does that... how does differ from Volt, Mr. Phillips?"
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,125.233,132.939,"In... the difference between this case and Volt, Mr. Chief Justice, is there the parties agreed that the arbitration itself would be controlled solely by California law."
2002.02-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.588,137.768,"Well, they said the place where the construction was... was taken."
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,137.768,143.044,"Right, and that was understood by this Court, and by the lower courts as a matter of State law, to embrace California law."
2002.02-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.044,146.457,But didn't... didn't the... didn't the agreement here say it would be governed by the law of South Carolina?
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,146.457,154.88,"The... the underlying contract is governed by South Carolina law, but the arbitration provision itself is governed exclusively by the Federal Arbitration Act."
2002.02-634,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,154.88,161.478,"Well, is your... your argument that if the South Carolina court is unreasonable in interpreting State law, then it comes up here?"
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,164.978,166.918,It seems to me there are two ways you can get to this question.
2002.02-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,186.308,188.145,"Why do you... I'm sorry, I thought you were done."
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,188.145,203.048,"--If, in fact, South Carolina had purported... if the South Carolina Supreme Court had purported to try to interpret this agreement as in some sense reflecting a... a consent by the parties to a class-based arbitration it would be a much, much closer case."
2002.02-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,203.048,204.034,"Well, what--"
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,204.034,205.251,That's not the standard that the court applied here.
2002.02-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.251,213.356,--What if the South Carolina court in a somewhat different case had said this arbitration is going to be governed by our State rules of discovery.
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,221.096,223.006,"No, that's not bad at all, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.02-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,256.627,258.743,And who are not... and who are not objecting so far as I know.
2002.02-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,258.743,259.288,Yes.
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,259.288,259.886,--Well--
2002.02-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,259.886,261.598,Green Tree is the one who's objecting.
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,261.598,263.757,"--Well, we don't know whether they objected or not."
2002.02-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,267.892,269.662,Why... please.
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,269.662,283.799,"--If you... if you flip this case around, in this situation, where the... where the unnamed members potentially are going to receive $5,000 to $7,500 of windfall recoveries, my guess is they're not going to object, but what if the case had gone the other way."
2002.02-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,302.305,302.527,Yes.
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,324.269,334.337,"--Can I... can I respond to that, Justice Ginsburg, because you see, it seems to me that that simply reflects the manifest hostility to the arbitration agreement as it's been... as it's been written by the parties here."
2002.02-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,372.514,372.741,--Do you--
2002.02-634,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,372.741,373.219,--That's true.
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,440.197,449.879,"It seems to me that the linchpin theory of the case ought to be the... the point I started with, Justice Breyer, which is, you look to determine whether there is the consent of the parties or whether--"
2002.02-634,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,449.879,453.914,"No, but what we don't know here is whether there is or there isn't."
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,463.438,465.795,"--Well, what South Carolina did--"
2002.02-634,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,465.795,466.185,"--is, they imputed an intent."
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,466.185,466.864,--they imputed an intent.
2002.02-634,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,466.864,497.324,"And they did it by a rule that says that since the other parties in our minds would have jumped for joy, and you, your client would have weeped in dismay, we in that situation interpret the contract against the drafter, which happened to be your client, so they chose the other side and thereby concluded that it was not hostile to arbitration, though it wasn't in the interest of one of the parties."
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,497.324,500.144,"Well, it also doesn't reflect the consent of both of the parties."
2002.02-634,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,500.144,500.454,Well--
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,500.454,502.17,"Both parties have to consent, Justice Breyer."
2002.02-634,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,503.52,503.742,--You... you--
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,503.742,505.439,You simply can't have unilateral consent.
2002.02-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,505.439,528.409,"--The reason, as I understand it... the reason, as I understand it, you say there isn't consent was the reason you gave in your answer to the Chief Justice, that, in fact, they had agreed to be bound by South Carolina law with respect to the interpretation of the contract, but not with respect to the arbitration clause itself, and my question is, how do you draw that line?"
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,536.384,536.863,Well--
2002.02-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,536.863,538.162,So why do you draw--
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,538.162,539.908,--South Carolina Supreme Court drew that line.
2002.02-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,548.398,564.775,"--No, but I mean, you say governed exclusively by the FAA, in the sense that the FAA naturally is going to trump any inconsistency with State law, but here, there isn't a clear inconsistency with State law, and the FAA is always applied with some State law in mind."
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,579.313,580.544,"--Well, there are two ways to get there."
2002.02-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,622.0,630.832,"Mr. Phillips, first, you're not... you're not urging that there's any inherent inconsistency between the arbitration and class action."
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,637.901,648.732,"Yes, although, Justice Ginsburg, there is not a single example that I could identify of any parties ever agreeing to go into a class action through arbitration."
2002.02-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,648.732,650.547,Have there been no class actions in... in arbitration?
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,650.547,651.251,I'm sorry?
2002.02-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,651.251,652.952,Have there been no class actions in--
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,652.952,653.501,Other than this one?
2002.02-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,653.501,654.007,--Yes.
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,654.007,656.683,"There are in California, but that's... that's it."
2002.02-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,664.859,667.524,Does the AAA have no rules about--
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,667.524,668.672,No.
2002.02-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,668.672,669.274,--class actions?
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,669.933,670.188,Not as far as I know.
2002.02-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,689.495,691.022,"--Well, suppose--"
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,691.022,691.826,"--were $36,000."
2002.02-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,691.826,701.093,"--If the parties had chosen, say, a New York forum... I thought an arbitration agreement is supposed to be a forum for action laws."
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,701.093,702.188,"Well, that's part of it."
2002.02-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,702.188,710.336,"If they said nothing about class action and they chose New York as a forum, New York has a class action vehicle."
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,714.864,724.209,"Well, I mean, the difficulty with that is that there's... there's no State law in general... I mean, there are no statutes out there that provide for class actions with respect to arbitrations."
2002.02-634,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,726.581,731.724,"But it... it... then arbitration is something other than a mere choice of forum, because--"
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,731.724,732.401,"--Oh, absolutely."
2002.02-634,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,752.927,754.682,"--Can I... can I interrupt with this question, Mr. Phillips?"
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,773.666,777.255,--I... I think if the parties all agreed to have it resolved by the same arbitrator--
2002.02-634,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,777.255,779.932,"Well, supposing the... supposing Green Tree objects."
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,781.192,781.539,--No.
2002.02-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,787.643,795.702,"Oh, but here... here the South Carolina arbitrator, which you... you certainly consented to his appointment, went ahead and did pretty much this."
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,795.702,796.313,Well--
2002.02-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,796.313,797.975,Not... not as sweeping--
2002.02-634,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,797.975,800.222,"--This in a vengeance, I will say, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.02-634,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1558.03,1563.471,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1613.056,1623.105,"What doctrine of state contract law led you... led to this result, the doctrine of construe the instrument against, contra proferentem against the person who drafted it?"
2002.02-634,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1623.105,1624.359,"That's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1624.359,1626.582,"Now, can... can that produce anything?"
2002.02-634,1,19848,cornelia_t_l_pillard,,1653.061,1653.911,The--
2002.02-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1653.911,1662.262,"And my next question is going to be, what if the other side comes in and says, you ought to pay me $10 million, and the other side says, gee, there's nothing in the contract about that."
2002.02-634,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3389.878,3391.567,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.02-634,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3566.868,3567.749,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
