1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.939,"We'll hear argument now in Number 97-463, Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Division v. United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,11.808,14.274,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.97-463,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,103.983,105.566,May I ask a preliminary question?
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,107.701,113.089,The contract has expired and the parties are in the process of attempting to negotiate a new agreement.
1997.97-463,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,113.089,115.339,And there's been a strike in the interim by the union?
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,115.339,116.207,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1997.97-463,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.207,118.124,Why isn't this whole thing moot?
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,126.229,146.16,"Well, we think that the matter should have been resolved by the board proceedings, but as far as the mootness of the court proceeding is concerned the union still claims damages based on the identical facts that led it to request the declaratory judgment and that issue would be unaffected, in the union's view, by the board's settlement."
1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,146.16,154.999,"Well, didn't the collective bargaining agreement also provide for the payment of survivor's benefits for a certain number of years after the contract expired?"
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,154.999,169.591,"There are a variety of issues which could arise under the collective bargaining agreement because, of course, the effect of that agreement wasn't limited to the 3-year period of the agreement, so for all of these reasons we think there's no real issue of mootness in this case."
1997.97-463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.422,196.909,"But Mr. Dyk, you concede if it came up defensively it would properly be a matter for the court."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,205.015,218.488,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, yes, we do agree that if there had been an alleged violation of the agreement and a declaratory judgment were sought, that there had been no violation, that that would be a matter properly within the district court's jurisdiction."
1997.97-463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,231.38,237.902,But nonetheless there's nothing about the issue that identifies it as an issue only for the board and never for the courts.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,237.902,265.553,"--That's correct, and what this Court has done, as we understand it, it has said that pursuant to the act, that you can have an affirmative suit that's brought in the courts or an unfair labor practice charge before the board that may involve defenses, defenses before the board concerning contracts, defenses in the courts concerning the interpretation of the act, and that has been brought up in cases like Kaiser Steel."
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,294.922,306.463,"But Mr. Dyk, isn't it the whole purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act to enable you to anticipate your defenses instead of having to wait for a lawsuit by the other side?"
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,329.06,342.486,"--Justice Scalia, I think it is not a classic declaratory judgment action in the sense that this Court has held repeatedly in the Franchise Tax Board case, in Skelly Oil and a number of others, that the Declaratory Judgment Act can't expand the jurisdiction of the Federal court."
1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,342.486,345.005,"It isn't a grant of jurisdiction at all, is it?"
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.29,349.073,"Correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,359.581,360.098,Of the contract.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,360.098,361.967,"Yes, a violation of the contract, but that--"
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,361.967,362.95,That's his claim.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,365.002,365.619,--No.
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,365.619,372.906,"The declaration judgment says the other side claims that I am in violation of the contract, and I say I am not."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,372.906,374.275,"No, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,382.278,385.096,There's never a claim that has violated a declaratory judgment.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,396.688,397.49,"--Well, they--"
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.49,398.49,Would that have been okay?
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,398.49,404.794,"--If they said we are about to strike and we'd like a declaration, that would not be this case."
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.631,411.031,Right.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,411.031,411.598,"--Yes, you could."
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.598,411.983,Okay.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,411.983,413.3,But that's not this case.
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.8,414.25,Okay.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,414.25,424.373,"--There has been no violation, no alleged violation, and we suggest that when Congress said suits for violation it was very clear that there had to be a suit over a violation of the contract."
1997.97-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,442.502,453.125,"Can you... can the... suppose the employer says to the union representative, if you go out on strike, I will sue you for breaching this contract."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,465.784,468.236,I think there are certainly some circumstances where--
1997.97-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,468.236,477.592,"Well, let's say the circumstance is a) my basis as union representative is I think you have to have an offer and an acceptance to have a contract and here there was no offer, or there was no acceptance."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,477.592,481.544,"--If the dispute is over a violation of the agreement, yes--"
1997.97-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,481.544,481.894,No.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,502.457,504.992,--I think under some circumstances that could be brought.
1997.97-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,504.992,506.544,What about the circumstances I just mentioned?
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,506.544,513.347,"No, I'm suggesting, under the circumstances you just mentioned, you could imagine, yes, that there would be section 301 jurisdiction."
1997.97-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,513.347,513.681,"Yes, all right."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,521.453,526.489,"Well, it isn't the question of what the basis for the claim is."
1997.97-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,526.489,534.512,"No, the reason that you cannot sue me for a breach of contract is because the contract doesn't exist, and the reason it doesn't exist is because it was obtained by fraud."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,534.512,544.819,"Justice Breyer, I agree that there may be circumstances in which something has gotten to the point where there is a real dispute about whether there would be a violation of the contract which possibly could be brought into Federal court."
1997.97-463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,575.839,581.242,"Well, in Justice Breyer's first hypothetical, could the offer and acceptance dispute have been remitted to the board?"
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,581.242,584.111,The offer and acceptance dispute could have been remitted to the board.
1997.97-463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,584.111,589.015,"Why wouldn't there be concurrent jurisdiction, or conflicting jurisdiction in that case just as well as here?"
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,589.015,593.133,In some circumstances conflicting jurisdiction is tolerated and will exist.
1997.97-463,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,622.069,623.485,"Mr. Dyk, may I just ask this."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,635.21,664.562,"Well, that's correct, Justice Stevens, and I think that's exactly why this matter belongs before the board, because of course the distinction between mandatory and permissive subjects of bargaining under this Court's decision in First National Maintenance is a very difficult line to draw, one that the board has struggled with again and again over the years, and if it's a mandatory subject of bargaining there is the obligation to supply the information to the union, but if it is a permissive subject of bargaining the obligation does not exist to supply the information to the union."
1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,664.562,668.431,"Well, why do we have to decide that it belongs somewhere else?"
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,680.905,684.809,"That's exactly correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and we suggest that--"
1997.97-463,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,684.809,689.944,"Yes, but you have argued that the better forum is the board, and that argument kind of falls apart if the forum isn't there."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,689.944,695.331,"--No, no, but Justice Stevens, it's exactly because of the difficult distinctions between mandatory--"
1997.97-463,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,695.331,695.748,Right.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,695.748,697.783,--and permissive subjects of bargaining that this case belongs before the board.
1997.97-463,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,709.774,718.03,"Are you suggesting that even if it was not a mandatory subject of bargaining, that the company could commit fraud in the negotiation and there would be no remedy for the fraud?"
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,718.03,718.93,"--No, absolutely not."
1997.97-463,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,722.182,722.582,Right.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,722.582,723.767,Which under Truett--
1997.97-463,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,723.767,724.2,Which they alleged.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,724.2,726.552,--That would apply to mandatory and permissive subjects of bargaining.
1997.97-463,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.552,726.969,Right.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,726.969,733.54,"But the main part of the charge here is that there was a request for information, that we didn't supply the information."
1997.97-463,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,733.54,733.823,"Oh, okay."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,733.823,737.242,And that turns on the distinction between mandatory and permissive subjects of bargaining.
1997.97-463,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,737.242,743.228,"But insofar as they're alleg... their claiming there was an active misrepresentation or a fraud, you would agree that could be remedied by the board."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,743.228,743.93,Absolutely.
1997.97-463,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,743.93,744.747,"Oh, okay."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,744.747,749.132,"There's no license to lie, whether it's a mandatory or permissive subject of bargaining."
1997.97-463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,749.132,749.834,Mr. Dyk--
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,753.953,755.419,Yes.
1997.97-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,763.309,765.427,"Mr. Dyk, you may have answered this."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,773.298,789.392,"Well, the line, Justice Souter, that I'm suggesting that you draw is between matters that are asserted as defense, either contract defenses before the board or unfair labor practice defenses in court, as opposed to allowing affirmative jurisdiction."
1997.97-463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,797.565,798.598,But that does--
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,812.825,824.215,"There was, if my recollection is correct, a dispute about a violation in the Mack case, the original... the Third Circuit case that preceded this one and yes, that probably was within... that was probably correctly decided."
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.215,828.934,What about a classic contract dispute as to whether there was a meeting of the minds?
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,836.773,840.309,"Well, there can be an unfair labor practice under those circumstances."
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,848.948,850.867,"Well, there's been no violation so far."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,860.139,868.511,"--There may be, Justice Scalia, some small number of cases in which there is no board remedy available to a party in the union's situation."
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,868.511,870.411,And no Federal court remedy.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,870.411,885.54,"And no Federal court remedy as an anticipatory matter but, of course, when there is a violation that can be asserted as a defense, but we don't think that the existence of that small number of cases should drive the decision here."
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.194,895.746,"Not in the vast majority of anticipatory situations, surely."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,895.746,901.133,I think that in the vast majority of anticipatory situations there is a remedy before the board.
1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,939.675,940.191,Mr.--
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,940.191,941.208,--thereby bypassing the board.
1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,941.208,951.398,"--An aggrieved... either the employer or the union can go into State court, can they not, under the Dowd case?"
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,951.398,951.948,Yes.
1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,951.948,958.636,So it isn't as if they can't get into Federal court under section 301 they have no judicial remedy.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,959.938,974.264,"Well, that's a possibility, Mr. Chief Justice, and the Ninth Circuit has held that if there's no unfair labor practice potential before the board you can go into State court and apply State law."
1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,976.848,979.05,"Well, why is it difficult after the Dowd Box case?"
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,979.05,981.668,--It's not difficult as to whether you could go into State court or not.
1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,985.637,988.405,"Yes, but that's something that isn't involved here, certainly."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,996.225,1008.133,"But our argument, Mr. Chief Justice, would mean that you could not go into State court under section 301 either, because the scope of Federal jurisdiction and the scope of State jurisdiction are the same."
1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1015.638,1017.338,You think that's a result of the Dowd Box case?
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1017.338,1019.424,"--I believe it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1019.424,1030.065,"Which means that you'd have some of the law of labor contacts made by State law rather than by Federal law, which is seemingly what the act envisions, or what we've said the act envisions."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1030.065,1044.123,"Well, our position, Justice Scalia, is that there isn't any room for State law here, that even if you went into State court, that you would have to apply Federal law, but that the State court no more than the Federal court can give declaratory relief under these circumstances."
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1044.123,1048.359,"So that there would be no remedy, to answer the Chief Justice's first question."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1054.597,1060.684,I have conceded that there is some small class of cases in which there would be no anticipatory remedy.
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1060.684,1061.184,Anticipatory.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1061.184,1063.369,But you could always assert it as a defense.
1997.97-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1063.369,1067.905,"And the reason for no anticipatory remedy comes down simply to plain language, I take it."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1087.902,1088.302,Yes.
1997.97-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1092.555,1092.872,But that's all.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1101.494,1103.394,--Our section 301 argument--
1997.97-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1103.394,1103.696,Yes.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1103.696,1104.696,--is based on statutory text--
1997.97-463,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1104.696,1105.062,Yes.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1105.062,1124.525,"--and the legislative history, but we have also argued alternatively that there is Garmon preemption here even if you could somehow shoe this... shoe-horn this in within section 301, that the Evening News exception to Garmon preemption only applies, as this Court said in Lockridge, where the cause of action requires a construction of the collective bargaining agreement."
1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1133.965,1144.154,Are you saying that if the union brought an action simply for a violation of the contract and... that there might be preemption of that sort of a claim?
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1144.154,1160.866,"We're suggesting that if the union brought an action for violation of contract which did not depend in any way on the interpretation of the contract, which is the scope of the Smith v. Evening News exception, there might not be jurisdiction under those circumstances."
1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1160.866,1163.166,"Well, but the statute speaks quite plainly."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1170.554,1177.042,"Well, I think it's not, Mr. Chief Justice, so much a question of ""jurisdiction""."
1997.97-463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1195.754,1197.256,"Well, why wouldn't you make that argument--"
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1213.432,1214.916,"That's correct, and the matter is still pending before the board."
1997.97-463,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1214.916,1219.502,--So why aren't you making any kind of primary jurisdiction argument with respect to that?
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1219.502,1221.121,"Well, I think in essence we are."
1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1246.503,1262.096,"But if you can't have an action for a declaratory judgment, which you certainly are maintaining in light of the statute, and you can't have an action for construction of the contract, what sort of action for violation of contract can you have under section 301?"
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1262.096,1268.352,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we agree that you can have an action to construe the contract for violation of the contract that requires a construction of the contract."
1997.97-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1287.98,1289.016,I understand.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1320.618,1323.736,There's a dispute about a Federal law--
1997.97-463,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1323.736,1324.003,"Oh, an antitrust case."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1324.003,1324.436,--Yes.
1997.97-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1324.436,1331.324,"Some private person says, I'm going to bring an antitrust case against you, and the defendant says, look, I have a piece of paper here."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1349.185,1350.237,I--
1997.97-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1350.237,1351.87,--for the reason that I have this State law defense.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1351.87,1355.355,"--I suppose, Justice Breyer, that such a suit would lie."
1997.97-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1355.355,1355.755,Yes.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1355.755,1361.409,But it depends on the jurisdiction of the Federal courts over the coercive suit that the other party could have brought.
1997.97-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1364.98,1378.205,"He could have brought a suit claiming that the contract was being violated and if you say, well, he wouldn't have, that would seem to be a question of whether the declaratory judgment action is ripe or not."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1378.205,1379.338,Well--
1997.97-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1379.338,1384.774,"That would seem a question of whether... I mean, yes, of course you're right, if there's no threat he can't bring the declaratory judgment action."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1384.774,1390.778,"--Well, I think ripeness and the question of whether there's been a violation or imminently threatened violation are very similar questions, and--"
1997.97-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1390.778,1393.797,"Yes, exactly, so if there's no imminently threatened violation, you can't be ripe."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1395.499,1397.249,--But that's not... that's not the issue here.
1997.97-463,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1397.668,1398.234,That's right.
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1398.234,1399.301,--imminently threatened violation.
1997.97-463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1437.993,1447.349,"Well, suppose the union said, we are in imminent danger of the employer enforcing this contract against us because we're going to take a specific action."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1453.538,1457.74,"Well, under some circumstances probably a declaratory judgment like that could be brought."
1997.97-463,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1465.143,1467.278,"Well, they just want a declaration of contract invalidity."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1475.118,1475.684,"No, Justice Kennedy."
1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1495.729,1496.562,"Very well, Mr. Dyk."
1997.97-463,0,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1496.562,1496.762,Thank you.
1997.97-463,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1496.762,1498.462,"Mr. Yokich, we'll hear from you."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1520.76,1540.222,"Our view of possible mootness is that there is a fair question of mootness in this case because the contract has expired, but that this is a situation that is a labor case, the labor cases tend to resolve themselves quickly and that therefore it's a situation that's capable of repetition, evading review."
1997.97-463,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1542.155,1545.174,"Well, but you wouldn't anticipate fraud in the future."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1549.661,1569.622,"--Well, we hope that Textron would not fool this Local twice, but we do think that, given the fact that we have several thousand collective bargaining agreements and almost a dozen with Textron, that it could come up again, and that this is a case very similar to the Burlington Northern case, where there was a strike that was resolved by an emergency... a presidential emergency board."
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1579.597,1588.703,"I suppose what you say is capable of repetition is a claim that there's been a violation of a contract, whether that qualifies."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1591.405,1594.523,"--But... well, that is true also, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.97-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1616.27,1617.722,"Mr. Yokich, do I have to struggle with that?"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1624.392,1626.494,"Well, I think that's a fair argument and--"
1997.97-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1626.494,1629.88,--I know it's an argument.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1631.898,1632.782,"--Well, I--"
1997.97-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1632.782,1634.015,What's the argument on the other side?
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1634.684,1635.234,--I have--
1997.97-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.234,1637.267,"Somebody ought to give us the argument on the other side, if there is any."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1637.267,1639.636,"--Well, you'll have to find somebody different than me to do it."
1997.97-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.102,1640.754,But you think it's a good argument.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1640.754,1642.087,--I think it's a decent argument.
1997.97-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1642.087,1643.17,Mr. Dyk--
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1646.741,1648.574,Yes.
1997.97-463,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1667.136,1678.176,"Well, Mr. Dyk's point was that you got a damage action going down below anyway, and it's the damage action which would be affected by this and therefore that's why there's no mootness here."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1678.726,1681.142,"Well, that's what we indicate in footnote 4 of our brief and--"
1997.97-463,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1681.142,1681.442,You agree.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1681.442,1683.844,--that is why this case as a whole is not moot.
1997.97-463,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1683.844,1684.128,You agree.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1684.128,1684.444,Yes.
1997.97-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1684.444,1694.152,So why do you bother with the capable of repetition yet evasive of review if you've got a concrete thing like damages that you say survive?
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1694.152,1699.389,I... what I'm... the reason why I bother with it is just that I'm trying to cover all the bases.
1997.97-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1700.655,1703.69,So you wouldn't put that as the number 1 reason that it isn't moot.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1703.69,1704.607,--No.
1997.97-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1711.361,1729.723,"What about something... you said that the determination here will inevitably impact on the bargaining that's currently going on, that you need to know whether the old contract was no good, and you said that will surely affect how it's bargaining now, and I thought, well, how?"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1737.162,1763.146,"Well, that's an argument that I would rank after repetition evading review, and I would just that when you bargain a new contract you typically bargain from the baseline of the old contract, and if there's a provision in that contract that for some reason doesn't apply because of fraud, you can make an argument that you would have less moral ability or more moral ability at the bargaining table to say we don't have to bargain about that, or we should bargain from zero instead of the old language."
1997.97-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1763.146,1773.335,"But here you're saying the whole contract is no good, so I just don't understand how that declaration would affect bargaining of a new contract."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1773.335,1777.204,I think there is a potential impact of that declaration.
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1851.204,1858.208,Are you saying that Lincoln Mills broadened the jurisdictional grant beyond the language that Congress had chosen?
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1858.208,1859.424,I'm not saying--
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1859.424,1860.476,That's what we're talking about here.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1860.476,1866.546,"--Well, I would say that... well, Lincoln Mills' reading of the jurisdictional grant was a fair one based upon that language."
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.546,1878.021,"Well, are you... what... beyond suits for violation of contracts, which is the statutory language, do you think Lincoln Mills said other things are included in that jurisdictional grant, too?"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1879.104,1893.531,"Well, I think Lincoln Mills said that the phrase, for violation of contracts, is a broad enough phrase so that the courts have the responsibility to develop a complete body of law with respect to the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements."
1997.97-463,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1893.531,1898.566,"Well, with respect to the provision of remedies for a violation."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1908.707,1924.3,"Well, I think what Lincoln Mills says is that when we have issues that deal with what the rights and the duties are created by the collective bargaining agreement, that the Federal courts are authorized to adjudicate those rights and duties."
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1934.406,1936.858,"How would you rate that, as a decent argument, or--"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1938.226,1942.595,"--Well, I'd rank it way up there on top."
1997.97-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.595,1943.078,PG?
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,1945.097,1962.425,"And I suppose that the... what it comes down to on our view in terms of looking at the language of the statute that's involved is what you use the... what the word for, the preposition involves."
1997.97-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1979.887,1987.041,"Considering the Court's latitude, suppose you're right that theoretically there is a 301 suit here."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2002.9,2006.352,I think it would be a proper response to some claims.
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2053.685,2055.085,May I just interrupt you with a question there?
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2069.61,2072.48,"It's hard for me to see that, Your Honor."
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2075.781,2082.835,"Let's assume it's permissive, and that there's active fraud in misleading the union and the board would be powerless to remedy that."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2083.954,2086.656,--If it's a permissive subject their duty is to supply information--
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.656,2087.422,I know there's no duty to disclose.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2092.06,2094.126,--I don't know of any board cases that give--
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2094.126,2095.594,He said there were a lot of them.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2096.312,2100.916,"--I don't know of any board cases that give relief in that situation, and--"
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2100.916,2104.951,Are there any board cases saying they have no power to give relief in such situation?
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2104.951,2114.657,"--Well, the closest the board has... the relief that we seek in this case is to be able to declare the entire contract unenforceable."
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2114.657,2115.074,I understand.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2115.074,2123.829,"And I don't know of any board cases that deal with that exact situation, and that say that you can award that kind of relief."
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2123.829,2133.268,"And you think, in representing the union, the board would not have the power to declare a contract void on the theory that the... there was no bargaining in good faith because of fraud such as I've described?"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2133.268,2140.791,"Well, representing the union, the best I could do is predict that that would be a very tough case before the board."
1997.97-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.993,2158.502,"The petitioner's brief makes that statement that the NLRB could, as a remedy for an unfair labor practice, invalidate the contract."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2158.502,2167.958,"Well, the cases the petitioner's brief relies on, first of all they all deal with mandatory subjects where the employer had an obligation to bargain about them."
1997.97-463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2205.333,2212.803,"You read the statute as if it were to say, suits respecting contracts."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2212.803,2222.445,"I... not only do I read the statute that way, but I think that that is the thrust of the board's precedent from Lincoln Mills onwards."
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2222.445,2227.849,What authority does the board have to construe a grant of jurisdiction of the Federal courts?
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2227.849,2228.782,The NLRB?
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2228.782,2229.249,Yes.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2229.249,2233.301,I think it has very little authority to construe the grant of jurisdiction for--
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2233.301,2236.955,"So, then, why is it important that the board may have construed it that way?"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2236.955,2239.221,--If I said that--
1997.97-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.221,2239.755,You misspoke.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2241.823,2243.023,--That's correct.
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2243.606,2246.692,"You mean this Court, when you--"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2246.692,2252.512,I think that the entire thrust of this Court's cases is to give section 301 a broad reading.
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2252.512,2259.202,"--Well, I've just been rereading Textile Workers and I must say I don't agree with your characterization of that."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2271.925,2272.309,Mm-hmm.
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2272.309,2276.061,But I don't see anything expansive in there about the jurisdictional ground.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2276.061,2276.913,Well--
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2276.913,2278.196,Maybe you could refer me to specific language.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2278.196,2288.804,--The... I think that the expansive nature of the jurisdictional grant comes as you develop the other cases that deal with section 301.
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2288.804,2302.861,"That would be strange, really, if you have a limited jurisdictional grant and then construed to authorize development of substantive law in cases within that jurisdictional grant, and then the substantive law doctrines enlarged the jurisdictional grant."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2302.861,2304.98,"I'm not trying to argue that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.97-463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2330.964,2338.904,"Are there cases in the arbitration area where the contract says suits for violation of this agreement shall be arbitrated, and then the question is whether or not the agreement is void?"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2338.904,2348.175,There are arbitration cases where this is put in as a defense to the enforcement of a specific term of the contract.
1997.97-463,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2354.579,2360.983,"Well, my question was whether or not there are cases going to the scope of the arbitrator's authority."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2378.195,2383.348,There are... let me divide that into two parts.
1997.97-463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2427.009,2431.913,What do you say about what I take it is the declaratory judgment theory?
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2454.66,2465.218,"Well, I think that your reaction to Mr. Dyk's argument that this is really a ripeness argument is the correct way to analyze that problem, and I--"
1997.97-463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2465.218,2466.101,"And then he said you'd lose, though, on that."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2466.101,2469.586,"--And I don't think I'd lose on the ripeness point, and that's for two reasons."
1997.97-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2493.802,2495.737,But that's not how it goes with declaratory judgments.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2504.593,2515.65,"I think that that goes to the issue of whether a judgment would fix the legal rights of the parties, and I think that a judgment would fix the legal rights of the parties, because--"
1997.97-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2515.65,2519.769,"But that doesn't sound... I mean, you can think of any kind of contract."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2542.318,2546.187,"--Well, I think that the parties in this case are in an adversary contest."
1997.97-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2589.381,2598.387,"You don't... you're not going so far as to contradict, however, the assertion that you have not threatened to violate the contract?"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2602.756,2605.558,We... I don't think I--
1997.97-463,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2605.558,2607.16,"The alleged contract, I suppose I should say."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2607.16,2607.627,--Right.
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.235,2628.574,I have understood your position to be that you do not need to allege a threatened violation of the contract in order to establish the jurisdiction you seek in this case.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2628.574,2631.157,That is our--
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2631.157,2632.276,I really think that's your position.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2632.276,2633.442,--We don't... I don't think we have to go that far.
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2633.442,2638.263,"In other words, this case doesn't turn on an estimate of probabilities of how much likelihood there was of a strike."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2642.632,2645.167,On an issue of this nature--
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2645.167,2645.467,Yes.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2645.467,2646.452,--where it's solely determined by--
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.452,2647.152,Set aside the entire contract.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2647.152,2647.952,"--historical fact, I would say yes."
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2647.952,2675.019,"Well, what if you have a landlordtenant dispute, and say a Maryland lawyer is renting an apartment from a Virginia lawyer, and they've signed a lease, and right after they sign the lease the Virginia lawyer sues the Maryland lawyer in Federal district court and says, we just want to... I want to know whether this is a binding contract or not, and the Maryland lawyer says, I do, too, and we'll just avoid future disputes."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2676.555,2693.314,"I don't think it's justiciable absent some claim that the contract was not binding and absent all of the facts necessary for a court determination on that claim existing, and so just a naked claim, we want to know whether it's enforceable, is not enough."
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2702.455,2708.859,"Yes, but the distinction here is, I don't think there's any doubt that if the statute clearly covered your case there would be Article III jurisdiction."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2716.513,2732.307,"I think that's right, and that's why I think it's important that when you construe the word for, that you construe it as meaning concerning, and that when you look at what are the issues the Federal courts have looked at with respect to concerning, you see the whole--"
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2732.307,2735.926,It seems to me if you construe the word for as meaning concerning that doesn't get over the principal hurdle as to whether there's a violation.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2735.926,2760.625,"--Well, I... what we're asking for is a declaration that the contract's not enforceable, that if we commit a breach, that it's not a violation, and I would argue to the Court that we've done all we need to do to indicate to the other side that we think that there's a substantial issue that we disagree with them on with respect to whether or not we can violate the contract."
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2760.625,2767.029,"You agree, don't you, Mr. Yokich, that the Declaratory Judgment Act doesn't expand any jurisdiction."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2769.398,2784.423,"That's correct, Your Honor, and it's a procedural device that let's a person who expects that they will be a defendant get into court first to get a declaration so that they don't have to risk the consequences of a breach."
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2807.939,2809.325,Do you think you could have gone into State court?
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2809.325,2811.058,No.
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2811.058,2811.759,Why not?
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2811.759,2818.58,Because our view of section 301 is that it creates a complete jurisprudence of section 301.
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2818.58,2820.263,"Well, what do you do with the Dowd Box case?"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2820.263,2823.198,"Well, I... let me step back for a second."
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2830.638,2832.221,"Well, why would it have been under section 301?"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2832.221,2833.188,--Excuse me?
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2833.188,2839.91,"I say, why would it have been 301> [""] when section 301 is a grant of jurisdiction for Federal courts?"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2839.91,2858.871,"Well, what the Court held in AVCO was that a State court breach of contract claim was something that arose under section 301 and was therefore removable, and as a consequence, if you go into State court on a breach of contract claim it's going to be determined by the same standards that this Court uses under section 301."
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2858.871,2863.073,"Well, but if it isn't covered by section 301, it's not removable, I would suppose."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2863.073,2877.833,"Well, and I think that reading Dowd Box and AVCO together means that if it relates to a collective bargaining agreement, that you use the Federal law under section 301."
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2883.487,2886.206,Even though there's no 301 jurisdiction?
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2886.206,2889.843,"Well, in the case... you see, and I guess that--"
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2889.843,2892.026,That would have to rank as one of--
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2892.026,2892.795,--that goes to the point that they're making in this case.
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2892.795,2895.211,"--One of the less plausible arguments, it seems to me."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2905.353,2933.603,"Well, our position on that is that their analysis of section 301 doesn't really do a very good job of explaining how that would work, and that's because presumably if you went into State court you'd be governed by State rules of procedure, and you could have a State Declaratory Judgment Act that was broader or narrower than the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act in terms of what types of violations you could bring before the court."
1997.97-463,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2972.228,2973.644,"Well, maybe Congress wasn't perfect."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,2984.869,2996.426,"Well, and our position on that is that so long as the court can find section 301 jurisdiction we would continue to live in this world where we have concurrent remedies."
1997.97-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2996.426,3010.603,"So your argument does lead to the end result that there would be many, many more cases of overlap of board jurisdiction and court jurisdiction than has been thought up to now."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,3010.603,3020.625,"I don't think so, Your Honor, and that's because we've had declaratory judgments in the Federal courts in labor cases for over... for almost 40 years now."
1997.97-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3024.994,3026.696,I'm not talking about declaratory judgment cases.
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,3034.017,3036.268,"--To the regional director, yes."
1997.97-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3036.268,3046.609,"One whole year, so couldn't what you have done be replicated by many other unions in this situation, that is, go to the board, they're moving too slowly, come to court?"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,3046.609,3064.404,"Well, if you look at the circuits where the courts have acknowledged that lawsuits like this one can go forward, I don't think you can find any evidence that there are dozens and dozens and dozens of cases where the parties are exercising both--"
1997.97-463,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3064.404,3071.892,"How many cases are there like this one that said the union, on what would be a defense, can come in and get a 301--"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,3071.892,3082.282,"--Well, the Tenth in McNalley, the Ninth in Rozay's and in Wilson, the First has hinted at that in a recent case, but the Seventh would almost certainly say it."
1997.97-463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3103.379,3105.148,"--Why wouldn't the employers do the same, though?"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,3114.503,3115.07,Well--
1997.97-463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3115.07,3120.074,"And they had all these things run right into Federal court, and they're deciding the validity of all the collective bargaining agreements?"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,3120.074,3138.286,"--Well, again, in terms of the affirmative... in terms of employers doing this I think the same analysis applies, because I think we've had concurrent jurisdiction over these types of contract formation issues for many years in many places, and we haven't seen this."
1997.97-463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3139.252,3141.404,"That isn't something that bothers you, or the board--"
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,3141.404,3142.588,"--Well, it doesn't bother me in this case."
1997.97-463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3142.588,3145.773,--No... well... what... as a labor lawyer--
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,3145.773,3146.223,"It might bother me in Mack Trucks, but--"
1997.97-463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3146.223,3158.53,--does it bother you that if you win in this case I guess the employers would have a perfectly valid legal right to challenge whatever collective bargaining agreement they felt was invalid as a matter of contract law?
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,3158.53,3160.863,"--Well, I think that because--"
1997.97-463,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3160.863,3162.132,"Then you go into the court, not the board."
1997.97-463,1,42305,stephen_a_yokich,,3162.132,3163.115,--in most places that's already possible.
1997.97-463,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3199.357,3199.74,"Thank you, Mr. Yokich."
1997.97-463,2,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3203.475,3227.257,"Just briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, if you look at the complaint that was filed in this case, which is pages 16 to 19 of the joint appendix, and particularly to paragraphs 5 through 10, which are the operative paragraphs, you can see quite clearly that the theory of this complaint is a failure to supply information in response to the union's request."
1997.97-463,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3306.674,3309.026,"Can the board award damages, which is one of the things they sought here?"
1997.97-463,2,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3309.026,3309.609,"Oh, yes."
1997.97-463,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3321.784,3322.917,"Thank you, Mr. Dyk."
