1990.89-1905,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.669,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1905, Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Ralph Mortier."
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,43.77,49.905,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,108.072,131.678,"Mr. Dawson, can... just so I understand, there is nothing in the position of the court below that would prevent a State upon the petition of a particular county, for example, from denominating that county as a county in which some special provisions will apply."
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,136.41,137.291,--That's true.
1990.89-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.352,139.061,Okay.
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,139.061,142.483,And the State does not have to respond affirmatively to such--
1990.89-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.483,143.485,"Well, of course."
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,143.485,146.667,--I'd like to briefly review the ordinance.
1990.89-1905,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,219.245,227.959,Does that ordinance regulate the same things that FIFRA does or the State does under its authority?
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,227.959,237.606,"There could be some overlap, but I think the emphasis here is that this ordinance, and ordinances that have been passed like it, deal with things that FIFRA does not do."
1990.89-1905,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,255.439,274.401,"Well, I take it that you wouldn't be satisfied if we held that the only way a locality or a town or a county could act on its own would be if the State permitted it to do so."
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,274.401,279.294,"--That's very problematical, because the State may not permit... I'm sorry... the State may not--"
1990.89-1905,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,279.294,288.871,"Well, it wouldn't be satisfied to condition your right... to condition the town's authority to pass this ordinance on... the State giving it permission to do so."
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,288.871,297.106,"--Well, in this case the State has given the Town of Casey permission to pass general ordinances under the police power to protect the local governments."
1990.89-1905,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,297.106,303.13,"Well, I know in this specific... what if it delegated to the county its power to regulate pesticides?"
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,303.13,308.262,"If it's the kind of power that is the power that their exercising now, fine."
1990.89-1905,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,320.961,322.832,So you would not be satisfied in this?
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,322.832,323.372,I would not.
1990.89-1905,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,323.372,331.948,Didn't one of the Wisconsin State courts suggest that the town's ordinance was preempted or at least unauthorized under State law?
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,331.948,337.792,The Washburn County Circuit Court held that.
1990.89-1905,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,342.674,343.205,They expressed no view?
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,343.205,345.616,--Simply ruled on the Federal question.
1990.89-1905,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,376.598,389.266,"Are all the things that the town did here or proposes to be able to do, things that, if the State itself were to do it, would be authorized under the FIFRA scheme?"
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,389.266,391.376,--If I understand--
1990.89-1905,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,391.376,392.448,Do you understand my question?
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,392.448,393.277,--I'm not positive.
1990.89-1905,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,393.277,408.097,Is everything that the town asserts its ordinance permits things that the FIFRA statute would allow a State to do if the State were doing it at the State level?
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,408.097,411.871,If I understand--
1990.89-1905,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,411.871,412.752,Is that not clear?
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,412.752,415.202,"--If I understand your question, I believe the answer is yes."
1990.89-1905,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,422.627,428.62,"Well, let me put it another way then, because I guess you didn't understand."
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,441.79,442.859,"Yes, that's correct."
1990.89-1905,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,444.532,454.988,And is everything that you argue the town can do here something that the Federal law permits?
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,454.988,455.749,--Yes.
1990.89-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,521.763,535.28,"Well, that depends upon... surely that depends upon whether you think that the statute, absent any references to States or municipalities, would have preempted the States."
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,553.022,553.532,No.
1990.89-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.173,555.092,But that would make a difference.
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,567.361,572.537,--Except that in this case we have 24(b) which is a specific preemption provision.
1990.89-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,575.458,576.437,Yes.
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,577.469,577.959,Yes.
1990.89-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,594.669,603.275,I wish people would use this... what's the section number in title VII?
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,603.275,605.576,It is 136(v).
1990.89-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.576,606.808,136(b).
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,606.808,616.395,Section... I might also point to--
1990.89-1905,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,616.395,619.648,"Mr. Dawson, it's completely irrelevant, but where is Casey, Wisconsin?"
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,619.648,623.858,"--Casey, Wisconsin, is a northwestern Wisconsin town--"
1990.89-1905,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,623.858,624.389,What county?
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,624.389,626.56,"--It's in Washburn County, Wisconsin."
1990.89-1905,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,626.56,629.013,"I thought I knew the county, but I've never heard of Casey."
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,630.332,631.354,It's near Spooner.
1990.89-1905,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,634.927,636.327,30 miles north?
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,636.327,636.878,Yes.
1990.89-1905,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,636.878,638.117,On the road to--
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,638.117,641.82,On the road to Superior.
1990.89-1905,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,641.82,642.431,--Yes.
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,644.262,648.706,There are approximately 400 to 500 citizens that live in the town of Casey.
1990.89-1905,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,648.706,652.128,Large enough to pass the ordinance in question.
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,652.128,656.961,"Large enough to be authorized by the State legislature to pass the ordinance, yes."
1990.89-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.416,699.679,"Mr. Dawson, before you get to that--"
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,699.679,700.628,Yes.
1990.89-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,700.628,705.123,--Did... has the State of Wisconsin taken a position on this matter?
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,711.996,719.0,The State Supreme Court held in a 4-3 decision that the Federal law preempts local governments from regulating pesticides.
1990.89-1905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.0,724.865,"I understand, but the executive of the State has not intervened in this matter or filed anything as an amicus?"
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,724.865,725.576,That's correct.
1990.89-1905,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,754.434,757.445,"This is the House Agriculture Committee you're referring to, Mr. Dawson?"
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,757.445,758.046,"--Yes, it is."
1990.89-1905,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,824.8,849.627,"Are you... before you sit down, would you comment specifically on the excerpt from legislative history that's referred to on page 23 of the opposing counsel's brief where they point out that one Senator inserted in the congressional record a statement prior to the vote that the amendments should be understood as depriving local authorities or political subdivisions of jurisdiction."
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,850.588,856.202,That statement has been given different significance by different courts.
1990.89-1905,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,887.391,891.465,Was there any opposing statement submitted into the record at that point?
1990.89-1905,0,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,891.465,892.234,I'm not aware of any.
1990.89-1905,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,895.145,896.307,"Very well, Mr. Dawson."
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,899.149,924.166,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1905,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1020.748,1035.377,Have we ever said specifically at this Court that the Federal Government can direct a State in allocating its powers to its political subdivisions?
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1059.244,1065.488,"We addressed that briefly in a concluding footnote in our brief, Mr. Justice."
1990.89-1905,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1173.297,1178.47,"Certainly, Congress can give powers to the executive branch and prevent delegation within the executive branch of those powers."
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1188.879,1190.929,"--That is correct, Mr. Justice."
1990.89-1905,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1191.79,1204.95,"Well, Mr. Wallace, I think... could you just briefly say what powers do you think these locals are entitled to exercise, absent any express delegation from the State?"
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1204.95,1213.914,"--Well, the extent of delegation from the State is entirely a matter of State law."
1990.89-1905,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.914,1222.541,"I know, but say there's no delegation from the State at all, and it's the State... the State is just silent, although the State enjoys the powers that FIFRA gives it."
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1227.023,1242.273,FIFRA itself does not impose any limitation as a matter of Federal law on whether the power can be exercised by the State government or its State agency or by a local unit of government exercising home rule.
1990.89-1905,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1242.273,1249.476,I don't suppose... don't you... I don't suppose a local... locality could regulate pesticides in a manner that the State itself could not regulate.
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1249.476,1255.013,"That is correct, and I'm speaking only of regulating the use of pesticides."
1990.89-1905,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1271.493,1282.599,"And within that area of State authority, the locals can do the same thing absent some restriction imposed by the State."
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1282.599,1285.671,That is correct.
1990.89-1905,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.762,1369.827,"But what the other side says, Mr. Wallace, is that you're reading it backwards... that is, is not a preemption provision at all."
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1402.217,1412.524,There's rather little basis in what EPA actually undertakes to do in the communities to support that argument.
1990.89-1905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1524.096,1542.348,"Mr. Wallace, in that connection, if the EPA prescribes a regulation... I mean a labelling deciding... describing how a pesticide can be used safely, is there any violation of Federal law if a person using the pesticide chooses not to follow the instructions?"
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1542.348,1549.094,The... they're authorized for use only in accordance with the label.
1990.89-1905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1549.094,1560.752,"I understand, but my question is whether... if a person goes beyond, uses it in a way which would violate the labelling instructions, is that person who uses the pesticide subject to any penalty under Federal law?"
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1560.752,1565.196,"Well, it would... I don't know what the penalty would be."
1990.89-1905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1571.59,1579.775,"Because it seems to me the local ordinance here is focusing on the user rather than the labeler, whereas the Federal law tends to focus on the contents of the label and descriptions of permitted use."
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1579.775,1580.936,--That is true.
1990.89-1905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1594.094,1594.735,I see.
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1594.735,1602.85,"The label requirements are to define the permissible uses, but the States have carte blanche to restrict uses beyond that."
1990.89-1905,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1637.454,1642.927,Why does this run off problem that you spoke about before... why would that have to be handled at the local level?
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1642.927,1644.768,--It doesn't have to be.
1990.89-1905,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1653.132,1665.571,Don't the FIFRA statutory provisions or regulations prevent the use of certain pesticides where they would be likely to get into streams?
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1665.571,1678.851,"--That is not addressed in the kind of detail that the Safe Drinking Water Act addresses it, which we have cited in our brief."
1990.89-1905,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1739.94,1745.634,You can argue that under the scheme of the statute you really need local regulation.
1990.89-1905,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1749.756,1750.537,--That is correct.
1990.89-1905,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1774.371,1775.263,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,1779.575,1792.244,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1905,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1867.862,1874.277,Are you suggesting by that Mr. Kent that if it were a narrower ordinance it might not be preempted?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,1874.277,1888.745,"I could see that if the ordinance was very narrowly drawn there may be some areas in which it would not run afoul of FIFRA, but that would be very limited circumstances."
1990.89-1905,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1888.745,1894.72,Local governments in your view are left some authority... are granted some authority by FIFRA?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,1894.72,1900.303,As we've set forth in our brief one area would be is if it falls outside of the preempted field.
1990.89-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1910.882,1918.626,FIFRA doesn't occupy the field?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,1922.159,1925.912,"Well, in our view, Your Honor, we would... we believe--"
1990.89-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.912,1931.785,"Well, if it did, why the locals couldn't do anything."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,1931.785,1934.787,--That's true.
1990.89-1905,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.927,1998.248,"Well, what is it in conflict with?"
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,1998.248,2010.176,We believe that the Casey ordinance is in conflict because it stands as an obstacle to accomplishing the purposes and objectives of FIFRA and frustrates the Federal scheme.
1990.89-1905,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2014.499,2021.392,"Well, then would a State law which had exactly the same provisions be subject to the same invalidity in your view?"
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2021.392,2027.276,"I do not... it would not under a field preemption analysis, but possibly--"
1990.89-1905,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2027.276,2029.359,"Well, under this statute and on this case?"
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2029.359,2037.574,"--On... under a conflict analysis, it could pose those types of problems."
1990.89-1905,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2059.888,2072.786,"Well, what if the State of Wisconsin itself adopted the exact same scheme to use Statewide that Casey... the Town of Casey adopted here?"
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2076.92,2079.362,"No, it would not, Your Honor."
1990.89-1905,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2086.344,2090.119,But wouldn't it be just as much of a conflict with the purpose?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2090.119,2095.51,"Not, Your Honor, if it was enacted on a Statewide basis."
1990.89-1905,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2114.274,2121.4,"Well, it boils down then just to your objection that whatever acts are taken are taken at the local level."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2121.4,2125.661,The problem with it being--
1990.89-1905,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2125.661,2126.412,Isn't that right?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2126.412,2127.682,--That's--
1990.89-1905,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2127.682,2129.846,Otherwise you're being very inconsistent.
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2129.846,2140.921,"--Yes, Your Honor, the... we would object to the local regulations for the reason that you do not have the type of coordination that you get on a Statewide level."
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.921,2150.308,I assume you would also say Justice O'Connor's... you responded to Justice O'Connor's question by saying it wouldn't conflict if it were on a Statewide basis.
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2174.014,2181.787,"It would be permitted within the... again, under a field preemption analysis, I do not believe that it would--"
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2181.787,2191.104,"Well, field preemption is trumped by the provision that says a State may regulate the sale or use of any Federal... I mean that trumps any field preemption, doesn't it?"
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2191.104,2200.962,"--No, I believe that looking back, Your Honor, at the way the statute was defined and the legislative history that Congress intended to preempt local regulation of pesticides."
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2200.962,2202.451,This is a local regulation.
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2213.24,2218.713,"Yes, a State may regulate on less than a Statewide basis."
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2218.713,2219.081,Right.
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2219.081,2224.166,I think there comes a point at which there very well could be a conflict.
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2226.017,2234.562,"I don't know why you fight this so hard, because some of us might think it's useful to be able to have different types regulation in various areas of the State."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2234.562,2235.103,--I--
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.103,2239.836,"And if you're telling me that that's impossible, you know, I'm not sure you're helping your case."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2239.836,2242.259,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm not saying it's impossible."
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.02,2275.619,"Well, that's this case."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2281.062,2284.635,"Right, and I believe that that is preempted, Your Honor."
1990.89-1905,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2413.191,2436.304,"Well, counsel, in the absence of any legislative history of the type found here, would you think that a definition of the term FIFRA would normally in another Federal statute preclude the States from allowing their political subdivisions to do the same thing?"
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2436.304,2438.926,Yes.
1990.89-1905,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2455.247,2463.672,"Have any cases of this Court or the courts of appeal in other statutes gone off on that rationale, do you know?"
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2463.672,2475.911,"--Certainly, there are cases which indicate that where Congress intentionally differentiates between terms that that congressional... that that indicates congressional intent to use those terms differently."
1990.89-1905,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2481.805,2492.441,And you don't normally think that State action includes action taken by local political subdivisions that are authorized by States?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2492.441,2494.222,--It might or might not.
1990.89-1905,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2503.878,2515.085,"Well, it's a little hard to find on the face of this statute that the term ""state"" couldn't include authorized action by political subdivisions."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2515.085,2521.961,I think provided that those actions were specifically authorized by the State there would be no problem.
1990.89-1905,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2523.26,2529.695,"Well, but it's not a... trying to tell a State what kind of law it has to pass to authorize action."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2536.57,2550.498,"Yes, but I don't believe that they have really done so here, and again, I think it's not... in this particular context, it's not just the definition of the term FIFRA which draws that differentiation."
1990.89-1905,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2679.582,2681.564,"Mr. Kent, just to make sure I understand it."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2689.459,2692.852,Subsection 136v.
1990.89-1905,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2692.852,2694.485,"v(b), that's right."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2694.485,2696.968,v sub (a)... v sub (a).
1990.89-1905,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2696.968,2697.547,I beg your pardon.
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2698.789,2714.37,"So that at this point, one not only has to disregard the statutory language... the definition, the differentiation, but one also has to disregard the fact that Congress expressly considered this question and rejected petitioners' view point."
1990.89-1905,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2714.37,2720.143,Did the committee report refer to the particular sub... sections and subsections you're talking about?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2720.143,2722.624,"Yes, I believe it did, Your Honor."
1990.89-1905,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2729.129,2734.462,Indicating that it was those particular sections or subsections which did preempt it?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2734.462,2738.276,"Right, that was the Senate Agriculture and Forestry Committee in particular."
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2767.644,2768.633,Excuse me.
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2768.633,2769.134,--Sure.
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2769.134,2798.252,"I suppose that if State throughout this whole things means State or any municipality as well, then a provision like... oh, gad, there's so many different letters here... 136b(f) which says that the administrator shall, under such regulations, authorize any State to issue an experimental use permit for a pesticide."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2805.338,2806.26,If you--
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2806.26,2807.088,"Now, has he done that?"
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2808.03,2810.702,--Has the State authorized it?
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2810.702,2812.214,"--No, has the administrator?"
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2812.214,2813.984,I... not that I know of.
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.984,2818.368,Authorized any municipalities to issue experimental use permits?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2818.368,2819.818,"Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2819.818,2828.924,But he'd be able to do that if State means both the capital state government and the municipalities.
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2828.924,2831.175,I believe that would be the logical conclusion of our argument.
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2831.175,2831.896,"It's scary, isn't it?"
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2831.896,2833.168,"We believe so, Your Honor."
1990.89-1905,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2878.385,2883.929,"Mr. Kent, we deal with any number of preemption cases here, as you know, every year."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2908.897,2919.912,"--If I understand your point, Your Honor, the... your point is that if the States are preempted that the--"
1990.89-1905,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2919.912,2928.618,"No, my point is that you're saying look at what extravagant things might be... happen if the various localities regulate this subject."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2941.228,2942.577,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1990.89-1905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2973.958,2975.809,Why can't the State administrator take care of that problem?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2975.809,2980.982,The State administrator could if it was a problem of significant enough Statewide--
1990.89-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2980.982,2983.954,"Well, you're describing one that's significant to adjoining jurisdiction."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,2990.479,2995.823,--In a... I use that example simply to illustrate the general problem.
1990.89-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3032.397,3032.937,"Yes, but that works both ways."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,3044.835,3049.877,"--Yes, but I think that the... I would agree with that as a general proposition."
1990.89-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3066.838,3067.95,May I ask you this question?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,3082.068,3097.519,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, and for this reason that the statutory scheme and as confirmed by the legislative history here means that it is the State which must be the ultimate regulatory jurisdiction."
1990.89-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3097.519,3101.223,And that regulatory power cannot be subdelegated to lessor units under your view?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,3101.223,3107.877,Local units of government can participate in administering and enforcing a State program.
1990.89-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3109.578,3115.171,"But if the State itself isn't supervising the program, you'd say they could not delegate authority to individual government units."
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,3115.171,3115.622,--That is correct.
1990.89-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3119.545,3125.976,Could I ask you then if... what do you understand of the provision for cooperation where they do specifically refer to local jurisdictions?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,3129.76,3132.792,"I would see that in two respects, Your Honor."
1990.89-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3160.962,3161.46,I see.
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,3161.46,3164.783,I think another way of looking at it would be the California model.
1990.89-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3420.622,3422.381,May I ask one question about this ordinance?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,3422.381,3422.952,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3422.952,3427.525,Is there any other regulation of aerial spraying in Wisconsin other than ordinances of this kind?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,3427.525,3435.56,"There is a regulation under the Wisconsin Administrative Code, Ag 29."
1990.89-1905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3443.105,3445.607,But this is more restrictive than that regulation obviously?
1990.89-1905,2,38047,paul_g_kent,,3445.607,3447.437,"--Right, considerably more restrictive."
1990.89-1905,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3507.697,3510.188,"Thank you, Mr. Kent."
1990.89-1905,3,42626,thomas_j_dawson,,3512.66,3515.952,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1905,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3567.317,3568.265,"Thank you, Mr. Dawson."
