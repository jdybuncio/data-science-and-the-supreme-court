1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,16.338,22.211,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.329,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,384.343,390.929,Would it weaken your argument if one concluded that Congress didn't think about it at all?
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,390.929,393.377,I think that it wouldn't weaken it.
1960.329,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,395.853,395.895,Alright.
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,395.895,399.183,"-- from the tools we have at hand and the statute, I submit, is the best and primary source."
1960.329,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,399.183,401.056,I suggest you must interpret the statute.
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,401.056,402.968,We must interpret the statute.
1960.329,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,625.207,633.242,"So far as the statute goes, your government's right -- is the government right to be complete under the first paragraph (Voice Overlap) --"
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,633.242,643.965,"That -- that's true, but we -- and we are saying that although certain comforting language was put in about contract unless you find the requirement of an actual common law contract."
1960.329,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,643.965,646.76,You mean a sort of a constitutional standby and (Voice Overlap) --
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,646.76,648.151,"Perhaps so, but --"
1960.329,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,648.151,649.161,-- showing up?
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,649.161,656.451,"Showing up, but I -- unless you find actual common law contract, they were intended vesting and that's what they accomplished."
1960.329,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,667.218,683.865,"Mr. Morris, on what legal basis does Congress have power to impose such a presumption?I don't know that they have it, but I just wonder what is the basis."
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,683.865,687.705,"I'm not sure, Your Honor, what the basis for is."
1960.329,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,725.439,725.546,But the --
1960.329,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,725.546,736.896,"The real question is what color is the Congress to say that a veteran being treated to a -- being treated by a Veterans' Hospital, who believes no (Inaudible)"
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,736.896,737.196,Yes.
1960.329,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,737.196,740.791,-- if the property shows advert of United States rather than in the State from which he died.
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,741.916,745.554,"And that is why constitutional discussion, and I -- and I shall go into that as the power --"
1960.329,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,745.554,753.768,"That's the real question because if -- if it hasn't any power to do that by ordinary language, it can't show it self up."
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,753.768,755.241,"That -- that's correct, if it --"
1960.329,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,755.241,757.708,(Voice Overlap) my Brother by saying a conclusive presumption.
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,757.708,758.084,That's right.
1960.329,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,758.403,764.462,Why should there be a conclusive presumption to the veteran who's demanded this -- once instructed to go to United States?
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,764.462,772.409,"If there were no conclusive presumption provision, we'd still have the vesting provision and be faced with the constitutional problem of the power of Congress, and I shall go in to -- and I shall treat that."

1960.329,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,774.855,775.574,"Well, Mr. Morris --"

1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,776.996,780.725,The conclusive presumption provision?
1960.329,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,780.725,805.225,"Mr. Morris, I suppose there's no question about the fact that Congress says power to set up the Veteran's Administration and such these hospitals and to impose conditions one of which would be the one we have here but that get you into the trouble of implying a contract and the need, therefore, for contractual capacity, doesn't it?"
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,805.225,820.475,"No, I think that Congress as -- as a -- under the power to provide hospitalization and other gratuities under the power to maintain an Army and Navy can't put reasonable conditions on these gratuities."
1960.329,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,832.353,834.319,Reasonableness wouldn't save it though.
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,836.891,837.557,That's right.
1960.329,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,973.628,976.646,May I ask you what is the General Post Fund?
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,976.646,993.705,"The General Post Fund is set up under 31 U.S.C. 725s, I believe, and it's a fund created at non-appropriated funds for purposes of providing religious and recreational services for veterans in VA Hospitals and Homes."
1960.329,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1026.233,1028.377,Is it pointed in your brief?
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1028.377,1032.165,"It's referred to in my brief, and it set out in appellee's brief, Your Honor."

1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1046.82,1048.723,He was.
1960.329,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1120.985,1125.845,Did the Committee Report referred to that particular point as Mr. Rankin had said?
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1125.845,1138.592,"The Committee Report did not expressly but it had a paraphrasing of the language used which, in your comparison, you will see the considerable change from the 1910 Act and showed in its paraphrase that each of these provisions was self-executing."
1960.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1299.464,1305.45,"Mr. Morris, as a matter of fact, how much emergency were to Veterans' Hospitals do?"
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1325.519,1326.528,"Well, I think -- I --"
1960.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1326.528,1327.237,-- about that?
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1327.237,1328.886,-- I have no statistical before --
1960.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1328.886,1329.961,"Well, I'm not -- I don't care about statistics."
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1329.961,1330.469,-- from -- from my statement.
1960.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1330.469,1331.031,I just want to --
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1331.031,1332.536,I -- I think that --
1960.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1332.536,1332.585,(Voice Overlap) -- they are.
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1332.585,1345.071,-- the chronic disable more or less goes if he can -- if he had the other eligibility requirements to a domiciliary which is what the 1910 Act covered in old soldier's home chronically disabled.
1960.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1350.402,1354.52,Do they handle any -- anybody unless -- until or unless they know he's a veteran?
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1354.52,1356.845,They'll handle anyone if he -- even if he's not a veteran.
1960.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1376.496,1377.604,"Well, that's what I wondered about."
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1380.474,1382.056,I think -- I -- I believe they do.
1960.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1384.426,1391.992,"Yes, except he had been in other hospitals long enough for -- for everything to be found out about him that was going to be found out."
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1394.661,1396.487,"Well, presumably although the record isn't clear --"
1960.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1396.487,1397.196,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1397.196,1400.147,-- that his eligibility would determine without an application.
1960.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1405.381,1405.981,It's not important.
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1407.997,1408.256,Well --
1960.329,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1408.256,1409.381,-- had impression in other words.
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1409.381,1419.075,"-- even if -- even if it is an overwhelming number, I would say the problems are still there for -- for contract concept or concepts to be applied here."
1960.329,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1456.157,1458.279,May I ask you one other question then?
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1466.079,1470.061,"From January -- from December 31st, I believe, to March 1 when he was in --"
1960.329,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1470.061,1470.31,And he --
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1470.31,1471.279,-- the two state hospitals.

1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1475.727,1479.787,19 days in the Veterans' Hospital before he died.
1960.329,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1479.787,1493.718,Is it your claim or is anything -- any contest here to whether or not this Oregon -- Oregon Hospital should recover anything out of his estate for services it rendered?
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1493.718,1494.788,It did recover.
1960.329,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1494.788,1495.279,It did.
1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1495.279,1495.872,Yes.

1960.329,0,27665,herbert_e_morris,,1831.768,1832.55,Right.

1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2023.363,2028.098,"Mr. Chief Justice, this case fundamentally involves the construction of a statute."
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2314.159,2316.314,May I ask you this.
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2333.375,2335.785,"The bill itself as it was passed, Your -- Your Honor?"
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2335.785,2338.794,Did it pass just as it was at the time Mr. Rankin (Voice Overlap) --
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2338.794,2339.734,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2348.53,2372.52,"I understand that but this -- this statute itself uses the language that including money and chooses an action owned by him at the time of his death and not dispose of otherwise shall immediately vest in and become the property of the United States as trustee for the sole and benefit of the fund, how could he say that consistently with this Section?"
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2372.52,2377.881,"I believe his purpose in saying that is this, that the statute was contractual if the veteran were --"
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2377.881,2384.429,"But this -- this Section, does it say anything about the contract?"

1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2385.274,2394.601,I -- I don't -- I do not see where the Act as it is now rest on the contract than this one looked so over that strange language about presuming the contract exist.
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2394.601,2404.613,"I think you will find in -- in reading the entire statute, Section 17 through 17 (j) that it is couched in languages of the contract."
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2421.183,2433.154,But this language in 17 says it shall vest and then says that these provisions that conditional precedent to the initial offer of the further furnishing of care to a veteran.
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2433.154,2436.816,"Perhaps, this would answer the question."
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2436.816,2442.542,That's why I do not quite understand Congressman Rankin's statement unless the bill was different at that time.
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2442.542,2446.059,The bill went through without any amendment or any opposition.
1960.329,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2518.188,2520.563,That's all in Section 17.

1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2764.512,2769.965,I think that it gets very close to the -- brings us to the Tenth Amendment question.
1960.329,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2801.315,2818.689,"But you would have, I think, you (Inaudible) you would have that statute if it ended with the (Inaudible) paragraph of Section 17."
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2818.689,2822.431,"Yes, I believe that would be escheat statutes in substance."

1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2836.553,2846.211,"I believe the statute, as it reads as a whole, is intended to be read as a whole and it was not intended to have a two-fold operation."
1960.329,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2846.211,2846.363,What happens if --
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2846.363,2847.167,I think --
1960.329,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2847.167,2847.983,I beg your pardon.
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2847.983,2848.309,I'm sorry.
1960.329,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2848.309,2851.164,"I beg your pardon, go on please."
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2851.164,2852.891,I think that it was just about completely --
1960.329,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2852.891,2924.827,"Well, does the practical -- the practical situation created by an intestacy of this sort, is by a failure to devolve the property or to have anybody inheriting it through intestacy is that here is a property left by a veteran who would had been in a Veterans' Hospital and enjoyed the bounty of the Government to that extent, his property and some disposition must be made of it but if the Congress of United States doesn't step in the estate, as the escheat of the State that if nobody else to take it, so the (Inaudible) to which we all belong -- which we all belong, as it was been inherited, but what abstraction, what -- what conflict is there would -- would -- to the reserved power of the States to profit by this escheat when Uncle Sam has no relation to the escheatable property?"
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,2993.057,2993.725,I --
1960.329,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2993.725,3002.311,"Meaning out of a common law contract, Uncle Sam does say by virtue of our samaritanship, we lay claim on this."
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3003.567,3004.495,If -- if the --
1960.329,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3004.495,3006.52,What's the profits about that?
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3006.52,3009.258,If that is a delegated power to --
1960.329,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3009.258,3009.508,"Well, if the --"
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3009.508,3009.934,-- the Federal Government --
1960.329,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3009.934,3032.376,"-- Congress, as constitutional as you say anything about it, but it does say that you may establish Veterans' Hospital, it does say that Uncle Sam has also to -- relationship to the veteran, it does constitutionally authorized Uncle Sam to give his bounty to the veteran and is implied consequent to that it says, ""We go to search some right to regard to it."""
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3032.376,3047.058,"Well, perhaps, this can be said that if the Veterans' laws are extended to that extent, I would assume that there would be the -- the Supremacy Clause would prevail."
1960.329,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3060.153,3060.672,Well --
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3060.672,3063.285,-- it didn't -- reaches the fade out area.
1960.329,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3063.285,3072.414,Of course your position doesn't require to -- a challenge to that constitutional argument.You said the statute as a matter of construction --
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3072.414,3072.858,"That's right, Your Honor."
1960.329,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3072.858,3074.838,-- requires a contract relation.
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3074.838,3075.487,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.329,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3075.487,3084.492,And if you're right about that that even if one could formulate a constitutional doctrine to show the answer that Congress hasn't asserted?
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3084.492,3085.957,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1960.329,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3085.957,3108.873,"But Ms. Zorn, I wonder, looking at the statement of Mr. Rankin, it actually -- what he suggested is if the veteran is competent to dispose of his property whether by will, gift or otherwise, then he may do so."
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3149.699,3165.859,"I think, primarily, the object to this was not to -- the Act itself didn't -- or there was not in contemplation of Congress any source of revenue you might say."
1960.329,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3166.675,3173.038,"What they were talking -- they make it clear what they were talking about, was a -- there was a nuisance to have -- to --"
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3173.038,3173.38,That's right.
1960.329,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3173.38,3190.385,"-- know what to do of the kind of thing that usually the deceased veteran left behind, and namely old suit cases, old trunks and suit cases and things like that, and they didn't want to have to go calling upon the States to help them dispose of old trunks and suit cases."
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3194.215,3195.196,"That's right, Your Honor."
1960.329,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3220.863,3223.742,"And yet, the (Voice Overlap) the Government has suggested."
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3254.552,3275.482,"I -- I don't believe that quite -- perhaps, the intent of the legislate or the Congress here, however, was to base upon contract because they -- going down on the next paragraph here, Mr. Pfeffer asked there might be cases where a veteran is picked up in an incompetent condition, not mentally --"
1960.329,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3275.482,3278.01,"Well, that's the important thing, not mentally but physically."
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3278.01,3278.661,But physically.
1960.329,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3278.661,3283.082,There he'd be competent to agree -- mentally to agree and this agreement would be required.
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3283.082,3288.682,"I think it's -- reading a little further, it says, he was unable to agree to anything when he entered the hospital."
1960.329,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3288.682,3292.191,"Yes, but he's not."
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3292.191,3295.41,"And then Mr. Rankin says, “If he does not agree, then this does not apply."
1960.329,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3295.41,3298.535,Does not apply.
1960.329,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3298.535,3308.259,"Ms. Zorn, you spoke of the paramount interest of the State or the Federal Government in this situation is being determinative."
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3318.968,3321.104,I think the primary thing is the statute here --
1960.329,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3321.104,3321.139,I beg your pardon?
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3321.139,3323.015,-- it operates contractually.
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3350.242,3356.717,I understood you to base the States' (Inaudible) on its power to control the devolution of properties.
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3356.717,3357.887,"Under escheat, yes."
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3357.887,3375.289,"Do you think that the power of the State to govern the property of a veteran, who is supported by the Government, is greater than the power of the State over an alien, that the Government might determine where his property would go?"
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3375.289,3381.179,I don't think it's too much of question of the power as the actual fact of the statute.
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3381.179,3382.15,"Well, I understand that."
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3382.15,3382.219,Yes.
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3382.219,3386.197,I -- I was talking about the constitutional power problem you raised.
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3386.197,3388.582,On the alien question in relation?
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3388.582,3390.779,"Well, undoubtedly true --"
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3390.779,3390.917,Yes.
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3390.917,3398.519,-- that the Government can -- can overwrite the state law with reference to the devolution of property of an alien.
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3398.519,3399.419,Yes.
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3399.739,3407.124,"Why would it have less power with reference to a veteran, a veteran who is under its care?"
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3407.124,3412.595,"Well, perhaps, it is possible under a proper statute that it could overwrite but under this present statute being --"
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3412.595,3412.873,"Yes, I --"
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3412.873,3413.809,"-- contractual, it does not."
1960.329,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3413.809,3421.982,-- I understand that.
1960.329,1,20442,catherine_zorn,,3421.982,3425.921,I don't believe I have very much to add in conclusion of the argument here.
