1974.74-452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.651,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 74-452, Twentieth Century Music Corporation against Aiken."
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,14.651,15.407,Mr. Chief Justice --
1974.74-452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,15.407,16.723,Mr. Rifkind.
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,16.723,19.458,And may it please the Court.
1974.74-452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,295.359,299.859,"There was no possibility of any implied license then, as that was referred to in the Jewell-LaSalle."
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,299.859,302.852,"That is Precisely, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1974.74-452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,322.44,332.787,"Mr. Rifkind, I'm not sure it's terribly important but I could not find in the record the aggregate number of loudspeaker outlets in all of his establishments."
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,332.787,335.884,My understanding of the record is that there were five.
1974.74-452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,335.884,336.486,Just five?
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,336.486,343.941,Some in the public spaces where costumers were entertained and some in the workspaces where the employees were --
1974.74-452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,343.941,345.872,"But that's just in one restaurant, is it not?"
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,345.872,347.739,It's all in one restaurant.
1974.74-452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,347.739,349.341,And he has only one?
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,349.341,360.695,"Oh no, he has other restaurants, but this particular infringement was of course brought as a test situation for the particular two songs that we are talking about."
1974.74-452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,864.868,916.724,"Is not there one difference, Mr. Rifkind, in this sense possibly, to the question, do you think there's a difference since the radio station is selling advertising, presumably, and I would assume that as a matter of economics, the advertising rate is based upon the coverage of the radio station that it differs from the orchestra in the sense that the orchestra has no advertising, and the radio station is getting -- radio station having paid the royalty is getting a larger income because of the standard audience of restaurants, hotels, business establishments, etcetera."
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,916.724,919.896,Let me explain that most explicitly.
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1411.337,1420.421,"Go to a barbershop and the radio is turned on, a three-chair barbershop, does the barber have to --"
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1420.421,1420.869,That's a --
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1420.869,1421.708,Pay ASCAP license?
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1421.708,1422.781,Fair question.
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1430.711,1434.208,Let's say the facts are stipulated that he's doing it for the --
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1434.208,1435.999,And I will only report the practice.
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1435.999,1438.306,Pleasant reaction of his costumers.
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1438.306,1447.29,The practice has been to impose no royalty charge on the one set type of operation.
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1447.29,1448.103,Why not?
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1448.103,1452.175,Because it is impossible to draw the line on a nationwide basis --
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1452.175,1453.446,But you're drawing the line.
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1453.446,1454.467,I beg your pardon?
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1454.467,1455.313,What do you mean impossible?
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1458.199,1464.573,I draw a line between the self-entertainment and the business entertainment.
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1464.573,1466.47,"No, no this is a barbershop --"
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1466.47,1471.465,This is the barbershop and the barber of course can entertain himself as well as his costumers.
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1471.465,1473.422,So the restauranteur in this case?
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1473.422,1477.086,Not when he puts in 5 or 50 or 100 loudspeakers.
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1477.086,1480.377,"Now, this is four or you say five, the record seems to indicate four."
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1484.601,1507.057,"It is to some extent, a practical accommodation to the facts of life that you go in to a small grocer who has a little set on his counter which he amuses himself, papa and mama are running an establishment, we say that's for their personal entertainment and only incidentally if at all for business purposes."
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1517.182,1521.92,"But if this one is a performance, so is the other, is it not?"
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1526.114,1539.929,"Each is a performance, but it is hard to see that you can say with assurance in any particular occasion, Your Honor suggest to me one way stipulated that he's doing it for business purposes."
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1556.555,1558.188,How about a dentist's office?
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1558.188,1561.013,Same thing.
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1567.487,1569.567,"No, no we're not talking about a home, we're talking about public performance."
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1569.567,1581.247,"No, I say if the home type of radio has ever been subjected, the kind of thing that the man would have in his home, and the Congress recognizes the distinction in all of the new bills that have been introduced."
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1581.247,1582.973,"Well, Congress hasn't enacted any?"
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1582.973,1583.741,Not yet.
1974.74-452,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1583.741,1584.767,So it hasn't recognized any of these things?
1974.74-452,0,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,1584.767,1588.051,The House has passed a bill in '67.
1974.74-452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1622.729,1627.003,Very well Mr. Rifkind.
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,1628.599,1633.27,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1974.74-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1779.918,1783.086,"To see, if I understood your illustration, Mr. Cohen."
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,1819.977,1820.264,Yes there is --
1974.74-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1820.264,1822.24,Or a Buck case?
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,1822.24,1824.976,"No, not at the Buck case."
1974.74-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1851.697,1854.4,This would be like copying recordings --
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,1854.4,1855.004,That's right.
1974.74-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1855.004,1856.324,But they have to pay a royalty.
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,1856.324,1862.922,"But in this instance, he has no control over what comes in."
1974.74-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1886.055,1887.36,And they pay for the licenses?
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,1887.36,1890.122,They pay ASCAP for their royalties.
1974.74-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1890.122,1892.705,And they charge their own costumers --
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,1892.705,1893.754,They charge their costumers --
1974.74-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1893.754,1896.099,On the basis of how large listening audience they have?
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,1896.099,1897.061,Exactly.
1974.74-452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1969.822,1976.93,"Well, Mr. Rifkind says they've been doing that for 40 years and they've been doing it on the authority of Jewell-LaSalle."
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,1976.93,1986.871,"It's curious indeed that if for 40 years they have been doing it, they have 5,150 licenses."
1974.74-452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2021.778,2026.138,"Well, does that include Muzak, the 5000 figure?"
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2026.138,2029.85,No the 5000 figure does not include Muzak.
1974.74-452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.489,2068.202,Do you think this case is factually distinguishable from Jewell-LaSalle?
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2068.202,2069.882,It's factually distinguishable --
1974.74-452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.882,2070.223,In any --
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2070.223,2070.687,On two grounds.
1974.74-452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2070.687,2072.018,Rational manner.
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2072.018,2100.035,"Well, certainly the ground that you indicated namely, the license implied in this case -- which may be implied in this case by virtue of the fact that the broadcasting station was authorized in Pittsburgh, whereas the broadcasting station in Kansas City in the Jewell-LaSalle case was not authorized by the copyright owners, is a significant point of distinction."
1974.74-452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.035,2108.102,But I thought the terms of the license of the broadcasting station negated any authority on its part to license anyone else?
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2108.102,2120.274,"We are not saying that there is necessarily a license implied in fact, but there's certainly is a license implied in law."
1974.74-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2335.983,2337.162,Mr. Cohen?
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2337.162,2337.629,Yup?
1974.74-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2337.629,2343.192,"If you know, what about a record player that's hooked up through an amplifying system."
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2343.192,2345.474,"Well, the record player I would say --"
1974.74-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2345.474,2347.902,Or tape player.
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2347.902,2361.818,"I would be inclined to say that that would be a performance because of the special provision on the statute, but if he has a record player or tape machine, he goes out and buys the tapes or rents the tapes."
1974.74-452,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2361.818,2362.723,"And selects them, selects what he wants."
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2362.723,2368.07,"Selects what he wants, has control over what is being sent out."
1974.74-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2380.962,2383.167,"But even if he doesn't, that's a performance, isn't it?"
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2384.795,2385.049,Yes.
1974.74-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2385.049,2386.944,"A jukebox, so called."
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2386.944,2401.343,"Well, the jukebox there's a special exemption for jukebox in the law which Congress is trying to modify to have an $8.00 jukebox charge imposed."
1974.74-452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2426.662,2442.64,"Would you think this Court in Jewell, in Teleprompter rather, intended to overrule Jewell-LaSalle which was a unanimous statutory decision on which presumably property rights have been established?"
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2442.64,2462.695,"Well, obviously this Court did not use the word overrule and I think the Supreme Court generally is reluctant to state explicitly that a former decision of the Court is overruled."
1974.74-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2511.178,2519.263,Well Mr. Cohen it's -- I think the phrase was its limited -- must be limited to its own facts.
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2519.263,2520.572,Right.
1974.74-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2520.572,2526.003,And one of the facts on Jewell-LaSalle was that the broadcasting station was unlicensed to sell.
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2526.003,2528.794,That was an important fact as I pointed out previously.
1974.74-452,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2528.794,2530.273,That's one of its own facts.
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2530.273,2534.287,That is right.
1974.74-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2538.052,2540.154,From what you said Mr. Cohen --
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2540.154,2540.719,Yes sir.
1974.74-452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2540.719,2564.374,"I take it that all of your arguments would apply equally to the factual situation we have here, and a hypothetical restaurant let us say sits a thousand people as there are such with 20 different rooms, and in each room there was one outlet."
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2564.374,2567.186,Yes.
1974.74-452,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2803.538,2809.975,"Well, what's the situation of the Aikens if the new proposed new statute comes along?"
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2809.975,2815.384,"Well, the proposed new statute is rather complicated."
1974.74-452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2818.464,2822.629,Do you mean you're ought to be here even under the new statute making the same argument?
1974.74-452,1,26791,harold_david_cohen,,2822.629,2837.7,"I think the new statute attempts and the legislative history indicates that establishments such as Aiken's, small establishment or barbershops or so forth, would not be subject to liability."
1974.74-452,2,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,3019.382,3021.223,May I take advantage of the few minutes that I have.
1974.74-452,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3021.223,3025.24,"for rebuttal, Mr. Rifkind."
1974.74-452,2,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,3025.24,3044.755,"I gathered as I listened to my learned friend that there might be a distinction drawn between Jewell-LaSalle in this case and that the station in Jewell-LaSalle, the broadcast station was unlicensed and here it is licensed."
1974.74-452,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3052.717,3053.735,"The only dissenting justice, is it not?"
1974.74-452,2,41943,simion_h_rifkind,,3053.735,3058.431,"The only, excuse me, of course you are right."
1974.74-452,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3300.76,3301.569,Thank you gentlemen.
