1962.81,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,34.749,"Number 81, United States, Appellant, versus Georgia Public Service Commission."
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,36.087,46.652,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1962.81,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,546.979,550.498,Meaning that this is (Inaudible) case?
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,550.498,550.619,No.
1962.81,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,550.619,552.103,Or an immunity.
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,552.103,580.129,"Meaning, by that, so far as it's an immunity -- implied immunity case, there is a direct constitutional issue and that, whether the Supremacy Clause case would give -- would require a three-judge court or not, needn't be considered because if there's -- a three-judge court is required as it is on the implied immunity ground, then it hears and disposes of all the issues and the direct appeal is proper."
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,619.433,646.856,(Inaudible)
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,646.856,648.5,Yes.
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,668.647,669.467,(Inaudible)
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,669.467,671.581,So far as the employee cost at which --
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,671.581,673.005,(Inaudible)
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,673.005,678.525,The practical -- there are further practical consequences which I would like to explain.
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,686.252,689.417,(Inaudible)
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,689.417,690.699,Yes.
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,720.736,728.901,(Inaudible) isn't that correct?
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,728.901,733.697,"Well, the Public Utilities Commission of California, yes."
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,782.002,804.285,(Inaudible)
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,804.285,813.937,"It's related to cost, personnel, time which could probably be offset by more personnel, trouble, inconvenience and that kind."
1962.81,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,815.103,828.29,"Am I right of my recollection, Mr. Solicitor General, that by statute the government does assume itself the obligation of transporting the personal effects of --"
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,828.29,829.531,Yes.
1962.81,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,829.531,832.447,-- of officers from one place to another when they're transferring?
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,832.447,839.916,"This is the government's responsibility, both in the case of officers and civilian personnel transferred to the convenience of the government."
1962.81,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,839.916,843.026,Then whatever they pay would be -- would affect the government --
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,843.026,843.66,Oh yes.
1962.81,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,843.66,844.394,Wouldn't it?
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,844.394,845.024,Immediately.
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1050.621,1069.911,(Inaudible)
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1069.911,1081.755,"Well, if I understand Your Honor's question, you are now looking forward to the part of the case where we rely on the implied constitutional immunity."
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1083.807,1086.234,(Inaudible)
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1086.234,1097.793,"I was just about to devote the rest of my argument to that very important point and with Your Honor's permission, I would like to fit it in rather than take it up separately."
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1097.793,1098.915,(Inaudible)
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1098.915,1119.389,"Because we do, in this case as in the California Dairy case, argue that the statute here, the Georgia statute, is unconstitutional because it attempts directly to regulate the terms upon which the United States may contract for the transportation of goods."
1962.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1390.56,1400.366,"May I ask you, Mr. Cox, are you directing this argument to the position that the Interstate Commerce Clause would be violated these things?"
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1400.366,1406.036,"No, that the implied sovereign -- no, that the implied sovereign immunity would be violated."
1962.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1433.557,1436.912,The government's power provides the goods on its own terms?
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1436.912,1439.302,Yes.
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1475.635,1497.571,"Mr. Solicitor General, do I understand you correctly that the (Inaudible) for the state and on the state itself had a minimum wage provided for the workers on the contract that are not -- the contract that is now being served to the United States?"
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1497.571,1505.909,I would think that was covered by Stewart & Company against Sadrakula and that it was not a violation of the implied immunity.
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1547.966,1573.039,"Now, does the state regards to this rules on public property (Inaudible) to provide minimum wage to personnel and the carriers as a (Inaudible) property of the state to find a third or to find a form of public service (Inaudible) in order to provide them public service."
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1573.039,1576.682,That's the second -- that comes directly to the United States.
1962.81,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1873.308,1900.337,What if the state had a regulation that every contract -- every building contract for construction of buildings must include the provision signed by the -- by the builder and by the contractor that the contractor pay a minimum wage?
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1900.337,1912.211,"I suppose that, in that case, the substance of the contract might control over the form."
1962.81,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2023.03,2029.918,"My case, my hypothetical case would have a direct impact upon the contract which the government would have to sign."
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2029.918,2030.094,"Yes, it --"
1962.81,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2030.094,2034.194,It would increase the cost to the government over what it might otherwise have to pay.
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2034.194,2044.445,"The mere increase in cost is, if the impact is indirect, is not alone enough."
1962.81,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2046.97,2047.328,"And, there --"
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2047.328,2049.873,In the minimum wage case that I gave Justice Goldberg.
1962.81,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2049.873,2052.081,"And Penn Dairies itself, isn't it?"
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2052.081,2052.511,What?
1962.81,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.511,2054.021,Penn Dairies involved increased cost.
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2054.021,2058.437,"Yes, but I think it involves something more than increased cost."
1962.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2164.69,2173.243,"I think that the government protects itself against such a situation as that, by doing its own work, paying the wages it saw fit."
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2176.905,2183.121,It will be perfectly clear that the government was not subject if it does the work itself.
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2532.064,2539.814,"Well then again, Mr. Solicitor General, will there be variations that are principally illegal or discriminatory?"
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2539.814,2542.477,"They're -- none of them -- none of them discriminatory, no."
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2542.477,2545.085,What about unreasonable?
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2545.085,2551.818,"Well, it -- no, I don't think that -- well, I don't really -- I can't -- I don't argue that they are unreasonable."
1962.81,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2752.112,2758.243,"Mr. Solicitor General, Congress may waive this sovereign immunity by sovereign immunity clause."
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2758.243,2759.843,Yes.
1962.81,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2761.226,2761.784,Yes.
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2761.784,2762.776,Yes.
1962.81,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.776,2775.524,"And, would you say that in effect, in the Penn Dairies case, the Court shall put Congress who waived it in the form of a regulation and statutes for procurement?"
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2775.524,2781.512,"Well, I haven't thought of that argument, but I'd be glad to embrace it."
1962.81,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2782.672,2784.326,"Yes, Penn Dairies is a little --"
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2784.326,2786.636,"I think it's a distinction, but I really think with thrust of Penn Dairies."
1962.81,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2786.636,2788.881,Penn Dairies is a little troublesome for your --
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2788.881,2789.768,It's against them.
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3197.906,3250.6,"Solicitor General, (Inaudible) when a carrier who charged your rate would be that and the wages that he pay the workers who (Inaudible) would that be a burden on the United States?"
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,3250.6,3257.892,I would think that that would be an attempt to regulate the contract of the United States.
1962.81,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3275.6,3278.416,(Inaudible)
1962.81,0,15704,archibald_cox,,3278.416,3281.092,"Well, you might have either kind of law."
1962.81,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3407.55,3409.111,Mr. Rodgers.
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,3409.111,3412.38,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1962.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3906.023,3909.668,How do you distinguish it then on that case?
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,3909.668,3910.663,You mean between --
1962.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3910.663,3917.621,"You say that there, there was actual frustration for the federal policy, do you not?"
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,3918.243,3918.529,"Yes, sir."
1962.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3924.227,3925.484,You could wait if you would.
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,3927.094,3932.22,"Well, to put it in a nutshell, in Public Utilities, there were involved military movement."
1962.81,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3975.021,3980.887,Would the character of the employment involved here make any difference to you?
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,3980.887,3981.324,"Yes, sir."
1962.81,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3981.441,3993.742,"Do you think it was Armed -- Armed Services, family of Armed Services, would that, in your opinion, be different from this which was a housing project?"
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,3993.742,3996.166,You mean on -- in the case of household goods --
1962.81,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3996.166,3996.26,Yes.
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,3996.26,3998.461,-- in distinguishing the movement of military material?
1962.81,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3998.461,3998.546,Yes.
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,3998.546,3998.794,Yes.
1962.81,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4316.787,4338.495,"Mr. Rodgers, (Inaudible)"
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,4338.495,4345.2,"Off hand, I do not recall any that's directed to material, Your Honor."
1962.81,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4345.2,4347.548,No service?
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,4347.548,4359.962,"No charged services, except of course, at the effect that I think that Penn Dairies plays in construing current federal procurement statutes."
1962.81,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5238.74,5250.97,(Inaudible)
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,5250.97,5254.274,"No, sir, not to military supplies."
1962.81,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,5283.727,5286.874,A household effect (Inaudible)
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,5286.874,5302.055,"Well, of course that's not involved here but I would think that would be on the same -- that would fall in the same classification of household goods to these employees because, of course, our military defense is not intended upon the rapid movement of the household goods."
1962.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5348.648,5354.62,Are you basing a constitutional distinction on that?
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,5354.62,5363.666,"Well, I think, on the constitutional as to the implied immunity, it turns upon the degree of interference."
1962.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5388.86,5401.989,"So that in one case, by a household good be shipped by the government, the Constitution would not give them immunity, but if military goods were shipped, it would."
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,5401.989,5406.911,"Because of the degree of interference, yes.That's correct and that is as to the implied immunity."
1962.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5423.139,5429.852,"If one should not agree with you on that distinction, what would you then say about the California case?"
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,5429.852,5430.651,"Well, if there is no --"
1962.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5430.651,5431.961,How would you distinguish it?
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,5431.961,5470.268,"Well, then I would try -- I would then say, well -- you mean a -- I would say then that you thought that violated the implied immunity of the United States, I would say then that this movement here is on the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act which would cause these related provisions, required on this context, a different result as to household goods and the movement of military supplies under the Armed Services Procurement Act, and that it was the intention of Congress, as reflected by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act to waive any immunity that the United States might have."
1962.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5472.818,5480.849,"That you do not reach a constitutional point there, that you depend on the interpretation of the congressional enactment, is that right?"
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,5480.849,5492.717,"Well, that's -- what we say -- we say, first, that state regulation does not conflict with congressional policy."
1962.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5504.718,5511.346,Do you rely on any congressional enactment since the California case was decided?
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,5511.346,5515.924,"Well now, the California case only involved the Armed Services Procurement Act."
1962.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5520.397,5528.205,Can you draw the distinction and the attitude of Congress in connection -- as shown by those two Acts?
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,5528.205,5545.423,"Well I think of course, the procurement provisions are substantially the same, however, I think there are other provisions in the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, which indicate much more clearly than the Armed Services Procurement Act, that Congress intended that procurement of this nature be regulated by state regulation."
1962.81,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5597.205,5601.092,"We'll recess now, Mr. Rodgers."
1962.81,1,38270,paul_rodgers,,5601.092,5601.681,"Thank you, sir."
