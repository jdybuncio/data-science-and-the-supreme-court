2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.282,We'll hear argument first this morning in Samson versus California.
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,6.309,10.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-9728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,68.452,68.912,Mr. Long--
2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,68.912,69.479,Mr. Long--
2005.04-9728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,69.479,85.675,"--with respect to liberty, as it... it's not disputed, is it, that your client could have had his parole revoked even though the search was suspicionless?"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,94.249,98.115,"Well, a parolee has conditional liberty."
2005.04-9728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,106.001,115.588,"But I thought that evidence seized could be introduced, could be a basis to revoke parole."
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,115.588,124.235,"--Oh, well, the Court held, in the Scott case, that the exclusionary rule does not apply at parole revocation hearings."
2005.04-9728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,135.237,138.686,"So, the... what the... the consequence here is whether--"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,138.686,138.886,--I--
2005.04-9728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,138.886,141.124,--he will have his parole revoked--
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,141.124,141.374,--I--
2005.04-9728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,141.374,145.906,--or he will have a separate criminal offense.
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,145.906,147.251,--I understand your question.
2005.04-9728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,167.067,175.714,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I suppose, can pursue her own line of questioning, but let me ask you this, because I... her question suggests this, to me at least."
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,184.873,190.166,"Well, this, of course, was a police officer, not a parole officer."
2005.04-9728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,190.166,190.449,I--
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,190.449,190.76,But if--
2005.04-9728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,190.76,194.381,"--Well, I... my question was a parole officer, and I'll get to police officer next."
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,194.381,194.714,--All right.
2005.04-9728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,201.601,202.034,When you see the--
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,202.034,202.778,"--""# this particular search""--"
2005.04-9728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,202.778,203.789,"--person on the street, et cetera, et cetera."
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,203.789,205.466,"""And, if you don't, I'll revoke your. """
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,240.829,241.923,Why are they dire?
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,254.019,254.385,Well--
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,254.385,264.772,"--and suffer the reduction of privacy there, which is much, much greater than being subjected to... I mean, he... he cannot even go to the toilet in privacy."
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,268.31,268.476,--Well--
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,268.476,269.492,--that he--
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,269.492,269.642,--I mean--
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,269.642,270.57,--he can--
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,270.57,270.686,--I--
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,270.686,271.414,--be searched.
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,271.414,274.268,"--I have two answers to that, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.459,288.803,"No, but it's--"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,288.803,288.869,--in California.
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.869,303.587,"--but it's also clear from the California statute that it is not a right, that it's a privilege, that you get the privilege of parole in exchange... in exchange for agreeing to the conditions, one of which is that you can be searched."
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,303.587,307.525,"Well, it's... in California, every inmate gets parole."
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.516,318.537,"California statute says it's a privilege, doesn't it?"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,318.537,322.987,"Yes, in Section 3067."
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.987,323.454,It does.
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,323.454,330.884,But it is... it is also a... Section 3000 of the California penal code says every prisoner gets parole.
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.406,333.489,Even if the--
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,333.489,333.622,--a matter of law.
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.622,339.331,"--prisoner... oh, I thought that he can turn it down, and that some prisoners do, if--"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,339.331,339.448,Well--
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.448,344.707,--if they decide that they don't want to be subjected to searches.
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,344.707,356.721,"--The California Supreme Court has held, in People v. Reyes, and in other cases cited in our brief, that, in California, parole is not a matter of choice, it is imposed as a matter of law."
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,356.721,360.669,"Is... and you mean people are put out on the street when... kicking and screaming when they say,"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,364.023,364.173,"Well, it's--"

2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,366.428,366.895,--Well--
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.895,368.078,--they are dragged out--
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,368.078,368.239,--That--
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.239,368.822,--into the street.
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,369.472,371.899,--That is what the California Supreme Court has said.
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.899,372.049,"Oh, I--"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,372.049,372.565,And what the statutes say is--
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.565,373.809,--I don't think so.
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,373.809,382.884,"--That... the statutes say that parole is a... is a transitional period, and that every inmate should undergo a period of parole."
2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,408.954,409.765,"--Well, but--"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,409.765,410.415,"--the permissible limits, it's a violation."
2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,410.415,413.62,"--their condition is very different, in a broad range of areas."
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,440.761,442.855,"Well, there are many rights that are sacrificed."
2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,452.941,460.245,"What about a drug... what if you're convicted of a drug offense, you're on parole, and one of the conditions is, every week you have to go in for a drug test?"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,460.245,462.089,"--Well, that--"
2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,462.089,462.172,Do you--
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,462.172,462.933,--that would be--
2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,462.933,463.749,--do you... is that acceptable?
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,463.749,466.287,"--That would be different in several respects, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,469.986,472.924,But it would be a fourth amendment right that you would be giving up--
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,472.924,473.041,--Yes.
2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,473.041,475.301,--that you would otherwise have if you weren't on parole.
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,475.301,488.341,"--And I want to be clear, we are not... we're arguing there is a broad spectrum of searches that States can undertake of parolees, and I'm, by no means, arguing today that all of them, or even most of them, are unconstitutional."
2005.04-9728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,488.541,498.067,What would you say about a condition that you must... not a regular drug test... you just have to submit yourself to a drug test whenever a police officer asks you to?
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,498.067,504.037,"--Well, you know, that would be much narrower, because it would simply be a drug test."
2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,508.486,510.413,"Well, but it's... I mean, the point--"
2005.04-9728,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,510.413,512.351,Do you think it would valid?
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,513.445,524.28,"--I think, because that's a much narrower test, that that could pass muster if... but I would think there really ought to be some guidance to the officer."
2005.04-9728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,527.053,527.653,"Well, so that a--"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,527.653,527.886,--this is so--
2005.04-9728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,527.886,531.407,--so that a burglar could be searched for burglar tools--
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,531.407,532.751,--Well--
2005.04-9728,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,532.751,534.095,--but not for drugs?
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,536.533,543.503,"--If it were... if it were tied to the crime that the parolee has committed, you know, that would give it some limitation."
2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,547.203,554.339,"--But Justice Stevens's question highlights the point that you criticize about, the randomness of it is often a critical element."
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,567.713,569.307,"Well, in all--"
2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,569.307,573.089,The search is only going to be effective if it's not announced or--

2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,573.155,573.455,--scheduled.
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,573.455,579.131,"--and in this Court's suspicionless search cases, you can have a random test where you draw names at random."
2005.04-9728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,604.202,604.868,Are you relying--
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,604.868,605.018,"--""# I search for""?"
2005.04-9728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,605.018,608.056,"--on the difference between... you said ""officer in the field""."
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,612.005,612.932,"Well, I think--"
2005.04-9728,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,612.932,617.214,"The parole officer was walking along the street, saw this guy, and said, ""I'm going to search you""."
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,617.214,622.858,--I think it's a very different set of circumstances if we have a parole officer.
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,660.13,670.965,"When he's in prison, is there any problem about the prison guards intruding upon his privacy, willy nilly, whenever they choose?"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,670.965,671.715,The... as I understand the Court's--
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.715,672.892,"I mean, walking--"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,672.892,673.042,--holding--
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,673.042,676.98,"--by his cell, which is always opened, and checking in on him to see what's... what he's doing."
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,676.98,684.294,"--As I understand the Court's holding in Hudson against Palmer, the fourth amendment does not apply in a prison cell."
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.527,693.453,"So, he's better off on parole than... well, at least no worse off on parole than he would be when he was in prison."
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,693.453,699.745,"--But, Your Honor, that's not the way this Court has analyzed the fourth amendment issues."

2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,713.651,713.851,--Not--
2005.04-9728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,713.851,714.534,--what do you make of--
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.534,714.995,--by me.
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,715.928,717.438,It's--
2005.04-9728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,717.438,723.147,"--I was going to say, What do you make of the pragmatic argument that seems to cut all of your objections?"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,742.481,742.714,--Well--
2005.04-9728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,742.714,743.564,What's your response to that?
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,743.564,748.09,"--I have a pragmatic argument, and then I have an argument just based on the fourth amendment."

2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,764.973,765.173,--Well--
2005.04-9728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,765.173,770.766,--do we have... do we have any empirical evidence that bears on the in terrorem argument?
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,770.766,775.475,"--The... well, the empirical evidence is that all the other States don't seem to be having a harder time--"
2005.04-9728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,775.475,775.675,"No, I--"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,775.675,776.502,--with recidivism.
2005.04-9728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,776.502,776.986,--I realize that.
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,780.685,792.615,"Well, the California... I think that's a pretty powerful demonstration, but we do have, beyond that, empirically, California was with all the other States until the People against Reyes decision."
2005.04-9728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,797.063,797.297,I take it--
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,797.297,797.58,--as they--

2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,797.907,798.124,--did before.
2005.04-9728,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,798.124,804.5,"--we don't have any empirical evidence, one way or the other, apart from the fact that California stands out in its system."

2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,880.815,881.031,--Well--
2005.04-9728,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,881.031,883.836,"--State decides that, what's unreasonable about it?"
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,884.236,884.419,--Well--

2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,886.191,886.274,--Because--
2005.04-9728,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,886.274,887.868,--says the Legislature.

2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,899.797,914.337,"--Well, I mean, the other side is a search condition that says you have... you could be searched at any time, any place, by any police officer for evidence of any crime, is a breathtakingly broad invasion of privacy."
2005.04-9728,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,914.337,916.425,"But, of course, that's how it happens when he's in prison."
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,916.425,919.958,"Well, but he has come out of prison."
2005.04-9728,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.834,931.876,But there is a breathtakingly high probability that he is committing a crime.

2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1089.407,1089.607,--fine.
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1097.421,1097.571,Well--

2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1104.307,1108.174,--And I take it the fourth amendment itself would prohibit that sort of thing.
2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1127.328,1135.659,"No, but your point was that this is the core of the fourth amendment, and they're taking away all of the protection and leaving it to the unbridled discretion."
2005.04-9728,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1147.227,1147.294,Well--

2005.04-9728,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1174.524,1176.218,Then which way do you think that cuts?
