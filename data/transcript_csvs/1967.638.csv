1967.638,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,15.024,"Number 638, Cheng Fan Kwok, Petitioner, versus Immigration and Naturalization Service."
1967.638,0,31969,john_s_martin_jr,,42.78,44.064,Thank you.
1967.638,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,46.164,75.063,"Thank you, gentlemen."
1967.638,1,29800,jules_e_coven,,83.443,89.158,"May it please -- Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.638,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,706.554,718.786,"What if he had filed a motion or petition, whatever you do, under Section 203 (a) (7) to be determined to be a refugee?"
1967.638,1,29800,jules_e_coven,,718.786,724.368,This application pursuant to the regulations would be submitted to a district director or immigration officer.
1967.638,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,724.368,726.556,What if that were denied?
1967.638,1,29800,jules_e_coven,,726.556,732.467,"If that was denied, it becomes a question as to whether or not it was submitted prior to the deportation proceeding."
1967.638,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,740.374,745.059,"Well, did you have an appeal to the Court of Appeals?"
1967.638,1,29800,jules_e_coven,,745.059,768.779,"I would say that since if the 203 (a) (7) application were denied and you then went before a special inquiry officer who cannot rule on a 203 (a) (7) application, that case would then -- you could I assume and raise it as a question as to why he should not be deported and then after the final order of deportation was entered and then I would say go to the Court of Appeals."
1967.638,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1065.536,1071.663,Mr. Gordon.
1967.638,2,19054,charles_gordon,,1071.663,1075.835,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.638,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.887,1724.051,"Well, would you suppose that if this alien had applied for reclassification as a refugee to the district director and the district director had determined that he was not so classifiable, that that would be reviewable to Court of Appeals."
1967.638,2,19054,charles_gordon,,1724.051,1726.032,This is part of our submission.
1967.638,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.854,1738.586,"You think that if he applied to the district director and he also said, now you suspend the order of deportation."
1967.638,2,19054,charles_gordon,,1738.586,1754.083,"I think that's clearly within the statute but I think that if he applies to the district director for an order which will make him unlawful resident of United States, that in itself will initiate the deportation order and itself applies to the deportation order and should be reviewable to the Court of Appeals."
1967.638,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.083,1775.85,"And but if he -- and a fortiori then if the district director refuses in order to -- a petition to delay the order of deportation pending his determination of reclassification, that affects the -- directly the deportation order."
1967.638,2,19054,charles_gordon,,1775.85,1776.913,Exactly sir.
1967.638,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.628,1779.693,"Well, it doesn't affect it but it might."
1967.638,2,19054,charles_gordon,,1779.693,1781.695,It operates directly on that order.
1967.638,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1789.344,1802.799,"Well, it really is in the -- you really have to argue the 203 (a) (7) determinations would be reviewable because if he refuses to suspend the order of deportation, he hasn't affected it at all."
1967.638,2,19054,charles_gordon,,1802.799,1805.093,In connection with the 203 (a) (7) you're talking about.
1967.638,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.093,1807.229,"So, it really hinges on 203 (a) (7)."
1967.638,2,19054,charles_gordon,,1807.229,1811.648,"Or any application that he makes, if he makes an application for what we call adjustment of status."
1967.638,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.648,1813.692,"Well, isn't that discretionary relief though?"
1967.638,2,19054,charles_gordon,,1813.692,1815.234,Everything is discretionary.
1967.638,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.328,1839.36,"Well, that just happens to be one of the grounds on which he asked for suspension."
1967.638,2,19054,charles_gordon,,1839.36,1846.641,And it is in our view a totally meritless ground because he has to make such an application outside United States.
1967.638,3,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,2800.688,2803.751,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.638,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2997.644,3007.704,Can you think of any order to be made pursuant to a 242 proceeding which would not be made by the special inquiry officer.
1967.638,3,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3007.704,3011.61,"Under my interpretation in the statute, no Mr. Justice White."
1967.638,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3014.02,3015.382,Only special inquiry officers --
1967.638,3,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3015.382,3015.695,Only.
1967.638,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.695,3017.751,--can issue orders that are revealed on the Court of Appeals?
1967.638,3,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3017.751,3020.459,"That is correct, under my view, Mr. Justice White."
1967.638,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.459,3020.748,Yes.
1967.638,3,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3020.748,3021.766,Now --
1967.638,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3021.766,3024.75,You do have the Giova case?
1967.638,3,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3024.75,3029.315,"Well, I was just about to say Mr. Justice Stewart."
1967.638,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3039.712,3040.364,Yes.
1967.638,3,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3040.364,3050.461,"It must be, however, in order that is either made in the initial 242 (b) proceeding or under Giova in a motion to reopen that proceeding."
1967.638,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3050.461,3080.103,"Now, if the district director simply issues a stay of the deportation order on some good ground, pending some other determination that even though it wholly suspends the deportation order and that order is -- you wouldn't say that that is a matter that's pursuant to a 242 proceeding."
1967.638,3,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3080.103,3080.688,"Yes, I would."
1967.638,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3082.246,3086.284,Because isn't the subject matter -- isn't the subject matter is the person that was issuing the order.
1967.638,3,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3086.284,3106.903,"Oh, it's the -- well, it's the person in the sense that it is the person who functions within the procedures prescribed by Section 242 (b) but I don't agree with the Government that what we're talking about is the question as to whether an officer labeled the district director or a special inquiry officer or a group labeled the Board of Immigration Appeals."
1967.638,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3889.319,3899.444,"We had some problems like that in other areas, which doesn't seem to have prevented remanding."
1967.638,3,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3899.444,3901.297,Remanding to the agency.
1967.638,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3901.297,3904.582,Like in contract to appeals cases.
1967.638,3,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,3904.582,3906.2,"Yes, yes."
1967.638,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4324.916,4325.518,What page is that?
1967.638,3,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,4325.518,4326.36,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1967.638,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4629.653,4633.476,"Mr. Dempsey, before you sit down."
1967.638,3,44422,william_h_dempsey_jr,,4668.074,4668.626,Thank you very much.
