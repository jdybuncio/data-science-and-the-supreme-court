1978.77-6540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.43,We will go out of order if we may until more of our colleagues arrive.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,42.161,45.659,Chief Justice Brennan and May it please the court.
1978.77-6540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,268.432,279.532,"Mr. Fisher, before you continue you had told us just a moment ago that ordinarily in King's County plea negotiations are conducted at bench conferences of which no record is made."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,279.532,280.597,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-6540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,280.597,288.098,Does that apply that it's quite usual for judges to participate in the negotiations?
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,288.098,289.09,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
1978.77-6540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,299.869,304.335,And your position I gather is that it's always improper for the judge to --
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,304.335,315.597,"Well, I would ask that the Court establish a procedural safeguard based upon my analysis of Jackson, the needless encouragement of guilty plea."
1978.77-6540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,328.937,332.636,"Well, to what extent would you suggest the judge has any role in the file?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,332.636,344.24,"Well, I think that an agreement maybe reached between the Defense Counsel and the Prosecutor, and that agreement maybe presented to the trail judge."
1978.77-6540,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,351.901,356.694,"A judge here will sentence the man if he pleads not guilty, but is found guilty."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,356.694,358.361,That's correct.
1978.77-6540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,401.111,411.81,"What if the prosecutor offers to recommend a certain sentence to the defendant if he pleads guilty and the defendants says, how do I know what the judge will do?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,424.989,440.238,I would not object to the presentation as in the federal system of an agreement being presented to a judge who then may ratify or reject the offer.
1978.77-6540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,464.77,465.839,What's the difference?
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,465.839,477.409,"Well, the first difference that comes to mind is although, assume that, that agreement was rejected by the judge."
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,516.417,532.9,"Mr. Fisher in the State of New York or in Brooklyn, is this by statute, by rule or by what, this bench conference?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,532.9,541.572,"Well, the conference part, there is a special part to which cases are sent after arraignment that is established by Court rule."
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,544.066,549.92,But what statute rule or what says that a judge shall participate?
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,549.92,553.694,There is no statute rule or other --
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,553.694,555.414,This is a custom that has grown?
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,555.414,556.915,"It has, Your Honor."
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,556.915,560.132,And the judge is a party in this --
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,560.132,560.467,Yes.
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,574.025,578.016,"Well, on which side is the judge on in the negotiation?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,578.016,584.103,"Well, it seems to me that the judge becomes an advocate for a disposition, his own perhaps."
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,618.254,629.048,"If one of the parties, district attorney has no position on sentence, what is the good of plea bargaining, who is doing the bargaining now?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,629.048,637.202,"Well, in this particular case and under these circumstances, the bargaining was between the Judge and the defendant."
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,637.202,640.257,Is that normally understood to be plea bargaining?
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,640.257,640.948,"Well, it's called --"
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,640.948,642.591,Or is that a trial?
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,642.591,644.934,It's called pre-bargaining in King's County Your Honor.
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,679.792,690.939,"Mr. Fisher the ABA standard on which you side on the footnote on page 16 of your brief was in fact changed last week, wasn't it?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,690.939,691.67,It was Your Honor.
1978.77-6540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,728.228,740.98,"When you say that the ABA standard permits, what you mean is that it recommends that the states and the federal government or anybody else who might have sentencing authority ought to permit the judge."
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,740.98,746.387,"But you would not agree with that if the judge is the one who, if the Board then fails, is going to turn the case."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,746.387,748.008,That's correct.
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,748.008,751.33,Even as a moderator?
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,751.33,759.428,I don't think that his position as a moderator would be consistent with constitutional principles.
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,793.345,796.232,Just to pause at one another point.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,804.13,817.406,"Well, it seems established that prior to the Wade hearing and generally they do discuss the fact, the prosecutor will say, we think we can prove this and Defense Counsel may say, well, but we don't --"
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,817.406,824.779,"So the judge is going to trial, the case -- gets a pre-run of the case that he is on a later trial?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,824.779,826.021,He does Your Honor.
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,829.638,832.161,"He could get a full run, because he could?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,832.161,833.311,He could.
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,833.311,840.723,And so the trial of the case would be a new trial.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,840.723,870.07,"In this case, it seems established and uncontested that prior to the Wade hearing, this very trial judge had apparently an unreported bench conference, again extended to the defendant the plea offer involving an unarmed robbery carrying a three and a half to seven year sentence and that the petitioner rejected that offer, insisted he was innocent and requested that he would be permitted to go to trial."
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.945,1030.813,"Well, how about a judge who at sentencing after a guilty plea of normally says or announces that I think it's only proper to get consideration, to give leniency, because the person has pled guilty and indicated that he is ready for rehabilitation or something like that."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1030.813,1034.667,I think that that might enter a judge's sentencing decision.
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1035.674,1047.438,"Yes, I understand, and so that a lawyer may properly advise his client at least this judge usually gives leniency."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1047.438,1049.135,"And may give, yes he might."
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1049.135,1050.431,You don't challenge that practice.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1050.431,1068.546,"No. I do not challenge that, but I think that where the petitioner and the respondent part company in the context of this case is whether the proposition that a State may offer substantial benefits to induce or to persuade the defendant to plead guilty whether that proposition includes a trial judge."
1978.77-6540,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1111.081,1121.628,"Yet, for purposes of State action under the Fourteenth Amendment, the judge's action is every bit the action of the state in the same sense as of prosecutors, isn't it?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1121.628,1131.766,"In certain aspects it is, Your Honor, but I don't believe that within the confines of the statement announced in Corbett that a State may offer."
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1166.501,1178.772,I think then he wouldn't think that any bargain that's been worked out between the prosecutor and the Defense Counsel should be presented for any kind of approval to the judge who may try the case.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1178.772,1188.94,"I have no objection to that procedure, because I do not see again the coercion."
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.94,1192.751,"What if the judge says, no I don't know agree with this."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1192.751,1193.448,That may enter into --
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1193.448,1194.74,And then he tried the case.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1194.74,1195.771,Well that might enter.
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1208.599,1208.901,Alright.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1217.942,1219.613,I find nothing wrong with that Your Honor.
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.613,1230.787,"Well, he knows that the judge has simply said, if you don't go for something better, I'm going to try you."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1230.787,1243.237,"Well, the difference I think is when a judge offers a specific disposition he becomes an advocate for it and the risk that the defendant faces is a rejection of a disposition, apparently desired by the judge."
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1279.38,1283.129,Mr. Fisher you rely.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1287.544,1288.493,I do Your Honor.
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1288.493,1308.231,"And you contend for a rule that would never permit the judge to participate in the bargaining itself to the extent at least that the Defense Counsel said he did in this case, if that judge is going to be the trial judge.I"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1320.861,1321.447,Both.
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1334.132,1363.721,"Of course, judges all the time deal with the rule that certain evidence should be excluded, because of sometimes for reasons not having to do at all with the guilt or innocence of the person very probative evidence of his guilt, but a judge is required under the law the Fourth Amendment or the rules of involuntary confessions or whatever to exclude that from the trial and yet the judge knows all about it and wouldn't that give him the idea pretty clearly that the defendant is guilty?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1363.721,1367.248,It would and the encouragement to plead guilty would be precisely the same.
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1403.476,1418.681,"How about the situation and maybe it's pretty hard for a Brooklyn lawyer to realize this, but there are many parts in the United States that are not like Kings County and that do not have many, many trial judges that only have one trial judge."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1427.321,1436.311,"Well, I think not, I think in that circumstance, I can see no State interest advanced by the participation of a trial judge."
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1436.311,1438.954,Well there is only one though in the whole County.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1438.954,1442.795,Right and in that county there would be judicial participation in plea.
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1442.795,1444.64,What if -- there could be under this privilege.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1444.64,1447.066,There could not be under my proposal.
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1447.066,1454.285,"The other way to -- the other way, it might come out, is to say, well in that county it's not needless."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1454.285,1458.509,"Except that I -- that argument might be made, but I think whoever --"
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1458.509,1459.375,But you don't make it.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1459.375,1465.83,"That's right, and I think that it would be up to whoever propose that argument to demonstrate what that need."
1978.77-6540,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1465.83,1471.864,"You used a phrase, needless guilty pleas and I'm not sure I know what you mean by some of Jackson opinion."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1471.864,1481.361,"Well, my reasoning is based on what I see to be the underlying principle in the Jackson case, which is that the constitution will --"
1978.77-6540,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1481.361,1483.81,"What you think it means, that's what I'm trying to get."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1483.81,1510.585,"What do I think it means, I think that what Jackson holds is that some encouragement or encouragement to a defendant to plead guilty is not always violative of due process, but the test of Jackson is needless that is whether it serves a legitimate goal and whether or not that goal can be achieved by some other means."
1978.77-6540,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1526.362,1549.323,"What if a judge assigned or a district where he is not regularly sitting, so that his habits are not known, announces at the beginning of the term when they the call the criminal calendar that all persons who are tied and found guilty will get the maximum sentence permitted by the statute."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1556.962,1557.895,Absolutely.
1978.77-6540,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1557.895,1558.919,Do you think it's bad?
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1558.919,1560.127,"Yes, I do."
1978.77-6540,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1560.127,1562.454,Do you think Jackson prohibits it?
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1562.454,1564.778,I think the principles of Jackson are prohibited.
1978.77-6540,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1591.386,1608.075,"Whether if instead of announcing it, particular judge by long habits communicates to the entire bar and practicing in that court, that that's what in fact he does but he doesn't articulate that is his standard."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1608.075,1623.073,"Well, of course that's a closer question of course because there is difference between a lawyer saying to his client, this judge is reputed to have a policy of imposing the maximum."
1978.77-6540,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1634.057,1648.567,Don't you think there are any advantages to the category of defendants as a class versus charge that the candor of the judge gives them much better working basis for making a decision.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1648.567,1669.781,"Your Honor, I agree with what I think is a consensus of opinion in the commentaries and the case is that whatever benefit may accrue to the defendants as a class, but this increase of information as they say is outweighed by the coercive effect of a judge's announcement or judge's participation in plea bargain."
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1669.781,1707.506,"Mr. Fisher some, close to 20 years ago, more than 15 years ago the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed a conviction on the ground of a statement by a trail judge in Chicago, that it was his practice and policy and considered have it to always give greater sentences to somebody who had been, who had pleaded not guilty and then found guilty than to those who pleaded guilty."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1712.518,1715.216,It was -- I am not familiar.
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1715.216,1718.711,What would you think of that?
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1718.711,1721.733,I think I would have trouble with it.
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1746.526,1766.566,"Although at least in your case, you have at least according to the defense counsel active participation in the bargaining by the judge himself and a precise statement in your case that if he found guilty, after non-guilty plea, you would get the maximum sentence."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1766.566,1768.048,Which was twice --
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1768.048,1775.328,"There is a problem in this case as to what the facts actually are, all we have is that statement of Defense Counsel."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1775.328,1780.052,There are differing interpretations now offered to the court by the petitioner and the respondent.
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1804.05,1811.543,"The colloquy that you, to which you call our attention on page 28 of the appendix."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1817.62,1818.541,Who is trial counselor?
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1818.541,1820.265,Who is trial counselor for the defense.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1820.265,1820.752,Yes.
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1820.752,1826.107,There is some qualified conformation of it by the Judge.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1826.107,1827.577,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1827.577,1829.369,But he immediately qualifies it.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1829.369,1845.979,"Well, subject to his reading of the probation report that is not -- I don't believe very meaningful since in New York every court is obliged by law, every judge is obliged by law prior to imposing sentence to at least order and consider probation report but he's not obligated --"
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1845.979,1853.623,But then he said that is a practice in my court when there is an armed robbery to give a maximum sentence unless there are mitigating circumstances.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1853.623,1861.491,Well he has obviously misrepresented his position because this defendant had pleaded guilty to armed robbery and received less than half the maximum sentence.
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1864.819,1865.664,After a not-guilty plea.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1865.664,1866.529,After not guilty.
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1867.393,1878.537,"Why didn't they have these statements or negotiations transcribed, you say, they never do it?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1878.537,1881.345,It is my experience that is not the -- it is the custom --
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1881.345,1884.873,Is there a reason for it?
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1892.414,1895.231,"Well, in the middle of the criminal trial certainly when issues of law are raised."
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1895.256,1899.048,"Right, why could you do it then?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1899.048,1907.437,"You certainly could I think that it must be -- any negotiations I think the better practice is to transcribe, but it's simply not the custom in Kings County to do so."
1978.77-6540,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1907.437,1908.984,"Well, in some counties, it is."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1908.984,1913.789,"I understand that, and it's the recommendation of the ABA with which I agree."
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.789,1918.773,I take it a state can have an announced policy of leniency for guilty pleas.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1918.773,1922.379,That's the implication of the statement in core of it as I understand.
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1922.379,1930.349,"Well, I mean that's the -- otherwise guilty plea systems would always be unconstitutional I suppose."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1937.07,1941.024,Yes and of course the range of the --
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.024,1954.313,"That is, you ask almost any prosecutor if he plea bargains, if he says yes, then you say, “Well, so you give, your policy is to recognize leniency, extend leniency exchange for guilty pleas?”"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1955.981,1956.673,Yes.
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1956.673,1957.723,It's almost everywhere.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1957.723,1958.127,Yes.
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1958.127,1962.009,So may a state have an announced policy of leniency for guilty pleas or not?
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1962.009,1965.058,May a state have an announced --
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1965.058,1965.782,"The state of, the state, yes."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1966.79,1968.477,Yes he may.
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.477,1977.781,May a Judge say I have a policy of extending leniency at the time of sentencing for those who have pled guilty.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1977.781,1980.327,"I don't think you can, I don't think you can."
1978.77-6540,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1980.327,1982.313,"You certainly can at the seventh circuit, okay."
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,1982.313,1986.206,No we can't Your Honor.
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1986.206,2000.096,"Well then he must have judged always -- may he say -- I agree, I approve this bargain you have struck based on leniency for--?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,2000.096,2006.778,He may -- once a bargain is struck yes he may say he accepts it and may give his reasons for accepting it if he so desires.
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2006.778,2015.948,"So any time under -- must you defend the position that at sentencing, a judge may never have a leniency for a guilty plea?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,2015.948,2021.386,"No, that is not my proposition; my proposition is that he may not prior to the plea agreement."
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.386,2023.056,That isn't what I ask you.
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,2023.056,2024.252,Well I believe --
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.252,2047.164,"May I -- I say, here is a Judge how at sentencing says, “My policy is to give leniency for guilty pleas,” that's all he has ever said but he says it almost every time, and lawyers are -- constantly tell their clients then that this judge's policy, announced policy is to give leniency for guilty pleas, is that unconstitutional?"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,2047.164,2050.301,"Well let me reconsider, I think yes."
1978.77-6540,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.936,2061.128,"So if he says, he says in proper cases my policy is to --"
1978.77-6540,0,41314,steven_fisher,,2061.128,2069.333,"In proper cases, would be more acceptable to my sense of due process, thank you."
1978.77-6540,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2069.333,2077.813,Very well Mr. Mischel.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2084.284,2087.476,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2366.569,2373.946,"But he may -- if not so exposed, he may participate only as a moderator, not as one of the bargainers, isn't that correct?"
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2373.946,2386.43,"That is correct Your Honor, but once the agreement is brought to the attention of the judge and the judge says, “No, I don't want to go along with this agreement go back and bargain some more,” the judge is aware of the fact that defendant wants to plead."
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2386.43,2391.816,"As I understand there was no go back, in this one it was all gone with the judge there."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2391.816,2392.67,I'm sorry Your Honor.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2392.67,2399.467,"In this case, it wasn't going back and forth to the judge, the judge held the whole thing."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2399.467,2400.953,That is correct Your Honor but --
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2400.953,2403.437,He didn't negotiate --
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2403.437,2411.179,"Your Honor, in all candor, this was not that the typical type of plea bargaining or horse trading."
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2411.179,2413.872,But when we have got -- .
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2413.872,2423.516,"But your honor this is not a situation where the Judge has said to the defendant well will you take one to three, the defendant says no, well how about is zip to two."
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2427.014,2433.586,Well as I understand prosecutor said practically nothing.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2433.586,2437.12,"Your Honor, that is unclear from the record, because after the record --"
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2437.12,2440.663,But at least it is in the record that judge did.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2440.663,2441.277,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2441.277,2445.349,The judge participated in the merits of the case.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2448.113,2449.559,Your Honor may I qualify that.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2449.913,2450.816,No sir.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2458.975,2462.685,Your Honor this Judge did not suggest the plea be taken.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2469.368,2471.548,Did he ask what where the facts?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2471.548,2473.882,The facts will presented through a wade hearing Your Honor.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2473.882,2475.922,Did he ask what where fact?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2475.922,2482.279,Your Honor the fact really presented to because a motion had been maid to suppress in code identification testimony.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2482.279,2487.276,"I'm not talking about that, I'm not talking about this theory, which the Judge have -- ."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2487.276,2488.719,No Your Honor.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2496.581,2499.412,"Well this Judge, was he going to try the case?"
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2499.412,2501.275,This judge was going to try the case.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2501.275,2506.956,"So this current theory, does he only have the cases he is going to try or does he have all of them?"
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2506.956,2509.452,"He only has the cases, he is going to try, but this --"
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.452,2511.665,Well how can that be a conference part?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2511.665,2514.454,"Well no, I'm sorry if I've mislead the court."
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2517.57,2520.782,"Well, it can't be remarked, every Judge has conference part."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2520.782,2523.836,"No, only one judge has the conference part Your Honor."
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2523.836,2525.581,And he tries all of those case?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2525.581,2527.219,No he does not Your Honor.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2542.871,2548.495,"Well, where did I get to understand in this case this Judge was going to try this case."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2548.495,2557.239,"No this, the judge who was involved in the ultimate plea negotiations was going to try the case, but it's a two step process."
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2596.19,2599.187,Was he doing the trail or do one of these conference thing?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2599.187,2600.283,"Pardon, I'm sorry Your Honor."
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2600.283,2604.285,Was it doing the trail or this conference business?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2604.285,2606.683,The conferencing of the case had terminated.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2608.788,2614.33,"Where was it that the judge is sitting on the bench, was that the trail of the case?"
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2614.33,2616.469,This is at a pre-trail hearing.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2617.146,2619.574,Pre-trail hearing held in open court.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2619.574,2620.759,But it had nothing to do with the plea.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2620.759,2621.868,In the open court?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2621.868,2627.83,"That is correct, in open correct, and what happened was that when the case was transferred to --"
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2627.83,2629.755,And was the court stenographer there?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2629.755,2631.091,"Yes, there was."
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2631.091,2632.951,They didn't take this down.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2632.951,2635.083,No court stenographer did not take this down.
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2635.083,2636.646,This was that Wade hearing.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2636.646,2638.524,The Wade hearing was transcribed.
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2638.524,2639.1,Right.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2639.1,2657.759,"But my understanding of the record was first the case was assigned out to Mr. Justice Heldt(ph), at which point Defense Counsel approached the bench and said your Honor would you agree to a resurrection of the original plea agreement, namely a plea to robbery in the second degree, at a term of 3.5 to 7."
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2668.945,2670.25,That was a conference judge.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2670.25,2672.393,The original agreement was before the conference Judge.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2794.366,2797.895,"Like the French Civil law, you're guilty until you're prove innocent."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2797.895,2806.351,"No Your Honor what I think Judge is saying is, he is not saying to the defendant I'm going to penalize you because you're going to trail."
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2832.059,2835.509,It also says you might persuade me to the contrary.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2835.509,2841.071,He would also persuade him to the contrary in what regard Your Honor?
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2841.071,2844.138,You said he said unless there is some kind of circumstance.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2844.138,2845.546,In the probation report.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2845.546,2849.509,"Yeah, well – well there is another sentence?"
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2849.509,2850.354,Pardon?
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2850.354,2852.674,He is crazy.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2857.919,2868.713,"No, no, but what he is pointing out your Honor is that if there are redeeming factors in this man's -- for example, what is his participation in the crime?"
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2894.483,2895.966,The defendant wasn't there.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2895.966,2899.129,The defendant was off on the side at counsel table.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2908.695,2911.229,What do you think we need here to find out what happened?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2911.229,2911.685,Your Honor --
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2911.685,2912.896,He thought they are worried.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2912.896,2914.034,I certainly was not.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2914.034,2918.405,But would you like to have a hearing and find out what happened?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2918.405,2927.903,"Personally I would, but I would suggest to the court there are four circumstances or possibly three circumstances under which a hearing in my view would be totally unnecessary."
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2949.342,2952.28,Not in the assumed fact.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2952.28,2953.681,See we have --
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2953.681,2956.143,We have difficulty assuming that.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2956.143,2960.206,What I'm saying – I'm not asking you to you know making findings of facts.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2960.206,2962.69,"You said, assuming your facts --."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2962.69,2963.023,Right.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2963.023,2964.632,Is that what you said?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2964.632,2977.668,I'm taking from the language your Honor of the case in which you dissented in United States ex rel. McGrath v. LaVallee in which there was discrepancy in what actually transpired between the prosecution defense and the Judge.
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2989.619,2995.906,"Now son, let me tell to you son, like a father to a son."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,2999.433,3006.632,The point that I making Your Honor is that I think that if petitioner's facts are borne out in the record.
1978.77-6540,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3022.157,3023.616,And unconstitutional.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3023.616,3023.903,Pardon?
1978.77-6540,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3026.491,3041.066,"Is it fair to say Mr. Mischel and I expect you, I think I know what your answer is going to be since what you have just told us, that it's not at all clear from this record or from what part of the record is in the appendix."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3042.58,3045.02,Regrettably Your Honor it is not clear from the record.
1978.77-6540,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3058.585,3061.948,"You think so, but you concede that that is not at all clear."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3061.948,3062.919,I concede that Your Honor.
1978.77-6540,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3062.919,3074.45,"Well, isn't the burden of proof in any case that comes to this court from the state court where you seek to upset a criminal convection on the petitioner of the person who seeks to upset the action of the state court."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3074.45,3076.265,"Yes, Your Honor that is my understanding."
1978.77-6540,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3092.033,3095.401,Under what authority of this court?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3095.401,3097.991,I was just – under no authority of this court.
1978.77-6540,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3102.124,3116.603,Well doesn't petitioner have the burden right now in this court of establishing the correctness of his contention in order to establish the principle that the proceeding was unconstitutional?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3116.603,3117.229,That is correct.
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3117.243,3127.497,"Well, no Mr. Mischel you told us I think that the record does clearly show that there was some participation on the part of the trial judge in the plea bargaining, you told us that didn't you?"
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3128.082,3130.281,The participation -- I would like to classify --
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3130.281,3146.517,"And you further told us if I, unless I misunderstood or misheard you, that if the petitioner's counsel is correct in his constitutional claim that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits any participation of the trail judge in the plea bargaining then you lose."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3146.517,3150.827,"That is correct and there would be no need for a hearing, because his participation."
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3190.8,3195.772,How does this case fit with Santa Bella case-- I'm sure you know that.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3195.772,3198.267,"Well, Your Honor in Santa Bella --"
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3198.267,3199.908,Attempt to promise.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3199.908,3210.897,"It was a promise by a prosecutor, which the defendant then relied upon and than the court refused to honor, excuse me that the prosecutor then reneged on his promise."
1978.77-6540,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3210.897,3211.936,To prosecute him.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3211.936,3221.884,"The prosecutor reneged on his promise, but I think that there is a very clear distinction between the conduct of a prosecutor and how far we would permit a prosecutor to go, as opposed to a trail judge."
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3247.78,3251.821,But the trail judge can't bring another indictment either which Bordenkircher involved.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3260.666,3261.644,Yes I would Your Honor.
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3261.644,3270.408,"Well how does the case as you assume it to be different from the one the Chief Justice posed a little while ago, that the trial judge just announces that his policy is to always to impose the maximum."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3272.624,3287.383,"I would submit Your Honor that I would have difficulty with an announced policy that anybody who is convicted in my court would only be sentenced to the maximum, because at that point you are taking out what sentencing requires, that is flexibility and the --"
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3287.383,3294.323,"Supposing the judge says that my practice is -- say it's a 20 year maximum, he says my practice in case of this kind gets 17 years."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3294.323,3300.418,"I still think that the judge under those circumstances would be of imposing a penalty, because it's not based on any factors --"
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3300.418,3305.013,"Well, supposing he always does and then take one step further, as the Chief Justice said earlier."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3329.446,3338.332,"I think that it is wrong, that prior to trail, before a judge has had any information given to him about a particular case, with particular facts and circumstances --"
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3338.332,3342.644,But he says my practice is always subject to exceptions and exceptional cases.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3342.644,3343.598,Alright.
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3343.598,3345.939,Which I think he says --
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3345.939,3347.008,Then I misunderstood.
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3355.751,3357.154,Isn't that what this judge did?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3357.154,3357.574,Pardon?
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3357.574,3358.474,Didn't this judge do that?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3358.474,3368.048,"That is correct, that is what our judge did, and I'm saying of that was fine, but what Mr. Fisher was arguing is that it was a two step process."
1978.77-6540,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3451.618,3457.366,Do you think there is a no distinction in the Jackson and (Inaudible) did it not?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3457.366,3458.637,"Yes, it did Your Honor."
1978.77-6540,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3458.637,3478.439,Do you think there might be one rule about a case as Jackson is relating to the specter of death sentence and that it would not be necessary to apply that same concept to a matter of two or three years more or less.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3478.439,3498.602,"Your Honor in Brady vs. United States Mr. Justice Brennan, pointed out specifically in his opinion of Parker vs. North Carolina that one of the big considerations in the Jackson case was the death penalty and until Corbett was handed down, I had assumed that, that was probably the primary motivating factor after reading Corbett."
1978.77-6540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3530.372,3533.229,"What about Corbett, what about the situation of Corbett?"
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3533.229,3545.502,"In Corbett, Your Honor, the defendant whether or not he pleaded non vogue, or went to trail was subject to the same type of penalty if he pleaded non-vogue, the trial --"
1978.77-6540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3545.502,3555.521,"But if he went to trail, there was no way he could and was found guilty, there was no way he'd get a lesser sentences in the statute stated."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3555.521,3556.302,"That is correct Your Honor, but --"
1978.77-6540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3556.302,3559.944,"So it's a flat rule, if you go trail you have a certain penalty."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3559.944,3570.102,"My understanding in Corbett, Your Honor and I maybe mistaken was that if was that if you went to trail and jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree, he got a definite sentence."
1978.77-6540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3575.597,3577.157,He could less.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3577.157,3580.897,"He could, but the point is that he could also be subject to the same penalty."
1978.77-6540,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3580.897,3581.299,I understand.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3581.299,3587.993,The judge could penalize him for the same thing and that there was no discrimination or discrepancy between the two situations.
1978.77-6540,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3596.236,3601.561,"So what if the trail judge says to that, well, look, if you got a trail, there isn't any statute."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3638.076,3639.746,I would have to retreat on that.
1978.77-6540,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3639.746,3645.168,Which one are you going to retreat on?
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3645.168,3646.616,I think that when a trial judge --
1978.77-6540,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3646.616,3649.158,You don't need to answer right now.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3649.158,3655.48,"If I may articulate, I think that a trial judge, take a step back."
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3686.95,3694.235,"Well the legislature would be announced before all trials that for certain crimes, there is a mandatory penalty."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3694.235,3718.657,"I understand that, but I think the difference between the legislature, Your Honor and trial judge was succinctly pointed out by Mr. Justice Brennan, in Parker v. North Carolina in Footnote 8, where he said that there is a distinction a human distinction between the statute, which is rigidly implied, and a judge who can be approached and any evidence of over bearing or overreaching will appear on the record."
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3748.132,3754.698,"What if prosecutor says if you go to trial, my recommendation to the trial judge is always 30 years if he is not guilty?"
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3754.698,3756.564,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, could you?"
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3756.564,3765.69,"What if a prosecutor says, if you go to trail in armed robbery and you are found guilty, I always recommend 30 years without exception."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3768.496,3781.722,"Your Honor, that what seemed to come under Bordenkicher and I still maintain that there is a very definite distinction between the prosecutor's threat to recommend a sentence and a judge's threat to impose the sentence because --"
1978.77-6540,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3781.722,3782.832,He had the power to impose it.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3782.832,3791.143,"That is correct, Your Honor and by threatening to impose the sentence based on nothing more than the defendant's assertion of his rights to go to trial."
1978.77-6540,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3802.222,3831.312,"Just a minute, you and your friend too have referred from time-to-time to the American Bar Association reports that cover this area, several of them and they might have or rather sweeping concessions you seem to be made -- I wonder if you are aware that in everyone of those reports the American Bar pointedly said, they were not addressing the constitutional question with nearly good sound practice."
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3831.312,3831.814,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-6540,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3831.814,3836.417,None of those were suggesting a constitutional question in this problem.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3838.493,3839.343,"Yes I'm, Your Honor."
1978.77-6540,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3862.522,3874.236,I was approaching this from -- the observation that I was making from the other end of the spectrum namely that even when they recommended something was a desirable practice.
1978.77-6540,1,39841,richard_elliot_mischel,,3883.357,3902.424,"Your Honor, I understand that to be correct and in addition to the proposals of the American Bar Association or the standards certainly would not be required in the States and the State would be able to adopt the system of contract, but I think of the system in Kings county fully comports with due process."
1978.77-6540,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3902.424,3903.002,Very Well.
