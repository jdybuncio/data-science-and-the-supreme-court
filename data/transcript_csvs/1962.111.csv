1962.111,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,18.627,"No. 111 William M. Ferguson the Attorney General for the State of Kansas, et al Appellants versus Frank G. Skrupa.o"
1962.111,0,44669,william_m_ferguson,,20.219,25.055,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,1624.228,1627.443,May it please the Court.
1962.111,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1646.075,1652.665,Mr. Weigand I beg your pardon I called you Mr. Gilmore without looking.
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,1654.903,1664.502,The act in question is practically a verbatim copy of the Pennsylvania Statute.
1962.111,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1785.687,1794.562,[Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,1794.562,1799.723,I think it is very definite with respect to the act that is made illegal.
1962.111,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1801.077,1815.313,[Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,1815.313,1828.81,If we are correct in the assumption on what that is based that the act does say that whoever does this specific act that I have defined shall be guilty of a crime.
1962.111,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1880.556,1881.986,"So, as stated that makes it a federal offense."
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,1881.986,1884.029,And only in that way.
1962.111,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1884.624,1886.064,Yeah.
1962.111,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1886.064,1901.23,[Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,1901.23,1913.215,"If I might add, my question -- put it -- my answer to your question, if Your Honor please that I know of no similar statute that you have upheld."
1962.111,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1924.152,1925.406,What about Olsen?
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,1925.406,1929.88,"I was going to discuss that Your Honor, Mr. Justice Black please."
1962.111,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1946.953,1948.026,Adams versus Tanner?
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,1948.026,1959.759,Adams versus Tanner said that the business of a man acting as agent for a man seeking employment was a lawful business activity and while it was subject to regulation could not be prohibited.
1962.111,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1977.27,1979.701,[Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,1979.701,1993.786,"That is a question where the matter was not -- first, it was one of public help, and I think that there are different categories with respect to types of regulations that maybe more stringent or less stringent with respect to it."
1962.111,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1994.987,2004.138,[Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2004.138,2015.058,"Yes, but the limitation that this Court has always put even as late as the Goldblatt case when it used the -- upheld the zoning regulation."
1962.111,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2102.498,2107.789,"Then I'd be sure that, I want to be sure, as to what you are arguing."
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2129.485,2130.087,And I --
1962.111,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2130.087,2131.72,Is that not your argument?
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2131.72,2133.443,"No, Your Honor."
1962.111,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2133.443,2142.502,Are you charging that it violates any specific Provision of the Constitution except due process?
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2142.502,2145.819,The due process and the equal protection clause of the Constitution --
1962.111,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2145.819,2147.97,Which one are you charging due process or equal protection?
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2147.97,2154.217,"We charge both, if the Court pleases; I think the strongest position is with respect to due process of law."
1962.111,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2154.217,2177.563,"That's because, as I understand you want us to return to what we said we were leaving in the Northwestern case that Nebraska's [Inaudible] you want us to leave the principle we said there, if we wouldn't any longer strike down statutes regulating business on the ground that the Court felt they were unreasonable?"
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2177.563,2189.826,"I didn't understand that this Court had ever said, while it held in substance what Your Honor has stated if I maybe at liberty to make this comment."
1962.111,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2200.28,2201.364,Wait a minute.
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2201.364,2208.892,Pardon me I didn't mean legal -- I mean an ordinary activity that in and of itself is lawful unless made criminal by the act.
1962.111,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2208.892,2211.15,Unless it makes it unlawful?
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2211.15,2213.269,"Well, but I think there is another limitation."
1962.111,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2221.553,2239.395,"But if the State decides in USA, a State decides deliberately through its Legislative body a certain type of activity like this, it wants to prohibit and bar, it cannot do it if a majority of this Court decides that it's unreasonable but to do it."
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2239.395,2245.24,And I submit Your Honor that in Adams versus Tanner in New State Ice versus Liebmann.
1962.111,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2245.24,2248.472,I just want to be sure that's what we have to -- that's what we have to meet.
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2248.472,2289.44,"That is the first question that Court has to meet, but if the Court should determine that contrary to the contingents made by the appellees, I submit this Court must still uphold the lower court, because of another constitutional deprivation of this statute results in and that is that it was enacted contrary to the limitations imposed by the Kansas constitution, as clearly interpreted by the Kansas Supreme Court and that construction of the Kansas Constitution by the Kansas Supreme Court is not inhibited or prohibited by any Federal Constitutional Provision."
1962.111,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2311.5,2319.055,Are you saying that the State of -- the Supreme Court of Kansas is held it by the Kansas Constitution that's an adequate State ground?
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2319.055,2327.47,"They did say that with respect to this specific statute, but they announced a rule of law seven months before this Legislature ignored it in the case of guilty --"
1962.111,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2327.47,2332.522,[Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2332.522,2333.008,Yes.
1962.111,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2333.008,2342.887,[Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2342.887,2344.42,Yes being difficult --
1962.111,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2344.42,2352.837,[Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2352.837,2377.458,"The Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution safeguards a person against the Kansas legislature taking away his rights, which he has under the Kansas Constitution, because it thereby denies him equal protection of the Kansas Constitution, which is to be enforced against all people equally and so far is as applicable."
1962.111,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2377.458,2389.888,[Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2389.888,2393.419,"Yes and the Due Process Clause, both."
1962.111,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2393.419,2403.95,[Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2403.95,2435.82,"Well, we have no direct access to the Supreme Court of Kansas and we had to go through a local Judge who had already expressed -- this is not in the record that's why we didn't go in, because this man is a non-resident of the State of Kansas and because of the Kansas Constitution entitles non-residents to the same protection of the constitution by specific provision, as it does to the residents, we were able to get into the Federal Court on two grounds."
1962.111,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.82,2442.259,Why couldn't you have raised state grounds [Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2442.259,2444.341,Well I think we could have.
1962.111,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2444.341,2448.811,Why couldn't you just said [Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2448.811,2450.114,"We could, we could."
1962.111,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.114,2454.1,[Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2454.1,2458.617,The lower Court cited the case that I referred to in the opinion.
1962.111,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2572.333,2589.204,Suppose the [Inaudible] did raise the federal [Inaudible] and did you --
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2589.204,2589.904,Oh indeed.
1962.111,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2589.904,2593.357,And did you argue that [Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2593.357,2595.765,We did and we also argued in addition --
1962.111,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2595.765,2600.689,[Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2600.689,2609.36,"Well, it cites as the principles of law applicable, they don't say that they ground it solely on that, because I think the Court will definitely felt --"
1962.111,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2609.36,2614.815,[Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2614.815,2622.388,"It said the principles of law applicable to this case were enunciated in Gilbert versus Matthew's, which is a the pronouncement of the --"
1962.111,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2622.388,2641.704,[Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2641.704,2656.116,"Well and Your Honor if I had failed to make my position clear, it's the Federal Constitution that we think that protects us against the enforcement of a Kansas law that violates the Kansas Constitution."
1962.111,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2656.824,2673.966,I understand that but [Inaudible]
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2673.966,2716.334,"Well, I have never had any doubt and I don't think the majority of the Court below had any doubt that there was any divergence between the construction by the Kansas Supreme Court of the law applicable to the Kansas Legislature and that announcement this Court in Adams versus Tanner, which the cert that I made of it maybe inadequate was that this Court had never said, we hereby disapprove or we hereby over rule, the rule of law that a state in the exercise of its police power can take a lawful business activity and make it criminal where it can be regulated and that was the rule that is consistently announced both in Adams versus Tanner."
1962.111,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2729.914,2742.746,We will recess and --
1962.111,1,35222,lawrence_weigand,,2742.746,2746.515,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1962.111,2,44669,william_m_ferguson,,3531.01,3532.573,May it please the Court.
1962.111,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3574.755,3583.132,[Inaudible]
1962.111,2,44669,william_m_ferguson,,3583.132,3595.759,"Yes I -- the Gilbert versus Mathews case, it is relied to some extent on Adams versus Tanner, and so did the Stone case in Pennsylvania."
