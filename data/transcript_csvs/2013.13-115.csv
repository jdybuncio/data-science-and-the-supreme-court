2013.13-115,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.624,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 13-115, Wood v. Moss."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,6.874,8.029,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,28.005,29.676,May I ask a question?
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,52.605,60.055,"So, Your Honor, the pro-Bush demonstrators were differently situated from the anti-Bush demonstrators in several fundamental respects."
2013.13-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,78.625,80.406,"That was after the second move, not the first."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,80.406,80.452,"No, Your Honor."
2013.13-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,100.914,128.98,"Counsel, I don't understand the government to be making the argument, and I can't understand why it isn't making the argument, that it doesn't matter whether there was any intent to suppress anti-Bush demonstrations, that in this area, as in traffic stops, we don't consult subjective intent."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,153.035,157.549,"Your Honor, I don't believe we are avoiding the argument that Your Honor suggests."
2013.13-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,157.549,158.19,You haven't made it.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,158.19,161.361,"We don't think it's -- I think, Your Honor, with respect, that we have."
2013.13-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,167.578,168.545,You don't even have to get into that.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,185.897,186.615,"--Your Honor, we agree with that."
2013.13-115,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,210.357,211.888,"Well, do you agree with that, Mr. Gershengorn?"
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,246.342,264.459,"--So, Your Honor, I think that the way we reconcile the two positions is the following: If there is no objective legitimate security rationale, and it is animus, we agree that it would be clearly established law that the officers could not have taken -- the agents could not have taken responsibility -- could not have taken the actions."
2013.13-115,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,278.861,280.281,Could you get oblige us by answering Justice Scalia's question.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,308.379,311.128,--We don't think they've stated a constitutional violation in that context.
2013.13-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,313.206,316.673,I don't -- what does that answer mean?
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,316.673,319.563,--That means there is no constitutional violation.
2013.13-115,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,319.563,339.194,"So you -- so you say that any time there is an objective basis for the Secret Service to act to move a protester, the fact that this wasn't the motive at all, but that viewpoint discrimination is irrelevant."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,339.194,340.397,"So, Your Honor, I want to--"
2013.13-115,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,340.397,342.506,Is that your position or is it not?
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,342.506,345.302,"--That is our position, but I don't think that's what we need to win this case."
2013.13-115,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,345.302,358.405,"I know that, but the reason that you -- the reason I think these questions are being asked, my impression is exactly what Justice Scalia said in respect to a Fourth Amendment case against a police stop."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,382.458,383.49,"So, Your Honor, I--"
2013.13-115,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,383.49,385.754,Now -- and what is the answer to what I just said?
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,385.754,386.659,--The answer to--
2013.13-115,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,386.659,389.908,"Am I right on part one, and am I right on part two?"
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,389.908,392.579,"--Your Honor, you are right on part one."
2013.13-115,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,425.862,425.934,"Well, we all know you don't need to win on that question."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,452.869,456.509,"--So, Your Honor, I've been asked the government's view on a couple of things, so I want to be very clear."
2013.13-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.094,481.256,I can't understand why you didn't brief it then in that case.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,494.291,494.63,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.13-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,494.63,495.699,Do we have any cases that has held that?
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,495.699,495.921,No.
2013.13-115,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,500.857,503.7,"Is that a relevant -- well, what is your position on that?"
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,511.65,520.065,"We do believe, Your Honor, that it is -- it is -- the Court would have jurisdiction to reach it because it's a logically antecedent question and that it would be something that the Court could consider."
2013.13-115,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,520.639,522.301,But I don't mean what the Court could consider.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,522.301,523.145,--Yes.
2013.13-115,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,523.145,527.582,"I want to know whether or not -- well, the question is simple."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,536.531,550.572,"Your Honor, I think that the presence of -- the Court's hesitance to recognize Bivens and the factors that go into the -- that gave the Court hesitance to extend Bivens to First Amendment claims are relevant to the analysis here."
2013.13-115,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,562.941,582.012,"Well, on -- on the merits of the case, if you were called to brief the Secret Service, what would you say in response to this question: Do we have any duties under the First Amendment when we are protecting the President with respect to crowds and -- and people that are close to him?"
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,583.558,590.711,"Your Honor, we would -- first of all, as the policy -- I know Your Honor has asked this, but I just want to make clear."
2013.13-115,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,596.804,598.147,"If you're asking about a law, they say we want to know what the law is."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,600.894,604.237,"--I would say, Your Honor, that the law is not clearly established."
2013.13-115,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,606.939,610.266,"That's why we've invited you to lunch, so that you will tell us what the law is."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,611.062,613.068,--And we may yet get clarity.
2013.13-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,613.186,616.17,You actually are arguing that it's not--
2013.13-115,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,616.17,616.951,Could I--
2013.13-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,616.951,617.903,--that it's not--
2013.13-115,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,617.903,619.025,"--have an answer to this question, please?"
2013.13-115,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,619.025,620.221,Answer Justice Kennedy's question.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,620.221,635.99,"--We would tell -- I think I would have to say in candor, Your Honor, that in part because of some of the discussion we're having, that we think the better view of the law would be if you have an objective security rationale for the action, that the retaliatory animus would not render that unconstitutional."
2013.13-115,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,635.99,636.618,"Well, can I ask you a question?"
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,636.618,638.957,But I would have to say that that's not clearly established and there's a rule--
2013.13-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,638.957,646.976,"--Do you think it's not clearly established that you can't discriminate solely -- I've used the word ""solely""."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,655.596,656.571,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.13-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,657.464,658.642,That's constitutionally established?
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,658.642,661.557,And I take that as different from the hypothetical that Justice Scalia proposed.
2013.13-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,661.557,661.909,"No, no, no."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,663.281,663.303,Okay.
2013.13-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,663.353,663.84,--step by step.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,665.767,666.732,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.13-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,666.732,667.135,All right.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,671.291,672.598,That's correct.
2013.13-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,672.598,674.229,That's a different issue.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,679.211,679.977,Your Honor--
2013.13-115,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,679.977,689.005,"That -- the other side, I think, is saying it's not, that there was no valid security reason, no objective security reason for this move."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,689.005,692.801,"--And I think our response to that, Your Honor, is we would agree that's clearly established."
2013.13-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.408,701.501,That's not a mixed motive.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,705.499,706.905,--I don't think that -- I don't think Justice Sotomayor--
2013.13-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.905,712.918,"If you agreed with my hypothetical, the point is it doesn't matter what the officer's motive was."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,725.757,738.546,"--Your Honor, I took Justice Sotomayor to be asking me a different question: If there is no objective security rationale, which takes it out of Your Honor's hypo, then we agree it is clearly established and we believe this complaint fails because they have failed to satisfy Iqbal."
2013.13-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.546,740.821,Then don't -- just don't call it mixed motive.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,743.749,743.843,"No, that I don't think is mixed motive."
2013.13-115,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,775.582,776.238,Justice--
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,776.238,776.894,But we agree--
2013.13-115,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,776.894,779.564,--Justice Alito has been trying to get a question in.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,779.564,780.314,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2013.13-115,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,780.314,781.314,"No, no."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,845.594,845.988,"I do, Your Honor."
2013.13-115,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,845.988,854.129,--The Secret Service has to make a decision about how much information they need before they can -- they should move people or change a route or something like that.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,856.578,864.374,"Your Honor, I think it would have to be a very deferential standard and it would -- and I think that that is proper under this Court's case law."
2013.13-115,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,932.409,947.418,"Would you say that under your view of the case, that there is a First Amendment interest that protesters have, but that it is virtually unenforceable in the context of crowd control?"
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,947.418,951.183,"No, Your Honor, we would not say that."
2013.13-115,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,952.199,956.556,"Because it seems to me that if this complaint doesn't survive, nothing will."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,956.556,959.195,"--So, Your Honor, I'd like to address that in a couple of different ways."
2013.13-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1013.439,1016.86,"You know, I really -- I really don't understand what the government is doing here."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1021.31,1021.92,--Your Honor--
2013.13-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1021.92,1032.588,"In -- in light of the arguments waived below and the arguments not made here, you want us to find for you, but on the narrowest possible ground."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1058.921,1065.996,"--Your Honor, we are -- we are doing our best to make with the arguments that we have before the Court."
2013.13-115,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1085.706,1106.51,"Mr. Gershengorn, suppose that we changed the facts here and that both the pro-Bush demonstrators and the anti-Bush demonstrators were in the same place and they were at the foot of the alleyway, so that there was an objective security rationale, but that the Secret Service members -- and they were in all respects the same except that they had different signs."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1128.674,1129.142,All right.
2013.13-115,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1148.602,1150.461,"I think you're changing my hypothetical, or let me just explain my hypothetical."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1150.461,1150.977,Okay.
2013.13-115,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1150.977,1163.879,"I put them both at the foot of the alleyway because that meant that both have a straight shot, you know, that they can throw a grenade into the patio, which is, I take it, what the nature of your objective security consideration is."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1169.703,1190.476,"So we would say, Your Honor, first on clearly established, that it is not clearly established that the Agency couldn't do that, but we recognize that the Court is -- is concerned about that situation where an agent -- an agent has a legitimate -- an objective security rationale, but acts solely on the basis of animus and I think it would support that kind of inference."
2013.13-115,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1197.349,1198.942,But just -- just tell me what your answer to that case is.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1199.707,1202.784,"--The answer is it would not be clearly established, that they--"
2013.13-115,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1202.784,1204.971,--And do you think it would be unlawful?
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1205.939,1215.436,--The government's position is if -- although we haven't briefed it in this case -- the government's position would be the one articulated by Justice Scalia.
2013.13-115,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1219.965,1222.51,I don't think that's responsive to Justice Kagan's hypothetical.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1234.785,1235.087,--I'm sorry.
2013.13-115,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1238.722,1248.532,"I said both can throw a grenade into the patio area, but in fact you only remove the people who have the anti-President sign--"
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1248.532,1248.921,--So I took the fact--
2013.13-115,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1248.921,1252.39,--notwithstanding that the security consideration applies to both equally.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1252.39,1267.055,"--So I took that to be that there is an objective security rationale, and I think in that situation, we would say that the -- A, it's not clearly established -- but that we believe that the better answer is the one from Justice Scalia because there's an objective security rationale."
2013.13-115,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1267.055,1267.508,"Well, no."
2013.13-115,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1277.051,1277.504,"No, that is."
2013.13-115,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1277.504,1278.737,--I'll ask it.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1278.737,1279.503,Okay.
2013.13-115,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1279.503,1284.985,Let's say you have to move the President in an emergency situation.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1300.37,1303.947,"We do not think that would be unconstitutional, Your Honor."
2013.13-115,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1304.711,1309.054,"So in other words, the viewpoint itself constitutes a security consideration?"
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1309.054,1313.848,"--That's what this Court said in Reichle, that there are times, not that it inevitably--"
2013.13-115,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1313.848,1326.999,"Therefore, your answer to Justice Kagan is that it would be proper if you have only 15 minutes, a limited amount of time, to move the people with the -- with the adverse -- with the signs that criticize the President?"
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1326.999,1328.264,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.13-115,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1329.061,1336.09,So your answer to Justice Kagan is that there is no violation if they move just the Bush protesters.
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1337.246,1337.776,"--That's correct, Your Honor."

2013.13-115,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1408.575,1427.96,"I mean, suppose I add to my hypothetical and I say -- and the Secret Service goes to the local police and says -- and, you know, doesn't talk about grenades at all and really just says we have got to get these anti-President people out of here because they're annoying the President; let's do it right now, and that's what they do."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1427.96,1439.443,"--I think, Your Honor, that at some point you would cross over into a position where you would say there -- there is a real question about whether there's an objective security rationale and we would be in a situation--"
2013.13-115,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1439.443,1439.607,"Well, there is one."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1451.746,1462.554,"--Your Honor, I recognize that that is -- as I said, I think that is a -- that is the -- the hardest case for us and I recognize that's why Your Honor posed it."
2013.13-115,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1490.449,1499.447,"We understand that and I think that that's the problem, and I think you're being sort of picked at for this reason in my mind, and I don't know if you have an answer to this."
2013.13-115,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1535.432,1539.197,"Your Honor, very briefly, then I'd like to reserve."

2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1573.386,1577.414,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-115,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1601.154,1609.698,"Would you have taken the same position if all that had been was the first move, that is, the move to Fourth Street?"
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1618.039,1631.409,"I think that would be a more difficult case for us to prevail because we wouldn't have one of the prongs on which we rely, which is the disparate treatment as one of the factors we rely on to establish the inference of intent."
2013.13-115,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1631.409,1651.009,"Well, then would you say that you would have no tenable case if they moved them just the one street over so they wouldn't be in a position to throw a hand grenade to the patio?"
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1651.009,1657.46,"I think as a practical matter, we would probably -- we would likely not have as tenable a case as we do."
2013.13-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1680.388,1688.634,"Counsel, do you acknowledge that -- that the issue here is whether the law was clearly established?"
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1690.587,1694.632,I think the -- I think we believe the law was clearly established by this Court's precedents.
2013.13-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.632,1698.24,I'm not saying whether you believe it is.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1702.364,1705.191,"Well, I think this Court's qualified immunity precedents make that clear."
2013.13-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1705.191,1705.597,Okay.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1721.746,1739.646,"I think you can, Justice Scalia, hold -- find from this Court's decisions in its viewpoint discrimination holdings, like Rosenberger, like R.A.V. v.

2013.13-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1739.646,1741.099,"Oh, it is pernicious."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1758.857,1759.73,--Up to now.
2013.13-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.37,1772.788,"Well, regardless of whether it was made below, it certainly goes to the argument that was made below and here, that the violation here was not clearly established."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1772.788,1778.99,"--Well, I think it's different to say whether or not there is a remedy for the violation as to whether the violation was clearly established."
2013.13-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1778.99,1779.834,"Well, okay."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1779.834,1781.175,The violation was clearly established.
2013.13-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.112,1784.706,That's a good point.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1784.706,1785.518,--is a different question.
2013.13-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.518,1786.471,That's a good point.
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1786.471,1793.406,"Mr. Wilker, let's say something happens back in the patio area where you -- you're the head of the Secret Service detail."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1806.65,1809.461,I think whichever way provides the clearest egress.
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1809.461,1810.288,"No, no."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1819.182,1819.823,It is a serious point.
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1819.823,1820.813,You've got to decide like that.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1820.813,1824.326,"But that's not the position that -- that's not the position the agents were in on October 14, 2004."
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1824.326,1824.564,No.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1839.216,1843.465,I truly don't know the answer to your question because I'm not--
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1843.465,1843.902,Really?
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1843.902,1844.871,--a security expert.
2013.13-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.368,1853.055,You're the farthest thing from a security expert if you don't know the answer to that one.
2013.13-115,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1854.568,1862.301,"That's actually not much of an answer for lots of reasons, but the most, if you don't know, how are we supposed to know?"
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1862.301,1865.503,"--Well, because that's not the issue that's presented to this Court for decision today."
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1872.702,1892.492,"Well, but with respect, my point is that we do have to adopt a general principle, and if we say viewpoint can never be a consideration, then you have to say when there is an emergency going on, it's just as likely there will be a problem if we go through the pro-Bush demonstrators or the anti ones, which seems to me to be, on its face, implausible."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1892.492,1903.35,"Well, in the context of an emergency, there may be a different rule than there would be in the context of a considered decision to take viewpoint into account in making a decision, which is what we have alleged here."
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1903.35,1911.104,"So then you think there -- well, there may be situations in which viewpoint alone may be a security consideration."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1911.104,1911.534,There may be.
2013.13-115,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1930.837,1945.08,"Mr. Wilker, do you concede that, looking on this just in a hindsight kind of way, that there is an objective security rationale here, that they are standing at the foot of the alleyway, that you could throw a grenade into the patio area?"
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,1957.497,1979.112,"I think if you -- if the concern was the mouth of the alley and that the riot geared police guarding the mouth of the alley were not sufficient to protect the alley and protect against that kind of incursion, the more simple solution in this case would simply be to move people slightly to the east or west where they had buildings between them and the President."
2013.13-115,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1979.112,1992.279,"The question is, what is -- there are so many different theories floating in this case that I've had a hard time trying to figure out what you want me to decide -- on what theory you want me to decide."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2019.784,2020.299,It's the latter.
2013.13-115,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.299,2022.485,It's the latter.
2013.13-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.867,2051.178,I don't think the government has conceded that.
2013.13-115,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2051.178,2051.475,All right.
2013.13-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.068,2053.096,I don't think they've ever conceded that at all.
2013.13-115,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2053.096,2054.568,Okay.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2119.011,2120.152,Uh-huh.
2013.13-115,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2120.152,2123.759,"Now, it's a long way of focusing you on that question."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2123.759,2131.381,"And so in Iqbal, this Court said to be plausible it has to be something more than possible."
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2170.898,2176.738,"Well, Iqbal says a little bit more than that, not that you just have to allege facts."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2216.222,2234.934,"I think, though, once we meet a certain threshold of plausibility, unless the competing inference is so compelling to make our claim implausible, that it involves at the pleading stage such a great burden that no plaintiff could ever satisfy it."
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2245.569,2246.085,That's what we said in--
2013.13-115,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2246.085,2248.291,"Mr. Wilker, sorry to take you back to this, but in this--"
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2248.291,2248.78,Right.
2013.13-115,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2248.78,2270.232,"--case, do you concede that a reasonable officer, even if not these officers, these officers might have had a terrible motivation, but that a reasonable officer could look at this map and say, look at the distance between the alley and the outdoor patio, you can throw an explosive in there, that seems really bad, let's get these people out of the way?"
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2272.246,2277.402,"Could a reasonable officer have said that, that given the proximity?"
2013.13-115,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2303.449,2318.365,"And have you -- you've conceded that there would be a security interest, in the hypothetical that Justice Kagan raised, that there are -- people are in front of that alley where they could throw a grenade."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2333.563,2334.531,I think there's a distinction.
2013.13-115,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2349.79,2355.18,"I'm not sure I understand that, because it seems to me there either is or isn't a valid security interest."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2377.609,2390.837,"The -- the question is whether proximity alone of a peaceful group of protesters is enough to create a security; and in hindsight, you could look at that and you could conclude that."
2013.13-115,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.038,2398.21,"You say in your complaint,"
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2464.653,2466.059,"--Well, yes and no."
2013.13-115,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2492.048,2497.758,"Well, what about the other situation, which is similar to your case but not exactly similar -- not exactly the same."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2544.889,2548.185,We acknowledge that's not enough under this Court's precedence.
2013.13-115,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2548.185,2549.047,What more do you need?
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2549.047,2554.245,We -- we do need to allege personal participation and intent.
2013.13-115,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2555.37,2556.912,"Well, you -- you plead intent."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2563.678,2569.021,--I don't -- I don't think we'd be in violation of Rule 11.
2013.13-115,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2574.408,2575.564,What more would you need?
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2575.564,2579.437,I think you need other evidence from which you can infer an intent and we've pled other evidence.
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2596.993,2600.616,"--Just to make sure, we're talking about the 15 minutes between--"
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2600.616,2601.71,We're talking about both.
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2601.71,2602.71,--Between when and when?
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2602.71,2609.441,So we're talking about the time the President made the decision and -- and the initial security arrangements were made approximately at 7 o'clock.
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2609.441,2609.687,Right.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2609.687,2618.937,"Then the President sat down at approximately 7:15, and then another 15 minutes elapsed before the decision is made to -- to move the anti-Bush demonstrators."
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2618.937,2621.868,"And the first -- they first cleared the alley, right?"
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2621.868,2622.251,Yes.
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2622.251,2624.876,And then the movement that you're concerned about.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2624.876,2625.234,Right.
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2625.234,2639.523,"Now, doesn't it make sense, just hypothetically, if you're the Secret Service agent and you suddenly have this challenge dropped in your lap at the last minute, you say, okay, here's the thing, the first thing we've got to do is clear the alley, right, because that's right up against where he's standing."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2656.208,2661.235,And we understand that's the competing inference that the government has offered here.
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2667.546,2668.029,But here's where we get back to Iqbal.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2682.954,2690.093,"But we rely on the language elsewhere in Iqbal, which we think has to be read together, which is, plausibility doesn't mean probability."
2013.13-115,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2712.349,2712.879,All right.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2745.196,2745.397,I think so.
2013.13-115,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2745.397,2745.928,All right.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2781.758,2785.163,"Well, I think there has to be some opportunity to develop a factual record."
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2790.52,2791.926,So discovery is your answer.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2808.56,2816.744,I think -- I think the Court would have to permit us to engage in some discovery of the agents regarding are there reports of the events of the evening?
2013.13-115,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2834.94,2836.221,But what about -- what about the--
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2836.221,2841.015,The first thing you'd want -- I say the first thing you'd want to know is whether this was a departure from established policy.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2867.895,2873.175,"--Well, the court -- the trial courts, the district courts have -- also have ample authority to enter protective orders."
2013.13-115,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2901.43,2908.831,What -- then what does happen if a district court does allow discovery of things what the Secret Service thinks are confidential?
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,2933.525,2947.269,I think that ultimately is one remedy and it's a remedy provided for in our system whenever we have an issue in which sensitive information may be involved in connection with a Federal lawsuit.
2013.13-115,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2965.527,2984.473,"There was -- in Judge Berzon's opinion, she seemed to think it was very important that when the President got into the motorcade to leave only one side had access."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,3007.682,3009.604,We have not taken that position.
2013.13-115,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3042.121,3046.668,"The question of mixed motive or improper motive, if we can get back to that for just a minute."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,3097.739,3106.579,"I would suggest to you that Wren is the exception, that Wren in the Fourth Amendment context, it says if there is an objective -- if there is an objective basis, I think that's reflected in Reichle."
2013.13-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3124.589,3125.091,Excuse me.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,3144.954,3145.392,--No.
2013.13-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3146.439,3147.594,"Yeah, I would think so."
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,3155.481,3164.619,"I think for the terms of the First Amendment claim, it wouldn't matter if the circumstances demonstrated and created a basis for that inference of intent."
2013.13-115,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3164.619,3172.803,"Just out of curiosity, was there anything to prevent someone from leaving one these groups and going over to the other group?"

2013.13-115,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3187.625,3192.84,Somebody couldn't have just walked away and taken a circuitous route and gone to the other group?
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,3194.761,3199.838,Is it theoretically possible that they could have taken a large enough circle around there?

2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,3261.767,3268.03,We would seek certain limited discovery with respect to those incidents to see if they bear out the allegations that we have made.
2013.13-115,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3268.03,3277.447,"The same range of things that we talked about earlier: Interrogatories, requests for production, discovery, with respect, not just to your case, but to the 12 others?"
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,3277.447,3285.335,"To the extent that the Secret Service denies that these allegations or that these officers deny these allegations in an answer, which we haven't yet seen--"
2013.13-115,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3285.335,3288.662,You wouldn't seek limited discovery; you would see unlimited discovery.
2013.13-115,1,62296,steven_m_wilker,,3291.426,3297.518,"--I'm not sure I would seek unlimited discovery, because then I might be overburdened with material that would have no relevance to the case."

2013.13-115,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3357.211,3359.101,Could I just clarify a factual matter.
