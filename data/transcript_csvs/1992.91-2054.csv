1992.91-2054,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.188,"We'll hear argument now in Number 91-2054, the United States Department of Justice v. Vincent James Landano."
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,11.399,14.612,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-2054,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,102.321,106.271,"What types of sources are you referring to again, Mr. Daly?"
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,106.271,108.444,"--The categories are indeed broad, Your Honor."
1992.91-2054,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,123.555,141.755,So your contention is that it should be enough to invoke exemption 7 if the FBI shows that the statement made by a particular individual was made to an FBI agent investigating a crime.
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,141.755,143.538,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-2054,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,143.538,157.105,"And that would be true even, for example, if the FBI were contacting some State authority in another State to determine somebody's whereabouts, or their criminal record, or anything of that kind."
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,157.105,159.377,"Very much so, Justice O'Connor, because as the--"
1992.91-2054,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,159.377,163.369,Even though you wouldn't normally think that would be considered confidential.
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,163.369,175.898,"--I would beg to disagree, Justice O'Connor, because as the declaration in the present case indicates, there is a particular tradition of confidentiality in the sort of information exchanged between law enforcement agencies."
1992.91-2054,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.818,194.98,Even as to routine information that's a matter of public record in that State.
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,194.98,199.734,"Well, something like arrest records--"
1992.91-2054,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.734,209.131,It just strikes me that there could well be people who talk to the FBI who don't have that expectation.
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,209.131,231.414,"--Well, I think, Justice O'Connor, what's important is not necessarily the subjective expectation of each individual, and the problem, as we've pointed out, is that to base the rule on the content of the information raises very problematic issues, because certainly when people are contacted, they... what they know for sure is they're talking to an FBI agent about a matter of criminal law."
1992.91-2054,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,250.598,257.781,"Well, perhaps the circumstances of a particular investigation would certainly justify the assumption in some cases."
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,274.213,279.937,"--Well, I think the important point, Justice O'Connor, is that we need a starting point for this analysis."
1992.91-2054,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.622,319.551,"Well, I mean if you can determine from the particular circumstances that there is a likelihood of the presumption of confidentiality, that's one thing, but I wonder if it should be applied across the board?"
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,319.551,330.478,"Well, Your Honor, I think the main circumstance that we do know is that we know that someone... say, an individual... has provided information to the FBI in the course of a criminal investigation."
1992.91-2054,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,338.075,351.512,Does the... is it a practice at the FBI for any kind of notation to be put in the file in connection with each witness interview as to whether it's confidential or not--
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,351.512,352.503,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1992.91-2054,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,352.503,353.735,--Or whether there's been any assurance?
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,353.735,356.977,"No, Justice O'Connor, and that is one of the key problems here."
1992.91-2054,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,356.977,358.377,But I guess you could do that.
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,358.377,361.539,It potentially could be done prospectively.
1992.91-2054,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,411.102,422.829,"Well, how about having to show just the general circumstances surrounding the situation?"
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,424.782,445.865,"I think part of the problem that we have with the respondent's view and with the view of the court of appeals is that they've never told us exactly what circumstances they want to hear, and frankly we have to question how useful the information would be, if one is talking about the physical circumstances... there was no one else in the room."
1992.91-2054,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,447.065,449.546,"--Well, how about the nature of the crime--"
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,449.546,450.498,The nature--
1992.91-2054,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,450.498,453.05,--And the witness' relation to it?
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,453.05,477.336,"--That is something that we will sometimes be able to tell from the face of the documents, but there again, I think one of the keys which we discuss in our brief is the fact that Congress was aware that... what needs reliable protection for sources, and in our view the language of the statute gives great flexibility in this regard."
1992.91-2054,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.267,478.828,"Well, on that point--"
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,505.793,507.736,"--No, not really, Justice Scalia."
1992.91-2054,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,532.721,535.332,You do not treat them as privileged.
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,535.332,540.138,"--No, we do not, because the rationale that we're talking about here just doesn't apply to those kinds of sources."
1992.91-2054,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.058,551.164,"Wiretaps... wiretaps is not provided in confidence, so if you wiretap me that becomes public--"
1992.91-2054,0,29973,john_f_daly,,551.164,552.917,--It wouldn't nec--
1992.91-2054,1,37204,neil_marc_mullin,,1762.426,1766.41,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-2054,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.119,1798.82,Call it the what?
1992.91-2054,1,37204,neil_marc_mullin,,1798.82,1799.571,The setting.
1992.91-2054,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1927.694,1937.34,And your point is that that shows that there was no assurance of... but they couldn't give an assurance of confidentiality that they wouldn't be compelled to disclose some matters in the course of--
1992.91-2054,1,37204,neil_marc_mullin,,1937.34,1937.851,--Exactly.
1992.91-2054,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1937.851,1942.534,"--Well then, there's no such thing as an assurance of confidentiality if you insist that it be absolute."
1992.91-2054,1,37204,neil_marc_mullin,,1942.534,1944.366,"No, I don't insist that it be absolute, Your Honor."
1992.91-2054,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1944.366,1947.128,"Well, this is in the course of litigation that they turned it over."
1992.91-2054,1,37204,neil_marc_mullin,,1952.481,1954.251,"I think... yes, that's right."
1992.91-2054,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1967.281,1971.655,"Well, I mean, people tell me things sometimes, and say keep it confidential, and I often tell my wife."
1992.91-2054,1,37204,neil_marc_mullin,,1974.297,1974.888,Exactly.
1992.91-2054,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1974.888,1976.086,"--You know, but I don't blab it around."
1992.91-2054,1,37204,neil_marc_mullin,,1976.086,1991.117,"And if I... Your Honor, and if I'm a source, and I tell the FBI to maintain confidentiality, what I mean is, you can tell law enforcement people as needed, but please, don't tell the people over there that want to kill me or harass me."
1992.91-2054,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.971,2035.295,"Why couldn't they use the word, anonymous, then, rather than confidential?"
1992.91-2054,1,37204,neil_marc_mullin,,2035.295,2042.929,"They used the word, ""confidential"" in order to broaden the category from ""informer"", which was in the original draft."
1992.91-2054,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2137.942,2141.654,"Well, we're talking, I guess, about two different suppositions."
1992.91-2054,1,37204,neil_marc_mullin,,2155.202,2165.7,"Well, there's great difficulty in evaluating, because the FBI has not provided this Court, or Congress for that matter, with a record."
1992.91-2054,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2244.722,2263.204,"Well, Mr. Mullin, it seems to me the Third Circuit went pretty far in requiring case-specific proof here, and I'm just wondering if a considerably lesser evidentiary showing wouldn't suffice."
1992.91-2054,1,37204,neil_marc_mullin,,2275.911,2276.421,Sure.
1992.91-2054,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2277.493,2284.679,Do you defend the precise holding of the Third Circuit here on its requirements?
1992.91-2054,1,37204,neil_marc_mullin,,2284.679,2288.48,--I am burdened by the formulation used by the Third Circuit.
1992.91-2054,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2292.884,2293.295,Yes.
1992.91-2054,1,37204,neil_marc_mullin,,2302.578,2319.912,"--I think what's happened here, Your Honor, is that because this presumption took hold throughout the circuits actually much later than might have been suggested in the brief of the FBI, the development of the common law, if you will, of exemption 7, has been truncated."
1992.91-2054,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2360.748,2364.77,But how would one know all that just from a record of the interview?
1992.91-2054,1,37204,neil_marc_mullin,,2364.77,2371.234,"Well, I think the FBI should tell us, or tell Congress what is in its records."
1992.91-2054,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2374.156,2375.538,"Well, you say tell Congress."
1992.91-2054,1,37204,neil_marc_mullin,,2378.731,2380.2,"--Your Honor, I hope it doesn't come to that."
1992.91-2054,2,29973,john_f_daly,,3062.206,3064.429,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-2054,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3144.339,3151.544,"Could I ask you, let's just assume that all that was involved here was how you should operate in the future."
1992.91-2054,2,29973,john_f_daly,,3166.614,3171.607,"I think that could be a significant burden, because it would change the way the FBI does business, and--"
1992.91-2054,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3171.607,3173.758,"Well, it may be, but what would be burdensome about it?"
1992.91-2054,2,29973,john_f_daly,,3173.758,3186.898,"--The... to be honest, Justice White, I'm not prepared today to talk about how that would involve day-to-day law enforcement activities, because that's an issue... that's... it's a legislative issue."
1992.91-2054,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.981,3195.041,"Well, that's hardly an answer to my question."
1992.91-2054,2,29973,john_f_daly,,3197.375,3201.376,"--Well, the FBI has assured me that it would indeed change the way that they do business."
1992.91-2054,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3210.913,3215.155,It might make the witness shut up if you told him what he said was confidential.
1992.91-2054,2,29973,john_f_daly,,3215.155,3218.427,"--It's possible, and it would do nothing for our concerns about existing records."
1992.91-2054,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3219.729,3220.5,"Thank you, Mr. Daly."
