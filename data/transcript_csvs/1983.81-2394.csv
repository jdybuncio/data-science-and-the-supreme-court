1983.81-2394,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.168,We'll hear arguments next in Westinghouse Electric against Tully.
1983.81-2394,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,52.899,56.741,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.81-2394,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,412.113,423.18,"Mr. Dodyk, what you're saying is basically that the federal Constitution requires the credit New York extends you to be larger than it was calculated to be under the statute."
1983.81-2394,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,423.18,424.79,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.81-2394,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,424.79,440.08,"I suppose you could win on that point and still be worse off financially if the case went back to the New York Court of Appeals after reversing, and the New York Court of Appeals decided that the New York legislature never would have enacted the credit at all if it knew that this was going to be the result."
1983.81-2394,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,440.08,446.385,"Well, I guess in that case my client, Westinghouse, would be a very altruistic enforcer of constitutional principle."
1983.81-2394,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,456.243,457.943,If you win.
1983.81-2394,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,457.943,460.004,"Yes, of course."
1983.81-2394,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,530.829,538.095,"Let me ask right there, the shipments that originated in New York, were all of them made in interstate commerce?"
1983.81-2394,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,538.095,539.515,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.81-2394,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,539.515,545.97,So then it's really not a discrimination against interstate commerce; it's a discrimination between two kinds of interstate commerce.
1983.81-2394,0,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,545.97,547.893,In a sense that is true.
1983.81-2394,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1234.263,1237.605,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.81-2394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1427.797,1429.86,"Well, isn't that upside down, though, really?"
1983.81-2394,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1445.511,1445.92,No.
1983.81-2394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1447.242,1451.883,"Well, anyway... anyway your credit would have applied to all the DISC income, wouldn't it?"
1983.81-2394,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1451.883,1452.394,"--Well, no, no."
1983.81-2394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1458.188,1458.558,That's what I said.
1983.81-2394,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1459.51,1460.291,"--Well, that's--"
1983.81-2394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1460.291,1464.713,So you would have collected less tax if all of the DISC income had been from New York.
1983.81-2394,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1464.713,1466.353,"--Well, the objective--"
1983.81-2394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.353,1467.104,Wouldn't... wouldn't you?
1983.81-2394,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1467.104,1468.566,--I think probably so.
1983.81-2394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.665,1470.306,"Well, probably."
1983.81-2394,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1471.628,1478.712,"--The objective of the credit is to some degree track the credit that's being given by the federal government, but that--"
1983.81-2394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1478.712,1490.242,"It sounds peculiar... it sounds peculiar that your credit is trying to identify the income attributable to New York so you can tax it, when in fact you find out the income attributable to New York, and you don't tax it."
1983.81-2394,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1491.772,1495.655,"--Well, we give it a lesser rate, but I don't see what's peculiar about that."
1983.81-2394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1496.915,1501.658,"Well, usually when you identify income as originating in the state, that's when you tax it."
1983.81-2394,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1501.658,1505.57,"--But we're only taxing income in the state in the first place, Your Honor."
1983.81-2394,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1505.57,1506.631,"Oh, I understand that."
1983.81-2394,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1506.631,1519.951,"And the question then is do we have to tax the DISC income at the same rate as all other New York income, and that's all that the division here involves."
1983.81-2394,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1687.771,1714.197,"While you're pausing, is it correct that the purpose of the credit is to make the... or to provide a motive for these special export companies to have as much business originate in New York as possible?"
1983.81-2394,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1714.197,1716.658,"Yes, absolutely."
1983.81-2394,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1716.658,1717.6,"In other words, the purpose--"
1983.81-2394,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1717.6,1720.712,Or at least to not lose any more business than necessary.
1983.81-2394,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1720.712,1727.795,--The purpose is to have a direct impact on the way goods are shipped overseas.
1983.81-2394,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1727.795,1733.71,"Well, in terms of the goods that are shipped, Your Honor--"
1983.81-2394,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1733.71,1737.763,"Well, at least that the business transactions--"
1983.81-2394,1,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1737.763,1748.929,"--It's a question of really of where... I would say it's a question of where Westinghouse does it business, because the question isn't really where it is shipped."
1983.81-2394,2,37850,paul_m_dodyk,,2480.288,2483.2,"Just a moment, Your Honor."
1983.81-2394,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2533.125,2533.576,"Thank you, gentlemen."
