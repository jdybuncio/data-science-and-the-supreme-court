2019.18-328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.28,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-328, Rotkiske versus Klemm. Mr. Gant."
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,7.28,17.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: While this case is about the FDCPA, it is also fundamentally about the relationship between this Court and Congress."
2019.18-328,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,190.4,201.68,"Mr. Gant, you keep saying fraud and self-concealing as if they're alternative rules."
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,228.6,229.48,"Well, not --"
2019.18-328,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,229.48,244.6,"-- that -- that -- that every case, every federal statute inherently says for whatever reason, if you didn't discover the fraud, equity could let you have a discovery rule?"
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,244.6,245.28,No.
2019.18-328,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,253.96,256.08,I call it the self-concealing rule.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,264.44,264.68,I --
2019.18-328,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,264.68,265.76,-- stating that rule?
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,265.76,266.2,-- I think so.
2019.18-328,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,267.92,268.16,All right.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,328.56,357.04,"This is as good a time as any to get to an important issue here, which is the confusion -- understanding the relationship between what I'm calling the common law discovery rule, the Bailey/Holmberg rule, and the refrain I was using of -- of fraud or concealment comes from TRW directly, which is why I was using it but not intending to create a different doctrine. All of the parties here and the scholars' amicus brief that was submitted all agree that there has been at times confusing use of terminology."
2019.18-328,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,535.48,535.8,Is the --
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,535.8,536.08,"Here, what --"
2019.18-328,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,536.08,541.12,-- discovery -- I'm sorry to interrupt -- is the discovery rule equitable?
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,541.12,542.56,I believe it is.
2019.18-328,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,551.0,567.8,"I grant you that. So the discovery rule could be part of a statute, but, if it's not part of a statute, there exists, I think you're saying, an equitable discovery rule as well that is akin to but maybe not the same as equitable tolling. Is that your argument?"
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,567.8,569.68,"Yes to the last part of that, that equitable --"
2019.18-328,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,569.68,572.04,Can you just give me real clear on the answer?
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,572.04,572.32,Yes.
2019.18-328,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,572.32,574.72,"Because clarity, we do need clarity."
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,574.72,588.28,"I -- I will do my best and I -- I agree that that's useful for everybody. There's a distinction between statutory discovery rule, obviously, and the common law discovery rule. The statutory discovery rule is employed by Congress from time to time."
2019.18-328,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,630.72,635.04,"When you use common law discovery, is that equivalent to equitable discovery?"
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,635.04,668.64,"I -- I think it's the -- the doctrine that originated in equity, but also applied to cases of law, the Court said that back in Bailey, the doctrine had its origins in equity, applied to law, and it is applied, and I -- and here is where I think that it -- that it's both equitable in origins and I think in nature, but -- but also fundamentally an exercise in statutory interpretation, because the touchstone is whether or not intended -- Congress intended to foreclose or permit the application of the common law doctrine to the statute in the absence of some express indication."
2019.18-328,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,668.64,685.56,"Well, if -- if you are arguing an across-the-board discovery rule applies to the FDCPA, I think that TRW weighs very heavily against you."
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,708.48,711.28,"Justice Ginsburg, we -- we mean the latter."
2019.18-328,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,711.76,714.4,Before you -- except the fraud exception.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,720.76,735.04,"And -- and it clearly does. So, just to be clear, we're -- we're not arguing that every FDCPA action is timely so long as the plaintiff was unaware."
2019.18-328,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,753.6,771.64,"Is it -- it's not a violation -- what -- what happened here serving the debtor at an address that was not the debtor's, that's not a violation of the FDCPA, is it?"
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,771.64,777.68,"Unto itself it might not be, but we have a very different circumstance in this case."
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,848.36,854.76,"That isn't the issue. I don't think the issue is, is your basic claim a claim of fraud."
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,859.64,859.96,Yes.
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,860.84,876.6,"Have you ever heard of a case brought under this where the fraud -- you -- I mean, the cases that were brought where somebody said give me your land and I will, because the land has gold or something on it, that was a lie, so buy my land, it has gold on it, and they sell the land and it doesn't have gold on it."
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,906.4,906.8,Yes.
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,907.12,921.24,And what is the -- what is the case that says a process server who fills in the wrong name and fools the judge is -- the person who hired the process server is -- has committed common law fraud?
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,921.24,931.72,"Well, it's not -- with respect, Justice Breyer, it's not just the process server and -- and the allegations go further than an innocent mistake. And the other side argues that this was an innocent mistake."
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,931.72,940.2,I'm asking you what here brings your case within the rubric of common law fraud.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,950.64,951.64,Right.
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,951.64,953.24,That's what I want to know.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,953.24,963.16,"And our allegation is that the -- the -- the knowing misrepresentation on the affidavit of service or reckless representation, we cite to laws like --"
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,963.16,969.64,"Who -- who represented, who writes the representation? The process server or the -- your -- your -- or the other person?"
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,969.64,974.12,The process server signs -- signs under -- effectively under penalty of perjury --
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,974.12,974.2,Yeah.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,974.2,976.12,-- that the representations are true.
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,977.16,979.04,And who makes the representations?
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,979.04,980.24,The process server makes the representation.
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,980.24,981.8,"Oh, so is your client the process server?"
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,981.8,981.84,No.
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,983.28,984.48,Is that their client?
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,984.48,985.12,It -- it is not.
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1002.56,1004.2,"No, I know the latter part."
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1015.8,1016.08,Yes.
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1016.08,1026.0,Now the closest case that you have found that calls that activity common law fraud is?
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1026.0,1027.72,"We didn't look for a specific case, Your Honor."
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1027.72,1030.32,"Oh, you didn't because it's so obvious that it's common law fraud?"
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1030.32,1036.68,"Well, if -- if -- you may not find this satisfactory, but we weren't the only ones here who thought that this constituted fraud."
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1039.92,1043.24,"No, no, I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm just trying to find out for myself."
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1046.2,1046.6,Right.
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1052.36,1053.36,Akin to.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1066.04,1068.4,"I don't know whether it's wrong because I haven't read it, so I will not --"
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1068.4,1100.96,"Well, it's a very good list of all these different doctrines, equitable estoppel, equitable this, and there are like six of them or something, and one of them, the thing that you're talking about now, is a special thing called -- what's it called? Undiscovered fraud. I thought an element of that is that the basic underlying thing is common law fraud. And that's what I'm trying to investigate now. But, if you have nothing more to say, I have nothing more --"
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1100.96,1101.2,I -- I --
2019.18-328,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1101.2,1103.56,"-- to say because, if I knew more about it, I wouldn't ask the question."
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1103.56,1105.92,I -- I don't have a case. I wish I did.
2019.18-328,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1145.24,1149.56,But you said -- you said the statement was the process server.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1170.32,1184.16,"The -- the process server -- and I think it's helpful to understand for context here, there was an original suit that was withdrawn which also had a defective affidavit of service and then a subsequent one that led to the default judgment at issue here. It was the same process --"
2019.18-328,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1184.16,1193.4,But it was still -- the prosecutor -- the process server was just following the directions of the person who -- who engaged the process server.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1193.4,1196.92,"Well, they were certainly following the direction to serve process."
2019.18-328,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1236.64,1237.52,Mr. Gant.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1237.52,1238.04,Yes.
2019.18-328,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1238.04,1244.64,I -- I note it is terribly confusing because of the confusion of the use of terms.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1250.24,1250.88,Yes.
2019.18-328,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1250.88,1255.16,It's not the violation at issue that's self-concealing.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1262.0,1262.2,Yeah.
2019.18-328,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1262.2,1263.56,Isn't that your -- your point?
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1263.56,1264.16,Yes.
2019.18-328,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1272.0,1272.2,Right.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1272.2,1280.84,"-- which it effectively is here under our view under subsections (e) and (f), or it can be separate and apart, in addition to the elements of the offense."
2019.18-328,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1353.0,1355.36,You've referred to remand a few times.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1376.72,1378.96,"I'm sorry, what wasn't raised in the Third Circuit?"
2019.18-328,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1378.96,1380.88,Equitable -- equitable discovery.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1380.88,1387.76,It is true that equitable tolling per se was not addressed in the Third Circuit.
2019.18-328,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1393.12,1397.88,"But I think what they're saying -- and this may not be a winning argument, but I just want to get your response to it."
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1416.56,1416.76,Right.
2019.18-328,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1416.76,1419.2,Your response to that? Is that wrong?
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1419.2,1449.32,"Under -- they are wrong in their understanding of the operation of the two words ""violation occurred"" and its effect on whether the common law discovery rule applies. We say that that language is inconclusive with respect to the question of whether or not Congress intended to permit or preclude the application of the common law discovery rule, and we then urge the Court to apply traditional tools of statutory interpretation, to look to the statute's purpose to eliminate these Debt Collection Practice Act practices that are prohibited, the structure of the statute."
2019.18-328,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1457.84,1476.24,"And what about your petition in this Court? Because, as I read your petition in this Court, it was more about the general statutory interpretation question, whether there is a discovery rule that applies generally in this statute, than it is about whether certain equitable exceptions might continue to exist."
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1476.24,1476.76,Yes.
2019.18-328,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1485.56,1487.08,"Well, but, again, what did that mean?"
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1487.08,1488.72,"Well, I think --"
2019.18-328,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1488.72,1498.88,"As I read the petition, it really did not address whether there was an equitable exception of -- of -- of the -- of the kind that the Third Circuit might have thought had been waived."
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1498.88,1501.36,"Well, that certainly wasn't how it was intended."
2019.18-328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1510.4,1510.8,Sure.
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1510.8,1524.4,"What was intended with the petition was to raise the question precisely as I attempted to present it this morning, which is whether or not Congress intended to permit or foreclose the application of the common law discovery rule to the statute."
2019.18-328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1528.68,1530.68,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.18-328,0,62840,scott_e_gant,,1530.68,1531.72,Thank you.
2019.18-328,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1531.72,1539.32,Mr. Dvoretzky.
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1539.32,1547.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Gant and I agree that this case is about the relationship between this Court and Congress."
2019.18-328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1588.12,1593.72,Is your position simply -- did I let you finish?
2019.18-328,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1593.72,1597.12,"I -- I think you still have a little time left, don't you?"
2019.18-328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1597.12,1598.16,"Oh, sorry."
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1598.16,1606.88,"Like Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan, I understand the question presented here to be whether an across-the-board discovery rule applies to the FDCPA."
2019.18-328,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1698.52,1712.2,"But I thought -- but I thought that the -- Justice Scalia and my opinion in TRW spoke about the discovery rule, not equitable tolling, exception to the discovery."
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1717.2,1724.12,"Well, I think what TRW is talking about was that the discovery rule might apply to fraud statutes."
2019.18-328,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1766.0,1766.16,But --
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1766.16,1766.96,-- on a particular fact.
2019.18-328,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1766.96,1784.08,"-- I mean, there might be variants of equitable tolling, mightn't there? I mean, one -- one variant is there were extraordinary circumstances, an earthquake hit, and so I couldn't file this suit in time, and so you should toll the statute of limitations until I can."
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1804.28,1813.8,"I agree that they would be under the same category of equitable relief because, in both situations, what a court would be doing is not applying the language that Congress wrote."
2019.18-328,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1830.12,1830.56,And is your --
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1830.56,1831.12,-- rather than an --
2019.18-328,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1831.12,1841.6,"-- and is your view that those are foreclosed by this statute, or is your view simply that those arguments were waived and this case has nothing to do about them -- with them?"
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1841.6,1844.28,Our argument is that those arguments were waived.
2019.18-328,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1860.28,1860.68,So you're --
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1860.68,1860.88,Not --
2019.18-328,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1860.88,1868.04,-- not taking a position one way or the other about whether those equitable defenses can be raised?
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1868.04,1871.48,I -- I don't think that is presented by this -- by this case.
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1878.44,1879.0,But that's --
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1879.0,1879.96,-- not part of this case.
2019.18-328,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1879.96,1903.16,"So -- so it's an open question, if you have a typical -- I don't know if it's typical -- but equitable tolling situation, the hurricane, you know, whatever, the -- even the courthouse is closed sort of thing, even though you're dealing with a statute of the sort you have here, that those claims could certainly be raised? Or at least you think it's an open question?"
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1903.16,1905.88,We are not arguing that that's foreclosed by this statute.
2019.18-328,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1908.68,1908.76,So --
2019.18-328,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1908.76,1918.64,"And, similarly, the Bailey kind of equitable rule? You're also saying where -- you're -- you're also saying that you're just not saying? (Laughter.)"
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1918.64,1924.64,"We're saying that it wasn't preserved and, therefore, is not properly before this Court at this stage."
2019.18-328,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1940.04,1950.88,"But I suppose what you have to maintain, though, is that equitable tolling has a higher or different threshold than simply a discovery rule?"
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1950.88,1957.4,And -- and that is actually -- I said I had four reasons why I think the discovery rule and equitable tolling are different doctrines.
2019.18-328,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1988.08,1997.96,"Should -- look, my recollection of Cada and so forth, one, the statute might provide for tolling."
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2074.12,2074.8,No.
2019.18-328,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2095.4,2096.08,Yes.
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2096.08,2107.84,"And the only question presented in the cert petition, set aside even what happened in the Third Circuit, in the cert petition here is the question of statutory interpretation. The cert petition doesn't cite -- Bailey doesn't mention fraud."
2019.18-328,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2121.4,2121.84,But --
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2121.84,2123.04,And the second point --
2019.18-328,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2123.04,2167.44,"-- but if we don't agree with you that this is under the rubric of equitable tolling, I mean, I thought Justice Scalia was very clear when he said the discovery rule as a general matter doesn't toll when your statute of limitation triggered by the -- what was the occurrence -- of the violation, but, he said, there is an exception to the non-application of the discovery rule for fraud. We have recognized historical -- historical exception for cases based on fraud."
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2167.44,2178.4,"Justice Ginsburg, the Court -- and it pains me to say this -- Justice Scalia, were not -- have not always been precise in their use of this terminology, but where it has mattered --"
2019.18-328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2178.4,2181.92,He's turning over in his grave hearing that. (Laughter.)
2019.18-328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2181.92,2184.6,Battle wordsmith.
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2184.6,2203.84,"Where it has mattered, where it has been dispositive of an issue, such as in ANZ, the Court has been careful to distinguish between equitable doctrines, equitable tolling, and the discovery rule. And that is -- that is really the only way to read these cases, Bailey and Holmberg and Exploration Co."
2019.18-328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2268.36,2269.12,"Well, how --"
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2269.12,2270.28,Do you really think that? I'm --
2019.18-328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2270.28,2271.32,If a patent --
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2271.32,2271.72,Go ahead.
2019.18-328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2271.72,2293.12,"-- issued, which is like what a violation -- when a violation occurs, we still apply the equitable doctrine, the concealment doctrine in Exploration, even though the languages are almost identical. So how do you separate Exploration from here?"
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2293.12,2320.32,"Because I think what the Court was doing in Exploration Co. is best understood as equitable tolling, not as reading that language about the patent issuing to mean patent issuing or is discovered. This -- this goes to the fundamental question of what is the Court doing? Is it interpreting the language like ""patent issued"" or ""violation occurred"" to mean something other than what it says, or is it exercising the Court's inherent equitable power to override what the language says? And that --"
2019.18-328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2320.32,2345.96,So are you saying there's no self-concealing fraud whatsoever? That the very act that you do -- this is what they're claiming -- the very act that they -- that you are alleged to have done doesn't -- wouldn't qualify? Assuming -- and I know that you take issue with whether you really knew that was his address or not and whether the lawyer just made a mistake in not seeing his regular files.
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2379.16,2382.0,I don't think that that is common law self-concealing fraud.
2019.18-328,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2404.36,2407.44,Not to the defendant but to the court.
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2421.92,2442.0,"Well, perhaps it shouldn't if that's what's actually alleged and if it's dealt with as equitable tolling rather than -- rather than reading language like ""violation occurs"" to trigger the limitations period upon anything other than when the violation occurs. With -- with respect to this case, though, it's not just the waiver in this Court and in the Third Circuit."
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2491.2,2491.96,Can I make sure --
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2491.96,2492.08,The --
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2492.08,2501.32,"-- I have the terminology correct -- sorry -- on a couple of the legal points? So, on the discovery rule, there's a discovery rule linked to fraud, as Justice Ginsburg said."
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2523.44,2524.72,I think that would be a good opinion.
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2524.72,2525.56,Okay.
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2552.48,2556.08,That -- so that's actually not the argument that I am intending to make.
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2556.08,2556.6,Okay.
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2556.6,2566.2,I don't think that Congress needs to expressly say no discovery rule in order to foreclose the discovery rule. If you had more ambiguous --
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2566.2,2566.24,Well --
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2566.24,2566.48,-- language --
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2566.48,2566.6,-- I --
2019.18-328,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2566.6,2567.36,In order to foreclose --
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2567.36,2568.48,-- I know you're not saying that --
2019.18-328,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2568.48,2570.4,-- an equitable doctrine.
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2573.68,2580.08,"But even for the statutory discovery rule, I don't think Congress has to expressly foreclose a statutory discovery rule."
2019.18-328,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2580.08,2580.88,"Oh, sorry."
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2580.88,2583.28,"In -- in a situation where, let's say, you had language like --"
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2583.28,2583.32,Yeah.
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2585.16,2585.4,Oh.
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2585.4,2587.56,Okay? So just assume I'm with you.
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2587.56,2588.56,Okay.
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2588.56,2594.64,"But there still exists, I think you just said, a kind of equitable discovery rule unless Congress has displaced that."
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2605.84,2617.36,"I -- I agree, and -- and the only tweak that I would make to, I think, the way that you've formulated all of that, I view the equitable discovery rule just as a species of equitable tolling."
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2617.36,2617.96,Got it.
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2617.96,2626.72,"If, like Judge Posner, you want to list out all seven different kinds of equitable doctrines that allow a court to override what Congress has written, that would be one of them."
2019.18-328,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2653.12,2653.44,So I -- I --
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2653.44,2654.36,None of those are presented.
2019.18-328,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2654.36,2677.6,"-- I think that that distinction is helpful, but I want to push back on it a little because it's all statutory interpretation, isn't it? I mean, as long as we understand that Congress could say, ""and no equitable doctrines shall apply either,"" then, in some sense, we're doing statutory interpretation even when we say that Congress didn't displace statute -- equitable doctrines, aren't we?"
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2677.6,2677.96,Sure.
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2704.6,2704.8,You'd need a --
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2704.8,2707.88,-- in order to foreclose that if we're in the equitable bucket.
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2707.88,2712.88,-- you'd need something akin to a plain statement to get rid of the equitable doctrines in the statute.
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2717.12,2719.96,Something clearer. This Court has often looked to the sort of two-part --
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2719.96,2720.64,Because they're --
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2720.64,2721.08,-- structure --
2019.18-328,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2721.08,2725.04,"-- equitable, so we're not going to assume silence displaces these equitable doctrines, right?"
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2725.04,2725.64,Correct.
2019.18-328,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2743.0,2743.88,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.18-328,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2743.88,2744.12,Thank you.
2019.18-328,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2744.12,2758.72,Mr. Bond.
2019.18-328,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2758.72,2777.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question on which this Court granted review and the only question the Third Circuit decided is whether the FDCPA should be interpreted to impose a statute-wide rule that the limitations period does not begin to run until a violation is discovered."
2019.18-328,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2965.16,2990.88,"Do you think that that equitable principle is the same as the way the Court has defined equitable tolling, meaning we have very -- we have very strict construction under equitable tolling and certain elements to it. Do you think the same apply more broadly to all the equitable principles, or is it a separate principle all together?"
2019.18-328,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,2990.88,2995.92,So our -- our view -- and I'm not sure anything turns on it here -- is that it's a subset of that broader equitable principle.
2019.18-328,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3083.84,3084.72,I have one. (Laughter.)
2019.18-328,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3084.72,3095.2,"Why does it matter that it is a fraud claim, rather than, whatever the claim is, fraud has been used to prevent the plaintiff from noticing it?"
2019.18-328,2,62924,jonathan_c_bond,,3095.2,3115.08,"So, if you understand Bailey as an application of more general equitable principles that grant relief not just from fraud but from fraudulent concealment and other kinds of extraordinary circumstances, like the earthquake, then we don't think it does matter. Bailey, I think, is best understood as applying those general principles in the particular context that was recurring at the time of fraud claims. So, if you understand it that way, there's no rigid boundary."
2019.18-328,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3157.44,3160.12,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Gant."
2019.18-328,3,62840,scott_e_gant,,3160.12,3196.92,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Perhaps ambitiously I will try and quickly make five points that I hope address some of the questions raised by the Court this morning. First, there's no question that this Court, although, when Bailey and Holmberg were decided, didn't use the label discovery rule. In more recent cases, like Merck and Gabelli, has clearly identified a discovery rule which I think under the best reading is separate from equitable tolling. The second point is that there's an argument advanced in the briefs and today by both counsel for the Respondent of the United States that the issue is whether a statute is all or nothing."
2019.18-328,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3438.52,3439.68,"Thank you, counsel."
