1983.82-849,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.067,We will hear arguments first this morning in United States against Mendoza.
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,13.261,16.923,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-849,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,161.327,169.863,Did the Act require the United States to send examiners outside the continental limits for this purpose?
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,169.863,175.796,Section 702 contemplated that naturalizations would take place overseas.
1983.82-849,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,175.796,181.07,"And you maintain that it was required that the United States do that under the Act, not permitted but required?"
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,181.07,192.38,"Yes, although Section 705 of the Act gave the Attorney General tremendous discretion in how to implement the Act, and this Court held that in Hibi."
1983.82-849,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,352.913,360.73,"Mr. Geller, why did the Government remove its examiners from the Philippines in '46?"
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,360.73,371.676,The examiners were removed at the end of 1946 because by its terms Sections 701 and 702 expired and therefore there was no further statutory authority after December.
1983.82-849,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,371.676,387.007,"What role, if any, did the position of the Philippine leadership, the government, have to do with this interruption of service?"
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,387.007,398.034,"Well, the naturalization examiner was withdrawn for the nine-month period between October 1945 and August 1946 because of the objections of the Philippine Government."
1983.82-849,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,578.341,580.511,"Mr. Geller, can I interrupt?"
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,586.645,587.557,That's correct.
1983.82-849,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.557,592.109,"Can you tell us, just out of curiosity, how many people are in the respective categories?"
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,592.109,595.281,In the 68 Filipinos case?
1983.82-849,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,595.281,596.082,"Well, I know that."
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,603.506,606.32,"Well, it's hard to make an accurate assessment."
1983.82-849,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,632.795,638.431,But then the Commissioner Castillo testified that there were only about 100 actually.
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,638.431,657.432,"--Only about 100 had applied, although in part the concern was not so much with the number who had applied for relief under Sections 701 and 702, but with the fact that if these people became citizens then all of their relatives would be entitled to a number of preferences under the immigration laws."
1983.82-849,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,679.177,681.688,I wasn't questioning the wisdom of the Government's decision.
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,681.688,682.299,Yes.
1983.82-849,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.299,688.824,"I was just curious if we knew, as between category one and category two, what the relative sizes of the categories were."
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,688.824,690.984,"Oh, category two is much, much larger than category one."
1983.82-849,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,833.048,844.024,"Mr. Geller, when you use the term ""collateral estoppel"" you mean the doctrine that goes beyond res judicata."
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,844.024,845.516,"Yes, issue preclusion."
1983.82-849,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,845.516,847.347,Issue preclusion.
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,865.558,873.654,"Yes, although in Montana the Court essentially said, using the Moser terminology, that the two lawsuits involved the same demand."
1983.82-849,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,891.316,894.777,"Well then, why wasn't it res judicata in Montana, if you're right?"
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,894.777,896.398,I think it was in a sense res judicata.
1983.82-849,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,928.869,932.802,"Well, when you refer to that, what the Attorney General had done, do you mean his withdrawing--"
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,932.802,933.283,--Yes.
1983.82-849,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,933.283,934.813,--the examiners for nine months?
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,934.813,936.495,"Yes, yes."
1983.82-849,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1016.178,1024.465,"Mr. Geller, do you think Montana versus the United States was correctly decided?"
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1024.465,1030.909,"I think it probably was a correct application of the principles that we rely on here, because--"
1983.82-849,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1030.909,1039.074,"In looking at your brief, it appeared that you might be asking us to make some modifications in that."
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1039.074,1040.364,"--No, I don't believe so, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-849,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1058.998,1064.41,"Well, you can still accept the principles in Montana and disagree with the result."
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1064.41,1068.803,"Well, the Government did argue for a different result in Montana, Justice White."
1983.82-849,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.499,1130.404,As distinct from a res judicata situation?
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1130.404,1130.945,Yes.
1983.82-849,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1130.945,1132.645,You would certainly be precluded from--
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1132.645,1133.486,"We don't challenge, yes."
1983.82-849,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1133.486,1138.499,--raising legal issues that might have been raised in the first court.
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1138.499,1142.583,If the second case involved the same cause of action.
1983.82-849,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.583,1143.014,Yes.
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1143.014,1144.262,That's of course correct.
1983.82-849,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.262,1153.768,"Well, in strictly a res judicata sense, if it were the same litigant on both sides and the same claim, you would also be precluded from relitigating a legal question."
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1153.768,1158.551,We would be precluded from litigating anything in a second case based on the same cause of action.
1983.82-849,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1296.033,1300.945,Do you think the Ninth Circuit rule applies to when the Solicitor General confesses error?
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1304.819,1315.664,"--I would think that it would; if the Government has announced its legal position in the course of litigating a case and that works its way into a court judgment, that the Government would be bound."
1983.82-849,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1315.664,1317.584,It'd be barred from forever raising that point?
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1317.584,1322.709,"That is a permissible reading of the Ninth Circuit's position, and that's what has us troubled."
1983.82-849,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1616.991,1618.483,May I ask you one other question?
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1630.78,1631.821,I don't know of any other cases.
1983.82-849,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1638.356,1638.817,Second Circuit.
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1640.666,1643.568,"That was just, I believe, one alien."
1983.82-849,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1643.568,1648.221,"So as far as the public records go, there are really perhaps only a handful of people that are affected by it?"
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1648.221,1653.206,"Yes, but I think it's probably unfair to suggest that the public interest in this case is in some respect--"
1983.82-849,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1653.206,1654.725,"Oh, I understand your legal contention."
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1654.725,1655.266,--Yes.
1983.82-849,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1659.989,1663.061,Because this is... they're rather senior citizens for the most part at this point?
1983.82-849,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1663.061,1664.513,"Yes, yes, I think so."
1983.82-849,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1668.376,1672.617,Very well.
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1675.459,1678.56,Mr. Chief Justice and may it--
1983.82-849,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1678.56,1681.252,"Mr. Ungar, you may raise the lectern if you wish."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1681.252,1682.203,"--It's all right this way, Your Honor."
1983.82-849,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1720.28,1735.139,"Well, since you raise that, doesn't he, or you to this Court, have an obligation to explain why he didn't make an application in the six months when he was in this country studying medicine?"
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1735.139,1739.312,"Well, he's testified at the district court that he didn't apply because he didn't know about it."
1983.82-849,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1800.262,1808.52,"But that really goes to the merits of your client's claim, doesn't it, rather than whether or not the Government should be estopped from litigating the merits?"
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1808.52,1810.33,"Well, in a sense it does, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1870.958,1879.514,Doesn't the same inequity apply when nobody applies for citizenship?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1879.514,1880.795,"--Well, it could."
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1881.597,1884.949,Wouldn't the same inequity apply?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1884.949,1891.612,"--If a person did not apply for citizenship and other people were naturalized, it might be characterized as an inequity."
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1899.319,1901.369,Plus the fact that he didn't avail himself.
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1901.369,1905.852,"Well, he didn't avail himself in 1945 when he didn't know about it, sure."
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1905.852,1907.222,That's what I'm talking about.
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1910.284,1912.565,The inequity that I'm referring to--
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1912.565,1915.176,"It was available, a remedy was available."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1915.176,1920.61,"--He could have, had he known, applied while he was in the United States, that's true, had he chosen to do so."
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1920.61,1922.172,"So he could have applied, not if he knew."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1923.902,1925.645,He could have applied had he known.
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1925.645,1927.275,You know about ignorance of the law.
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1927.275,1928.587,"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you."
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1928.587,1930.748,You know about ignorance of the law?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1930.748,1932.869,"Well, sure, I know about ignorance of the law."
1983.82-849,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1947.358,1955.104,"Doesn't it go to the prejudice that he suffered, whether he suffered prejudice, which is an element of any due process claim?"
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,1967.801,1970.014,"He was here... excuse me, I didn't mean to interrupt."
1983.82-849,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1999.553,2011.912,"--Mr. Ungar, I'm sure you must be aware that the Court's primary interest in this case is in the collateral estoppel issue, not in the individual, its impact in the individual case."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2011.912,2013.271,Right.
1983.82-849,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2101.87,2104.55,"Mr. Ungar, was 68 veterans a class action?"
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2104.55,2105.492,"No, it was not."
1983.82-849,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2105.492,2106.841,Just the 68?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2106.841,2108.013,That's correct.
1983.82-849,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2179.08,2182.062,He said it was that Administration's policy.
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2182.062,2183.993,"Yes, he did."
1983.82-849,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.102,2202.485,"Well, you wouldn't suggest that that reversal alone would estop the Government, would you?"
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2202.485,2203.767,That the reversal?
1983.82-849,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.767,2205.217,Of that policy?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2205.217,2221.938,"Well, I think ordinarily, in ordinary circumstances, I don't think the Government's decision to change its mind about something would warrant an estoppel."
1983.82-849,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.901,2234.826,"You're just saying, you're saying then that the Government itself may be estopped if it's too unfair?"
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2234.826,2240.42,"--Well, no, I'm not saying that, either, although obviously I think they're being unfair here."
1983.82-849,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.63,2257.901,"Well, the change of policy is irrelevant in that context."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2257.901,2261.133,The change of policy I don't think is--
1983.82-849,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2261.133,2264.516,It's irrelevant in terms of collateral estoppel.
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2264.516,2266.756,--unfair or irrelevant in that sense.
1983.82-849,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2267.287,2270.429,"For the purposes of collateral estoppel, that change of policy argument is just irrelevant."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2270.429,2273.822,If that were all that was concerned in a particular case.
1983.82-849,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2284.778,2288.932,"Mr. Ungar, your client is relying on offensive estoppel."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2294.275,2295.167,"Well, I read about it."
1983.82-849,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2296.947,2298.8,Do you think there is a difference?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2298.8,2306.785,"Well, offensive obviously is a much newer sort of theory."
1983.82-849,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2320.693,2325.094,And even though the parties are different?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2325.094,2328.039,"Even though the parties are different, sure."
1983.82-849,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2328.039,2336.174,"Well, when there's no mutuality, as I take it there wasn't here, do you think that your client really has a fairness argument?"
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2348.719,2350.481,Sure he is.
1983.82-849,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2388.637,2400.104,"Well, my only point was that when you do depart from mutuality I don't think you have the same fairness argument that you have in... you have basically a judicial economy argument."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2407.638,2424.832,"Well, I think it's unfair for the Government to have one policy with respect to certain veterans and to say, okay, you people can be naturalized, and to take people like Dr. Mendoza and to say, sorry, you can't be naturalized, although the circumstances are virtually identical."
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2428.484,2433.386,"Mr. Ungar, let's look at prosecutorial discretion for the moment."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2448.206,2449.425,Two different people?
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2449.425,2450.447,Yes.
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2452.087,2455.249,"No, because, first of all, we're talking about--"
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2455.249,2456.071,You're sure he doesn't?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2456.071,2456.812,--Pardon?
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2456.812,2458.602,You're sure he does not?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2458.602,2462.005,I would say he does not have an estoppel argument there.
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2462.005,2468.199,"Well, isn't it true that whether or not the Government appeals the case is determined by the Solicitor General?"
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2468.199,2470.78,Yes.
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2470.78,2475.572,And if he doesn't appeal one case he can't appeal any other?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2475.572,2476.734,I'm not saying that.
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2481.188,2482.107,"You're getting kind of close, I think."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2482.107,2484.17,"--Well, I don't think so."
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2488.822,2491.514,How unique is it?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2495.127,2498.66,"--Category two, who have applications pending at the present time?"
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2498.66,2502.122,The category of Dr. Mendoza.
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2502.122,2502.911,Okay.
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2526.526,2528.997,You mean that's where all the Filipinos are?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2528.997,2531.21,"I wouldn't say all, obviously."
1983.82-849,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2553.964,2570.605,"Mr. Ungar, the American Law Institute has suggested that the only principle that we should apply in a situation like this, where the Government is a party, is stare decisis."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2583.625,2584.396,"No, I don't."
1983.82-849,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2751.173,2753.875,May I ask you a question on the facts?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2760.539,2761.35,That's correct.
1983.82-849,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2761.35,2764.562,Did he testify that he found out about the law after he got back to the Philippines?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2764.562,2765.331,No.
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2787.087,2798.433,It's his position that he was here for six months and he never thought of inquiring as to whether he could become a citizen or not?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2798.433,2799.525,Sure.
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2831.846,2839.269,"All that your argument tells me is that if I had all of that I would try to find a way to get to this country, where those things don't happen."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2839.269,2841.553,--But they can't get to this country.
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2851.178,2851.919,Did he know that?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2851.919,2852.73,It was an absolute impossibility.
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2852.73,2854.2,Did he know that?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2854.2,2856.851,"Well, I don't know whether he knew that or not."
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2859.533,2861.926,"While he knows one part of it, he doesn't know the other part?"
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2861.926,2863.166,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear that."
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2863.166,2866.328,"He knows one part of the immigration law, but he doesn't know another part."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2866.328,2867.911,I don't think he knew any part of it.
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2869.67,2880.617,"I don't see where it helps my decision as to whether or not we should grant estoppel here, the fact that ""he didn't know about it""."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2880.617,2883.829,"--With all due respect, Your Honor, I don't think that's the question."
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2908.427,2911.169,He was a part of the 68 case?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2911.169,2914.521,"In effect, he was in identical circumstances."
1983.82-849,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2914.521,2915.382,That's what you're saying.
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,2915.382,2916.832,"Yes, that's what I'm saying."
1983.82-849,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3021.18,3036.04,"Well, maybe the interest is the concern that some might have with the use of... the application of offensive collateral estoppel as a principle against the Government."
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3046.035,3052.83,"Well, I can only say that I'm not sure the Government has made that particular argument."
1983.82-849,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3082.53,3085.642,"Mr. Ungar, where is the doctor now?"
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3085.642,3090.056,I believe he's on a trip to the Philippines.
1983.82-849,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3092.086,3093.265,Is he living in this country?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3093.265,3094.066,"Yes, he is."
1983.82-849,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3094.066,3094.998,Where?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3094.998,3097.229,In the Los Angeles area.
1983.82-849,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3097.229,3099.059,Practicing now?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3099.059,3101.052,Practicing medicine?
1983.82-849,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3104.275,3105.935,That's young.
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3107.595,3111.969,"I hope I'll say that when I'm 75, too."
1983.82-849,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3371.347,3380.404,Do you suppose that the judge was aware that the Philippine Government had requested the United States to terminate its activities?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3380.404,3382.174,Whether Judge Renfrew was aware of that?
1983.82-849,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3386.889,3389.16,"It didn't seen to carry much weight with him, did it?"
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3389.16,3391.18,"--Well, I think--"
1983.82-849,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3391.18,3397.986,The United States was being unfair when it responded to the request of an ally and friendly country?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3397.986,3404.821,"--Well, I think the answer to that, Justice Burger, is that that may have been an important consideration in 1945."
1983.82-849,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3417.507,3426.145,Does it not bear on the argument of unfairness in 1945 and 1946?
1983.82-849,1,21644,donald_l_ungar,,3429.636,3435.37,"--Well, but I don't think the issue in 1945 or 1946 would have been an issue of fairness."
1983.82-849,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3554.818,3557.71,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Geller?"
1983.82-849,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3557.71,3562.693,I'd just like to clarify one answer I gave to Justice Stevens.
1983.82-849,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3582.227,3583.219,"Thank you, gentlemen."
