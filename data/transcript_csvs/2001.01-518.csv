2001.01-518,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.538,"We'll hear argument next in No. 01-518, the BE&K Construction Company v. the National Labor Relations Board."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,19.197,27.575,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents an important question arising under the Petition Clause of the First Amendment."
2001.01-518,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,70.012,72.158,How do you describe the test applied by the board?
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,72.158,82.272,"--Well, the test by the board is one which says that the employer must be... must prevail, must be 100 percent prevailing in the lawsuit."
2001.01-518,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,90.529,92.591,Should there be any other component?
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,96.306,98.703,"Well, the question is what was--"
2001.01-518,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.703,100.189,--What else should be part of the test?
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,100.189,104.025,--The test is what is the... was there an objective basis for the litigation.
2001.01-518,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,115.792,123.239,"Well, should the test from Professional Real Estate automatically be carried over to the Labor Relations Act?"
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,123.239,130.215,"Well, in this case, Your Honor, an answer is yes because the Court itself has interacted with the... both of the acts."
2001.01-518,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,139.857,152.694,"Well, but I... I wonder if... if the National Labor Relations Board doesn't have some discretion to say that the labor situation is somewhat different, as they apparently do, from the antitrust situation."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,152.694,157.236,"Well, but the irony here is that the NLRB has not... has not interpreted its own statute."
2001.01-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,161.944,165.326,Which happened to say precisely what the NLRB said it said.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,165.326,166.607,"Well, no, Your Honor."
2001.01-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,167.267,173.954,"If a judgment goes against the employer in the State court, if it goes against him, then he's had his day in court."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,187.783,188.61,--Three--
2001.01-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,188.61,192.819,"And you've been reading three cases to us, so that seems to be the language that you have."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,199.756,200.332,--Yes.
2001.01-518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,225.762,226.998,"Mr. Baskin, back up a bit."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,226.998,227.741,Yes.
2001.01-518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,227.741,232.45,The... the Court in that very paragraph gave a definition of what it meant.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,249.455,251.026,Yes.
2001.01-518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,251.026,251.852,Judgment against you.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,282.809,286.153,"Yes, and if it were the holding of the opinion, it would have greater weight."
2001.01-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,291.809,294.493,"Well, there are two responses to the dicta point it seems to me."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,326.937,344.748,"--It is clearly dicta because the Court stated what was the issue before it, and the sole issue before it in Bill Johnson's is stated at the beginning of the opinion, whether the NLRB may issue a cease and desist order to halt the prosecution of a State court civil suit brought by an employer to retaliate against employees."
2001.01-518,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,362.481,364.089,I think there's another element that you're ignoring.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,374.203,374.824,Yes.
2001.01-518,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,374.824,376.721,Isn't that the other element?
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,376.721,377.275,Yes.
2001.01-518,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,378.744,379.116,Okay.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,385.97,386.713,"Well, it's--"
2001.01-518,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,386.713,387.745,"--do you think, in the board's rule?"
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,387.745,388.321,--Yes.
2001.01-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,451.024,452.389,"May I just ask this, Mr. Baskin?"
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,457.506,464.482,"It's one mostly as to timing and facts available to the board, and I think that's what the Court was--"
2001.01-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,464.482,466.878,"But the... in your view, the standard is the same."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,473.853,475.878,--The substantive standard should be the same.
2001.01-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,475.878,477.047,"It should be, but--"
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,477.047,477.568,Should be.
2001.01-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,477.568,479.054,--do you think that Johnson says it's the same?
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,479.054,486.197,We're all here today because the language in the tail end of the Bill Johnson's opinion is ambiguous as to what they intended the standard to be.
2001.01-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,486.197,487.516,But at least it says there's a different standard.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,487.516,490.571,As to... the... the impact was--
2001.01-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,490.571,492.513,And your view is there should be no different standard.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,492.513,492.718,--Correct.
2001.01-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,492.718,494.492,And that's the whole key to the case.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,494.492,496.6,That really is the whole key to the case.
2001.01-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,496.6,497.276,And why not?
2001.01-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.276,504.978,"Mr. Baskin, is your... is your argument... in your opening remarks, you... you referred only to the First Amendment."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,524.214,524.685,No.
2001.01-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.752,534.699,"Which says... so, it's a statutory argument."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,534.699,535.525,--No.
2001.01-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,543.987,544.359,That's too fuzzy for me.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,547.869,552.532,It prohibits a statute from prohibiting it.
2001.01-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.532,553.275,The Constitution prohibits.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,554.928,557.073,Constitutional and statutory.
2001.01-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,557.073,560.046,--You... you cannot... that Congress could not adopt the English rule.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,560.046,560.417,No.
2001.01-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.73,563.389,It would do that by statute.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,563.389,566.378,But is there an... a declaration of unlawfulness involved?
2001.01-518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,583.097,589.024,But the fact that it's triple damages is a little different than fee-shifting.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,619.489,623.781,"First, the most important is the declaration that you are a law violator in and of itself."
2001.01-518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,638.825,640.582,--Explain that.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,658.332,674.679,"It's not meant in the legal sense and the Government... we're not... we're not talking about whether the Government has to debar the company, but both private actors and many Government contracting officers take the view they don't want to deal with people who have been declared to be law violators."
2001.01-518,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,677.074,684.71,"Well, in our lower case, the... Wisconsin set out to do that on a State basis, didn't it?"
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,686.529,687.948,"Yes, they did."
2001.01-518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,722.233,733.834,What do you do with the 2 decades that have elapsed... about 2 decades... since Justice White's opinion which has been interpreted by the board the way the language most naturally reads?
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,744.608,758.271,I regret to say it's a tribute to the speed of the board's processes and the process of getting this case up to this level on this issue because this case alone has taken 7 years to work its way through the board.
2001.01-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.728,782.67,"They won over half their cases, didn't they?"
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,782.67,783.617,Excuse me?
2001.01-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,783.617,786.589,Didn't they win... they won some 15 out of their 29 cases.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,786.589,790.016,"Depending on how you count, they just barely got over 50 percent."
2001.01-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,790.016,794.308,"Did you ask... talking about the history of the case, could you tell me how did this case end up in the Sixth Circuit?"
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,794.308,802.443,"Well, in fact, by the time this case got to the court of appeals, BE&K was no longer doing business in California."
2001.01-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,805.704,806.197,I see.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,806.197,808.426,And that's why the decision was made--
2001.01-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,808.426,813.256,"I'd like you to address, if I can go back to the... what I think was the Chief Justice's question."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,899.698,900.813,--The--
2001.01-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,900.813,901.677,"And now, what is your response?"
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,901.677,907.705,--The irony is that the Court considered those purported differences in the Bill Johnson's case and rejected them.
2001.01-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,907.705,908.243,All right.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,908.819,909.479,"No, no."
2001.01-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,910.222,917.903,"--I... but I'm trying to stay away from Bill Johnson because obviously if you're right that the statute holds it, I mean, I... all right."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,919.305,934.825,"Well, to me it's... the interesting thing about this case is the Court has itself considered these very questions that you're raising and you have answered them, and you do not need to revisit them to... to come out with the conclusion that the NLRB has either misinterpreted the standard or that the standard is unworkable."
2001.01-518,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,934.825,943.082,"Well, but I... I have... I have the same question that I think underlies Justice Breyer's concern."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,977.717,978.46,"Well, only in one respect."
2001.01-518,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,984.609,991.463,"Well, I suppose there's always abuse of process if there's... but if there's some basis, then you can use it specifically to retaliate."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,991.463,993.071,More than some.
2001.01-518,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,996.581,998.272,You can specifically use it to retaliate.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,998.272,1003.724,"The Court... this Court has said that if there is an objective basis, that means it's a meritorious lawsuit."
2001.01-518,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1009.789,1012.473,But... but we're talking... we're talking in... in the labor context.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1012.473,1012.623,Yes.
2001.01-518,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1012.623,1013.876,And you lose the suit.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1024.9,1048.017,"If it is a reasonable, meritorious suit, as this Court has defined it, where the right of access to a court is too important to be called an unfair labor practice solely on the ground that what is sought in the court is to enjoin employees from exercising a protected right because of the First Amendment to the Constitution, the right to petition the courts with a meritorious lawsuit."
2001.01-518,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.017,1051.194,But the First Amendment argument goes by the boards once the case is over.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1051.194,1056.479,"No, Your Honor, because... for the same reasons that the Court held in Professional Real Estate."
2001.01-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1064.031,1070.68,"Yes, but that ignores the fact that we're not concerned solely with chilling; we're also concerned with retaliation."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1088.263,1093.093,"Because the employers are being chilled and, in effect, the retaliation--"
2001.01-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1093.093,1099.963,"Well, they're being chilled in... in engaging in retaliation for the exercise of statutory rights."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1099.963,1103.95,--But there's actually less retaliation that's going to take place once the suit is completed.
2001.01-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1110.859,1113.238,"And the... the answer to that, it seems to me, is set out in the cases."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1120.668,1122.071,"Well, here there's even a more compelling interest."
2001.01-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1127.272,1127.894,All right.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1165.25,1169.543,"Well, the ambiguity was in the opinion that led the board to take an erroneous view--"
2001.01-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1169.543,1176.396,"That's right I believe, and the board has made it very clear how the board is reading it, and after 20 years, we've got a pretty clearly settled body of law, haven't we?"
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1176.396,1178.542,"--Well, a settled body of erroneous law."
2001.01-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1180.688,1186.139,And we're interpreting statutes... the... the settled body is clear and Congress is apparently quite agreeable to it.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1186.139,1196.103,"--Well, first, the Court has said you don't defer... that... that you can't read anything into congressional inaction, particularly when it has taken this long before the board ruling really was definitive."
2001.01-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.548,1205.103,I don't understand that.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1208.264,1208.924,--Because it's been in doubt.
2001.01-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1219.576,1221.35,You mean it has been contested constantly during that--
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1221.35,1221.805,--Yes.
2001.01-518,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1221.805,1222.464,--20... 20-year period?
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1222.464,1223.041,Absolutely.
2001.01-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1223.041,1226.263,Has the board ever taken a different position in the 20-year period?
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1226.263,1230.843,"There have been dissents, but no, the board has generally taken a consistent view."
2001.01-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1230.843,1232.412,"So, the board's position has been clear for 20 years."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1232.412,1233.072,"Yes, but the board--"
2001.01-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1233.072,1233.694,The board is slow.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1236.871,1242.61,--But the board is not entitled to deference in its interpretation of the U.S. Constitution or of this Court's decision.
2001.01-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1250.428,1257.365,I think we're not raising... I think Justice Ginsburg's question and my question is not so much geared to an issue of deference.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1296.003,1304.093,"Well, it is... stare decisis is a form of deference, and we're talking about stare decisis would apply to the Court's own opinion."
2001.01-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1318.788,1319.325,I'm saying that--
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1319.325,1320.828,--on Bill Johnson's since Bill Johnson's.
2001.01-518,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1320.828,1333.981,"--I'm saying that in... as... as your own answers indicate, for 20 years there seems to have been a... a settled practice on the part of the board which at best is not inconsistent with our opinion."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1342.276,1356.272,"I contest that it's a settled statutory regime, that we are dealing with a First Amendment right, and that the board's outcome, which it has taken this long to reach back to the court, is wrong under the First Amendment."
2001.01-518,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1384.796,1386.033,If there's a retaliatory motive.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1386.033,1387.397,If there's a retaliatory motive.
2001.01-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1403.122,1408.118,"But, I mean, that's a normal problem, isn't it, with the labor statutes and most other statutes."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1419.552,1420.378,Well--
2001.01-518,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1420.378,1424.382,We're trying to carve out a... an exception where you're home free from that.
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1424.382,1432.367,"--Well, no, it's the board that's carving out an exception from the basic First Amendment protection that this Court has recognized already."
2001.01-518,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1432.367,1449.812,"Mr. Baskin, that... that goes back every time to how you construe this paragraph, and so if the position that Justice White is making a distinction here between, on the one hand, an ongoing proceeding... the First Amendment says you can't stop it."
2001.01-518,0,35525,maurice_baskin,,1494.988,1502.856,"There... there can be a difference, mainly the difference of having more facts, having an outcome in front of the board at that point."
2001.01-518,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1539.925,1540.956,"Very well, Mr. Baskin."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1542.525,1579.223,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The board and the courts of appeals have had no difficulty in reading Bill Johnson's the way I think most people would read this Court's opinion as comprehensively addressing what the board was doing with respect to the unfair labor practice under section 8(a)(1) of the filing of--"
2001.01-518,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1579.223,1579.927,Mr. Wallace.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1579.927,1580.67,--retaliatory lawsuits.
2001.01-518,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1580.67,1584.135,"Mr. Wallace, when I ask you a question, please stop."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1584.135,1586.076,I didn't hear you.
2001.01-518,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1586.736,1587.934,"Well, listen a little more closely."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1598.336,1607.624,"I do disagree with that, and... and no court of appeals that has reviewed board decisions since Bill Johnson's has read it that way."
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.575,1651.297,"It did say that, but of course, that was not the situation before the Court."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1678.501,1680.07,I beg to differ.
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1697.532,1698.852,But those cases were not before them.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1711.938,1719.164,--It... it was a direction for how further proceedings in the case should be handled.
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.164,1720.65,"Exactly, as many dicta are."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1733.198,1744.715,"In any event, if I may turn now to address the question that the Court asked the parties to address in formulating the question presented here."
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.009,1802.178,"Well, I... I have one particular difference in mind that I'd like you to comment on."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1884.534,1891.76,"Well, the board is not contradicting anything found by the courts."
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1909.238,1911.284,They will address it in a proceeding before the board.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1958.178,1979.81,"--Well, the... the cases against unions are much less numerous to begin with because unions are less apt to bring lawsuits to interfere with the rights of employees under section 7 for concerted activity."
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.358,1996.612,"There were union lawsuits in this present case, weren't there?"
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1996.8,2000.82,"--But those were against the employer, and... and they--"
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2000.82,2007.59,But suits... suits against the employer can certainly be brought to impair the... the rights of the employees not to... not to unionize.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2007.59,2019.274,"--That would have to be a showing a violation by the union of 8(b)(4), not... not that the lawsuit was an 8(a)(1) violation against the concerted activities rights of employees."
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2043.256,2046.228,Never... never mind the 26 to 3.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2069.058,2070.377,"Well, this isn't punishment."
2001.01-518,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2093.699,2103.731,"Mr. Wallace, Mr. Baskin told us that there are punitive aspects to this that could lead to debarment he said."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2112.814,2169.035,"Well, the... the case to which the Chief Justice referred earlier, Wisconsin Department of Industrial Relations against Gould, was one in which this Court held that Wisconsin law was preempted, and Wisconsin could not refuse to make purchases, State purchases, from companies that had been found to have violated the National Labor Relations Act because the whole purpose of the remedy scheme under the National Labor Relations Act is remedial and the remedies are limited, and the idea is to get labor disputes behind us, not to have disruptions of the economy, to keep productivity going, and to keep the people employed."
2001.01-518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2169.035,2181.461,"Well, is... is the point of this colloquy whether or not this act can be called punitive or this NLRB doctrine can be called punitive?"
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2188.437,2194.193,"Well, I... I wouldn't think that... that anything would turn on it, but it is not punitive."
2001.01-518,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2219.645,2224.02,But is there any other effect by virtue of the finding of the unfair labor practice?
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2224.02,2225.301,--Well--
2001.01-518,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2225.301,2227.614,"I mean, true in terms of money, it's the fees."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2231.412,2232.443,--Notice is to be posted.
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2241.276,2254.463,"Well, let's just talk about the make-whole remedy."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2317.437,2345.097,"Well, board proceedings are much less burdensome than... than court proceedings to those that are issue, and the Court held in Bill Johnson's that the board remedy of recompensing the defendants who prevailed in this suit for their costs, because the suit was brought to defeat their section 7 rights, was a permissible remedy by the board."
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.097,2347.076,We held it or... or said it.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2349.1,2349.677,Yes.
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.047,2364.061,We're just going around the dictum point again.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2365.259,2375.001,"Well, when the Court prescribes a rule of that nature, the United States considers itself bound by it in its further handling--"
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2375.001,2375.457,Yes.
2001.01-518,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2378.073,2400.636,"Mr. Wallace, I... do you agree that under the board's rule here that it does allow the board to find the unfair labor practice and impose the sanctions on litigation brought by employers that is not limited to just shams and abuse of process?"
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2400.636,2401.463,--That's--
2001.01-518,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2401.463,2412.73,It does allow the imposition of these things for an employer suit that could be considered objectively reasonable at the time it was brought.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2412.73,2414.588,--Exactly so.
2001.01-518,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2431.1,2438.076,"Well, does that have the necessary effect of at least chilling some conduct that is protected by the First Amendment?"
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2442.346,2456.198,But it... it's a far less daunting situation than what the Court was faced with under the antitrust laws in the Professional Real Estate Investors case.
2001.01-518,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2456.198,2461.211,"Mr. Wallace, isn't it correct that the scope of chilling is limited to those with a retaliatory motive?"
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2461.211,2462.308,Absolutely.
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.308,2464.826,I thought it's where the board finds--
2001.01-518,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2464.826,2466.85,--should be chilled in those cases.
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2466.85,2473.016,--to those where the board and not Federal courts on their own find a retaliatory motive.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2473.016,2476.714,"But, of course, the board's findings are subject to judicial review."
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2476.714,2481.173,"For... so long as there's substantial evidence, which means... you know."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2481.173,2481.999,Correct.
2001.01-518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2481.999,2482.37,All right.
2001.01-518,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.113,2485.898,"--In every 8(a)(1) case, the retaliatory motive is found by the board."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2488.498,2488.891,That is correct.
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2488.891,2501.523,"The other parts of this statutory proceeding do not exclude the Federal courts from their business, do they, which this does by imposing penalties upon people who come to the Federal courts?"
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2501.523,2517.831,"Well, I think this Court's make it quite... this Court's decisions make it quite clear that under the National Labor Relations Act, it is board rather than courts that have the responsibility of ruling about unfair labor practices."
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2517.831,2530.835,"We agree with that and the only issue is whether that statutory provision places within the board the power to impose this particular sanction for an unfair labor practice, a penalty for bringing a meritorious lawsuit."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2530.835,2534.3,"Well, make-whole relief--"
2001.01-518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2534.3,2558.616,"Isn't the make-whole relief simply that they've said, since ours is a statute which foresees taking labor disputes out of the courts and putting them into the board, since that's why it was passed, we're going to say a... a loser in a Federal lawsuit that violates that basic underlying purpose has to pay attorney's fees to the winner?"
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2561.709,2563.817,--Not... not at all.
2001.01-518,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2581.854,2583.152,"Well, isn't what--"
2001.01-518,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2583.152,2593.371,--Is the courts'... is the board's definition of a unmeritorious lawsuit simply one which... in which the plaintiff does not get what the plaintiff wants.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2595.768,2601.052,"--That's approximately it, yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2001.01-518,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2601.052,2602.205,How... how would it vary?
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2604.971,2610.833,"Well, there can... there can be cases in which a voluntary dismissal was taken with prejudice."
2001.01-518,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2628.211,2629.947,Is... is... I'm sorry.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2679.731,2688.647,"Well, we... we didn't come up with analogies in which regulatory agencies do the fee-shifting."
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2697.935,2702.887,But they have to be very explicit because it's such an extraordinary thing.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2726.087,2753.868,"Well, there is not a reference to fee-shifting as such in the National Labor Relations Act, but Congress did say in section 8(a)(1) that it shall be an unfair labor practice to an employee to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the concerted activity rights for mutual aid and protection that are guaranteed in section 7."
2001.01-518,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2765.385,2767.531,Mr. Wallace--
2001.01-518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2767.531,2796.304,"--In... in a case like this, if we have essentially these facts, if the finding of the board was is that the purpose of the employer in bringing the suit was because the employer's board of directors met and they say, we are being hurt in the marketplace, public opinion is against us, we must bring these suits to protect our position in the business community, I take it that is a retaliatory motive."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2796.304,2814.342,"Well, the retaliatory motive would be... it would have to be shown that the suit was brought for the purpose of coercing, discouraging, suppressing, restraining the employees in the exercise of their rights."
2001.01-518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2814.342,2817.276,"Well, but you... you know what I'm trying... trying to get at."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2828.793,2838.247,"Well, the... the board addresses that question in light of all the circumstances of the case."
2001.01-518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2846.049,2847.906,Assume... assume that there... it's not baseless.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2847.906,2850.22,--That weighs in the employer's favor.
2001.01-518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2854.056,2867.681,But it can be retaliatory for the employer to protect its business against suits by the union which are brought by the union for the motive of weakening the employer.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2868.879,2875.604,"--Well, only if the employer has brought suits against the union or the employees."
2001.01-518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2876.142,2876.802,No.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2878.76,2880.972,--Well--
2001.01-518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2880.972,2883.406,Let... let me ask you in a related vein.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2888.031,2900.496,"--This Court did not indicate in any way that it could not reexamine, modify the rules of Noerr-Pennington or of Professional Real Estate."
2001.01-518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2902.354,2905.592,"In other words, Noerr-Pennington doesn't have a constitutional underpinning."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2905.592,2937.898,"--It... it certainly construed the antitrust laws in light of the fact that those laws focus mostly on private conduct in the marketplace, not on petitioning for Government-imposed restraints, and that there was a need in construing them not to... to allow improper chilling of the bringing of lawsuits or other forms of petitioning activity."
2001.01-518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3022.066,3036.472,"My... my concern... my concern is... is this, is that the First Amendment has its own corrective counterspeech, but what the board has done here is it's defined retaliatory motive so broadly that it's taken away that First Amendment corrective."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3044.812,3062.562,"Well, there... there is a very limited remedy available here compared to the prospect that treble damages might be awarded on the basis of rather unpredictable findings about subjective motivation in bringing the lawsuit."
2001.01-518,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3078.537,3082.641,"Mr. Wallace, is retaliatory motive... is that before us in this case?"
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3096.165,3100.374,"I agree with you on that point, Justice Ginsburg."
2001.01-518,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3100.374,3116.077,"Because on that, I was going to ask you, well, what is it that shows that this was in retaliation for violation of section 7 rights instead of being in... in response to the union's desire simply to harass the employer?"
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3124.772,3129.064,I... I agree with you completely.
2001.01-518,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3129.685,3142.084,I take it... I take it the background of this case is that there was a finding of retaliatory motive and we have to make our decision based upon the way the board interprets retaliatory motive in cases such as this.
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3142.084,3157.095,"--Well, it's certainly part of the background of the case, but the Court did limit the grant of certiorari to whether these two decisions are compatible given the differences between the two acts."
2001.01-518,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3157.095,3166.132,"And we have to defer both to the board's determination of what constitutes a retaliatory motive and, even more so, to the board's factual determination that retaliatory motive existed."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3187.681,3198.992,"Well, there is seldom direct evidence of that kind, although occasionally there is direct evidence of animus in the bringing of the suit."
2001.01-518,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3230.738,3234.742,"That's an issue that was raised by question 3 of the cert petition, and we didn't grant it."
2001.01-518,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3234.742,3235.607,--That's correct.
