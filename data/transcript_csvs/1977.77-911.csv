1977.77-911,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,50.765,We will hear arguments next in National Labor Relations Board against Robbins Tire.
1977.77-911,0,20174,carl_l_taylor,,62.518,65.851,Thank you sir.
1977.77-911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,163.868,185.056,"Mr. Taylor, I spent three years in the executive branch and resolutely adhere to juxtaposition that you are taking now and I thought was right then in doing it, I have a good deal of difficulty after the 1974 amendments where it seems to me that Congress just plowed ahead and said that that is what they meant?"
1977.77-911,0,20174,carl_l_taylor,,185.056,202.72,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the statute speaks of enforcement proceedings without distinguishing between particular types of enforcement proceedings and I suggest to the Court that what applies to an enforcement proceeding applies to all equally and I think the legislative history bears me out on that."
1977.77-911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,214.859,221.205,You compared the House history of the bill of the 66 Act with the senate history?
1977.77-911,0,20174,carl_l_taylor,,224.371,249.515,"The bill of course, came up in the senate first and what is key in the senate as far as we are concerned is the participation of Senator Humphrey who specifically protested during the debates in the senate that the Act might be used to obtain statements of witnesses prior to hearing in Labor Board proceedings is specifically addressed to Labor Board."
1977.77-911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,344.557,356.312,"Certainly, there is nothing in the Act either in 66 or 74 which suggests the Labor Board is different from OSHA or different from the FTC or different from any other agency, is there?"
1977.77-911,0,20174,carl_l_taylor,,356.312,360.295,There is nothing to distinguish between various types of enforcement proceedings.
1977.77-911,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,413.833,425.448,"Mr. Taylor, what do you do with Senator Hart?s comment at the bottom of page 30 of your brief, your footnote that it is only relevant to make that determination in the context of the particular enforcement proceeding."
1977.77-911,0,20174,carl_l_taylor,,428.649,438.303,"Mr. Justice Stevens, if I am right that the concept of no earlier or greater access still finds its way into the 74 amendments."
1977.77-911,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,447.981,451.061,"You mean by particular you meant particular kinds of enforcement, like Labor Board --?"
1977.77-911,0,20174,carl_l_taylor,,451.061,452.892,"Yes sir, exactly."
1977.77-911,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,452.892,459.989,"So is that interpretation consistent with your notion that the same rules apply to criminal enforcement, Labor Board notion?"
1977.77-911,0,20174,carl_l_taylor,,459.989,467.933,The notion sir is of no earlier or greater access than whatever the discovery rules in the particular type of proceeding prescribed.
1977.77-911,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,473.766,477.836,What do you think that Congress did intend to do by 1974 amendment?
1977.77-911,0,20174,carl_l_taylor,,477.836,487.797,Congress was focusing particularly on a set of cases which Congress felt constituted a judicial distortion of the original intent.
1977.77-911,1,44573,william_m_earnest,,1869.125,1872.651,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.051,2093.69,As I understand Mr. Earnest this proceeding has simply been stayed pending the outcome of this ruling under FOIA?
1977.77-911,1,44573,william_m_earnest,,2093.69,2095.905,It has not been stayed by any Court.
1977.77-911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.905,2099.079,But I mean the NLRB has declined to proceed with it.
1977.77-911,1,44573,william_m_earnest,,2099.079,2100.17,"At their own volition, yes."
1977.77-911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.17,2103.289,"Right, so there is no question of mootness here?"
1977.77-911,1,44573,william_m_earnest,,2103.289,2109.617,"Yes, in fact the District Judge Hancock in the District Court specifically gave that option to the Board's counsel."
1977.77-911,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.499,2137.281,"FOIA has not anything to do with whether there is a hearing or not, does it?"
1977.77-911,1,44573,william_m_earnest,,2137.281,2140.38,"FOIA has to do, that is correct."
1977.77-911,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.38,2146.571,So even if it was dismissed it would still be a live FOIA case?
1977.77-911,1,44573,william_m_earnest,,2146.571,2148.627,That is correct.
1977.77-911,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.627,2150.862,Even if the Board case was dismissed?
1977.77-911,1,44573,william_m_earnest,,2150.862,2164.128,"Yes, there was an interesting comment and I think it may have been regarded to the Exemption 5 that the Board's duty of disclosure or the public interest would have been met as the facts were brought out in the hearing."
1977.77-911,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2183.944,2187.375,Could you not go after them again under FOIA?
1977.77-911,1,44573,william_m_earnest,,2187.375,2190.468,I think you can go after them any time with FOIA.
1977.77-911,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2190.468,2192.62,But would you not be successful then?
1977.77-911,1,44573,william_m_earnest,,2197.066,2201.677,I suspect we would see the same exemptions we have got now because the Board has I think taken --
1977.77-911,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2201.677,2207.233,That is before?
1977.77-911,1,44573,william_m_earnest,,2207.233,2207.573,"Well, they have taken --"
1977.77-911,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2207.573,2210.377,Unless they could say it is after.
1977.77-911,1,44573,william_m_earnest,,2210.377,2219.838,"I think they have taken, Mr. Justice Marshall, they have taken the position that even a closed file could interfere with future enforcement proceedings or could --"
1977.77-911,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2219.838,2222.826,But they have had issued that especially for this particular case.
1977.77-911,1,44573,william_m_earnest,,2229.493,2231.665,I think they would.
1977.77-911,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2231.665,2233.179,Would they be successful.
1977.77-911,1,44573,william_m_earnest,,2233.179,2238.47,I do not think they will be successful in this.
