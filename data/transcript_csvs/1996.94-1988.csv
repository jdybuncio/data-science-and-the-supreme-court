1996.94-1988,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.989,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-1988, Camp Newfound Owatonna, Inc. v. the Town of Harrison, Maine."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,18.083,24.576,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.453,130.074,Why should the taxpayers of Maine subsidize charity to people outside of Maine?
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,133.398,134.179,"Well, they're not--"
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,134.179,135.18,--by the Commerce Clause.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,135.18,135.571,--Surely.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,191.935,202.845,Do those other cases... those other cases don't involve as proximately as this one does the... in effect the expenditure of State money.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,214.743,215.263,Well--
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.263,225.498,"It seems to me this is closer to the situation in which the State is a market participant, and the State chooses to purchase its goods only from in-State companies."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,225.498,226.099,--Well--
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,226.099,227.468,Which it's entitled to do.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,227.468,233.623,--Let me try to address that question in the two aspects in which I understand it.
1996.94-1988,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,292.351,299.487,"Well, logically there's... it's hard to see a difference between a tax exemption and a direct subsidy, isn't there?"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,299.487,301.567,That's precisely what I'm trying to say.
1996.94-1988,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,301.567,303.54,But you say the Court has drawn that distinction.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,303.54,304.73,"I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor."
1996.94-1988,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.73,307.551,But you say the Court has treated them differently.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,307.551,309.804,This Court has treated them the same.
1996.94-1988,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,309.804,314.806,"I mean, what if it were a direct subsidy of cash to a Maine charity--"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,314.806,315.447,Right.
1996.94-1988,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,315.447,319.399,--based on how many Maine residents were served by the charity.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,319.399,319.93,Precisely.
1996.94-1988,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,319.93,322.411,Would that be all right for Maine?
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,322.411,324.134,That's a very interesting question.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,366.62,372.083,"That's because the tax goes to the county, not the State, this real property tax?"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,372.083,384.872,"--I... yes, I'm sure that's right, but... in terms of fact, but the reason for the State's participating at the trial court level and not appealing is a matter that I am in no position to comment on at all."
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,398.6,403.074,But the tax... the tax in this case was the town's tax--
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,403.074,403.785,--Town's tax.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,403.785,404.855,--that was authorized by State law.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,404.855,405.396,Yes.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,407.787,437.326,"And while you were outlining the, is it like a subsidy, is it like a participant in the market, it's... is it at all relevant that real estate... taxes on real estate go back a pretty long way, and I thought that the original... that that thought had little to do with commerce, but had to do very much with the public service that the charity, or most traditionally the church, was supplying for the local community."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,437.326,437.856,--Yes.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,437.856,441.5,And not some notion of worldwide benefit.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,441.5,448.234,"Well, I... let me make sure that I understand your question correctly, Justice Ginsburg."
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,448.234,456.079,I'm asking you to... whether this... we can say real estate taxes originate... exemptions from real estate taxes--
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,456.079,456.49,Yes.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,456.49,472.889,"--you don't tax the church property... from something that had to do with benefiting locals, and that's why we... that's why these exemptions from the real estate... real estate doesn't move from one State to another like lumber does."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,472.889,473.53,No.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,473.53,482.075,Is there something special about real estate where an exemption from the tax might be supportable in that area and not in others?
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,482.075,484.707,"Well, let me put it this way."
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.877,544.376,Not if it's limited to charity.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,544.376,546.127,Now... yes.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.127,573.996,"Before you can decide that there's been discrimination against out-of-State commerce, you have to decide that you're dealing with two taxpayers who are similarly situated, and why isn't it entirely reasonable to say that they are not similarly situated where a charitable... where this deduction is at issue where one of the taxpayer provides charity to the citizens of Maine--"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,573.996,574.417,Right.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,574.417,575.977,--and the other one does not.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,575.977,576.688,Right.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,577.098,578.6,Why are they similarly situated?
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,585.944,586.435,--All right--
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.435,587.785,But here one is giving something--
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,587.785,588.466,--Yes.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.466,591.198,--gratis to the citizens of Maine.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,594.22,597.792,"I understand... I understand, Justice Scalia, the force of that reaction to the case."
1996.94-1988,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,653.738,667.928,"No, but isn't the answer to that that it's purchasing a great number of other things, too, and for that reason it doesn't fall afoul... I mean, it's purchasing all sorts of secular benefits on the same ground for that reason it doesn't fall afoul of establishment."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,667.928,675.514,"Oh, I'm sure it doesn't fall afoul of establishment, Justice Souter, but the reason it doesn't is because it's not market participation."
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.289,688.313,I don't think the argument is that the State is a market participant.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,694.036,694.715,Right.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.715,699.259,--and you can discriminate against your out-of-State citizens when you're a market participant--
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,699.259,700.368,Right.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,700.368,708.506,"--so also you can do it in this situation, where you're dealing with someone who is providing a... you know, a service gratis--"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,708.506,709.375,"A service gratis, yes."
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.375,709.996,--to the State.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,709.996,737.283,"All right, well let me address... but just before I forget, Justice O'Connor, on the subsidy question, of course, the subsidy defense does not have the same quality of imprimatur from this Court as yet as the market participation test does, but as I've indicated, for my purposes I'm perfectly wiling to assume, arguendo, that any sort of a subsidy is immune from the dormant Commerce Clause just... because this just isn't subsidy, that's all."
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,822.369,823.801,Before you go too far down that road--
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,823.801,824.62,Yes.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.62,829.545,"--as I understand this law, it doesn't apply to all nonprofits."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,829.545,830.244,Correct.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.244,837.369,"It applies to only those... they have to sell their services for no more than $30 a week, isn't--"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,837.369,837.81,No.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,841.743,842.732,--Do you know any--
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,842.732,848.695,"If they have a modest charge then they get a modest exemption, but if they charge more than $30 then they lose the exemption entirely."
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,848.695,849.236,--Then they lose the exemption.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,849.236,849.897,Right.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,849.897,859.863,"Now, do you know anybody that can possibly run a camp for $30 a week without giving a lot of that away for free?"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,859.863,862.227,Well--
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.227,870.732,"So you're not just talking about ""nonprofits"", you're talking in every case under this law about companies who are giving away stuff free to residents of Maine."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,870.732,878.016,"--No, we're talking about nonprofits here who serve primarily citizens of Maine whom they charge $1,000 a week, who get the exemption."
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,878.016,885.561,"That applies only to when they're serving out-of-State people, and it's $30."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,885.561,893.906,"If they're serving primarily or principally Maine citizens, then they may charge $1,000 or $2,000, and they get the exemption."
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.906,897.579,"I see, and the $30 applies only to out-of-Staters?"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,897.579,898.107,No.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,905.083,906.224,I see.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,906.224,907.505,So--
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,907.505,913.999,"Fifty thousand, which might not be the lion's share of the tax anyway, right?"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,913.999,917.622,"--The... oh, the tax in this... if you're asking about the--"
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,917.622,920.614,"Well, it depends on what is the value of the property."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,920.614,921.516,--What is the value of the property.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,930.562,931.324,I'm glad you clarified that.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,931.324,931.714,--Yes.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,932.285,932.776,So we really are talking--
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,932.776,933.186,--Right.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.324,934.355,--just about charitable organizations.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,934.355,950.396,"--a protected relationship with the State, nursing homes, camps, some of which are... many of which are nonprofit, but they are in competition directly with these charities, so-called charities, and these people lose the exemption, and they lose the exemption because they serve too many people from out of State."
1996.94-1988,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,950.396,954.248,Would a hospital lose its exemption if it took a lot of out-of-State patients?
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,954.248,960.512,"The hospitals are not covered by this provision of the statute, Justice Stevens, and I should point that out."
1996.94-1988,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1014.578,1016.208,"Well, at least you've given me the answer for a mental institution."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1019.31,1022.864,"Mental... community mental treatment centers, so it would not be a mental hospital."
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1048.201,1049.433,--And that's true--
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1068.604,1068.944,No.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1090.609,1094.632,"Well, what is the effect, the harm that you're complaining about?"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1096.513,1096.773,Yes.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1111.643,1116.117,But your camp isn't even within that range.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1116.117,1116.487,We're not close.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1116.487,1129.425,"I mean, you describe some things, this will give camps like yours an incentive to take people only from in the State, but it's... your camp can't operate... that's not what it is."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1129.425,1132.386,Not without a massive conversion to Christian Science in the State.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1135.078,1138.471,So it's not going to have that impact.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1138.471,1138.892,It is not.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1138.892,1140.674,What is the impact that you have?
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1140.674,1159.404,"All right... but I don't want to leave that, because I think the statute is attacked on its face, and surely you must contemplate in judging the probable impact of the statute situations in which by imposing a quota, or imposing a differential fee schedule, a camp, or a nursing home, or whatever, could qualify, so--"
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1159.404,1163.618,"Do we know, in fact, that there is any such camp in the entire State of Maine--"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1163.618,1164.079,--That's--
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1164.079,1170.751,"--where there would be that... they say, gee, we're pretty close to the 50 percent mark so we have to serve in-State people not out-of-State?"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1170.751,1171.062,--No.
1996.94-1988,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1178.559,1186.703,What if the statute granted a charitable exemption only to charities domiciled or headquartered in the State of Maine?
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1186.703,1207.076,"Absolutely, without any question in my judgment that is perfectly all right, and indeed, I think it is natural, normal, to be expected, proper, in every way reasonable for a State to say we're not going to grant a charitable property tax exemption unless this charity is here, doing work to benefit the people of this State."
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1207.076,1207.837,"Well, why?"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1213.1,1213.551,Right.
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.551,1215.912,--and all of your charity can be expended in Bangladesh.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1215.912,1224.938,"Right, but I'm going beyond that, beyond the Chief Justice's question, in saying I think it's also proper to say that the charity must perform charitable services in the State."
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1230.562,1237.176,"But that's a different question than, you can be domiciled in the State, have all of your operations in the State, but everybody you serve is from out of State."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1237.176,1246.723,"--That could well be, and all that I'm suggesting is that a requirement that a charity expend... if this is the question--"
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1246.723,1248.446,But the Chief's question... I--
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1248.446,1248.806,--not only be domiciled there but spend money in the State.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1248.806,1250.216,--Mr. Dempsey--
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1250.216,1250.537,Yes.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1250.537,1259.001,"--I thought the Chief's question was, suppose the Maine law was, charities who are domiciled in this State are exempt from real property taxes in this State."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1263.803,1264.994,"Absolutely, in my judgment."
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1264.994,1270.328,"So what... so let's take a charity situated in Maine, operating only in Maine--"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1270.328,1270.799,Right.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1270.799,1272.701,--but serving only children from India.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1277.955,1278.943,I... I--
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1278.943,1280.386,--That would be constitutional.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1282.095,1283.157,--Would be unconstitutional?
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1283.157,1284.447,--I'm sorry.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1284.447,1284.928,No.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1284.928,1289.412,It serves only people from out of State.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1289.412,1290.521,Right.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1290.521,1292.784,There wouldn't be any complainant.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1292.784,1297.717,"Let me see if I can... this is a question, of course, I considered as soon as I started on this case."
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.703,1309.554,How does it do that?
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1309.554,1327.607,"Well, it's been my view, and there's no case law on this that I know of, but it's been my view that it is appropriate and proper for a State to say not only must the corporation be a Maine corporation, which this statute does require, but that it's got to do something in the State of Maine."
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1333.12,1341.935,"Can we get back to the question of how people situated as your client is, how they're harmed."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1341.935,1342.326,Yes.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1342.326,1358.706,"Because we've already established that at least for this category of camp they're not going to change the composition of the people who come to them, and we don't know whether any such entities that would decide to take--"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1358.706,1360.028,Right.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1360.028,1360.479,--We just don't know that.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1360.479,1360.919,Yes.
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1360.919,1365.03,So what is... what other harm are you complaining about?
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1365.03,1365.881,Well--
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.881,1367.833,You're complaining about the tax.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1367.833,1368.864,--Complaining about the--
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.864,1372.016,"You're out of pocket, I suppose is your big complaint."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1372.016,1372.995,"--Well, but I mean, that's right, Justice Scalia."
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1372.995,1374.056,"Yes, but you can't--"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1374.056,1385.082,"In other words, we are suffering a financial loss, and what the record does show is that part of that is passed on to the campers and part of it detracts from the ability of the camp to perform certain services."
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1391.828,1403.004,"--But if you're just complaining about, there's this tax and you don't like to pay it, suppose Maine has a higher sales tax than other States, and it could cost you more to operate in Maine because of that?"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1403.004,1417.865,"No, but if... if the sales tax or the real estate tax or any tax is imposed upon an organization because it serves too many people from out of the State... a hotel, a motel, any kind of a service... a grocery store."
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1431.464,1436.848,But you're not competing with charities that serve Maine people.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1441.409,1442.721,"Well, I'm--"
1996.94-1988,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1442.721,1449.257,"Because you just started out by saying, no, we wouldn't change... our camp is for Christian Scientists from all over the United States."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1449.257,1457.201,"--No, but just... now, that point has been made by the law court that we're not really in competition with anybody else because we serve just Christian Scientists."
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1475.043,1477.433,"You're competing to give away money, not to make a profit."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1489.973,1510.836,"Justice Scalia, nonprofits are nursing homes... just looking at the way that nursing homes operate, or any kind of a treatment facility, any kind of nonprofits, they are in competition for contributions, they are in competition to build up their staffs, they're in... you've got the evidence of their competition every day in the mails."
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1544.616,1556.076,"Could it do it by saying every organization, that every charitable organization that serves the citizens of this State gets a $1 deduction from its income tax each time it serves a citizen of the State?"
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1556.935,1557.797,"No, I don't think so."
1996.94-1988,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1557.797,1559.477,I think it could.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1559.477,1560.688,"Well, I--"
1996.94-1988,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1560.688,1584.395,"Well, as I understand, your argument is, even if you lose on this point about the parity of competition, your argument, as I understand it, is essentially the same, because you say, number 1 you can't draw a charitable versus for-profit distinction because in fact they are both businesses in a given place, and number 2, even apart from competition, you are discouraging interstate activity."
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1584.395,1585.125,--Exactly.
1996.94-1988,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1585.125,1586.104,And that's the essence--
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1586.104,1586.915,Exactly.
1996.94-1988,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1587.947,1588.678,--Yes.
1996.94-1988,0,44444,william_h_dempsey,,1602.295,1613.133,"In that case, with each citizen armed with a voucher to go wherever, there would be no incentive on the part of any camp to limit its service to non-State people."
1996.94-1988,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.849,1639.83,"Very well, Mr. Dempsey."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1642.591,1647.226,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.94-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1708.044,1713.908,"You're asserting that, unlike other tax exemptions, this is a quid pro quo type of tax exemption."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1721.362,1733.1,"--Fundamentally, Justice Scalia, that is one of my arguments, that this is like the market participant exemption in Hughes v. Alexandria' Scrap and the Massachusetts Council case involving the City of Boston."
1996.94-1988,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1733.1,1751.612,"So it's like, for example, we give a special exemption to our farmers, only to our local farmers because they keep the land green and they in addition provide employment, and they maintain the State as primarily agricultural."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1753.125,1754.914,"Justice Breyer, this is--"
1996.94-1988,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1754.914,1756.787,--for discriminating against out-of-State farmers?
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1756.787,1760.328,--This actually is quite unlike that kind of a subsidy or--
1996.94-1988,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1760.328,1761.24,"Oh, I understand that."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1775.408,1780.401,"--I don't think so when we're talking about exemptions for charities, and the reasons are these."
1996.94-1988,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1794.982,1816.505,"And that means, then, that in fact the hungry in other States, the children who want to travel to the local hospital across State lines, the people who want to travel across State lines to get an education, all of the different people out of State that want to use commerce to take advantage in-State... you see, I'm saying, so?"
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1816.505,1817.236,The--
1996.94-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1817.236,1820.068,Or weekend canoeing at Camp Okefenokee.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1836.978,1845.383,"--Well, the second distinction is that the other exemptions that are addressed by this Court... for example, in West Lynn Creamery, there were two problems with that."
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1852.029,1853.411,"Well, why is there no competitive advantage?"
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1862.306,1869.358,"--Well, of course, the fundamental discrimination that we draw is between for-profit camps and nonprofit camps that receive an exemption."
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1869.358,1870.67,But they're competing.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1870.67,1872.862,"There's also competition there, Justice Stevens, and--"
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1872.862,1876.595,But let me... I just want to challenge you on your no competitive advantage.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1887.792,1891.435,"--Well, part of the answer I think is, what is the competition?"
1996.94-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.473,1906.455,"Actually, you dispense more charity by losing more money, I assume."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1921.635,1929.76,"--Of course, universities in Maine are under a separate section of the statute and this provision we're talking about which, primarily, benefits doesn't apply to them."
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1929.76,1932.932,"Yes, but they can be under this section of the statute if you win the case."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1932.932,1935.533,If the State legislature were to so determine.
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1935.533,1936.034,Right.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1949.112,1950.403,"Well, we haven't done that."
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1950.403,1952.593,"No, but you can, can't you, if you win this case?"
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1952.593,1954.814,It's legislative discretion.
1996.94-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.96,1961.94,That's not so scary.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1979.171,1980.724,"They could do that, Justice Scalia."
1996.94-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.724,1983.976,So this horrible can come about no matter how we come out in this case.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1983.976,1986.528,There is no constitutional right to a tax exemption.
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1986.528,1990.899,"No, but they couldn't give the subsidy to a church camp, could they?"
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1990.899,1993.43,Ah.
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1994.722,1995.263,Yes.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,1995.263,1999.444,And I would like to address the Walz question because that has been brought up in the reply brief.
1996.94-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2116.952,2123.888,"Mr. Plouffe, what is the cut off for being... serving... for qualifying for this exemption?"
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2131.042,2139.779,"Justice Ginsburg, the statute says principally benefits, and throughout the course of this litigation we have treated this as being 51 percent."
1996.94-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2151.51,2159.884,"Let me stay where the division is, because do I understand the statute to work this way: we have two camps, say, for the blind."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2177.085,2187.12,"That would be up to the local assessor, who acts as an agent of the State, to determine whether or not the 50-50 meets the test of principally--"
1996.94-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2187.12,2192.365,"Well, let's make it 60-40 so we won't run into that problem, 40 percent from Maine, 60 percent from outside."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2192.365,2192.994,--That--
1996.94-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2192.994,2194.125,No exemption at all.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2194.125,2206.644,"--That would be true if... if the nonexempt entity chose to be insular, not to provide any other services to the surrounding people, and that's one of the problems in this case."
1996.94-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2208.845,2231.799,"I'm not sure I... it's a camp for the blind, and it serves the same number of Maine people as the camp that serves only Maine people, but it's a larger camp so it also takes in a lot of people from out of State, so it's rendering exactly the same benefits to the State of Maine, but it's also including these other people."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2231.799,2233.702,--Let me answer your question directly.
1996.94-1988,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2281.444,2285.354,But a camp that served just Maine residents would not have to do that.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2285.354,2289.649,"A camp, because they would already be serving Maine people--"
1996.94-1988,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2289.649,2292.19,So you're right back to where you started.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2294.941,2302.505,"--There's discrimination drawn, Justice Kennedy, based on the benefit to Maine people or no benefit to Maine people--"
1996.94-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2302.505,2303.887,How long has this law been in effect?
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2317.026,2320.267,--The provision that we are arguing about--
1996.94-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2320.267,2323.088,Maybe we should strike it down for foolishness or something.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2326.061,2328.732,--The provision that we're arguing about was enacted in 1957.
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2392.595,2401.032,"Well, I think you... we accept the fact that the Fourteenth Amendment is a much more lenient standard of review on these matters of economic regulation than the Commerce Clause."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2419.643,2426.028,"I understand, Your Honor, that the Court can and in this case is looking at this under the Commerce Clause."
1996.94-1988,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2426.028,2429.779,"And in looking at it, what test do we apply?"
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2438.886,2452.565,"If we choose not to use something like the market participant exception, and therefore apply the dormant Commerce Clause to it, then the question is, is it, per se, a flexible approach, and the law court chose the flexible approach."
1996.94-1988,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2477.351,2491.058,"Well, but if you concede that even nonprofit organizations can engage in interstate commerce you can certainly look at this, let's say, in the nursing home context as being facially discriminatory."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2491.058,2494.621,"--I respectfully disagree, Justice O'Connor."
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2517.626,2518.377,May I ask--
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2518.377,2519.308,There's the target.
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2521.41,2526.674,--Do you think the people benefited do not include the church that runs the camp?
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2526.674,2535.477,"I'm not sure that I understand the question, Justice Stevens."
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.477,2542.874,"Well, you say... you look at the people benefited, and I just suggest one of the people benefited would be whatever the charity it is that gets the benefit of an exemption."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2542.874,2550.368,"The Christian Science Church in Boston, for example, the church is actually owned by a separate Maine corporation."
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2550.368,2555.102,And supposing it... just focus on the church for a minute.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2571.221,2575.184,"Well, again, I think that under Walz churches are treated differently by the Court."
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2575.184,2577.505,And we have a church here.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2577.505,2578.406,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2578.406,2580.177,We have a religious organization here.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2580.177,2584.41,We have a nonprofit Maine corporation that is not itself a church.
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2587.733,2588.474,I see.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2588.474,2589.583,--and the 50 percent just doesn't apply.
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2606.494,2611.438,"I see, but let me ask one other... you place so much emphasis on the fact that it's a real estate tax."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2627.468,2630.349,"I think I have a couple of responses to that, Justice Stevens."
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2635.494,2638.207,"Well, under... just confine our analysis to the Commerce Clause--"
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2638.207,2640.177,"--and would have under Green Acre B'hai, which is the main case."
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2652.214,2657.598,"--Well, the interest would be to encourage local commerce, encourage transactions within the State, encourage the local economy."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2657.598,2661.531,I do not think that that would survive.
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2662.601,2668.975,"Well, supposing there were two camps, not charitable camps but just for-profit camps."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2677.4,2680.643,--I don't think it would.
1996.94-1988,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2682.934,2684.106,Sure it would.
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2695.502,2714.596,"--I... again, if it's real estate, then I don't think it's facial, that it's an indirect effect on interstate commerce, and because it's indirect, you look at it under the flexible approach, but I think it would fail under the flexible approach because it would not... I can't conceive of a legitimate state interest, for example, in the motel situation that's raised in the reply brief."

1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2802.544,2817.452,"Mr. Plouffe, could you... going back to Justice Stevens' hypothetical, could you explain to me why it is in the case of the two profit-making corporations as to which a distinction is made the discrimination would not have been facial?"
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2822.766,2837.826,"I think because we're talking about real estate, and we have never applied the Commerce Clause to the taxation of real estate which doesn't move across State lines, that effects that a tax on real estate, or an exemption from a tax on real estate have on interstate commerce are indirect."
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2837.826,2839.717,Why the fact that real estate doesn't move across State lines?
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2841.84,2844.511,"Well, the language of the positive Commerce Clause--"
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2844.511,2851.644,"I mean, interstate commerce is going to be affected whether you're doing it through a real estate tax or any other form of taxation."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2861.992,2866.173,"--Perhaps I have a narrow view of the dormant Commerce Clause, but--"
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2866.173,2868.977,Isn't it the effect on interstate commerce that we're concerned with?
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2868.977,2872.768,"--We are, but the question becomes, is it per se a flexible one."
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2885.207,2894.733,"Directness and indirectness hasn't got anything to do with the fact that it's real estate that's being taxed, number 1, and number 2, I don't know where the direct-indirect distinction comes from."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2894.733,2901.826,"--Well, I think that the tax on real estate may or may not be incorporated into the charge made by the for-profit organization."
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2928.945,2933.168,"Well, nobody is arguing that you're going to treat consumers as articles of commerce."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2950.499,2952.63,"Well, they... I think they did in their first brief."
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2954.663,2962.287,"It escaped me, but it's clear in any event that they have abandoned any such attempt if they ever made it, isn't it?"
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2962.287,2969.293,--They certainly have not abandoned the attempt to say that the travel of these campers across State lines is protected by the Commerce Clause.
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2969.293,2972.405,"Well, I... are you challenging that assumption?"
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2972.405,2975.357,I certainly am attesting that... challenging that.
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2975.357,2977.608,Interstate travel is not protected under the Commerce Clause?
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2977.608,2983.733,I don't read Heart of Atlanta or Edwards for the proposition put forth by the petitioners.
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2983.733,2989.786,Do you think that interstate travel has an effect on interstate commerce?
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,2989.786,2994.798,"I think the provision of interstate travel by bus companies, for example, does."
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2997.209,3002.295,"Wouldn't these campers perhaps arrive in Maine by bus, or by plane, or by train, or some such means?"
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,3002.295,3004.716,--But we're not taxing the plane or the bus or the train.
1996.94-1988,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3004.716,3013.762,"No, but we're asking whether interstate commerce is affected, and if it's affected by bus travel, then I suppose this is a case in which it's affected."
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,3013.762,3024.168,"And I'm suggesting that it would be an indirect effect and subject to the flexible approach, but I still do not read those two cases for the proposition for which they want them to stand."

1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,3063.645,3076.541,"My argument goes so far as to cover an exemption from income taxes, which was the case in Regan, Federal income taxes, excise taxes, if they would pay... having occasion to pay them, and sales taxes."
1996.94-1988,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3090.762,3091.942,Do we--
1996.94-1988,1,45789,william_l_plouffe,,3091.942,3097.626,"--that it's under market participation, because in each one of those cases the State is asking something in return."
1996.94-1988,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3107.623,3113.887,--We would never think of accusing the State of Maine of provincialism.
