1987.86-6284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument now in Number 86-6284, John T. Satterwhite v. Texas."
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,12.641,15.86,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-6284,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,67.192,68.994,Was that by court order?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,68.994,70.846,"Yes, sir, it was."
1987.86-6284,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,108.019,113.023,This is the same Dr. Grigson that appears in every Texas case or did appear?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,113.023,113.673,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-6284,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,113.673,115.475,Is he now deceased?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,115.475,115.808,No.
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,122.462,132.235,"Mr. Woods, what's the role of defense counsel in connection with one of these examinations by a psychiatrist in Texas?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,132.235,141.074,"Justice, the role as far as the defense counsel would be is to determine or to at least advise the client of the scope of the examination."
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,146.977,154.266,The attorney doesn't actually sit in and participate at the time of the examination.
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,154.266,157.552,"Such a request, of course, was not made and I don't think the attorney would necessarily--"
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.552,159.654,"But it doesn't normally occur, is that right?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,159.654,162.772,"--No, I don't think so."
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.772,173.878,It would simply be a matter of consultation of some kind with the defendant in advance of the examination?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,173.878,180.215,To let him know what the ramifications could possibly be as to the examination.
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,180.215,189.422,"Now, there were two other doctors appointed in this instance to examine Mr. Satterwhite, is that right?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,189.422,190.289,Yes.
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.291,198.278,"And in each case, did his attorney advise... were you representing him below?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,198.278,199.461,"Yes, I was."
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.461,203.83,Did you talk to him in advance of those... each of those examinations?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,203.83,204.949,I was not advised.
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.519,214.555,There was a psychologist who did.
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,214.555,215.99,Dr. Betty Lou Schroeder.
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,215.99,221.811,"Yes, and did you talk to Mr. Satterwhite before that examination?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,221.811,228.13,"Dr. Schroeder examined Mr. Satterwhite on March 16th, before I was appointed to represent him."
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,228.13,230.916,And not again?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,230.916,238.153,The testimony that was elicited in the trial shows that she talked to him on several occasions.
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,242.474,245.592,That testimony is not challenged.
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,245.592,259.983,"Well, basically, it is challenged, but, of course, it's challenged through the means of the complaint of Dr. Grigson, because of Dr. Grigson's impact on the jury, which, of course, is buttressed by the state's argument."
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,286.134,290.621,"Now, what was the April 18th order signed by the Court?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,290.621,293.407,--That was the... there was an order signed.
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,302.179,303.679,And you knew about that order?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,303.679,304.798,"No, ma'am."
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,304.798,305.798,Never?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,305.798,307.098,Did not... was not told.
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,307.749,308.899,Never looked at the file?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,308.899,310.951,I saw the file several times.
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.951,313.051,You did not see that order in the file?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,313.051,318.455,"Well, I can only tell you from my own personal observation and knowledge, I didn't see that order in the file--"
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,318.455,320.14,But it was there?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,320.14,330.596,"--Well, I tell you, I saw the file on, I can say, two occasions, both of which I did not see the order in the file nor did I see Dr. Grigson's letter that he wrote on May 3rd."
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.596,332.448,I'm talking about the April 18th order.
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,332.448,342.404,"The April 18th order did not surface until after, I'd say it was, about the middle of May, and that's when I prepared several motions which were filed May 29th."
1987.86-6284,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,342.404,343.756,Isn't there a copy of that for each case?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,343.756,352.361,"The entry of a docket sheet as to that particular order, if made, and I don't have it in front of me right now, was not necessarily entered, as I could see."
1987.86-6284,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,352.361,354.178,"Well, has it ever been entered?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,354.178,355.063,I don't remember.
1987.86-6284,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,356.513,365.753,"I suppose if it's on the docket, entered on the docket sheet and there's a date on it, that's what you usually look at to see what's in a file."
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,365.753,366.955,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-6284,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,366.955,367.821,Did you look at it?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,367.821,368.321,I looked.
1987.86-6284,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,370.573,372.442,"Well, don't you think you ought to look at the docket sheet?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,372.442,385.833,"--Well, that's true, but, Your Honor, the point is that in examining the file... first of all, the order that was presented in front of the Judge, after I was appointed as counsel, was not even... in fact, I was not even provided any notice for it."
1987.86-6284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,387.119,398.39,"Wouldn't Texas practice ordinarily provide that if there's an attorney of record for the Defendant, that a copy of that... at least a proposed formal order would be served?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,398.39,399.342,"--As far as I'm concerned, yes."
1987.86-6284,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,403.878,405.413,What date were you appointed?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,405.413,408.282,"April 10th, I believe, yes."
1987.86-6284,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,408.898,412.234,Was April 18th the order serviced?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,412.234,416.186,--That's the date the order was signed by the Judge.
1987.86-6284,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,416.186,418.471,And you didn't see it until May some time?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,418.471,420.94,I didn't see it until mid-May.
1987.86-6284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,420.94,423.625,Is this the Schroeder order or the Grigson order?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,423.625,425.494,This is actually the Holbrook order.
1987.86-6284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,432.397,440.253,I thought that the order pursuant to which Schroeder examined your client was entered before you were appointed.
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,440.253,441.186,"Yes, sir."
1987.86-6284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,445.221,447.507,What order is it we're talking about?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,452.477,457.196,The contents of the order on April 18th dealt with the appointment of Drs.
1987.86-6284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,468.321,474.657,"You're not directly challenging either the Holbrook or the other expert testimony, are you?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,474.657,477.259,There was no expert testimony from Holbrook.
1987.86-6284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,477.259,479.294,"Well, then, the other, the Schroeder."
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,479.294,481.161,I am effectively challenging--
1987.86-6284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,481.161,487.298,You're not saying that it was a violation of the Sixth Amendment to have permitted her to testify?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,487.298,498.44,"--Her testimony came in based upon her examination at a time prior to counsel being appointed and then, as she testified, at a time after counsel was appointed."
1987.86-6284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,506.629,510.414,"But, now, was that point raised in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,510.414,513.932,The point was raised more towards Dr. Grigson than it was--
1987.86-6284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,513.932,516.467,"Much more, almost to the exclusion of--"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,516.467,517.586,--I'll have to agree.
1987.86-6284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,518.436,526.359,"--So, but, now, do you challenge the Schroeder testimony here, not having challenged it in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,526.359,529.911,"Well, it was challenged in the Motion for Rehearing in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals."
1987.86-6284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,529.911,533.346,And what did the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals do with the Motion for Rehearing?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,533.346,534.529,They did not write an opinion.
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,538.25,545.654,"Now, when was the order appointing Dr. Grigson entered by the Court, do you know?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,545.654,549.106,There was no order for Dr. Grigson ever submitted.
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,551.224,556.544,"Well, the Court did something or he wouldn't have made examination presumably."
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,556.544,562.615,--The Court... Dr. Grigson acted in the stead of Dr. Holbrook.
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,562.615,565.067,Relying on the appointment of Dr. Holbrook.
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,565.067,565.8,"Yes, ma'am."
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,565.8,567.269,Did they practice together?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,569.119,571.638,I don't recall where exactly Dr. Holbrook is from.
1987.86-6284,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,576.208,585.398,"--At the beginning of the argument, I asked you whether Dr. Grigson's examination was pursuant to court order, and I thought you said yes."
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,585.398,587.85,"Well, of course, technically, he was not in the body of the order."
1987.86-6284,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,599.371,604.792,"Do you accept that, that he was examining him pursuant to some order?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,604.792,612.048,"I can only accept that because he wrote a letter to the trial judge on May 8th, about five days after he examined the Defendant."
1987.86-6284,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,612.048,615.833,Is there any court order which specifically names Dr. Grigson?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,615.833,617.785,There is not.
1987.86-6284,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,617.785,623.439,Did the same judge that appointed you sign the order of April 18th?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,623.439,624.823,Yes.
1987.86-6284,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,624.823,627.058,And didn't send you a copy after he appointed you?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,627.058,631.593,No copy.
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,647.471,650.006,"Well, Mr. Woods, let me ask you this."
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,673.337,677.657,"If Dr. Grigson did not testify, I may not be here today."
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,677.657,678.373,Why not?
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,683.744,694.119,"If Dr. Grigson had, as was in Barefoot v. Texas, if Dr. Grigson had, in fact,... notice been provided to counsel and he did examine him--"
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,694.119,697.404,"No, no, no notice provided to you."
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,706.677,710.462,"--Well, if the state didn't use the testimony, of course, there's no harm to the Defendant."
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,710.462,715.032,"So, we do apply harmless error then in the question?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,715.032,716.282,"Well, I believe you'd almost have to, yes."
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,716.282,718.984,"Then, why shouldn't we apply harmless error here?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,718.984,728.506,"Well, I have seen some decisions which this Court has... there seems to be a trend towards harmless error doctrine or Chapman towards these cases in which--"
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,728.506,730.875,"So, you don't object to that really?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,730.875,734.51,"--Well, because of the trends of the Court and the law of this land, I would say no."
1987.86-6284,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,734.51,739.898,"And it would be your submission then that in this case, error was not harmless?"
1987.86-6284,0,40825,richard_d_woods,,739.898,743.516,Exactly.
1987.86-6284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.885,900.135,"Thank you, Mr. Woods."
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,906.389,912.376,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-6284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,966.779,973.683,You don't suggest that your opposition has abandoned the notion that it was harmful?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,973.683,974.35,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-6284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,974.35,975.452,No.
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,975.452,986.258,"One of the arguments made at some length in the amicus brief was that this particular type of error can never be harmless, and I understand that argument to be abandoned."
1987.86-6284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.258,988.41,Do you think we're bound by that abandonment?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1002.869,1003.652,"He was, Your Honor."
1987.86-6284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1003.652,1008.106,And doesn't the state him because he's particularly persuasive to juries?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1010.725,1012.927,I don't know what Dr. Grigson's record is.
1987.86-6284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1020.097,1023.299,Because they believe he'll be persuasive to the jury.
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1023.299,1023.999,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-6284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.999,1030.119,And do we have any reason to doubt that he was persuasive to the jury in this case?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1030.119,1031.905,No reason to doubt it.
1987.86-6284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.905,1034.007,"Then, how could we say it was harmless?"
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1035.79,1037.959,"Well, for a number of reasons."
1987.86-6284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.139,1061.924,Wasn't he the only doctor who testified on that issue?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1061.924,1064.276,He was the only medical doctor.
1987.86-6284,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1093.962,1101.116,"You feel that his testimony on a scale of one to ten, he's a ten plus?"
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1101.116,1101.818,"Your Honor, I--"
1987.86-6284,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1101.818,1104.437,It would not be harmful in any way?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1104.437,1106.12,--I would not agree with that.
1987.86-6284,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1134.789,1137.574,Is Dr. Grigson alive?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1137.574,1138.658,"As far as I know, Your Honor."
1987.86-6284,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1140.11,1142.978,"As far as you know, he is alive right now?"
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1145.93,1146.964,"--Again, Your Honor, I don't know."
1987.86-6284,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1157.07,1162.523,"Mr. Palmer, what... where do we find the court order appointing Dr. Grigson?"
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1162.523,1165.158,There is no court order appointing Dr. Grigson.
1987.86-6284,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1178.901,1181.937,Were they practicing psychiatry together?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1181.937,1187.591,"Your Honor, I do not know, and I don't want to represent that as a fact to the Court, but I'm under the impression that they were."
1987.86-6284,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1193.195,1203.683,Is there any evidence of record that defense counsel was sent a copy or otherwise served with a copy of that April 18th order?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1203.683,1206.818,"--No, Your Honor."
1987.86-6284,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1206.818,1211.039,Do you think that is a requirement?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1215.158,1228.834,"Certainly, Your Honor, and we have argued that counsel is effectively put on notice by the fact that the court order was filed in the record of the case, was filed the same day it was entered, April 18th, some two weeks prior to the examination."
1987.86-6284,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1228.834,1241.642,"But is that ordinary practice in Texas, that you expect a lawyer for a party to the case to be bound by an order of which he had never seen a copy, that was simply put in the case file?"
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1241.642,1245.36,"Again, Your Honor, I'm not aware of what's ordinary practice statewide."
1987.86-6284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1254.799,1260.37,Was the Defendant required to submit for the examination?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1260.37,1261.222,"No, he was not."
1987.86-6284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1262.655,1269.376,"Well, but he did and I suppose that counsel might have advised him not to submit."
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1269.376,1271.511,--He might have.
1987.86-6284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.451,1312.155,How could he have discussed the possible future examinations when they hadn't even been requested?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1312.155,1316.976,"At the time counsel was appointed, there had been one examination requested and performed."
1987.86-6284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.976,1324.545,"Yes, but I know, but you're saying that the client should have told the lawyer that another examination which hadn't even been requested might take place."
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1324.545,1330.549,"I'm saying, Your Honor, that competent counsel would tell his client, hey, don't let them do this to you again."
1987.86-6284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1333.568,1340.472,"Well, more likely, if the counsel is told, he would say, well, I guess that phase of it is over, they aren't going to do it again."
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1340.472,1341.707,"That's possible, Your Honor."
1987.86-6284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1341.707,1344.043,Wouldn't you sort of think that?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1347.245,1348.211,Perhaps so.
1987.86-6284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.211,1349.095,Yeah.
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1356.767,1359.969,It was in the file as of April 18th.
1987.86-6284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1359.969,1361.255,"Well, now, where do you get that?"
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1365.456,1368.758,The order is in the transcript before the Court.
1987.86-6284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1375.162,1376.864,Is there a docket sheet?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1377.797,1378.114,No.
1987.86-6284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1389.988,1396.678,"Do you disbelieve the representation to us that when he looked at it, it wasn't there?"
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1396.678,1402.296,I have no reason to disbelieve Mr. Woods on any point.
1987.86-6284,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1405.949,1407.716,Where is it now?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1407.716,1415.222,"It's in the transcript which is in the Court's possession, along with the entire trial records."
1987.86-6284,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1415.222,1422.876,"All it says is it was filed and you don't know where it was filed, do you?"
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1422.876,1423.745,The file is maintained--
1987.86-6284,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1423.745,1426.045,It must have been filed in the Judge's file.
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1426.045,1426.863,"--No, Your Honor."
1987.86-6284,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1428.713,1432.351,Does it have a court trial on it?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1434.784,1440.255,"It has a stamp saying it's filed by the District Clerk's Office, yes."
1987.86-6284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.255,1448.793,Was there a finding by the Texas Court that it was on file?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1448.793,1449.693,I don't--
1987.86-6284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1449.693,1456.466,"I mean, what I'm saying, if Mr. Woods is wrong about, you know, if he says it wasn't there, maybe that should have been raised before the Texas Court?"
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1457.866,1460.334,--There was not a specific finding one way or the other.
1987.86-6284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.007,1473.928,Why is that implicit in the decision?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1473.928,1479.998,"Because, as a matter of record, the thing was filed and was stamped filed."
1987.86-6284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1502.345,1508.934,Part of your submission was that the lack of notice was irrelevant as long as the order is on file.
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1514.403,1516.321,That is our first argument.
1987.86-6284,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1517.957,1519.823,Has this Court ever held that?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1519.823,1522.159,"No, Your Honor."
1987.86-6284,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1522.159,1523.159,Has the Texas Court ever held that?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1523.159,1526.211,I'm not aware that they have.
1987.86-6284,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1526.211,1537.684,"So much would depend on local practice, it seems to me, and there's really no representation or anything very authoritative here about what the practice in Texas is."
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1537.684,1539.136,"That is true, Your Honor."
1987.86-6284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1539.136,1541.103,What city was this in?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1541.103,1541.888,San Antonio.
1987.86-6284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1541.888,1542.572,San Antonio.
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1544.607,1545.907,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-6284,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1545.907,1555.896,"I mean, you usually don't run over to the Clerk's office every day to see what's been filed in the cases that you are involved in."
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1555.896,1570.655,"Well, assuming for the sake of argument that this examination was conducted in violation of Satterwhite's right to counsel, we would submit that certainly in this record any error was harmless."
1987.86-6284,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1570.655,1576.911,Do you know whether or not we possibly got a copy of that order of April 18th?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1576.911,1579.278,The record is silent on that.
1987.86-6284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.278,1586.867,"Well, we do know that Dr. Grigson must have because on May 8th, he wrote a letter to the Judge reporting on the results of his examination."
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1586.867,1587.534,This is true.
1987.86-6284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.534,1593.271,Does the record tell us whether a copy of Dr. Grigson's letter to the Judge went to the Defendant or his counsel?
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1593.271,1598.242,"I don't know that it does, Your Honor."
1987.86-6284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.242,1599.792,I couldn't find any indication of it.
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1599.792,1609.216,"But, again, the letter was placed in the file on that same day."
1987.86-6284,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1818.684,1832.127,"Mr. Palmer, this... the testimony of Dr. Grigson, though, was the... am I correct that it was the only expert testimony by a psychiatric on the matter of future dangerousness?"
1987.86-6284,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1832.127,1836.515,"That is true, Your Honor."
1987.86-6284,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.248,1839.231,"Thank you, Mr. Palmer."
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,1841.767,1842.669,I'll be short.
1987.86-6284,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1877.64,1880.96,"Well, now, does this ordinarily require a motion?"
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,1885.579,1887.031,The practice has been.
1987.86-6284,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1892.934,1902.473,"But supposing the state wants an examination of a defendant by an expert witness, is that ordinarily accomplished by a motion under Texas procedure?"
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,1902.473,1903.84,"Yes, sir, it is."
1987.86-6284,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.84,1907.009,Not just an order filed by the judge?
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,1907.009,1910.044,"It's usually a practice of a motion and an order, is what I've seen."
1987.86-6284,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1910.044,1916.467,"But, here, I gather, at least there's no record of any motion having been made and just the order filed?"
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,1916.467,1921.935,I believe there was a motion and an order both signed by... the motion was signed by the prosecutor and the order was signed.
1987.86-6284,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1921.935,1924.954,"Was it in one document, a motion and an order?"
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,1924.954,1925.356,No.
1987.86-6284,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1926.373,1932.643,And you say that the defense attorney got... was served copies of neither the motion nor the order?
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,1932.643,1934.261,That's correct.
1987.86-6284,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.261,1940.332,"Well, the purpose of the examination was for what?"
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,1940.332,1941.482,To determine whether or not--
1987.86-6284,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.482,1942.198,Competence?
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,1942.198,1947.819,"--Competency and future dangerousness, and the body of that motion and order of that."
1987.86-6284,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1947.819,1966.198,"But if there's some question of competence, I suppose the district judge or the trial judge has got some obligation of his own to respond, if there's some question in his mind about competency, wholly aside from any motion."
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,1968.8,1981.409,"Justice, that's correct, except in this case, there was no raising of the issue of competency whatsoever by the Defendant, by his counsel being myself, or by anybody except the prosecutor."
1987.86-6284,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1984.694,1994.983,"Mr. Woods, is there no local rule of practice governing notice to be given to counsel in criminal cases?"
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,1994.983,1999.954,I know of no such rule which says that no notice has to be given to opposing counsel.
1987.86-6284,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1999.954,2004.941,"Well, do you know of a rule that says notice must be given?"
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,2004.941,2008.06,"I can't say that there is a specific local rule that says that, ma'am, no."
1987.86-6284,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2008.06,2010.177,Have you checked the local rules?
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,2010.177,2013.797,"I have read the local rules before, but I don't recall anything such as that."
1987.86-6284,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2013.797,2016.08,"Not in preparation for this case, I take it?"
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,2016.08,2017.998,"Well, certainly not that."
1987.86-6284,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.998,2035.544,"Well, you know, when your opposing party makes a motion, not necessarily in a capital case, but just in the run-of-the-mind criminal case, in a run-of-the-mind civil case, doesn't he ordinarily serve opposing counsel with a copy of the motion?"
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,2035.544,2036.594,Absolutely.
1987.86-6284,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2044.816,2048.101,"Doesn't that practice pertain in criminal cases, too?"
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,2048.101,2054.339,"Everywhere I've practiced in the criminal courts and also civil courts, that practice has always been maintained."
1987.86-6284,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2054.339,2062.71,"Beyond that, isn't it also typical in your motion to include a proof of service or some kind of an indication that the opposing counsel received notice?"
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,2062.71,2063.226,That's correct.
1987.86-6284,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.646,2065.795,The record doesn't show that.
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,2065.795,2066.246,"--Yes, sir."
1987.86-6284,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2079.755,2087.327,"Mr. Woods, you had been appointed ten days before the order of April 18th."
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,2087.327,2088.245,Eight days.
1987.86-6284,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2088.245,2089.679,Eight days before.

1987.86-6284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2111.377,2116.579,"Maybe your appointment was just noted, put in the file, and no notice sent to him."
1987.86-6284,2,40825,richard_d_woods,,2116.579,2120.066,They let me go my way.
1987.86-6284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.066,2123.352,"Yes, but the judge, it was the same judge, so the judge certainly knew it."
