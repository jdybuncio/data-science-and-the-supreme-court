1983.82-5279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.886,We will hear arguments first this morning in Dixson against the United States and the consolidated case.
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,12.429,36.785,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court, the issue before the Court is whether petitioners as employees of a community-based, non-profit corporation, United Neighborhoods, Incorporated, UNI, constituted public officials according to the bribery statute."
1983.82-5279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,120.26,127.484,"Did their agency, the local agency have a contract with the United States government?"
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,127.484,135.969,The contract was between the city of Peoria and the United States government.
1983.82-5279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,414.211,419.514,"Mr. Morano, is this argument directed to the phrase in the statute"
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,423.267,424.499,Yes.
1983.82-5279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,464.395,467.177,But not... Let's take them one at a time.
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,478.872,495.095,"--But, see, these are... we are talking about actual government bodies in government or any agency or branch of the government thereof, but these are--"
1983.82-5279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.095,495.944,But--
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,495.944,497.626,"--This one is acting on behalf of these, you see."
1983.82-5279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,497.626,499.307,--But are we talking about them?
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,524.134,526.104,"Yes, I understand what you are saying."
1983.82-5279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,554.073,557.556,"Well, I suppose the grain inspectors are an example."
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,578.029,584.434,"--But I think that the grain inspector, wouldn't the grain inspector be acting for the Agriculture Department?"
1983.82-5279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,623.228,636.517,"Mr. Morano, did the UNI do any of the work itself in any occasion, or was it always a mere conduit for the federal funds?"
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,636.517,645.363,It had no relationship whatsoever with the federal government save for the federal source of the funds.
1983.82-5279,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,645.363,650.055,Did it ever do any of the rehabilitation work itself?
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,650.055,656.36,It did all of the rehabilitation work.
1983.82-5279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,744.877,753.853,"Mr. Morano, may I just make sure I understand?"
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,764.091,764.85,"Oh, I see what you mean."
1983.82-5279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,767.692,770.265,--They didn't actually do any of the--
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,770.265,772.526,"They did have volunteers, though."
1983.82-5279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,778.701,779.309,--I see.
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,779.309,785.764,"--but this wasn't... you see, there were volunteers, community-based volunteers, and there were other things which--"
1983.82-5279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,785.764,786.154,I see.
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,786.154,788.806,--UNI continued to carry on all kinds of activities.
1983.82-5279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,788.806,792.289,So they did actually some physical rehabilitation work--
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,792.289,792.67,Yes.
1983.82-5279,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,792.67,795.5,--with their own personnel as well as contracting work out?
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,797.41,802.326,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."
1983.82-5279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,999.583,1017.426,"Do you think the Congress could have authorized the federal agency itself in Washington to go out and do all this community rehabilitation, awarding the contracts directly through federal employees?"
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1024.509,1055.521,"There might be a problem of... I mean, the... I haven't thought that through, but my guess might be that there might be a problem between of the... a dispute between the legislative and executive branches of the government that this is... this sounds a little bit maybe too socialistic for the usual way in which Congress operates."
1983.82-5279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1055.521,1075.253,"Well, in this instance, Congress created an agency which was authorized by Congress to make grants in the communities and allow the grantee of that community to carry out the rehabilitation of housing."
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1076.134,1077.296,Yes.
1983.82-5279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1077.296,1087.2,"Well, then, wasn't everything that was being done being done on behalf of the United States?"
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1087.2,1106.875,I think that the history of the Act shows that this would be giving too broad a scope to acting on behalf of the United States.
1983.82-5279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1159.351,1176.692,"The initiative began with the local community asking the federal government for some money, and then the federal government gave the money, so that it was entirely paid for by the federal government, was it not?"
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1176.692,1183.127,"Yes, Justice, it was entirely paid for by the federal government."
1983.82-5279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1183.127,1200.528,"Then on the second... on the disjunctive aspect of what Justice Rehnquist read to you, isn't all this conduct by these people being done on behalf of the United States?"
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1200.528,1216.877,"I don't think, Justice Burger, in terms of the legislative history of these words, that we should give such a broad construction--"
1983.82-5279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1216.877,1222.57,"Well, let's forget about the legislative history and see whether the language of the statute is clear."
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1226.904,1229.506,"--That's true, Justice."
1983.82-5279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1303.806,1312.901,"Mr. Morano, suppose the UNI just took the money and bought a yacht with it?"
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1316.053,1320.175,"Yes, there would, Justice Marshall."
1983.82-5279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1320.175,1321.707,There would be?
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1327.17,1365.476,"As I have tried to delineate with these government controlled corporations, UNI does not qualify as a government controlled corporation; however, audits were regularly allowed by the Secretary of HUD, and if there is a misuse of the funds, then funds can be adjusted, withdrawn, or reduced in terms of this information."
1983.82-5279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1365.476,1369.109,Can anybody be put in jail for taking federal money?
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1369.109,1372.829,Not unless there is a criminal statute.
1983.82-5279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1372.829,1388.58,"Well, my hypothetical is, they took the federal money and bought a yacht with it, and I am asking you, is that legal or illegal under the federal law?"
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1388.58,1398.627,"They couldn't be prosecuted under the bribery statute, because the bribery statute doesn't cover them, because--"
1983.82-5279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1398.627,1402.368,"Well, I didn't think the bribery statute covered buying a yacht."
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1406.041,1410.535,--I don't know what law it would or would not be covered under.
1983.82-5279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1410.535,1412.715,But don't you know that it's a crime?
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1421.892,1433.51,"No, within the scope of the... they have a contract with the city of Peoria, and they were subject to an audit by the city of Peoria--"
1983.82-5279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1433.51,1434.889,And the federal government.
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1434.889,1439.304,"--and if they didn't conform, they were subject to prosecution under any existing law."
1983.82-5279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1440.485,1443.307,Weren't they subject to an audit by the federal government?
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1448.35,1450.411,--They had the right to--
1983.82-5279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1450.411,1452.751,They had the right to.
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1452.751,1453.322,--Yes.
1983.82-5279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1453.322,1455.074,"Well, how did they get that right?"
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1455.074,1459.546,"It was given by the statute, the community block grant."
1983.82-5279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1459.546,1462.669,"Well, does anybody have the right who doesn't have the money?"
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1470.303,1476.297,I think that we can analogize with income tax.
1983.82-5279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1478.0,1479.64,Are you going to answer my question?
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1480.821,1483.212,--I think I do.
1983.82-5279,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1486.294,1487.345,I have forgotten it.
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1493.907,1568.046,"Well, I think that certainly... I think the emphasis has been too much upon the federal source of the community block grants and the perduring interests of Congress in these, but when it comes to a criminal statute, if there is any ambiguity, and I maintain that there is ambiguity in what it means to act on behalf of someone else, that if we were to say that any time one handles funds that have been derived from someone else, that one is acting on behalf of that government body, well, then it seems to me that we would have an almost limited jurisdiction, and it doesn't seem to me that that would be a reasonable interpretation of what Congress had intended."
1983.82-5279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1641.415,1663.409,"Mr. Morano, you are now referring to the section of the statute that speaks of under or by authority of any such department, agency, or branch of government, and then you go back... if you go back earlier in the statute, within the same subparagraph, the language there,"
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1695.563,1728.614,"--I would think so, but I wonder if it makes any difference in this case, because obviously if these people were acting on behalf of... if they were public officials, they would be so because of the connection through HUD, and so therefore it is a department of the federal government, and therefore, if they are going to be public officials, it would be under or by authority of the Department of HUD."
1983.82-5279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.256,1877.43,Have you looked at 18 United States Code recently to see all the federal criminal statutes there are?
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1888.5,1890.34,I am sorry.
1983.82-5279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1891.902,1894.192,"No, you may respond to my comment."
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1895.324,1900.287,Have I looked at the statute?
1983.82-5279,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1900.287,1906.991,I was just making the point that there are a great number of federal criminal statutes certainly.
1983.82-5279,0,21209,donald_v_morano,,1906.991,1907.991,Yes.
1983.82-5279,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1910.311,1914.615,Mr. Wilkins?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,1914.615,1921.771,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the United States has just a few brief points to make."
1983.82-5279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2034.303,2048.314,"Mr. Wilkins, can you give other examples of federal grant programs that you believe should be treated like the community development program for purposes of this statute?"
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2059.261,2067.145,"Certainly, it is a subject of some concern, but I think the plain terms of the statute handle that concern, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-5279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2119.468,2148.569,"Certainly in the Fortune versus Harris case, where we have to deal with the Freedom of Information Act question, the Court took a different approach and said that grants of federal funds generally don't create a partnership or joint venture with the recipient, and they don't convert the acts of the recipient from private acts to governmental acts, and so forth, and took a different approach."
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2148.569,2156.965,"Certainly, that... perhaps, though... you have to look at the underlying goals of the different statutes involved also."
1983.82-5279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2179.038,2183.011,One last question while I have you interrupted.
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2183.011,2183.582,--Sure.
1983.82-5279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2183.582,2195.99,"Would Congress have needed to even pass a statute expressly covering, for example, the grain inspectors under your interpretation of this statute?"
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2195.99,2196.829,"No, indeed they don't."
1983.82-5279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2240.079,2256.849,"Mr. Wilkins, is your argument, in a nutshell, as to why these people are acting for or on behalf of the United States that they were... they had control over who got so-called ""federal funds""?"
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2256.849,2264.604,They had substantial control over who would receive the benefits of a federal housing rehabilitation program.
1983.82-5279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2264.604,2265.154,"Well, okay."
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2273.298,2277.222,"Well, Justice Rehnquist, they did indeed have direct control over federal funds."
1983.82-5279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2281.914,2286.208,"Yes, but how many concentric circles had the funds gone through before they got to them?"
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2286.208,2293.902,"Well, the funds went directly to the... the program is set up... the Housing and Community Development Act is set up in this fashion."
1983.82-5279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2299.586,2301.339,Like the city of Peoria in this case?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2301.339,2302.448,Like the city of Peoria.
1983.82-5279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2338.892,2368.331,"If there had been a block grant in this case, not any sort of a categorical grant, but just that the United States decided to give $500,000 to every city over $100,000, and let's assume Peoria qualified as such a city, and then Peoria in turn contracted with UNI to develop the same things UNI was doing, and some of the money that Peoria used came from the federal government in this uncategorical block grant."
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2372.425,2376.246,"In that circumstance, it might be more questionable."
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2414.303,2425.069,"But aren't you then saying that the less authority that the person has to act independently, the more readily you would conclude that he is acting on behalf of the federal government?"
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2425.069,2426.15,Exactly.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2426.15,2435.314,"I see, so if there were a blanket authority to make all the decisions, he would not be acting on behalf of the authority, but if there is a limited authority to make decisions, he is."
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2435.995,2446.173,"That is right, because if the federal government has limited your authority and said you can do A, B, and C, but not D, when you do A, B, and C, then you are acting on behalf of the United States."
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.173,2451.546,"--But if you said, you may do A, B, C, or D, then even... it is not on behalf of--"
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2451.546,2453.977,I don't know whether I follow that analogy.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2453.977,2455.958,--Let me just put it a little differently.
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2464.075,2468.457,In their function as--
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.457,2469.519,In letting the contract.
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2469.519,2472.7,"--determining who was going to receive the funds, they probably were acting on behalf, yes."
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2472.7,2473.93,So it applies to them.
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2480.394,2481.005,Yes.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2481.005,2485.119,"--Now, what about the building contractor letting a subcontract to an electrician?"
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2485.119,2490.863,"Now, that, in certain circumstances, that circumstance could be followed."
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2514.067,2527.044,But your submission to us today is that not only the employees of UNI but the employees of the general contractors with whom UNI contracted are also within the federal bribery statute?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2527.044,2529.746,Yes.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2532.179,2533.669,And may I just ask one other question?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2533.669,2534.35,--Yes.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2534.35,2540.084,At what point in the history of this much amended statute did the language on which you rely become a part of the statute?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2543.767,2545.377,"The... Yes, it was."
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2671.58,2672.531,May I just interrupt you right there?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2672.531,2673.112,--Yes.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2673.112,2680.604,"You, I thought, acknowledged that if there had been an unrestricted block grant from which all of the salaries were paid with federal money, that would not be enough."
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2680.604,2681.996,"No, that's--"
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2681.996,2685.749,"Nevertheless, you continue to rely heavily on the fact that federal money--"
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2685.749,2688.051,"--Well, it is one of the facts in this case."
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.472,2694.355,--I think the key fact under your submission is the extent of the government regulation of the distribution of the money.
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2694.355,2698.577,"Exactly, but the fact--"
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2698.577,2704.24,"Now, let me ask you on that, was there a violation of any federal regulation pertaining to the distribution of this money?"
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2704.24,2706.844,--There are federal regulations.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2717.7,2718.231,"Well, I am not sure you have answered me."
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2722.622,2729.668,"Yes, because there are... as I said, there are regulations that prohibit the--"
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2729.668,2732.43,Prohibit subgrantees from taking bribes?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2732.43,2745.319,"--From taking bribes and kickbacks, but the remedy for that as provided by the regulations is recoupment of the funds or taking away of grant funds in the future."
1983.82-5279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2745.319,2753.426,"Mr. Wilkins, you said a moment ago that this defendant had his... these defendants had their salary paid by the federal government."
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2758.098,2758.558,No.
1983.82-5279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2758.558,2760.218,--out of a United States Treasury check?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2760.218,2761.22,"No, it didn't."
1983.82-5279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2769.796,2771.897,What was that chain of distribution?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2771.897,2779.002,"As I explained earlier, it went directly to the city of Peoria, and then according to federal regulations to the subgrantee."
1983.82-5279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2779.002,2784.185,"So the government check went to Peoria, there was a check drawn by the city of Peoria to UNI--"
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2784.185,2784.726,Right.
1983.82-5279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2784.726,2788.657,"--and then UNI wrote these salary checks, and you say that is federal funds."
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2788.657,2791.8,But the funds were always subject to federal control and audit.
1983.82-5279,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2828.975,2834.598,But how far back... or how far out in the stream of things can you go with that argument?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2842.332,2843.483,--No.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2975.67,2978.812,"Mr. Wilkins, may I turn to another area that keeps running through my mind?"
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,2995.922,2999.695,They may well indeed be subject to federal bribery statutes.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3036.191,3055.372,"Well, I am thinking of situations, and we recently had this Panhurst case reargued in which there was a state program for care of the mentally ill, which is partially financed by federal funds, and the grant is subject to all sorts of regulation, and the state officials were doing their normal state duties but are also carrying out a federal function."
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3058.855,3059.476,--Yes.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3059.476,3061.196,"And it may well be correct, but I am just trying to think of--"
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3061.196,3064.128,"Right, if they were performing an official function, as I said."
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3064.128,3066.329,"--Well, it's their official state function--"
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3066.329,3066.8,Right.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3066.8,3069.131,--just as these people are doing their UNI duties--
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3069.131,3069.681,Exactly.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3069.681,3074.987,"--but you say it is a kind of a mixed function, both federal and otherwise at the same time."
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3074.987,3086.132,"In fiscal year 1983, the federal government has appropriated over $4 billion into the housing program that was administered by petitioners."
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3099.44,3100.432,Mr. Wilkins?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3100.432,3101.123,--to ensure... Yes?
1983.82-5279,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3101.123,3101.912,Let's back up a minute.
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3105.895,3106.806,Yes.
1983.82-5279,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3106.806,3108.487,--like an electrician.
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3108.487,3109.589,Yes.
1983.82-5279,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3109.589,3119.903,"Well, suppose the ABC Electric Wire Company bribes the electrician subcontractor."
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3121.195,3123.807,It would--
1983.82-5279,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3123.807,3125.457,"I mean, where does the line cut off?"
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3125.457,3127.65,"--The line cuts off, Justice Marshall--"
1983.82-5279,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3127.65,3129.731,It cuts off some place before the grocery.
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3129.731,3130.231,--Yes.
1983.82-5279,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3136.185,3149.163,"Well, this man is furnishing electric wire to the subcontractor who is working for the contractor who you say is directly under the federal government."
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3151.765,3155.378,In... if there--
1983.82-5279,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3155.378,3156.329,Where do you draw the line?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3156.329,3158.189,--It would depend on some attendant facts.
1983.82-5279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3209.763,3213.674,How about in Medicaid and Medicare programs?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3215.978,3228.745,"In the Medicaid and Medicare, I am not terribly familiar with the legislative scheme or statutory scheme for those programs."
1983.82-5279,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3259.535,3266.1,So the doctors and pharmacists and so forth are all covered?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3266.1,3274.405,--I am not sure whether you would go clear down to the pharmacists and all sorts of lower level echelons.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3326.288,3329.771,"Let me ask you just one more question, if I may, or perhaps two more."
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3351.606,3354.648,I think that the remedy is against the entity.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3359.911,3364.623,And there was at all times some kind of a right to audit the operation?
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3364.623,3365.103,--Yes--
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3365.103,3366.335,But they just didn't happen to do it in time.
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3366.335,3366.856,--They did.
1983.82-5279,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3367.294,3367.915,I see.
1983.82-5279,1,40688,richard_g_wilkins,,3367.915,3370.356,"I mean, that... it is a misstatement in the briefs."
