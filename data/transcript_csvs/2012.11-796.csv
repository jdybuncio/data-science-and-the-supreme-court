2012.11-796,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.837,"We will hear argument next this morning in case 11-796, Bowman v. Monsanto Company."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,8.856,11.456,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2012.11-796,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,45.462,58.887,Why in the world would anybody spend any money to try to improve the seed if as soon as they sold the first one anybody could grow more and have as many of those seeds as they want?
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,58.887,62.59,"I agree no one would do that, and I don't think that is the situation here."
2012.11-796,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,76.081,79.55,"That's true, that's true in the case of any patented article, right?"
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,79.55,80.385,--Correct.
2012.11-796,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,80.385,88.974,"So the patent system is based, I think, on the recognition that contractual protection is inadequate to encourage invention."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,88.974,97.914,"Well, part of the patent policy as well is to protect the purchaser, and that's been part of this Court's law for more than 150 years."
2012.11-796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,117.675,119.343,I didn't understand that last sentence.
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,125.164,128.466,Is infringing under license by Monsanto.
2012.11-796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,129.216,139.841,I thought that their claim is he only violates the patent if he tries to grow additional seeds from his first crop.
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,142.376,158.735,"--The reach of Monsanto's theory is that once that seed is sold, even though title has passed to the farmer, and the farmer assumes all risks associated with farming, that they can still control the ownership of that seed, control how that seed is used."
2012.11-796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,158.735,160.154,"No, not that seed."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,172.828,186.987,"That's correct, Your Honor, but if we don't apply -- if exhaustion is eliminated, rather, for the progeny seed, then you are taking away the ability of people to exchange these goods freely in commerce."
2012.11-796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,194.075,206.299,"I think you may be right in the way you characterize Monsanto's argument, and I have great difficulties with characterizing it that way, as Justice Scalia's question indicates."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,229.414,237.42,If you assume that there is exhaustion in the seeds that are sold to the farmer -- let's take our particular case here.
2012.11-796,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,298.561,302.713,"No, but you are allowing him to use those seeds for anything else he wants to do."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,386.449,387.118,No.
2012.11-796,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,387.118,388.568,"No, he wouldn't have?"
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,408.799,410.65,"Well, I guess I misunderstood your question."
2012.11-796,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,410.65,415.202,My question is the same with the grass as with the magic box.
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,477.876,489.684,"Justice Breyer, my response is, if you applied the law that way to side making over use, you are eliminating the exhaustion doctrine in the context of -- of patented seeds."
2012.11-796,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,490.534,490.917,But why--
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,490.917,492.117,--anything but practice the invention.
2012.11-796,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,492.117,500.823,--But why -- you said making or use and it isn't an either-or thing then -- as the other side has pointed out.
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,517.684,521.153,"Justice Ginsburg, that is the point of the invention here."
2012.11-796,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,532.027,537.431,"Well, suppose he -- he had never bought any Monsanto seeds."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,556.992,557.578,No.
2012.11-796,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,557.578,562.396,So he never has to buy any seed at all from Monsanto.
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,562.396,579.342,"Well, in practical matters it doesn't work that way, because the seed that's available at a grain elevator is not a very good source of seed and farmers are not going to be able to eliminate the need to go to Monsanto or the other seed companies every year by going to the grain elevator."
2012.11-796,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,593.934,595.601,I'm still not getting the answer.
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,677.218,682.187,"Your Honor, that's an exception to the exhaustion doctrine for self-replicating inventions."
2012.11-796,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,682.187,682.856,Yes.
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,682.856,683.589,The invention here is--
2012.11-796,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,683.589,684.256,Is that there?
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,686.558,687.541,--It is not there.
2012.11-796,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,696.947,698.116,I'm sorry.
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,728.901,736.407,This is obviously a brand-new case where we're dealing with the -- the doctrine of patent exhaustion in the context of self-replicating technologies.
2012.11-796,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,762.741,768.293,"Well, you just said that -- that we haven't had a case involving self-replicating."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,808.603,825.482,"--The Exhaustion Doctrine, the policy that underlies this Court's cases is fundamentally a choice about the purchaser's rights in that personal property over the patentee's rights in the monopoly to use that monopoly and increase its sales."
2012.11-796,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,833.571,842.61,"Well, except to the extent, as Justice Breyer suggested, except to the extent that the purchase is going to use the article just to create a new one of the exact same kind."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,853.566,860.555,"First, we disagree that the activity of basic farming could be considered making the invention."
2012.11-796,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,886.153,897.078,"Do you mean they don't do any work, they don't lay the soil and the nutrients it needs, water when it needs watering, protect it from animals?"
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,898.347,899.38,They absolutely--
2012.11-796,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,899.38,900.247,--in growing the seed?
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,900.247,904.767,"--They absolutely do work, but they don't have control over the creative process."
2012.11-796,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,906.851,909.736,"I'm sure if they don't do all of the things I said, it doesn't grow."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,915.473,916.825,They certainly aren't in control of it.
2012.11-796,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,923.895,929.649,"Well, you only need one -- I mean, you throw the seeds on the ground, one or two of them are going to grow and you still have the same case, right?"
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,929.649,930.818,--Absolutely.
2012.11-796,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,942.04,944.142,"That's true, but that's what I thought you were going to respond."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1008.334,1009.851,"Thank you, Justice Breyer."
2012.11-796,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1078.765,1082.55,"And they may -- they may they own them, but that doesn't mean that they are infringing."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1097.309,1099.328,--It's the servitude on the title.
2012.11-796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1128.597,1131.799,"I have only one question so far, and it's a farming question."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1152.027,1157.631,"You know, most farmers are not growing soybeans for -- for seed."
2012.11-796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1159.883,1160.367,You would not?
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1160.733,1170.09,"--various types of farmers who are -- who are growing foundation seed, for example, that is very close to the -- to the first generation seed that's engineered."
2012.11-796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1170.09,1171.09,I don't understand this.
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1172.959,1173.726,They are.
2012.11-796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1173.726,1180.046,"But that's -- if you're going to use the soybeans for seeds as opposed to flour, do you leave them in the ground any longer?"
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1180.046,1181.08,I don't know the answer to that question.
2012.11-796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1181.08,1181.546,Okay.
2012.11-796,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1181.546,1195.454,"Mr. Walters, can you go back to the Chief Justice's opening question, because the Chief Justice asked you what incentive Monsanto would have to produce this kind of product if you were right."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1226.591,1240.751,"Taking our example here where -- where Petitioner bought commodity seeds, it's an undifferentiated mixture, it can't be overemphasized how different every single seed is, you don't know a Monsanto from a Pioneer from an Asgrow."
2012.11-796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1295.735,1297.003,Please correct me if I am wrong.
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1309.578,1310.361,"--Well, he--"
2012.11-796,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1310.361,1313.197,So he did exactly what you said is uneconomical.
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1313.197,1313.68,--No.
2012.11-796,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1332.593,1334.093,"I'm sorry, maybe I didn't read this right."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1343.816,1344.401,--That's correct.
2012.11-796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1359.411,1361.511,Including the Monsanto seeds?
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1361.511,1362.88,--Including the Monsanto seeds.
2012.11-796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.88,1364.982,Some of them would -- would grow at different rates than others.
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1364.982,1365.332,Absolutely.
2012.11-796,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1365.332,1367.85,How come that's not a problem the first time you plant?
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1367.85,1369.55,It's a problem each time.
2012.11-796,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1379.672,1379.956,"No, no."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1389.628,1390.028,--Yes.
2012.11-796,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1390.028,1393.096,So that doesn't make the commodity seeds any different?
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1393.096,1394.181,I'm sorry.
2012.11-796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.056,1407.456,But not the original batch that he buys from Monsanto?
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1407.456,1407.823,Correct.
2012.11-796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1408.441,1418.214,"The original batch that he buys from Monsanto, in addition to being resistant to the chemical that kills the weeds, in addition to that, they all mature at the same rate."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1418.214,1419.247,--Exactly.
2012.11-796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.768,1426.387,So all the Monsanto seeds are not -- are not fungible.
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1426.387,1427.237,--That's correct.
2012.11-796,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.237,1430.705,"There are some of them that mature early, some mature later."
2012.11-796,0,36940,mark_p_walters,,1430.705,1431.706,It makes sense.
2012.11-796,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1513.259,1514.444,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-796,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1529.454,1533.606,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-796,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1612.624,1616.326,"Well, but I mean, this -- the reason it's never is because this is an entirely different case."
2012.11-796,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1639.875,1653.368,"It's true that the Court hasn't had an exhaustion case specifically involving the sort of replicating technology, but when the Court has talked about exhaustion it has always focused on the specific article that's sold and it has done that for a reason."
2012.11-796,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1731.451,1772.778,"That's a pretty horrible result, but let me give you another horrible result, and that is if -- if we agree with you, farmers will not be able to do a second planting by simply getting the undifferentiated seeds from a grain elevator, because at least a few of those seeds will always be patented seeds, and no farmer could ever plant anything from a grain elevator, which means -- I gather they use it for second plantings where the risks are so high that it doesn't pay to buy expensive seed."
2012.11-796,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1781.048,1785.002,--And the answer to that is this is actually not a traditional farming practice.
2012.11-796,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1823.727,1825.211,That's why it's so cheap.
2012.11-796,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1830.731,1833.25,But farmers wouldn't be able to use it for another reason as well.
2012.11-796,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1838.486,1841.938,But correct me if I am wrong; I thought that is what Bowman did.
2012.11-796,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1841.938,1845.324,"Bowman did, absolutely did it in this circumstance."
2012.11-796,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1896.207,1901.411,So when -- when are the patent rights exhausted in the seed?
2012.11-796,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1901.411,1909.75,"--The patent rights are exhausted in the seed at the same time they are exhausted with respect to any other product, upon an authorized sale."
2012.11-796,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1935.55,1936.017,I'm sorry.
2012.11-796,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1947.442,1948.508,--If Monsanto authorizes--
2012.11-796,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1948.508,1950.827,I'm putting aside all the contracts and stuff.
2012.11-796,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1950.827,1951.277,--Right.
2012.11-796,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2005.011,2007.346,That sounds like the patent rights haven't been exhausted then.
2012.11-796,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2007.346,2010.548,--They have been exhausted with respect to the particular article sold.
2012.11-796,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2017.252,2019.488,You are saying it's exhausted with respect to the one bean?
2012.11-796,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2019.488,2022.856,"--Yes, and that's always the case just as if I sell -- I mean, even if you think in the copyright--"
2012.11-796,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2022.856,2033.048,That's always the case because it's a very -- the other cases haven't involved this situation where you are talking about a self-regenerating product.
2012.11-796,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2033.048,2036.0,--But I think there is other technology out there.
2012.11-796,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2051.025,2052.292,"Well, we haven't had that case either."
2012.11-796,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2052.292,2078.443,"The Court hasn't had that case exactly, but it did decide Microsoft v. AT&T, and granted that was on a slightly different issue, but in that case the Court recognized -- that case, it was copies from a master disk and it treated them as separate copies because they were actually separate articles, even though it was really easy to do, even though the actual copying is not done by human hands, it's done by mechanical processes."
2012.11-796,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2108.462,2109.814,I'm sorry.
2012.11-796,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2135.196,2136.281,"Your Honor, may I?"
2012.11-796,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2136.281,2136.815,Sure.
2012.11-796,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2136.815,2140.433,I think the Court does not need to do something about it in this case.
2012.11-796,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2155.01,2155.943,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2165.049,2166.734,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-796,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2349.418,2359.543,"But he couldn't put the herbicide on -- he couldn't -- if he went and bought conventional seeds, not the genetically improved seed--"
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2359.543,2360.226,Exactly.
2012.11-796,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2360.226,2369.481,--then -- then he wouldn't -- what would the yield be if he put the herbicide on it and they were all killed?
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2369.481,2380.206,"Justice Ginsburg, the -- the glyphosate resistance doesn't change the yield of a particular plant, it changes the way you have to control weeds."
2012.11-796,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2531.687,2533.106,What do you mean you can do it once?
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2533.856,2553.018,The -- the Department of Agriculture authorized Monsanto to engage in -- to transform natural -- natural plant material with its recombinant gene in one single event that is referred to as a transformation.
2012.11-796,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2553.018,2554.27,--One shot of a gun.
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2554.27,2559.591,I think you may be able to shoot several -- I don't know whether you can shoot a whole round or whatever.
2012.11-796,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.809,2564.493,"You can't rob a bank with it, though, right?"
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2565.328,2569.63,"I, in my mind, have been trying to figure out what a gene gun looks like."
2012.11-796,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2675.915,2678.517,"Mr. Waxman, there is a worrisome thing on the other side, though, too."
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2729.384,2731.736,--Certainly not.
2012.11-796,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2743.876,2744.359,Okay.
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2746.109,2754.349,"--If I take my -- you know, my Girl Scout troop and have them do a science experiment, it will rot but it will not generate."
2012.11-796,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2756.451,2758.386,"And I thought I was being so clever, too."
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2759.069,2774.496,"--Well, it also reminds me that my original answer to Justice Kennedy is wrong, which is that edamame is taken from the pods before the -- the thing becomes actually a seed that can be processed in any other way."
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2888.104,2904.563,"Well, is -- I mean, that is an interesting question, because you can imagine -- you see, this is -- your answer -- this really deals with all -- it could be with genetic patents, with -- with hosts of things which are self-replicating."
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2904.563,2905.063,Mm-hmm.
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2905.063,2912.569,"And some of the self-replicating items, which are infringing items, end up inadvertently all over the place."
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2922.192,2922.592,Well--
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2922.592,2925.71,Is -- is there precautions that you take?
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2927.827,2938.202,"--So infringement is -- unlike contributory infringement or induced infringement, the act of infringement, that is a violation of Section 271--"
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2938.202,2938.618,Right.
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2938.618,2946.807,"--is a strict liability tort, but it requires affirmative volitional contact -- conduct."
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2951.942,2953.144,"Well, the person plants it."
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2953.144,2953.977,The person--
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2953.977,2955.829,"I mean, he plants it, but he doesn't even know, you know."
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2964.769,2965.152,"--I mean, take the--"
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2965.152,2966.252,But you're just saying that would need a--
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2966.252,2966.719,--Sure.
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2966.719,2967.302,--modification in patent law.
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2967.302,2967.669,Of course.
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3073.838,3075.94,What about -- what about the other question--
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3075.94,3076.373,So the other one--
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3076.373,3086.646,"--No, no, no, I want to go back to a different question that was asked, which was the question what do you think we should do about this other aspect of the case, the licensing aspect?"
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3137.245,3137.812,--Okay.
2012.11-796,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3272.948,3278.418,Could -- could you prevail in this case if we focused just on use rather than make?
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3278.418,3303.553,"If you're referring to generation N plus 2, the answer is yes, because those are newly infringing products with no exhaustion of Monsanto's rights, and as a consequence farmers have no authority to use, make, sell, or offer to sell without Monsanto's authorization."
2012.11-796,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3307.005,3314.175,"Mr. Waxman, I want to go back to Justice Breyer's question and reformulate it as a different question, with I think the same answer--"
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3314.175,3314.491,Okay.
2012.11-796,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3314.491,3317.879,--but I just want to make sure you and the Government are exactly on the same page.
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3338.041,3338.543,I--
2012.11-796,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3338.543,3342.428,You're -- you're telling us we don't need to reach that prong and we shouldn't.
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3342.428,3346.047,--I'm -- I agree that you don't need to reach the prong and you shouldn't.
2012.11-796,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3346.047,3348.849,"I understand we don't need to, but the question is should we?"
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3349.815,3350.099,"Well, I think--"
2012.11-796,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3350.099,3353.968,--generally in -- in clarifying some lingering confusion?
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3353.968,3360.056,--I think that -- I think that an appropriate case will come up where it will be important for you to determine that.
2012.11-796,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3459.655,3462.188,Actually then you do have a different position than the Government does.
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3462.188,3467.676,"--Yes, and I think the reason, if we take it out of the soybean area, let's look at vaccines."
2012.11-796,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3532.618,3540.874,"Simplifying this case, you can't take the person who's been given the vaccine and take vials of their blood and keep selling it?"
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3541.64,3545.175,"Yes, and keep -- well, keep replicating it in competition."
2012.11-796,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3546.592,3548.144,"Well, is that how it works?"
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3564.586,3569.123,"--Well, CVS was presumably buying it either from the manufacturer or another lab."
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3586.735,3593.273,"But you don't need that because in each instance, as you say, you are making new ones."
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3599.077,3599.543,--Yeah.
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3615.186,3616.438,Then you use the word “ use ”.
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3616.438,3617.704,--Excuse me?
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3617.704,3620.773,Then you use the word “ use ” and you get to the same place.
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3620.773,3621.842,"I mean, my submission about--"
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3621.842,3623.092,I don't think you can think of an example.
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3639.47,3639.77,--Okay.
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3689.569,3690.152,So lease it.
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3690.152,3691.886,--to go into competition with it.
2012.11-796,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3691.886,3693.121,So lease it.
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3693.121,3706.948,"Yes, but you can't lease articles like software and, you know, soybeans that consume themselves in any use other than an art experiment."
2012.11-796,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3706.948,3712.183,I do have this problem that goes back to Justice Scalia's example.
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3740.185,3743.804,"Well, I mean, when you say you can't sell them."
2012.11-796,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3745.906,3751.81,"You can't sell them if they know they are going to be used for seeds, and you can't use them for seeds even though there is only 1 percent of the seeds?"
2012.11-796,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3751.81,3756.295,"--That would be true even if this case came out another way, Justice Kennedy."
2012.11-796,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3861.964,3863.248,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
2012.11-796,3,36940,mark_p_walters,,3865.85,3874.022,I'd like to first address the statement that this is not a traditional farming practice.
2012.11-796,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3900.589,3904.557,Do you agree that it's unlawful for grain elevators to sell it for replanting?
2012.11-796,3,36940,mark_p_walters,,3904.557,3905.024,--No.
2012.11-796,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3946.468,3952.805,What -- what about Mr. Waxman's suggestion that we've already decided this in Microsoft v. AT&T?
2012.11-796,3,36940,mark_p_walters,,3952.805,3955.507,"That case is not on point, Your Honor."
2012.11-796,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3983.843,3987.045,Don't people or animals eat them?
2012.11-796,3,36940,mark_p_walters,,3987.045,3989.897,"That is certainly a use, but it's not the invention."
2012.11-796,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3989.897,3991.963,"Well, then why is it the only way you can do is to plant them?"
2012.11-796,3,36940,mark_p_walters,,3993.199,3993.915,"Well, that's not use."
2012.11-796,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3993.915,3996.401,--You can buy them from the grain elevator and sell them for other things.
2012.11-796,3,36940,mark_p_walters,,3996.401,3998.419,"That's not use of the invention, Justice Breyer."
2012.11-796,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4004.573,4006.007,The invented thing.
2012.11-796,3,36940,mark_p_walters,,4016.98,4019.666,"--The same argument came up in Quanta, Your Honor, with--"
2012.11-796,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4019.666,4020.399,You don't use that.
2012.11-796,3,36940,mark_p_walters,,4025.236,4029.388,"--There were other uses for the computer chips, of course, that were asserted."
2012.11-796,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4049.802,4064.378,"The people buying from grain elevators are mostly people who take these chips -- whatever they are, the seeds -- and they sell them for making tofu, or they sell them to eat, or this -- there are loads of uses, aren't there?"
2012.11-796,3,36940,mark_p_walters,,4064.378,4068.697,"--But the only use of the invention is to plant it, and that's the use that Mr. Bowman makes."
2012.11-796,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4068.697,4072.051,"Yes, but -- but that's -- nothing prevents him from planting it."
2012.11-796,3,36940,mark_p_walters,,4090.713,4106.122,"So -- the judgment in this case was based on acres planted, and so I'm not sure how many -- we talked a bit about the N plus 2 generation, and we don't know in the record what the N plus 2 generation was, in terms of his sales or his yields."
2012.11-796,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4123.0,4127.119,"I'm sorry, I didn't follow that answer to Justice Scalia's question."
2012.11-796,3,36940,mark_p_walters,,4127.119,4131.273,--Could you ask it again?
2012.11-796,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4131.273,4136.507,"You know, you're saying that you are preventing him from using it."
2012.11-796,3,36940,mark_p_walters,,4163.827,4169.129,But you're saying that there's no exhaustion in the progeny where he owns that seed outright.
2012.11-796,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4172.517,4173.433,"Thank you, counsel."
