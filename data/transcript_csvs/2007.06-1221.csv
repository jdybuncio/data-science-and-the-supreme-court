2007.06-1221,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.966,"We'll hear argument this morning in case 06-1221, Sprint/United Management Company v. Mendelsohn."
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,12.542,36.985,"Chief Justice Roberts, and may it please the Court: Our basic principal of evidence of the need for foundation explains why the court of appeals should be reversed."
2007.06-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,60.539,73.768,"If you were to read the district court's minute order... and this is that short minute order... as saying that evidence of pattern and practice simply is not admissible, that would be error, would it not?"
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,84.405,93.449,"Yeah, if the district court had held that under no circumstances could a pattern or practice of discrimination be shown, I think that would have been error."
2007.06-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,93.449,105.115,"--Is there anything in the other parts of the record colloquy, comments by the district judge, that you think Respondents have called to our attention to indicate that he had this sweeping view?"
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,105.115,107.77,No.
2007.06-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.638,168.699,"We don't really know, do we, what the district court's order was based on?"
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,177.196,180.444,The district court did not specifically invoke rule 403.
2007.06-1221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,202.092,205.888,"Well, to the extent it was grounded on 401, it was error, wasn't it?"
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,205.888,208.277,"I don't think so, because I don't think there's--"
2007.06-1221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,208.277,226.691,"Well, if you have three supervisors, and one is discriminating and another is discriminating, isn't that some evidence that you're in an industrial situation in which discrimination goes on, and therefore doesn't it have the tendency that amounts to relevance under 401?"
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,226.691,230.72,"--We have here five persons, who out of 15,000--"
2007.06-1221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,230.72,231.595,"Well, what about my question?"
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,231.595,235.282,"--The answer to the question is no, it doesn't."
2007.06-1221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,237.389,239.201,No relevance at all?
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,239.201,242.731,--A pattern or practice is not established by anecdotes.
2007.06-1221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,246.886,248.104,What about my question?
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,271.048,274.874,--That's why I started with the importance of emphasizing foundation.
2007.06-1221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,276.062,282.543,"I don't want to... I don't want to emphasize my question, before we get the--"
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,282.543,285.871,"--For relevance to exist, there would have to be a foundational showing."
2007.06-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,285.871,287.823,What do you mean by that?
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,308.751,320.559,"The foundation, Justice Ginsburg, would be some linkage between the decision making supervisor and the supervisors whose acts or conduct is assailed by the plaintiff."
2007.06-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,326.526,327.26,"What do you mean by ""nexus""?"
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,332.602,332.93,--No.
2007.06-1221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,336.429,344.721,--What if you've got 20 supervisors and you've got evidence that 19 of them have discriminated after making expressly discriminatory remarks.
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,351.78,352.202,I think--
2007.06-1221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,352.202,355.076,Is a nexus there?
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,355.076,366.993,"--I think, in a company that was not small, where a nexus could be inferred, that there was consultation or that there were directions from more senior management, then I think that would be an appropriate foundation."
2007.06-1221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,366.993,367.446,All right.
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,383.362,383.892,I'm sorry.
2007.06-1221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,389.672,391.858,"At this point, I'm saying three supervisors out of a whole company."
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,393.123,399.168,Not absent some reason to believe that they conferred or they received directions.
2007.06-1221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,399.168,401.728,"Three supervisors, and that's all there is in the company."
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,404.041,411.803,"If there were... if two out of three, I think there might be an argument that at least it was a jury question at that stage."
2007.06-1221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,411.803,412.694,Okay.
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,412.694,415.756,"But here we're dealing with a 70,000-employee company."
2007.06-1221,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,422.049,425.406,You agree that it has to be a case-by-case determination?
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,427.218,431.092,--I think there... there should be a guiding principle.
2007.06-1221,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,442.494,455.707,"So I assume it would be addressed as it was here, in a motion in limine, the plaintiff would say here are the witnesses we intend to call; the company would say we don't think they're relevant because, as you say, there's no connection between them, and then the judge would decide."
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,455.707,458.097,That's normally how--
2007.06-1221,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,458.097,458.894,That's on the issue of relevance.
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,458.894,465.281,"--That's normally how it would present itself, and indeed the district court normally would consider Rule 403 consideration if that's the case."
2007.06-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,465.281,465.875,Excuse me.
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,469.031,470.029,"70,000."
2007.06-1221,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,472.747,477.433,"If that's the way to do it, you didn't do it that way, did you?"
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,522.899,526.35,The motion was grounded in both Rule 401 and--
2007.06-1221,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,526.35,535.488,"Well, that may be, but the... I don't see... I mean, that may be, but this is the argument you made, and this was the argument the district judge adopted."
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,536.8,545.812,"--That is so, but what the district judge adopted was grounded in the offer of proof that had been made here and the evidence that was proffered here."
2007.06-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.841,553.419,Excuse me--
2007.06-1221,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,553.419,554.216,How do we know?
2007.06-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.216,554.512,--Yeah.
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,561.744,562.15,--Yes.
2007.06-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,562.15,569.022,It doesn't mention... it doesn't mention which of the two of your arguments the district court is relying on.
2007.06-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,569.022,570.397,It doesn't mention the offer of proof.
2007.06-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,570.397,579.206,And didn't the Tenth Circuit read it to be an absolute prohibition?
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,601.322,601.883,And I think--
2007.06-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,601.883,602.555,--the district court.
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,602.555,608.365,--That would be the rule in the normal run of cases where there is no showing of connection.
2007.06-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.365,609.068,We're not talking about the rule.
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,626.594,628.937,No.
2007.06-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,637.512,644.665,"If there's any basis on which the district court's decision would have been correct, the district court's decision is upheld."
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,644.665,645.462,--It could be affirmed on that ground.
2007.06-1221,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,645.462,647.258,That's why I don't understand your answer.
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,718.853,727.569,The general rule applies because there was no showing here of any relationship between the decision at issue here and--
2007.06-1221,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,727.569,730.522,"You... you want to defend the harder ground, I understand."
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,778.799,781.404,"--No, I absolutely want to defend 403."
2007.06-1221,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,788.762,790.434,"Well, don't we have to address 403 in any event?"
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,798.993,799.915,That is what--
2007.06-1221,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,799.915,803.07,--for the trial judge to have excluded it under 403.
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,803.07,803.476,--That is correct.
2007.06-1221,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,825.295,830.637,Would that be done typically at the motion in limine stage?
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,840.305,841.758,I think it can happen both ways.
2007.06-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,879.072,892.722,"But that didn't present the other supervisor, which I think is more... a better way to comprehend this, because 10 witnesses working under the same supervisor."
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,901.952,903.265,--That's correct.
2007.06-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,918.26,920.649,"But that's not ""other supervisor""."
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,945.451,954.682,"--And, more importantly, the other supervisors were persons that were not shown to have any connection with the decisionmaker with respect to this plaintiff."
2007.06-1221,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,966.303,973.487,But you say... I thought you said in your reply brief that other-supervisor evidence could be relevant.
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,973.487,984.935,--It could be relevant if there were a showing that the bias on the part of the other supervisors somehow tainted the decision making of the instant decisionmaker.
2007.06-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1020.077,1032.744,"Was there an attempt by the plaintiff during the discovery phase of the case to show other evidence of pattern and practice, statistical evidence; or was it just these five people?"
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,1034.136,1035.9,It was just these five people.
2007.06-1221,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1052.895,1055.111,--What about the spreadsheet evidence?
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,1061.031,1070.496,"That spreadsheet was linked to some supervisor named Kennedy, who bore no relationship to this department and no relationship to these decisionmakers."
2007.06-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1113.587,1114.009,I am somewhat puzzled.
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,1123.162,1124.911,--I don't know that--
2007.06-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1124.911,1130.378,The inference they are trying to prove is there was somebody upstairs that told everybody what to do.
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,1130.378,1133.689,--And they had full and fair discovery to try and demonstrate that.
2007.06-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1143.451,1147.917,"Does the record show in this 70,000-person company how many supervisors there were?"
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,1148.542,1149.073,No.
2007.06-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1156.867,1157.57,"Let me ask this, though."
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,1164.818,1166.722,--It is a different person.
2007.06-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1171.675,1172.47,The next step up would be--
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,1172.47,1175.968,"--Not the next step up, the next step after that, and not the next step after that."
2007.06-1221,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1175.968,1182.903,"Your theory doesn't depend on where in the hierarchy the other supervisors are located, I take it, if there's a connection?"
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,1199.1,1210.049,"If a... no matter what level, I would disagree that if a discriminating supervisor is in the chain of command and supervises the decisionmaker, then I think there's--"
2007.06-1221,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1210.049,1224.699,"No, I'm talking about a situation... let's say it is a lower-level supervisor outside the chain of command who commits another ""me, too"" act, but that is communicated to the other in a way that suggests, for example, that the company tolerates it or accepts it."
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,1229.65,1230.633,--I think that's right.
2007.06-1221,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1235.695,1244.348,"--I see your... does 404 bear on the case, Rule 404 of the Rules of Evidence?"
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,1244.348,1246.784,"Yes, I think it does."
2007.06-1221,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1256.046,1259.279,Have we said that 404 applies to corporations?
2007.06-1221,0,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,1260.324,1262.512,--I don't think the Court has ever held that.
2007.06-1221,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1287.611,1296.811,"Thank you, Mr. Cane. Mr. Garre."
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1296.811,1311.837,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Evidence of discrimination by other supervisors within the company is sometimes but not always admissible in a disparate-treatment case to help prove discrimination by the plaintiff's own supervisor."
2007.06-1221,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1311.837,1316.773,"--That's under... under 401, it's not always admissible, or do you need 403 to reach that conclusion?"
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1316.773,1324.268,"I think you need to look at the evidence under both rules, the first question being whether it meets the minimum-evidence threshold in 401."
2007.06-1221,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1332.142,1338.294,But do you think there are situations where other-supervisor evidence is not admissible under 401 itself?
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1338.294,1339.716,--Yes.
2007.06-1221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1361.426,1365.815,"Well, but here you have a company of 70,000 people."
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1365.815,1380.778,"You have a company of 70,000 people, but you have allegations that supervisors in the same division, implementing the same company-wide reduction-in-force plan in the same timeframe and giving similar explanations under similar circumstances, engaged in discrimination."
2007.06-1221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1392.913,1397.27,It is hard to see what wouldn't be marginally relevant if you think that's marginally relevant.
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1402.971,1408.126,"Well, I think you've got other situations as well, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1221,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1437.396,1439.379,How do you articulate the rule that separates these situations?
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1439.379,1446.532,"--Well, I would point to several criteria, Justice Scalia, in determining relevance."
2007.06-1221,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1464.852,1469.836,"Well, that's the relevant factors, but what do you look at the factors to determine... what's the test for determining whether they are sufficient?"
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1469.836,1472.304,"Well, you would look at the proffered evidence."
2007.06-1221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.109,1494.625,Why is that relevant... the same vicinity?
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1497.202,1500.998,--I think it is more likely--
2007.06-1221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1500.998,1502.23,--Opposing counsel has said they are... they are three supervisors up.

2007.06-1221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1585.416,1589.649,"And you say the foundation is satisfied if they were the same supervisors in the same division, I thought."

2007.06-1221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1590.649,1593.461,You want us to write that in a case as a rule?
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1593.461,1594.414,--The plaintiffs--
2007.06-1221,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1594.414,1596.569,Without reference to how many employees were involved?
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1596.569,1601.614,"--The plaintiff has the burden of showing that the evidence is relevant, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-1221,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1601.614,1609.142,I think you said in your brief that the plaintiff does not have to lay a foundation.
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1622.933,1632.008,"That's correct, and that's why as I said the plaintiff has to show that the evidence is relevant, that it has some tendency to make a fact or consequence more likely."
2007.06-1221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.068,1638.833,"Well, one... one would have some... some tendency--"
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1638.833,1640.208,--And Justice Scalia--
2007.06-1221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.208,1641.661,--What about one instead of three?
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1643.613,1644.128,--It might.
2007.06-1221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.531,1652.998,"Why, by the way, do you think this was excluded under... under 401 rather than 403?"
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1652.998,1656.98,"--Well, we... we acknowledge that the record isn't precisely clear on that."
2007.06-1221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1657.84,1660.027,"Well, then why should it be assumed it was done properly rather than improperly?"
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1660.027,1664.431,"--Largely because of what was said in the order, and because of the way it was briefed."
2007.06-1221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1664.431,1665.383,What was said in the order?
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1668.212,1678.051,"Well, it doesn't say 401, but the reason why the evidence can't come in is because the... the proffered witnesses didn't have the same supervisor."
2007.06-1221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.442,1679.926,But--
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1679.926,1682.049,What the court excluded is any evidence of the pattern--
2007.06-1221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1682.049,1684.283,--That's very relevant to the 403 determination.
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1684.283,1691.888,"--It's relevant, but not it's certainly not determinative, and we think in a case like this, where this kind of evidence is the critical evidence for the trial... in the case--"
2007.06-1221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1691.888,1693.56,"Picky, picky, picky on the trial court."
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1694.326,1694.779,--Yeah--
2007.06-1221,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1694.779,1704.055,"It seems to me this order should be... should be given... it should be treated as if, it could be sustained, it should be sustained."
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1704.055,1709.662,"--With respect, Justice Scalia, in this case, this proffered evidence was the crux of the trial, the critical issue."
2007.06-1221,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1731.217,1742.227,"The determination of the relevance of the 403 status... needs to be made at the motion in limine stage, or is it a question for the jury?"
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1742.227,1745.93,"--Well, the district court serves as a gateway."
2007.06-1221,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1765.047,1774.231,"So if it's... if on the ""me, too"" evidence it's a ""he said/she said"" type of case, does that get admitted to the jury?"
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1776.979,1788.475,"Well, if you're pointing to other acts of discrimination by other supervisors that are relevant, then that would be allowed in, and the employer would come in and present their counter evidence--"
2007.06-1221,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1788.475,1801.376,"Well, they're only... it is only relevant, of course, if it is true; and if the company denies that the ""me, too"" episode even took place, don't you have to have a separate trial on that before you can determine whether it's even admissible?"
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1801.376,1804.406,--In our system we put that evidence before a jury.
2007.06-1221,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1807.936,1810.449,"Well, I get back to my... the predicate to my question."
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1812.09,1812.684,--And--
2007.06-1221,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1812.684,1818.135,"And it seems to me we've had a lot of discussion whether it is relevant if it happened, but we don't know how we determine whether it happened or not."
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1818.135,1824.959,"--In the Furnco case, the Court said that... that the evidence doesn't have to conclusively demonstrate the fact."
2007.06-1221,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1834.487,1840.282,"So an allegation... an allegation of discrimination in a ""me, too"" context is automatically relevant?"
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1840.282,1840.736,--No.
2007.06-1221,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1864.303,1889.029,"Mr. Garre, do I understand correctly that the reason the Tenth Circuit thought that the district court was ruling under 401, making a relevance determination, was that the court of appeals had a precedent in the area of employee discipline, and the Tenth Circuit said well, the district court was following that precedent, but that precedent doesn't apply in this situation."
2007.06-1221,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1895.728,1900.116,"That's correct, and that's the way this case was litigated all the way until to the reply brief in this case."
2007.06-1221,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1901.273,1902.538,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,1914.018,1929.356,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If we'll turn to 3a in the white book, the court of appeals properly understood that this was a blanket order based on only one fact."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1981.07,1989.739,"Counsel, what if you have a situation that's been referred to earlier, where you have four other supervisors that are presented as ""me, too"" evidence."
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,1999.203,2001.358,"--It depends what the evidence is and what it is tied to, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2001.358,2010.011,It is just that they... they are alleged to have fired people for an impermissible basis under the age discrimination act as well.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2010.011,2016.134,"In your hypothetical was it was during the same common employer initiated action, such as a reduction in force?"
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2016.134,2018.461,"All right, let's take it and say yes."
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2018.461,2019.476,Okay.
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2026.161,2027.363,"Well, but doesn't that beg the question?"
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2048.683,2051.385,"--If there is no connection, it might not be, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2051.385,2052.728,It might not be relevant.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2052.728,2053.556,Might not be relevant.
2007.06-1221,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.243,2061.178,But you assert that the mere fact that it is pursuant to the same reduction in force is enough of a connection.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2061.178,2067.208,"--Yes, Your Honor, because the standard arises out of Article IV, which is entitled ""Relevancy and Its Limits""."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2100.288,2101.084,404.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2101.084,2102.615,"404(b), Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2124.464,2134.851,"Well suppose you're... if you're right on 401 and 402, would... do we not still have to go on and decide whether it would have been a abuse of discretion for the trial judge to exclude this under 403?"
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2134.851,2136.46,"Your Honor, I believe that--"
2007.06-1221,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2136.46,2142.037,"If we find that it would not have been abuse of discretion, then how could we affirm the Tenth Circuit?"
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2142.037,2154.733,"--Your Honor, I believe that what you have to do is look at what the court did, because what the court did was it ruled on what they presented, which was not anything having to do with the weight of the evidence, confusion of issues."
2007.06-1221,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2170.133,2172.023,But I thought they said that it should be admitted.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2175.179,2177.537,I'm not sure that they went to that extreme.
2007.06-1221,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2191.97,2193.422,How did they?
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2193.422,2196.374,"Your Honor, in several different ways."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2215.695,2220.942,Are these episodes that were necessarily communicated to the supervisor at issue here?
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2220.942,2223.331,"--No, Your Honor, but this is on the question of culture."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2223.331,2228.643,You don't make the... you don't suggest that he was even aware of these other anecdotes.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2228.643,2234.952,"We do not suggest, but what we say is that what was going on in the culture... you've got a supervisor like Ted Stock, openly saying,"
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2241.387,2248.041,But you're conceding that we don't even know that that comment was communicated in any way to the supervisor at issue here.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2253.695,2267.891,"Your Honor, what way do know is that they attended the same meetings, the key leadership meetings, that took place in January 2002 that covered something very important to our case... the establishment of a forced ranking system and also a discussion of the RIF's that are ongoing and continuing."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2275.546,2289.306,I assume there's no dispute over any direct evidence you have that the supervisor was being guided by a company policy or statement or the RIF program that was discriminatory.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2297.27,2302.862,"--Your Honor, the rules of evidence simply talk in terms of ""not demonstrate a connection""."
2007.06-1221,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2344.954,2346.251,May I ask you to elaborate on that somewhat?
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2346.251,2346.626,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2346.626,2352.796,I went through to kind of pin down what the facts of consequence were.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2377.16,2377.504,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-1221,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2377.504,2388.703,There was one employee who would testify that he received... she saw a spreadsheet in front of one supervisor that indicated age.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2426.094,2426.641,"No, you are not, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2444.884,2445.494,All right.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2450.694,2452.083,"--Your Honor, we believe that--"
2007.06-1221,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2452.083,2454.286,And finish your answer to Justice Souter.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2454.286,2456.02,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.758,2483.883,What if even one of these three had existed?
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2486.305,2487.913,"--One of these three what, Your Honor?"
2007.06-1221,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2487.913,2491.974,One of these three other employees who complained about age discrimination.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2494.895,2498.316,It depends what it's offered for because relevance does--
2007.06-1221,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2498.316,2499.36,You think one is enough?
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2499.36,2501.126,--If it's culture--
2007.06-1221,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2501.126,2501.579,Yes.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2501.579,2506.139,--and the CEO is saying that we want to bring the average age down... which never happens... but under--
2007.06-1221,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2506.139,2507.764,"No, I'm not talking about somebody up at the top."
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2522.055,2523.57,"--Well, if they're just accused, no, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2524.633,2525.836,"Well, all of these are just accused."
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2526.991,2535.409,"--Your Honor, we have not even addressed at any time the content of the decision... I mean the content of the testimony."
2007.06-1221,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2535.409,2535.737,So--
2007.06-1221,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2535.737,2545.78,Let's assume the testimony at least shows these points that you and I agreed the offer of proof offers to prove.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2552.589,2553.37,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2553.37,2563.68,"We're going to have litigation on these points, and they're going to take... in effect, become subsidiary chapters in this trial."
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2605.927,2611.957,"My response, because I'm hearing you talk about the mini-trial issues, first of all, as you know, it will not happen here."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2636.618,2637.243,But what--
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2637.243,2638.914,--to let Sprint put on counter-evidence--
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2638.914,2639.914,--What happens in this case?
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2664.731,2668.23,"--Your Honor, I think that what you handle that with is limiting instructions."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2677.711,2685.287,"No, under my hypothetical, in the three cases, the court of appeals, let's say, determines that the alleged statements did not occur."
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2689.847,2695.111,"--At least that's part of our adversary system, Your Honor, where we have both sides presenting and countering."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2695.892,2698.077,Is that reversible error on appeal?
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2698.077,2699.812,--That it--
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2699.812,2703.887,Five gets you cases when the court of appeals determines that three did not occur?
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2703.887,2705.199,--If it's determined under your hypothetical--
2007.06-1221,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2705.199,2707.261,"Well, that's exactly what's sort of bothering me."
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2709.838,2710.354,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2710.354,2711.807,And I'm not.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2764.192,2764.598,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2764.598,2775.828,"And, therefore, I thought this court of appeals is trying to second-guess that trial court judge unless that trial court judge is making an absolute rule, which he may have been."
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2792.821,2793.43,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2809.222,2819.81,"Well, then, how are we going to... I'm not arguing about what it says so much as I'm arguing about who has the right between the court of appeals and the trial court to decide?"
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2819.81,2820.122,--Your Honor--
2007.06-1221,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2820.122,2826.088,And all I'm worried about... and you tell me if that's the law in the Tenth Circuit or elsewhere.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2834.726,2835.382,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2835.382,2838.319,"Now, you tell me if the rules are different in the Tenth Circuit?"
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2842.286,2842.833,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2842.833,2843.801,All right.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2860.622,2861.294,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2865.698,2866.901,I got your blanket part.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2867.447,2880.942,"And so once you are there, we have no quarrel if the Tenth Circuit... and I think the Tenth Circuit leaves room for sending it back, remand it, and then the court could still make rulings, as the Tenth Circuit said, on cumulative nature of evidence, hearsay objections."
2007.06-1221,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2883.316,2888.361,"Oh, no, not... I'm saying... well, you got my point, but you're just not answering my question."
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2888.361,2888.564,"--I am sorry, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2889.314,2891.266,And I don't want to repeat it.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2900.621,2901.293,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2920.941,2929.906,"--Mr. Egan, what if I think that, had he engaged in a balancing, it would have been an abuse of discretion not to exclude it?"
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2934.108,2945.447,"If you believe that it is so clear, then, of course, that would be... if you believe that it is so clear that it is an abuse of discretion not to exclude it, then that is the prerogative of the Court to do."
2007.06-1221,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2960.63,2965.909,"No, but I am worried about having five trials... you know, one trial turning into six trials."
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2969.314,2970.111,"--I understand, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2970.674,2970.861,Yes.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,2970.861,2971.971,"--But let me just say this, if I might."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2992.541,2995.101,What if I assume your rule cuts the other way?
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3021.747,3022.122,--Absolutely.
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3026.793,3035.742,"So if you are talking about culture, what is the culture of the company if 995 supervisors don't supervise... don't discriminate in their decisions and 5 do?"
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3035.742,3041.646,"--Your Honor, the culture... they have the right to bring on evidence, but the trial court retains the discretion."
2007.06-1221,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3047.503,3057.64,"Well, maybe, just as an example, you could take Mr. Borel and Mr. Hoopes and explain why their testimony should not have been excluded under 403?"
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3074.523,3078.849,"Because John Borel's evidence goes to pretext, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3122.128,3137.592,"So if company can admit evidence to show the opposite of your ""me, too"" evidence by other supervisors and you say five shows the culture of discrimination, how many are they allowed to admit before... to show the opposite culture?"
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3143.604,3145.932,"--I can't pick a number, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3154.287,3154.803,Right.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3159.269,3160.004,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3160.004,3165.737,"You said there was going to be an agreement that this would be a trial or a day, a day and a half."
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3165.737,3166.345,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3166.345,3172.592,Was that before or after the premise this testimony would not be admitted.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3172.592,3176.279,That was after the premise that the testimony would not be admitted.
2007.06-1221,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3178.028,3181.589,You told it can be done in a day and a half.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3185.025,3186.041,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3207.594,3219.231,I don't think that has any bearing on the ruling that the trial judge made that's under review in the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and that we're looking at here.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3219.231,3230.46,"Well, Your Honor, it goes to whether or not saying that there's going to be a lengthy trial it is some evidence as you look at what the actual experience is... look at the cases cited by the defendant."
2007.06-1221,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3232.053,3234.49,They may have just thought the game isn't worth the candle.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3244.127,3244.846,"That's fine, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3249.468,3252.873,And that's the problem that concerns me.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3278.535,3281.425,"Your Honor, we're simply asking for balance, because other supervisors--"
2007.06-1221,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3281.425,3293.341,"Doesn't that get to the point, though, hasn't the last hour of questioning from the court shown that what we really ought to take place here is a remand to the trial court for a 403 balance?"
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3293.341,3293.685,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1221,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3293.685,3294.185,Okay.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3294.185,3299.075,If I might offer some concluding thoughts because my time is running down.
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3317.145,3321.377,So you think the court of appeals erred as well in ruling that the evidence was admissible?
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3329.796,3338.636,"--Your Honor, I think that what the... my reading of the Tenth Circuit, for what it's worth, is that they were looking at the exclusionary order based on the wrong legal rule and said, we are going to reverse that."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3361.878,3371.201,"And if on the remand that you conceded is necessary, that will take place in the context of a motion in limine and not in the context of a new trial?"
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3371.201,3382.853,"--It should be in the context of going back and being remanded, for the court maybe to make determination, but our position is in the context of a new trial the court can address any new motion that hasn't been made."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3382.853,3388.351,So you think a new trial is required for the district court to make the 403 determination?
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3388.351,3392.615,I think that you have to get back before the district court procedurally.
2007.06-1221,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3392.615,3396.254,Has this Court said that 403 determinations must always be made on the record?
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3396.254,3400.735,"No, Your Honor, you haven't said that they should be on the record, but we're not asking for that."
2007.06-1221,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3403.422,3407.296,"Well, I thought that's precisely what you are saying, that that there is no balancing shown, that he didn't do the balance."
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3407.296,3415.356,"--Well, Your Honor, there should... we believe, if... as you write the opinion, there should be... the court should show there work."
2007.06-1221,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3421.527,3428.633,It seems very strange to me that we... there's been... the case went to the jury without the evidence you wanted to get in.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3442.096,3443.955,"No, Your Honor, if may I answer that question."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3443.955,3444.768,Yes.
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3444.768,3454.592,"The only thing that can't happen on remand... I want to make sure this is clear... is that the judge can't exclude on the same basis that caused the problem the first time; that is, well, it is not Reddick; it's excluded."
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3458.997,3459.888,"Thank you, Mr. Egan."
2007.06-1221,2,20822,dennis_e_egan,,3459.888,3460.466,Thank you.
2007.06-1221,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3460.466,3462.169,"Mr. Cane, you have five minutes."
2007.06-1221,3,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,3462.169,3474.866,Let me begin by addressing Justice Kennedy's question about the Rule 403 issue.
2007.06-1221,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3487.674,3494.282,But the... how can we make that assumption when the Tenth Circuit says we know why this district judge ruled as he or she did?
2007.06-1221,3,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,3512.476,3512.945,--Neither--
2007.06-1221,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3512.945,3514.788,So it wasn't any 403 question.
2007.06-1221,3,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,3517.506,3526.596,"--Neither that case nor this case involved any attempt to show that foundation, the linkage between these other persons, these other alleged bad actors, and the decision here."
2007.06-1221,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3526.596,3534.124,But that's not... the point is that the Tenth Circuit said this judge made an absolute rule: It doesn't come in.
2007.06-1221,3,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,3539.092,3543.885,"Well, I think the Tenth Circuit... it... it applied the incorrect presumption."
2007.06-1221,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3546.713,3549.32,How could ut have been?
2007.06-1221,3,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,3568.283,3571.204,"Well, that always will be true in the case of a motion in limine."
2007.06-1221,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3575.732,3576.341,But where does it say?
2007.06-1221,3,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,3596.473,3606.454,"--I don't think district judges can be expected to, you know, write opinions that are... to be affirmed to be worthy of publication in F. Supp. 2d."
2007.06-1221,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3613.28,3623.167,"Did anyone argue that before December 15, 2004, that we don't know about the mine run of cases, but this case, in fact it's a waste of time?"
2007.06-1221,3,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,3627.119,3628.103,--That's the time when--
2007.06-1221,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3628.103,3631.554,I'm asking yes or no; did they or didn't they?
2007.06-1221,3,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,3631.554,3631.836,--No.
2007.06-1221,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3631.836,3632.258,Okay.
2007.06-1221,3,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,3632.258,3634.537,Because that's when the court considered notions in limine.
2007.06-1221,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3639.488,3642.394,You said there were two points about 403.
2007.06-1221,3,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,3642.394,3655.92,"Yes, the second is I agree with Justice Alito's observation, or I think it was his observation, that it would have been abuse... an of discretion to admit this evidence anyway; and so that gets you easily by the 403 issue."
2007.06-1221,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3671.898,3681.658,Do you not think that there is an important value that the Tenth Circuit recognized in making it clear that there is no absolute bar?
2007.06-1221,3,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,3703.196,3713.396,"I think that, absent some showing of relationship of nexus, then the presumptive rule in the run of cases should be that this evidence should not be admitted."
2007.06-1221,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3713.396,3718.987,"You... you don't want that clarification to be done at the expense your client, I take it?"
2007.06-1221,3,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,3722.705,3724.0,Of course not.
2007.06-1221,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3738.698,3742.4,The... the Government said it was not necessary to lay a foundation.
2007.06-1221,3,37819,paul_w_cane_jr,,3744.445,3747.912,"--He did say that, Justice Ginsburg, but that's not what their brief says."
2007.06-1221,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3747.912,3750.178,"Thank you, Mr. Cane."
