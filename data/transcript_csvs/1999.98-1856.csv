1999.98-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.496,"We'll hear argument now in No. 98-1856, Leila Jeanne Hill, et al. v. Colorado."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,10.558,13.448,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,77.641,83.561,"Mr. Sekulow, am I correct in understanding that no speech, no words, are prohibited."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,88.622,91.482,"Outside of the zone, there is no restriction on speech."
1999.98-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,92.012,95.76,"But even in the zone, as long as you're 8 feet away, you can speak."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,95.76,98.868,"--Yes, but there... you have... there are two different zones here."
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,119.221,121.456,"What is it... what is it that... I mean, 8 feet."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,128.625,129.655,--I think it's--
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,129.655,136.622,"What... what speech is it difficult for anyone to make when you're about this 8 feet, say, the distance between me and Justice Kennedy?"
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,136.622,140.699,"--Justice Breyer, I think it's the same issues that the Court dealt with in Schenck, the distribution--"
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,140.699,146.417,"Well, in Schenck I suppose the problem was that you couldn't... you didn't know where the bubble started."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,155.882,157.224,"--Well, I... I think there is, Justice Breyer."
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,165.628,181.388,"That wasn't... I thought the problem in the other case was that as the person walked along the sidewalk, people who were just standing on the sidewalk would have to get out of the way as the person carrying the bubble moved along."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,196.178,196.725,--This--
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,196.725,198.678,"Now, is... am I right about that factually?"
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,198.678,200.569,"--I think that's incorrect, Justice Breyer."
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,200.569,200.913,All right.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,201.288,201.46,And here's the reason why.
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,208.193,209.005,--I'm... I'm sorry.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,227.905,228.373,That's--
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,228.373,238.276,"But if in fact the woman decides she doesn't want to go close to that person and walks around him, then he cannot chase her."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,242.447,243.43,--That's correct.
1999.98-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,276.667,277.276,"Well, that's not like in Madsen."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,283.446,289.007,"Actually, Justice Stevens, in Madsen the... the prohibition that was at issue in the injunction prohibited a physical approach."
1999.98-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,289.007,293.271,"Well, didn't the Chief Justice's opinion interpret it as requiring the stand-by to move?"
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,293.271,294.974,Not in Madsen.
1999.98-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,297.584,298.27,"Oh, okay."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,298.27,302.128,"And in that... in that regard, here the concern was that the zone floats in Schenck."
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,306.815,312.781,"Remind me... my original question was this, and it may just require reminding me of what these other cases said."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,324.824,325.73,Yes.
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,325.73,327.246,And there's a woman coming along.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,332.633,334.038,I think--
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,334.038,335.445,This is a speech case.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,337.272,340.473,"--The display of a leaflet, the showing someone written material."
1999.98-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,363.136,364.963,"What was the distance, Mr. Sekulow?"
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,366.259,367.181,--That's correct.
1999.98-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,388.096,390.642,"But the... but the distance must make some difference, Mr. Sekulow."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,403.729,411.055,"Well, interestingly in this particular case, the statute does prohibit impeding, blocking, or crowding, section 2, which is not challenged."
1999.98-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,427.923,428.58,It's not just impeding.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,446.308,450.745,"Well, Justice Scalia, this Court has recognized that when it comes to public debate, that it can be robust."
1999.98-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.354,456.729,No.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,462.834,470.644,"I don't... first... first of all, this would not... that action would not violate the statute because this statute, section 3, does not prohibit simply an approach."
1999.98-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,495.838,496.868,Have you... I don't think you've answered the question.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,499.023,501.898,--I... I think it suffers from the same constitutional problem.
1999.98-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,502.397,502.928,"It would be the same, okay."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,502.928,511.113,"--Justice Stevens, I don't think it's simply the location because you could be 6 inches away from someone and not be blocking them at all."
1999.98-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,512.361,513.938,How about an eighth of an inch?
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,514.799,517.563,"Justice Scalia, I... I wouldn't even want to give you the eighth of the inch."
1999.98-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.563,519.905,"Really, your client holds some very unreasonable territory."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,519.905,526.248,"I... I don't... I don't think so because this is... this is speech on a public forum, and if you're blocking somebody, that... that's a different story."
1999.98-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,526.248,539.072,"But speech on a public forum, the traditional concept is, you know, there's somebody on a soapbox and a bunch of people gathered around them, not that you're one on one with someone an eighth of an inch away."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,539.072,543.289,"I... I think leafleting, Mr. Chief Justice, does require close contact."
1999.98-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,552.519,556.657,"Well, in Abrams against United States, they threw them out of a second story window... the leaflets."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,556.657,561.015,"--Yes, and I... I take it, when it landed on the streets, it would be... have been protected speech at that point."
1999.98-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,561.469,577.601,"Would you acknowledge, Mr. Sekulow... would you... no, I gather you would not acknowledge that it would be reasonable to have such a law which limited the bubble to a distance which is inherently intimidating."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,584.959,599.514,"I think that the danger in that is, because it's so specific on facts and circumstances, in the context of a statute like this, that if the concern that's being addressed is access or blocking, the way to handle it... the State of Colorado did it... and that is section 2."
1999.98-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.887,607.949,"I'm not obstructing, detaining, hindering."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,615.118,615.555,--No.
1999.98-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,617.195,619.147,--What makes that okay?
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,619.147,619.866,But under the statute--
1999.98-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.866,620.569,What makes that okay?
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,620.569,623.02,--Because of speech activity.
1999.98-1856,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,648.807,655.57,"Well, but you... you certainly can convey anything you want to convey orally from a distance of 8 feet."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,673.781,675.031,--That's correct.
1999.98-1856,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,675.031,677.499,"And so, this isn't some unusual provision."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,677.499,678.296,"But I... I think, Justice--"
1999.98-1856,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,678.296,683.715,You don't... you don't say that a person must accept the leaflet.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,683.715,684.933,--No.
1999.98-1856,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,686.933,687.401,No.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,687.401,700.974,"But I think what... Your Honor, Justice O'Connor, what you wrote in Kokinda... and that is people that live in metropolitan areas know that one need not ponder the contents of a leaflet to mechanically take it out of someone's hand or, for that matter, to reject it, but it's that mechanical taking out of someone's hand."
1999.98-1856,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,711.063,717.264,"Well, if the person to whom it's offered wants to take it under this statute, they can and will."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,718.279,718.998,And the same--
1999.98-1856,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,718.998,721.404,--And it would be the same if it were 1 foot or 8 feet.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,721.404,728.823,"--And it... the same argument could have been and was made in Schenck, and this Court said there 15 feet was still a problem because the zone floats."
1999.98-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,730.152,745.253,"Mr. Sekulow, on... on that, I understood you to answer Justice Breyer's question by saying that the stationary speaker, so-called, could not even station... in a stationary position offer leaflets without violating the statute."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,746.784,750.783,"--If you're standing still and you're in... within that 8-foot zone before someone else is, you--"
1999.98-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,750.783,751.969,I'm standing still and somebody--
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,751.969,752.766,--Approaches you?
1999.98-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,752.766,753.657,--gets within 8 feet.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,753.657,753.907,It's... that's correct.
1999.98-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,755.406,760.029,"So, I can say to that person, will you take a leaflet, or just hold the leaflet out."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,760.607,761.498,--If you're there first.
1999.98-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,761.498,762.045,Pardon me?
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,762.045,763.074,If you're there first.
1999.98-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,763.074,764.027,If you're there first and you're stationary--
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,764.027,764.543,Absolutely.
1999.98-1856,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,764.543,765.199,--you can do that.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,765.199,768.291,"That operates exactly, Justice Souter, as the no-approach zone in Madsen."
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,768.291,774.992,"Now, why then being that... if that's the case, what's exactly the problem?"
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,815.04,827.832,"The problem is the assumption, Justice Breyer, that you're operating under is that you got there first, and if you got there first, you... and you stand still and someone approaches you and you're not blocking them... of course, the... the dichotomy of all this is, if you're standing still, you may well be blocking."
1999.98-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,870.661,872.38,How practically?
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,891.123,893.217,"--That's right, if they got there before the event opened."
1999.98-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.168,902.559,Mr. Sekulow--
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,902.559,903.356,--Yes.
1999.98-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,903.356,904.949,--May... may I just ask kind of a general question?
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,926.252,928.251,"Well, to anyone who doesn't want the leaflet."
1999.98-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,929.157,929.72,"Well, I understand that."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,929.72,930.766,--seeking access to or egress from the clinic.
1999.98-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.766,934.843,"So... so, you... you have... it's... there's kind of a dilemma, it seems to me."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,943.684,948.339,"You don't have the... you... you can't require someone to take a leaflet, but I think Heffron is a good example of this."
1999.98-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,948.339,955.243,"--But... but you do have a constitutional right to give her an opportunity if she's a willing recipient, either the doctor or the... to have that."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,960.133,962.648,"If there's... consent is given, there's no violation of the statute."
1999.98-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,984.532,989.421,"But see, what I'm trying to suggest is that you have to be a willing listener if you're in the 8-foot zone."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,993.513,994.825,--It's... it's not simply leafleting.
1999.98-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,996.215,999.823,"Well, I'm just concentrating on the leafleting now because, it seems to me, that's your strongest argument."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,999.823,1005.587,"Well, the... the way the leafleting works is usually, in a... in a leafleting situation, people are close, closer than 8 feet."
1999.98-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1024.299,1024.94,Mr. Sekulow?
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1024.94,1025.532,--Yes.
1999.98-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.532,1035.951,"In Madsen, we said that an injunction would be judged by a more stringent standard than a statute, and here, of course, we... we have a statute, not an injunction."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1035.951,1036.576,That's correct.
1999.98-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.576,1041.48,"Yet, you frequently refer to Madsen as if the things were interchangeable."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1041.48,1042.369,"Well, in this context."
1999.98-1856,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1057.961,1059.115,Why don't you talk about that one?
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1071.751,1072.314,--Absolutely.
1999.98-1856,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1097.241,1097.741,Can you... can you tell me?
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1109.175,1110.236,That... that's interesting.
1999.98-1856,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1114.97,1116.281,It's... it's not protest.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1117.469,1117.891,Encouragement?
1999.98-1856,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1117.891,1118.391,--encouraging the person.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1118.391,1127.622,"Oh, it... I think that that would not, but I think the State, if they were making an accusation, would probably say... they would argue that it may constitute a form a counseling, offering of guidance, the way they... they've drafted this."
1999.98-1856,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1141.835,1142.663,How do you feel?
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1142.663,1143.584,How do you feel?
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1164.859,1165.702,"Well, but which is it?"
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1198.47,1199.954,Which I think they did not.
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1199.954,1205.936,"--or... or if they do narrowly tailor it, it's content discrimination."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1205.936,1206.655,And... and--
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1206.655,1211.701,"So... so, whenever the State would try to regulate anything, they'd fall into the one or the other."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1211.701,1213.059,"--Justice Breyer, I don't think so."
1999.98-1856,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1219.15,1224.727,Do you know of any precedent which defines narrow tailoring by whether or not it's content-based?
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1224.727,1234.52,"I... I think looking at it, no because the most realistic narrow tailoring case that fits this the Court found it to be content-neutral, which was United States v. Grace."
1999.98-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1237.613,1245.922,"Mr. Sekulow, I was reading your brief closely and trying to envision the statute that would be constitutional."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1273.489,1275.645,I think that's... that's a correct position.
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1287.954,1288.361,Wait.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1304.042,1307.103,"--Well, the way Colorado has drafted it, I think it is."
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1307.103,1307.603,"No, no."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1314.195,1315.929,Commercial speech would--
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1315.929,1317.209,That isn't content-based because you--
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1317.209,1317.787,--That's--
1999.98-1856,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1317.787,1321.192,--treat advertising differently from... all right.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1321.536,1329.221,"--Although it does bring up an interesting scenario here, Justice Breyer, and that is the way that this statute works... let's say someone talking about advertising, to take your example."
1999.98-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1344.543,1350.664,"--Well, you... you argue... my colleagues admitted you argue, on one hand, the statute is too broad and, on the other hand, it's too narrow."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1376.842,1377.998,"--No, I think the State can."
1999.98-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1379.232,1380.527,Well... go ahead.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1380.527,1383.089,--What I would... what I would have drafted if I was the... the State here--
1999.98-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.089,1383.964,You were the State.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1383.964,1385.011,"--Yes, but I'm not."
1999.98-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1386.947,1387.931,That's why you should use the subjunctive.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1389.039,1389.867,--Yes.
1999.98-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1403.581,1404.597,They have that statute.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1405.267,1406.033,--Section 2.
1999.98-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1406.033,1410.608,"--Yes, and I asked you before and you, I thought, were quite candid in saying that's all they can do."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1410.608,1411.577,I think that's--
1999.98-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1411.577,1415.342,--section 2 and there's no other statute that would satisfy your test.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1415.342,1416.342,--I think that... that--
1999.98-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1416.342,1417.246,It could not go beyond that.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1417.246,1419.449,"--because section 2 would satisfy my test, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.98-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1419.449,1425.54,"Yes, but I asked you if there was any statute that tried to replicate--"
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1425.54,1426.79,What they've done here.
1999.98-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1426.79,1430.289,--or controls the injunctions that we have permitted--
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1430.289,1434.412,"I don't think so, and let me clarify my position and the reason why."
1999.98-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1466.009,1469.867,"--But as I remember Boos at least, that was a one viewpoint."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1485.003,1485.847,And this Court--
1999.98-1856,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1485.847,1487.409,You can't educate about either side.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1487.409,1494.64,"--Justice Ginsburg, the... this Court in Madsen and Schenck, in dealing with the issues, said that the injunctions were content-neutral and--"
1999.98-1856,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1494.64,1505.932,"Well, this... this statute makes me think, in a way, of the City of Renton case where the concern was the secondary effects of the conduct."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1509.43,1509.993,--I--
1999.98-1856,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1509.993,1512.43,"But there were secondary effects being addressed, and maybe--"
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1512.43,1513.071,--Justice--
1999.98-1856,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1513.071,1528.596,"--that's the situation here, that the... the State doesn't care on which side of the message it is, but is concerned about the secondary effects of intimidation... intimidating conduct near a medical facility."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1528.596,1541.356,"--If that's... based on your question and... and comment, Justice O'Connor, they need to draft a statute that prohibits intimidation, crowding, or violence which I think... or threatening conduct, which I think they did in section 2."
1999.98-1856,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1541.356,1541.903,But we--
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1541.903,1542.45,This isn't--
1999.98-1856,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1542.45,1550.854,"--we take the case, I think, on the assumption that Colorado has tried to do that and cannot enforce it if there are crowds."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1568.846,1590.541,"--I think they set the purpose out of the statute in section 1, which states that the General Assembly recognizes access to health care facilities for the purposes of obtaining medical counsel and treatment that's imperative for citizens, that the exercise of a person's right to protest or counsel against certain medical procedures must be balanced against another person's right to obtain medical counseling."
1999.98-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.992,1596.272,"Mr. Sekulow, can I ask... I'm really seeking information here on your position."
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1610.08,1615.704,--The pizza solicitation would be the distribution of literature prohibition which applies to all literature distribution.
1999.98-1856,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1615.704,1616.048,I see.
1999.98-1856,0,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1617.906,1625.512,"We... we think it's content-based from the standpoint that it provides an opportunity for... because of the prior consent requirement, to allow for content-based determinations."
1999.98-1856,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1631.416,1632.479,"--Very well, Mr. Sekulow."

1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1651.487,1651.925,Excuse me.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1655.346,1656.033,"--That's what I said, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1656.033,1657.97,--It only protects those people?
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1657.97,1658.219,No.
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1665.045,1666.498,But it doesn't cover just medical patients.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1675.558,1676.854,"--No, Your Honor--"
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1676.854,1681.43,"I mean, that's a very small percentage of the... of the universe covered by this thing, isn't it?"
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1681.43,1698.267,"--Your Honor, the... the statute covers all persons within 100 feet of a medical facility, and a great percentage of those people are... are either treating individuals who are sick and vulnerable and disabled or persons who are seeking treatment from these--"
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1698.267,1700.422,"Well, in... in that respect, how does this statute work?"
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1720.165,1726.257,"--The statute operates to the extent that it is covered, public sidewalk or a public way."
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1728.599,1729.037,"So, if--"
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1729.037,1733.159,"--a story of any type, it would be the entrance to the building which contained the medical facility--"
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1733.159,1733.534,--So--
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1733.534,1734.441,--and the public right-of-way.
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1734.441,1750.232,"--So, with respect to all of the businesses in those buildings, the press, lawyers, business people, people engaged in manufacturing that might affect the environment, this statute happens to apply just because there's a doctor's office there."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1750.842,1751.232,No.
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1753.169,1758.62,It seems to me that that's... that that's whimsical and imprecise and inconsistent with our speech precedents.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1758.62,1766.445,"Your Honor, it was... it's narrowly designed to affect only the 100 feet within a medical facility or a hospital."
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1766.445,1768.523,But we've just discussed the hypothetical in which it is not.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1768.523,1778.551,"Well, if a doctor's office is contained within a... a private building, the statute would not be operative because it doesn't involve a public way or a public sidewalk."
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1779.676,1785.705,I... I... my hypothesis is a private building that has an entry off a public sidewalk--
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1785.705,1787.001,--That's--
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1787.001,1788.86,--which I assume most buildings do.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1788.86,1790.373,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1804.181,1804.556,Sorry.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1825.565,1838.294,"The statute uses the term, Justice Breyer, health care facility, and it states that a health care facility means any entity that is licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized or permitted by law to administer medical treatment in the State."
1999.98-1856,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1838.294,1846.587,"So, I guess that... that floor 18 or... has office number 1806 is the medical facility."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1848.992,1850.836,"No, Your Honor, it would not be."
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1853.569,1854.146,Right.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1860.379,1863.706,The provision states--
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1863.706,1864.502,Within 100 feet of what?
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1864.502,1869.094,--Within 100 feet of a medical... of the entrance to a medical facility.
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.094,1870.405,Of the entrance to a medical facility.

1999.98-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1886.665,1896.177,"Now, Mr.... Mr. McLachlan, in section 2 on page 65a, it uses the term health care facility."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1901.926,1903.301,"I believe they're synonymous, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1907.627,1909.751,Where... where you reading from?

1999.98-1856,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1919.997,1934.257,"Is... am I... where... where does this issue that Justice Kennedy just raised fit in this case, that the reason that it's too broad is it would cover offices that are located within some large, downtown office building that don't have doctors in it?"
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1942.114,1950.017,"--Your Honor, it's narrowly drawn because the statute only operates in conjunction with entrance to a medical facility and a public side-way or walkway."
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1950.907,1961.779,"--I don't want to distract the Court on an issue that wasn't briefed, but it seems to me that this is troublesome and I would read the statute... and I thought... and I think that's your answer, that it applies to anybody on the... on the sidewalk of that building."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,1986.393,2002.465,"--Your Honor, the statute is predicated upon a finding by the Colorado legislature that it is imperative to protect access to health care facilities and that the relationship between that... that location and a public sidewalk is the object of the... of the regulation."
1999.98-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2003.95,2004.463,But--
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2004.463,2006.057,--are the circumstances in which it would apply.
1999.98-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2006.057,2011.009,"--Mr. McLachlan, now as I recall in Madsen, it was a free-standing clinic."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2030.0,2041.917,"Well, Your Honor, again because the statute only operates as to a public sidewalk or... or way... public way, I think, as a practical matter, the statute operates outside the facility within... within a--"
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2041.917,2042.823,But that's... that's the whole point.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2048.774,2050.539,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2050.539,2063.378,"Well, Mr.... Mr. McLachlan, I thought a moment ago your answer to the 18-story building hypothesis was that the medical facility was the office up on... whatever it was... the 16th floor."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2064.94,2065.908,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2065.908,2066.346,All right.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2066.985,2071.533,But the entrance is located in conjunction with the public sidewalk and the public way.
1999.98-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2071.533,2085.06,"--So that if there is one doctor's office on the 16th floor, the whole sidewalk and entrance is subject to this regulation by the statute as if the entire building were filled with doctors' offices?"
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2085.06,2086.418,"No, not as if, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2090.292,2100.507,"No, but you're saying that if there's a doctor's office on any floor of the skyscraper, that the entrance and the sidewalk is subject to regulation under the statute."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2100.507,2101.74,"--That's correct, Your Honor."

1999.98-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.843,2127.309,"But if... if you're talking about a statute that abridges freedom of speech or is alleged to, it... it can't be vague."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2145.755,2147.927,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2147.927,2174.011,"Is that the case that you want us to do, that we... we now accept as the... to turn this case on your interpretation of a matter that hasn't come up before I gather, and that you're saying officially in your role as a representative of the State that it does apply to an 18-story office building on the... on the sidewalk where there's nobody but one doctor up on the 18th floor and stops everybody else from speaking about anything?"
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2174.011,2178.415,I'm not... I'm not asking the... the Court to accept my interpretation.
1999.98-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2186.302,2187.896,"Well, has the statute ever been applied--"
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2197.956,2199.315,I think it does apply in conjunction--
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2199.315,2199.753,You think it does.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2199.753,2202.315,--If it's... if it's in connection with a public way and a public sidewalk.
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.315,2207.251,"You think it does, and although you're not willing... you're not willing to say authoritatively that it does?"
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2207.251,2208.281,No.
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2216.31,2216.904,That it does.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2216.904,2221.247,--that it applies to the entrance of a health care facility in connection with a public sidewalk or a public way.
1999.98-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2221.247,2227.995,And that is so even if the health care facility on the 18th floor is more than 100 feet away from the sidewalk.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2230.681,2235.538,"That's correct, Your Honor, because the focus of the statute is with 100 feet of the entrance."
1999.98-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2235.538,2241.8,Has the statute ever been applied in the fashion you... you maintain it would apply?
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2244.377,2245.299,"No, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2246.534,2247.736,--The answer is no.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2247.736,2249.734,--there has never been a prosecution under the statute.
1999.98-1856,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2250.328,2250.953,For anybody.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2250.953,2251.797,--has never been enjoined.
1999.98-1856,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2257.857,2258.762,But even in the case--
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2262.074,2263.699,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2267.01,2269.729,Is... excuse me.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2273.54,2275.507,"To the contrary, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2276.554,2276.773,--I didn't think it was.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2276.773,2282.818,--all conduct of the subject matter of the statute which occurs within 100 feet of a health care facility.
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2282.818,2285.973,"It would be bad if it was addressed just to abortion protests, wouldn't it?"
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2285.973,2286.723,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2288.27,2291.035,So... so it applies to labor picketing?
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2291.035,2296.142,It would apply to labor picketing under the circumstances present in this case if you were within 100--
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2296.142,2302.281,"So, a labor organization has a different rule if it's in front of a health facility than it's... if it's in front of a manufacturing plant."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2302.281,2304.78,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2304.78,2305.982,That's... is that content-based?
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2305.982,2312.886,"No, Your Honor, it's not because again the purpose of the statute and the scope of the statute is to govern all... all forms of--"
1999.98-1856,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2312.886,2322.273,"But I suppose the NLRB, if it turned out to be a labor problem, could preempt any effect of Colorado's State law in respect to the labor unions, couldn't it?"
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2322.273,2330.083,"--That... that may well be the result, Justice Breyer, that the operation of the Federal law would... would affect the statute that way."
1999.98-1856,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2330.083,2332.16,What--
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2338.158,2339.908,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2352.981,2354.012,I'm curious.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2375.535,2377.722,"I'm not aware of that, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2378.644,2387.517,"--I'm just wondering why... you know, why this is a... a great... this particular area is of... is of great concern to the... I don't know."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2406.839,2413.304,"--Your Honor, the Colorado legislature, in its review of the statute, first of all, we've never employed the term innocent."
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.238,2436.42,"I just wonder whether the statute is... is, you know, although facially applicable to anybody who... who approaches this kind of facility, I think... I think we know what it's aimed at, which is abortion protests."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2445.932,2461.91,"Your Honor, what the statute singles out and what the statute focuses upon is the approach in a... in a circumstance which can arise and become, as this Court recognized in... in the Schenck case, a constructive obstruction."
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2461.91,2463.112,In other words--
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2483.34,2494.165,I think the reason this has a different under... under-support than labor picketing is because it focuses solely on people within 100 feet of a health care facility.
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2494.165,2494.54,No.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2495.118,2499.397,And that these people are entitled to special protection as found by our legislature.
1999.98-1856,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2499.397,2514.673,"--And it would apply to labor people who were trying to educate the public about a labor union matter, people who were objecting to the facility charging too much money, people who were objecting to the facility's use of animals in experimenting."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2517.109,2518.047,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2521.044,2521.654,What--
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2521.654,2527.371,--It applies to both sides or all the multiple sides of the debate because it is a content-neutral statute.
1999.98-1856,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2527.371,2535.838,--Would you tell us what this portion of the statute accomplishes that subsection 2 does not?
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2535.838,2543.071,"Subsection 2 only deals with, in our... in our view, physical contact between persons and--"
1999.98-1856,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2543.071,2548.802,"Well, it... it deals with knowingly obstructing, detaining, impeding, and so forth."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2556.519,2565.375,--What this covers by the establishment of the 8-foot zone of separation is it allows a normal conversation to occur.
1999.98-1856,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2578.542,2579.62,But--
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2579.62,2592.71,The other section just deals with physical... physical contact and... and physical obstruction without... without regard to the proximity between the... the willing listener and... and the demonstrator.
1999.98-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2592.71,2598.035,--We don't ordinarily think that to... to be able to speak you have to have State authorization or permission to speak.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2604.876,2617.418,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I think it's important for us to point out again in front of this Court that from 8 feet away all forms of expression, irrespective of their content, are... are encouraged, allowed, and permitted under the statute--"
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2617.418,2635.692,"Well, you... you could say that from... from 100 feet if you use a... you know, a bullhorn, but... but you can't... what the... what these abortion protestors, which is what this is directed at, generally do is... is... like to say, you know, my dear, have you really considered the consequences?"
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2658.669,2661.496,"--Your Honor, 8 feet is a normal conversational tone."
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2661.496,2662.027,It is?
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2662.027,2662.855,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.23,2666.978,"My goodness, I... I rarely stand 8 feet away from somebody that I'm talking to."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2672.366,2676.302,"--I understand, Your Honor, but everybody that you communicate with is a willing listener."
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.754,2681.128,"Oh, I... I think not."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2683.876,2686.658,"But if I may, Your Honor--"
1999.98-1856,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2686.658,2688.252,Don't be too sure.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2688.797,2690.11,"--Yes, ma'am."
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2705.854,2715.538,Why isn't this a content-based statute if what it does is foreclose discussion of all the issues Justice Ginsburg was mentioning with relation to the health... health care system?
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2715.538,2718.037,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2718.037,2730.83,"Why isn't this content-based because it has... imposes a special burden on people who want to discuss issues, all of the ones Justice Ginsburg raised and more, HMO cost, et cetera, with reference to the health system?"
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2730.83,2734.438,It's not content-based because it allows... it takes no side on the debate.
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2736.811,2738.921,It forecloses all debate on that subject.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2738.921,2742.855,--All... all debates on the... no subject.
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2742.855,2744.714,"Well, on the subject of health care."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2749.274,2763.097,"Again, within the 100... 100-foot from an entrance of a facility, it allows completely for both uninhibited debate on all topics and it allows it if the listener wants--"
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2763.097,2767.705,You're saying the statute is not content-based if it forecloses discussions on both sides of... of a particular subject.
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2767.705,2769.97,"--It doesn't foreclose discussions, Your Honor."
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2769.97,2770.283,That's not my definition of content--
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2770.283,2780.653,"All discussions can occur from 8 feet, and if the... if the listener is willing to allow a... a person to approach... and again, one of the reasons for the 8 feet is a very common sense thing."
1999.98-1856,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.653,2783.668,"--This would cover a protest over the death penalty as well as something to do with health care, wouldn't it?"
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2788.667,2790.275,"If it... yes, yes, it would."
1999.98-1856,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2790.275,2797.132,"So, I mean, not only point of view, but also a wide range of subject matter can be spoken in... in this kind of activity."
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2797.132,2802.115,"That's correct, Your Honor, if it meets the statutory definition, oral protest, education, or--"
1999.98-1856,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2802.115,2805.722,"If you're interested in health care issues, do you go to a health care facility or to the zoo?"
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2805.722,2822.309,"--I think probably you would go to your insurance carrier, if you have one, or you would go to your doctor and you would want to make sure that you would have access to your doctor because the Colorado legislature has provided that you will have that access through the operation of the statute."
1999.98-1856,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2822.309,2833.102,Why... why wouldn't it suffice for the concerns of the State here to... to prohibit any intimidating approach by speech or otherwise?
1999.98-1856,1,36366,michael_e_mclachlan,,2843.632,2847.457,"Again, Your Honor, it's our position that there is no prohibition."
1999.98-1856,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2853.471,2855.643,"Thank you, Mr. McLachlan."
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2857.579,2868.513,Thank you.
1999.98-1856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.142,2903.017,Ms. Underwood--
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2915.185,2919.419,"No, not a general... not... not a general statute like--"
1999.98-1856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.419,2919.761,Why not?
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2919.761,2922.589,"--Well, Colorado was responding to a particular need."
1999.98-1856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2924.807,2932.008,"Well, there's violence in... you... you unaware that there... that there have occurred instances of violence and intimidation in labor picketing?"
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2932.008,2932.945,"--Well, the Court has--"
1999.98-1856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2932.945,2940.067,"We can make the same finding they have here and say all... all picketing... you know, we apply it generally to all... all commercial establishments."
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2940.067,2943.582,--Colorado hasn't made that finding that... I don't think that finding would be supported.
1999.98-1856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2951.205,2955.579,"So, there is some problem about... about not letting somebody come closer than 8 feet."
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2956.892,2958.406,--There is a First Amendment issue.
1999.98-1856,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2960.639,2961.468,--Not a real--
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2987.379,2987.832,No.
1999.98-1856,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2997.626,3009.747,"Well, it might or might... wouldn't it be for the labor board in the labor case... the constitutional issue has to presuppose that the labor board made findings like Colorado and then, as a labor law matter, laid it down."
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3014.59,3015.231,--That's right.
1999.98-1856,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3015.231,3019.603,"Well, why... why do you say that's right in this very peripheral discussion?"
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3034.439,3065.224,"If Colorado made findings that... that there was a problem of violence and intimidation that arose out of one-to-one close... close approaches of the sort here and that was not capable of being dealt with in any other way, as Colorado had tried to do here and that a statute like this was the least restrictive or at least the... was the most appropriate way of dealing with the problem, then such a statute would be upheld."
1999.98-1856,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3067.442,3075.424,Is it necessary that there be hearings and findings in order to sustain a statute like this?
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3075.424,3080.391,--It is necessary that the judgment be supported.
1999.98-1856,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3091.963,3097.211,"But is there... there is Federal legislation, is there not?"
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3097.211,3097.586,--Yes.
1999.98-1856,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3097.586,3101.085,A Federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act?
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3101.085,3101.772,"Yes, there is."
1999.98-1856,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3101.772,3106.848,And how does that differ from this?
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3114.267,3121.889,"Well, this statute was passed before the Federal Access to Clinics Act was passed, about a year before."
1999.98-1856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3227.898,3228.319,Excuse me.
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3239.691,3255.935,"The ban in Grace around the Supreme Court is on flags and devices that call attention to an organization, a movement, or... there clearly... there's a communicative requirement there that's quite similar to this."
1999.98-1856,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3314.085,3323.566,"If there were a sudden interest in the automobile industry, could Colorado have these speech regulatory zones around every auto dealership?"
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3323.566,3329.095,"--This isn't a... first, if exactly the same findings were made, obviously, it seems to me--"
1999.98-1856,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3329.095,3331.126,You don't like that term speech regulatory zone?
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3332.0,3332.734,--No.
1999.98-1856,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3335.515,3336.281,But what about the hypothetical?
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3337.498,3338.654,--Yes.
1999.98-1856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3341.59,3345.307,It's not an approach... you can approach as close as you like so long as you don't speak.
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3345.307,3346.245,"--No, that's not right."
1999.98-1856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3346.995,3350.447,It's only the person who approaches to speak or to... or to hand a leaflet--
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3350.447,3350.838,--With... with that--
1999.98-1856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3350.838,3351.619,--who is prohibited.
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3351.619,3352.447,--With that purpose.
1999.98-1856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3363.038,3365.397,Approach with the intention of.
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3365.397,3366.006,--With the intent.
1999.98-1856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3366.772,3367.13,Right.
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3367.848,3369.004,--without getting to the point of speaking.
1999.98-1856,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3369.004,3371.081,Or you could do this just for auto dealerships--
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3371.081,3372.863,If there were--
1999.98-1856,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3372.863,3373.8,--or law offices.
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3377.673,3379.532,--If there were a problem--
1999.98-1856,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3379.532,3387.545,And what I'm... what I'm trying to find out is if this isn't a basis to say that this is content-controlled and not content... that obviously underlies the question.
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3389.201,3390.951,"--No, it's not content control."
1999.98-1856,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3397.588,3400.618,Because of the message that goes on there.
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3400.618,3400.978,--No.
1999.98-1856,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3443.726,3446.21,"Ms. Underwood, what about... what about the consent requirement?"
1999.98-1856,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3471.013,3474.825,"Not to turn off unwelcome... may I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?"
1999.98-1856,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3483.463,3484.713,"Thank you, Ms. Underwood."
1999.98-1856,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3487.462,3491.273,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-1856,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3512.061,3512.576,Mr. Sekulow--
1999.98-1856,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3512.576,3513.013,Yes.
1999.98-1856,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3513.013,3527.601,"--am I wrong in thinking that there... there's legislation that establishes quiet zones around hospitals, around schools, which would be much more restrictive than what's involved here, based on the character of the facility?"
1999.98-1856,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3528.898,3531.054,You often see signs even that say quiet zones.
1999.98-1856,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3537.583,3538.254,"Well, is it--"
1999.98-1856,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3538.254,3540.519,And it's not a quiet zone here that they're talking about.
1999.98-1856,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3543.332,3574.397,"--But... but given the fact that there is a history of women in a very vulnerable, emotionally charged state, in a difficult physical condition, and given the fact that using words like you can't harass and you can't... whatever those words are in section 2... are very hard to interpret, could you say that having 8 feet as the limit between my fist and your face, so to speak, helps the First Amendment?"
1999.98-1856,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3579.3,3579.753,No.
1999.98-1856,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3579.753,3583.658,--rather than every time getting into an argument about what constitutes harassment.
1999.98-1856,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3583.658,3588.703,"Justice Breyer, this case... this particular statute is a criminal statute."
1999.98-1856,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3599.528,3600.542,That's my very point.
1999.98-1856,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3612.524,3618.6,--I think for the exact same reason that this Court in Madsen and in Schenck rejected the health care exception to the First Amendment.
1999.98-1856,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3633.252,3639.063,"But, Mr. Sekulow, isn't there something different about a hospital, I mean, wholly apart from the question of abortion clinics?"
1999.98-1856,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3651.044,3655.527,"But this Court has also said in those same contexts... Mr. Chief Justice, my time is expired."
1999.98-1856,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3656.463,3657.854,Briefly.
1999.98-1856,3,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,3657.854,3669.725,"The difference is there the question was was the conduct going to aggravate what was going on inside, and because the courts there gave a narrowing construction that only when it... it violates what's going on inside or causes a problem, that there would be a violation."
1999.98-1856,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3670.835,3671.804,"Thank you, Mr. Sekulow."
