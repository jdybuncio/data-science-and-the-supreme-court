1998.97-1704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.807,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 97-1704, Esteban Ortiz v. The Fibreboard Corporation."
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,11.109,16.765,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.218,201.965,"Mr. Tribe, I thought that the Fifth Circuit on remand said the big difference was that Amchem was certified under (b)(3), and this was a nonopt-out (b)(1)(B)."
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,201.965,211.332,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, they certainly did, and what I would like to show in a moment is that, if that's the difference, it cuts very much against class certification here."
1998.97-1704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,243.876,253.43,"Well, Mr. Tribe, you talk about how badly these people are going to fare under the... but how well are they going to fare if they just keep fighting their individual lawsuits?"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,253.43,265.598,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not talking about how good or bad in terms of ultimate fairness the settlement is, only the question of whether it was proper to certify it in the first instance."
1998.97-1704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.598,280.207,"Well, but you pointed out that the people are left... even when they finally go to court it's a cap on damages and that sort of thing, but don't you have to compare that with what their fate would be if they simply keep suing Fiberboard and it ends up in bankruptcy?"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,280.207,286.803,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, if we were talking about whether it's a good settlement, if that's the reason I was mentioning the caps, I guess we would."
1998.97-1704,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,344.963,347.094,"Mr. Tribe, would you help me out on one thing?"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,353.518,354.269,They are objectors--
1998.97-1704,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,354.269,354.449,And how many of them are there?
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,354.449,361.604,"--They are individual objectors who were exposed to asbestos, and who do not want to be members of this class, and who were allowed--"
1998.97-1704,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,361.604,363.227,They are all people who were exposed?
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,363.227,363.625,--Yes.
1998.97-1704,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,363.625,365.718,So they're not members of those who are not exposed--
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,365.718,366.447,That's correct.
1998.97-1704,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,376.885,376.995,--How many of them are there?
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,377.536,378.788,I think there are five.
1998.97-1704,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,378.788,383.07,"Five intervenors, and are they people who question the jurisdiction, also, or are they--"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,383.07,384.302,"Well, three of them do."
1998.97-1704,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,387.484,388.485,--Where are they from?
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,388.485,395.639,I believe Alabama... I guess they're all from Alabama.
1998.97-1704,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,398.109,410.088,"Mr. Tribe, you indicated that assuming there was adequate representation you thought that a class action might well be possible here."
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,410.088,410.659,Well... no.
1998.97-1704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,440.09,464.007,"Under (b)(1)(B), then I'm confused, because I thought it was your position, no matter how fair the settlement, no matter how good it is for the greatest number, (b)(1)(B) simply is not available for a mass tort action which consolidates or, in your words, collectivizes many injured and potentially injured people."
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,467.549,467.889,That's right.
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,480.107,489.223,"I want to ask you on the first question, you're basically saying that the lawyers shouldn't have represented their own existing clients and also the class of futures."
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,489.223,492.046,"That's separate, Justice Breyer."
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,513.928,521.264,"So in respect to both, I take it Judge Parker, who's a pretty experienced trial judge, looked at it and said, we have to act fairly quickly."
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,534.073,534.222,--Well--
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,534.222,535.544,"Now, what are we supposed to do?"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,535.544,536.225,--Justice Breyer--
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,536.225,538.987,Are we supposed to go and read the whole record in this and--
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,538.987,539.698,--I don't... I don't think--
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,539.698,542.079,"--say Judge Parker was wrong, or what?"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,542.079,544.48,"--As a matter of law, I think he was wrong."
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,584.256,604.608,"My problem is, not having read your briefs on this and the other side, I don't see how I could make a judgment as to whether Judge Parker was right or wrong in his weighing of several factors to come to the conclusion that the representation was okay, without familiarizing myself in great depth with the details of this case."
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,604.608,605.009,--Well--
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,605.009,607.922,If you see an easier way... maybe I'm supposed to do that.
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,607.922,608.102,--I do.
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,608.542,608.833,Yes.
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,609.384,620.493,"--If one takes Amchem as binding precedent, then the fact that one might have regarded the whole thing as a much more nuanced balance is no longer on the table."
1998.97-1704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,630.809,636.615,"--Are you talking about representation in terms of attorneys, or in terms of class members?"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,636.615,636.986,"Both, primarily--"
1998.97-1704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,636.986,637.516,The rule--
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,637.516,638.047,--We know that--
1998.97-1704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,638.047,640.879,--Rule 23 says nothing about attorneys.
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,640.879,659.241,"--Well, it... the focus on adequacy of representation has been interpreted by this Court to mean that not only must the class representatives meaningfully speak for the groups in question, but that the attorneys must have the ability meaningfully to represent them, since, as this Court knows, it's the attorneys that are making this deal."
1998.97-1704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,663.725,669.94,"Mr. Tribe, I would, because your time is running, like you to get to the point of--"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,669.94,670.781,(b)(1)(B).
1998.97-1704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,670.781,671.46,"--Yes, because--"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,671.46,672.351,I'd love to.
1998.97-1704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,672.351,675.533,"--if you can't certify under (b)(1)(B), all the rest of it is beside the point."
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,675.533,686.42,It seems to me that the reason you can't certify under (b)(1)(B) is primarily that there is nothing in this case that remotely resembles a limited fund.
1998.97-1704,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,694.735,701.038,"Well, what if the corporate assets, the bulk of them were put into the mix, and there it is."
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,702.33,702.78,"--Well, here--"
1998.97-1704,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,702.78,707.173,Could that not meet the rather loose language of (b)(1)(B)?
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,707.173,709.486,"--Several points, Justice O'Connor."
1998.97-1704,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,715.279,715.459,I know.
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,723.544,726.157,"Well, if it's in bankruptcy, and then you have a res--"
1998.97-1704,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,726.157,726.968,Not yet in bankruptcy.
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,727.098,727.319,--Right.
1998.97-1704,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,727.319,727.989,Maybe there's--
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,727.989,728.64,"Well, no court--"
1998.97-1704,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,728.64,733.804,--the will that remains so that the company could somehow string it out and stay in business.
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,733.804,761.242,"--Well, if there were not, as there is in this case, a potentially unlimited insurance fund, which I do want to turn to, and if, therefore, when we're in that category of cases where you can predict insolvency from a stream of liability judgments arising from a mass tort, then, if you look at the position that the author of the rule, Benjamin Kaplan, took, and we quote him in the brief, and the advisory committee, it appears... and no court has yet disagreed with this... that that is not the office of this rule."
1998.97-1704,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,768.576,771.938,But the language of the rule doesn't seem to foreclose that notion.
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,771.938,775.26,"Well, the language in fact is broader than anything about a limited fund."
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,780.664,781.445,Do you think that--
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,781.445,792.561,"But you can't squeeze that within this language, because in this case what creates the risk is the chance of a lawsuit involving insurers in California coming out the wrong way, not separate suits by individuals."
1998.97-1704,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,795.195,808.292,--Would you recognize the possibility that in personam rights could be determined under a (b)(1)(B) settlement?
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,808.292,808.823,"Well, I'm dubious."
1998.97-1704,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,822.592,824.334,"You could use it for beneficiaries of a trust fund, I take it."
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,824.334,824.755,--Yes.
1998.97-1704,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,900.315,901.815,"Mr. Tribe, may I--"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,901.815,902.526,"That is, the limit has to come--"
1998.97-1704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,902.526,935.407,"--May I... do I understand correctly that your position on (b)(1)(B) is that you simply cannot have in any case where the stand-alone claim would be for tort damages, you cannot have a (b)(1)(B) action, maybe (b)(3), but are there any circumstances in which tortfeasors... a tortfeasor could gather together injured and potentially injured people whose stand-alone claims would be for tort damages and place them in a (b)(1)(B)?"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,936.659,949.389,"--Prior to bankruptcy or receivership I can think of no such case, because the rule that bothers them, first come, first served, is part and parcel of the legal right that these individuals claim when they want to sue."
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,949.389,957.594,"Suppose an insurance company paid the full amounts of its policy and say, we're paying the full amount in, we'll walk away, could that be subject to a (b)(1)(B)?"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,957.594,959.737,"I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy, I don't see how--"
1998.97-1704,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,959.737,961.149,The insurance company pays the full limits of the policy.
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,969.815,976.49,"--Well, I can imagine a different kind of suit, the one that they would like to think this is, against the insurance companies in which one seeks--"
1998.97-1704,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,976.49,978.102,"No, I'm just testing the limits of (b)(1)(B)."
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,982.397,985.218,--But the insurance company isn't the defendant.
1998.97-1704,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,985.218,988.74,But in my hypothetical that's all the money there is.
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,988.74,991.493,And they're perhaps interpleaded?
1998.97-1704,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,991.493,992.724,Yes.
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,992.724,999.998,It still seems to me that making a (b)(1)(B) class out of is problematic.
1998.97-1704,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,999.998,1003.51,"Because there are individual tort rights that are in personam, not in rem?"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1003.51,1013.556,"That's right, and because of the Rules Enabling Act, which in effect says that you can't take one of these rules like (b)(1)(B) and use it to create a limit that was not independently there."
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1013.556,1017.26,"We wouldn't have to go that far for you to win, though--"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1017.26,1017.61,"No, that's right."
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1017.61,1018.201,"--I take it, in this case."
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1018.201,1018.692,That's right.
1998.97-1704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1024.263,1027.445,You pointed out that it's not against the insurance company.
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1040.54,1069.008,"--Well, under the 1994 amendments to the bankruptcy law which codified a preexisting practice, a trust would be set up, and its details would be negotiated, and that trust would be used to distribute over time the remaining proceeds, whatever they were, among all creditor classes, including the asbestos plaintiffs for whom the amendments were particularly designed, and--"
1998.97-1704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1069.008,1070.079,--Is that like the Johns-Manville--
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1070.079,1086.129,"--Very much like that, and in particular the national commission which looked at all of this concluded that the protection in that context for plaintiffs who have been exposed but not yet injured is greater than what they imagined would exist in class actions."
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1130.348,1131.169,--Why equitable?
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1155.855,1161.059,"--Well, for one thing it's not clear to me that you have to force them into bankruptcy."
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1161.059,1184.424,"Well, you're saying the only way that could happen is bankruptcy, but in fact, it wouldn't have to happen in bankruptcy if what we were going against was a trust, or what we were going against was a ship, and so why, if we can go against a ship and we can go against a trust and get this equitable result, why can't we go against this fund as long as it complies with the literal words of the rule?"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1184.424,1185.165,But it's not a fund.
1998.97-1704,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1216.077,1220.501,I agree with you that this is not your normal situation.
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1234.489,1265.722,"I think the fundamental principle that it violates is that the parties who are at the bargaining table ought not to be able, by mutual contrivance, to create a situation in which others who are not represented, some of whom are sick and others who will get sick, are simply told, fait accompli, because they weren't willing to put more money on the table you'll have to take a pro rata share as though you were a kind of equity stakeholder when the State law under which you claim gives you a legal right."
1998.97-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.722,1266.951,Mr. Tribe--
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1278.337,1278.588,Right.
1998.97-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.588,1285.353,"Whoever sues first and gets his judgment first gets his money, and someone who sues later doesn't get money, and you accept that that is unfair?"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1285.353,1285.904,No.
1998.97-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1290.649,1294.472,"It's the way we've always done things, and unless these rules allow us to do it differently I don't know that we can--"
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1294.472,1294.592,--Right.
1998.97-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.882,1297.566,--pronounce that that is unfair and can therefore be avoided.
1998.97-1704,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1297.566,1301.247,"--I think, though, without having some metatheory of fairness, one looks at the State law."
1998.97-1704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1311.345,1330.876,"But there's one part of it that you seem to agree can be done, and I believe that Justice Breyer wrote an opinion in Metro North sometime ago that said that people who are merely exposed do not have a claim under the FELA, and cited in support of that the common law of many States."

1998.97-1704,1,22509,elihu_inselbuch,,2410.864,2417.787,"Well, first of all, the issue in Mullane was not whether I have an interest in collecting a small amount from a common fund."
1998.97-1704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2423.113,2425.004,"Yes, and there had to be periodic accountings."

1998.97-1704,1,22509,elihu_inselbuch,,2452.361,2460.406,"Well, I was there and I think, as the record reflects, surely Fibreboard had an interest in getting the case resolved."

1998.97-1704,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3452.722,3457.485,So your argument basically is that you can't bring any of these classes period if there's one person who objects?
