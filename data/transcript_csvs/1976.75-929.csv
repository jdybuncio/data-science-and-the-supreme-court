1976.75-929,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.947,"We will hear arguments first this morning in no. 75-929, Estelle against Gamble."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,15.523,18.27,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please Court."
1976.75-929,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,141.42,153.902,"Your Brief I believe indicates that because of changes in creation of administrative procedures as kind of a problem will tend to go away in the future, is that so?"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,153.902,158.55,No Your Honor that is in respondent’s brief.
1976.75-929,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,170.618,179.998,You do not question or do you question his outline of the administrative procedures that have now been established to deal with these problems.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,179.998,200.082,"No, Your Honor I do not except for one instance, and that is that at the time when this complaint was filed in 1973 the grievance procedure which was subsequently written into the rules and regulations, in other words the appeal with the word and then to the director and director sending someone down from the staff to investigate the complaint."
1976.75-929,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,251.017,261.634,"If we decide that this Court should decide that administrative remedies have to be exhausted and utilized first, to what extent do you think that would solve this problem?"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,261.634,272.984,"As far as a flood of litigation in the Federal Courts is concerned, which the courts have experienced, the District Courts over the last five or six years I think it would help tremendously."
1976.75-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,332.778,342.219,Would that physician’s claim of privilege in this sort of action or defense be any different by virtue of that he was employed by the State of Texas?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,342.219,349.675,The only thing the Tort Claims Act does Mr. Justice Rehnquist is it establishes liability on the part of the state itself.
1976.75-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,356.58,368.107,But if the physician would be liable on the fact then that liability is assumed by the state assembly is not the federal Tort Claims Act?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,368.107,371.289,Yes Your Honor that is correct.
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,371.289,384.213,"Mr. Attorney General while you are interrupted, would you help me on the procedure here that complaint was filed as I read the record in February and the magistrate made a recommendation in June, and then the District Judge dismissed the complaint."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,390.491,397.765,"Mr. Justice Stevens, apparently the complaint was never sent by the District Court to our office."
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,406.211,410.128,"Well, what is the practice in this District in Texas?"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,423.708,433.247,Your Honor the practice in the Texas courts is to refer the cases to magistrate both the habeas corpus cases and the 1983 cases.
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,433.247,434.498,For what purposes?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,434.498,435.843,For screening.
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,435.843,441.411,And supposing they find no merit then do they deny lead to file or --
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,441.411,446.64,The magistrate would recommend either to deny relief to file or to grant relief to file.
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,487.903,492.078,But that is all done in advance of any service or notice to the defendants.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,492.078,495.725,I could not honestly answer that question across the board.
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,500.971,501.965,This is not a sport.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,504.892,508.101,"I am not sure Your Honor; I could really not answer that, I just know --"
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,508.101,514.859,The reason I raised that this practice has been followed in the Seventh Circuit was challenged at one time just wondering if it was challenged in that district.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,514.859,516.984,"No, it has not."
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,545.377,552.88,"Well, the magistrate seems to correspond it with the prisoner without corresponding with the defendants."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,562.347,568.318,My co-counsel just passed me a note and I am a little nervous this morning.
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,568.318,569.424,"Well, I am not being critical I am just trying to discover what happened."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,569.424,575.189,"I understand, but my mind is not working too clearly; hopefully it will be better as I go along."
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,585.774,587.371,This was the 1983 case.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,587.371,589.236,"This is a 1983 case, right."
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,619.536,620.423,I see.
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,620.423,624.524,You do not have to complain.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,624.524,628.132,I do not need to know whether we would serve with the complaint or not.
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,628.132,630.6,"Well, who you represent here?"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,630.6,633.39,"Mr. Justice Marshall I represent the petitioners, the director."
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,633.39,637.897,"Well, you do not have a complaint that the petitioner was not served; the petitioner was."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,637.897,638.585,That is correct.
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,648.906,656.117,Some procedure requiring the grant by a megistrate to leave to file a 1983 complaint?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,656.117,657.194,No Your Honor.
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,657.194,658.556,Alright.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,664.202,665.375,"Yes, Your Honor it was."
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,665.375,670.299,And it was that had to be served on these petitioners.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,670.299,671.15,That is correct.
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,671.15,679.464,"But what you are telling is whether or not your office gets to defend the petitions, depends on you are being requested to represent the defendants?"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,679.464,681.941,That is correct Your Honor.
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,681.941,684.17,You have never heard of this case until it was an appeal?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,684.17,684.85,That is correct.
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,684.85,689.506,Who represented the petitioners in the District Court?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,689.506,697.479,"Apparently, there was no need to represent the petitioners in the District Court, because unless the District Court summarily dismiss without requiring a response."
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,697.479,701.953,And that when the appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals you first heard of it?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,701.953,702.54,That is correct Your Honor.
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,702.54,708.409,And does your office always represent defendants in cases like this in the Court of Appeals at least?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,708.409,716.39,"Not necessarily, but as a practical matter most of the defendants will request our representation in the vast majority of cases."
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,723.247,728.158,Don't you think that that case deals with attorney that represent Mr. Estelle?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,730.965,733.98,Mr. Estelle is sued thousands of times.
1976.75-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,751.955,759.837,"Well, what you are suggesting is perhaps that other defendants then Estelle like the board of regions or other people who might be partied to 1983 --"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,759.837,760.13,That is correct.
1976.75-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,760.13,762.767,"-- under Texas Law, might have other counsel."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,762.767,770.031,"For example, the Highway Patrolmen frequently have private counsel."
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,770.031,774.628,"Mr. Attorney General, I do not mean to labor the point, but you assumed that Mr. Estelle was served."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,795.108,801.63,"It may explain it, I was really curious about it; I know our office never heard of the case until it was on appeal."
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,801.63,817.827,"And I am just wondering if they are following Rule 4 thereof automatically issuing summons or what they do, and it seems to me that at this -- as I read this case, it seems to me as a pleading case, and here we are arguing the substance and lot of facts and all and I was wondering why there was nothing at all filed by the state."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,823.4,832.228,"We did not know about the case, that is the reason, and it would not make any difference as far as substance is concerned whether the state were required to file a response or not."
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,838.174,846.528,"You would, but perhaps you would have filed a medical record, you might have had a different record before us and instead of just having prisoner allegation we do not know what you would have filed."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,846.528,846.838,That is true.
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,846.838,850.605,You might have investigated and find well there is something here.
1976.75-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.223,872.169,"But I take if the Court of Appeals just took it as if there had been a motion to dismiss file, all the allegations, the complaint were taken as true and they nonetheless held that that stated the claim for relief."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,872.169,875.074,That is correct.
1976.75-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,888.514,892.057,So you disagree with the result reached by the Court of Appeals on the law?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,892.057,914.408,"That is correct, and the Court of Appeals' opinion and also the respondent’s brief, it is very different for anyone arguing that there is a claim stated here to get away from the difference of opinion in a disagreement as far as diagnosis and treatment is concerned."
1976.75-929,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,956.449,957.78,Do you agree with that or not?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,957.78,959.229,I do agree with that.
1976.75-929,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,959.229,962.698,It has a total failure to provide any treatment in the prison.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,962.698,963.967,That is correct Your Honor.
1976.75-929,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,963.967,966.863,You think that would be a 1983 cause of action?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,966.863,968.532,I think that would state a claim.
1976.75-929,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,968.532,975.285,"But what do you understand the Court of Appeals to have said here, this negligent treatment is sufficient?"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,975.285,980.301,The Court of Appeals here came to the conclusion that there was a total failure to treat.
1976.75-929,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,990.445,993.547,"If that is the conclusion, you agree with it?"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,993.547,1003.336,"I would agree with the law that that is the law, but if the application of the law that the facts were correct, it is very difficult for me to understand --"
1976.75-929,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.336,1008.618,The states then withdraw the line between total failure and just an ordinary malpractice?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1008.618,1009.864,An ordinary malpractice.
1976.75-929,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.864,1010.843,Or negligence.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1010.843,1018.977,"Inadequate medical treatment without any exceptional circumstance like deliberate indifference, intentional neglect."
1976.75-929,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.493,1080.002,"Well, Mr. Attorney, what if these Fifth Circuit’s opinion said the rule in this Circuit is that you stated 1983 cause of action when there has been a total failure to treat, you do not state one when you allege only a negligent failure, and we construe this complaint to allege a total failure."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1083.453,1085.506,Yes Your Honor.
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1085.506,1099.666,"Mr. Pluymen, I hope at Page 31, the Court of Appeals apparently read this as reading general medical services afforded by the state in these prisons are publicly known to be woefully inadequate."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1099.666,1101.003,That is correct Mr. Justice.
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1101.003,1108.946,And that fall short of what you think would be the basis for a constitutional plan?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1108.946,1115.627,"Your Honor, in this class action lawsuit by a number of prisoners, which we have pending."
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1143.994,1149.211,"May I ask, what you are just telling is, is that in the complaint?"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1149.211,1159.436,"No Your Honor that was in the Appendix submitted by respondent, the Appendix, a brief submitted by respondent to the Fifth Circuit."
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1164.041,1166.912,That must be the one referred to I gather the footnote was --
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1166.912,1167.847,That is correct Your Honor.
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1167.847,1173.064,What is this Appendix Page 10 and 11?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1180.509,1181.394,That is correct Your Honor.
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1181.394,1187.611,"He says, he went to Dr. Ralph Gray, Medical Director of the Texas Department of Correction."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1187.611,1188.525,That is correct Your Honor.
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1188.525,1190.917,He says himself that he had medical treatment.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1190.917,1191.754,He does.
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1195.577,1196.713,That is in his complaint?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1196.713,1198.534,It is in his compliant.
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1244.089,1246.4,Is this a medical doctor?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1255.689,1263.571,"Dr. Gray I know the people who worked on the Prison Reform Committee, and they have all the respect in the world for Dr. Gray."
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1266.419,1268.549,And how about the prison (Voice Overlap)?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1268.549,1270.471,Dr. Astone?
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1270.471,1271.836,No Captain somebody.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1271.836,1273.051,Captain Blunt.
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1273.051,1274.627,You mean a doctor is a captain?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1274.627,1277.718,"No, sir, Captain Blunt would not be a doctor."
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1277.718,1283.102,"That is what I thought, because this captain is a guard."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1283.102,1289.52,"In general way, if we are going to talk about -- here is the reports and everything."
1976.75-929,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1315.255,1318.733,Actually that has been reported as the allegations of the complaint.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1318.733,1321.326,That is correct Your Honor.
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1321.326,1324.615,That was submitted to the Court of Appeals by way of an appendix.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1324.615,1325.622,"Your Honor, that is correct."
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1347.416,1351.233,The complaint says that he saw them on numerous occasions.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1360.553,1363.585,I understand.
1976.75-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1378.77,1392.936,The material submitted to the Court of Appeals by appendix there was a pleading is that Citizens Advisory Committee of report is not that -- not the sequence of treatment which is the sequence of treatment is in the complaint.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1392.936,1395.389,It is in the complaint.
1976.75-929,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1395.389,1412.678,"What you are saying I take it is that even if the medical care in Texas prisons generally is inadequate, that is only complaints filed here, there is no showing, no allegation of the Court can act upon."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1412.678,1415.229,"That is correct Your Honor, it is completely irrelevant."
1976.75-929,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1415.229,1427.613,"Well I thought also, it is your claim or as a legal matter that an allegation of inadequate care was insufficient to state a claim under the Federal Civil Rights Act."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1433.756,1435.983,"That is the point, Eighth Court of Civil Appeals has dealt with."
1976.75-929,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1435.983,1436.855,That is your position.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1436.855,1440.373,That is the position.
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1440.373,1449.29,Mr. Attorney General anyway did you and your respondent can get us a translation of that you agree on?
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1449.29,1454.085,I think we can probably have it typed up Your Honor verbatim.
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1454.085,1456.927,That you both agree is that what was served.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1456.927,1457.805,We can do that.
1976.75-929,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1457.805,1466.831,"I mean at least you have Page 3 or 7 of your petition, it really summarizes each allegation, does it?"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1466.831,1470.333,It is a summary and an interpretation.
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1470.333,1473.079,"Well, it is an interpretation and not just --"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1473.079,1475.446,It is not a verbatim transcript.
1976.75-929,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1486.378,1488.844,"So it reduces this the way we get it, doesn't it?"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1488.844,1492.196,That is correct Your Honor.
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1492.196,1495.212,Mr. General I ask one other question.
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.419,1533.922,"Do you think the standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the complaint should be the same or different when there has been no response, no motion, no nothing by the state?"
1976.75-929,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.582,1544.507,So you would disagree with the analysis by the Court of Appeals on that point as well as on the test what Section 1983 requires.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1544.507,1545.077,That is correct.
1976.75-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1554.764,1574.516,Certainly there is no hint in the Federal Rules as Civil Procedure that the standard is any different when the state has responded by way of a one line motion to dismiss or by some other pleadings when the question of sufficiency of a claim to state a claim is the complaint to state a claim is right.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1574.516,1575.532,No there is not Your Honor.
1976.75-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1584.661,1598.641,"Well, conceivably if the state answers, and then there is a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the plaintiff is entitled to rely on the state’s admissions and the answer is well as on the plaintiff’s complaint."
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1598.641,1602.768,That is true Your Honor.
1976.75-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.721,1623.649,"Is that what we usually take, our law firm take a consensus the Courts of Appeal?"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1623.649,1626.346,"I understand that Mr. Justice Rehnquist, no you do not."
1976.75-929,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1626.346,1631.996,"We have never even held a total absence of medical care raises the constitutional question, have we?"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1631.996,1633.185,"No, you have not Your Honor."
1976.75-929,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1666.832,1685.426,"Is not your position at the Court of Appeals applied the wrong standard of law in deciding whether there was a cause of action stated, because the court says that the treatment was inadequate?"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1685.426,1690.425,"And the court says it at one point, another point the court says it was a total refusal to treatment which --"
1976.75-929,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.425,1700.674,"There is a totally failed to provide adequate treatment, now that is an adequacy standard, isn't it?"
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1700.674,1702.772,That sounds like.
1976.75-929,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1702.772,1707.444,And that standard I think that you assert as wrong.
1976.75-929,0,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,1707.444,1718.812,"We have asserted that all the way through this case, we asserted in the brief and cite numerous cases in support of it."
1976.75-929,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1718.812,1719.913,Mr. Hedges.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,1719.913,1722.843,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-929,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1807.175,1812.217,(Inaudible) The allegation to the complaint is true.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,1828.951,1835.918,"He saw doctors Your Honor, but we would certainly say that we can argue that there was a refusal of medical care."
1976.75-929,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1894.615,1902.562,That is an assertion that the doctors refused to provide care that they knew should be provided.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,1902.562,1913.403,"I think if they are -- if it is clear to them that the care which they were providing was having no affect whatsoever than the logical conclusion would be that their diagnosis was wrong, but --"
1976.75-929,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1913.403,1915.927,"And it is actually a malpractice claim, isn't it?"
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,1919.9,1921.18,That was a 1983 case.
1976.75-929,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1921.18,1924.938,"Yes, but it boils down to as a malpractice claim, doesn't it?"
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,1924.938,1930.018,"It is very similar, and we do not need to rely on that in this case, and I hate to spend my time before the Court dealing with that."
1976.75-929,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1930.018,1941.278,But that is quite different from a claim of a total failure or refusal to give any medical care whatsoever to somebody in accidents.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,1941.278,1943.392,It is definitely different from the total absence of medical care.
1976.75-929,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1943.392,1949.158,"Okay, and the two claims are different not under Gray, but in kind, are they not?"
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,1949.158,1950.8,"Yes, they are."
1976.75-929,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1956.092,1962.642,"On the basis of the man’s own complaint he saw not one, but two doctors and saw them more than once."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,1962.642,1978.937,"I would like to call the Court’s attention to certain other allegations in the complaint, in which on certain occasions, overall on certain occasions, this individual suffered from the deliberate indifference of prison authorities to his medical need."
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2083.889,2094.516,"Mr. Hedges as I understand you that every time a prison guard denies a man a right to sick call, it is a 1983 action."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2094.516,2098.954,Not every time he does it Your Honor but I would urge upon the Court the standard stated in --
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2098.954,2100.58,Perhaps (Inaudible).
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2100.58,2102.342,You cannot put a number on it Your Honor.
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2102.342,2103.823,I did not think you could.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2103.823,2106.446,You cannot Your Honor but I would urge upon the Court standard --
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2106.446,2119.208,"Because I mean, the guy every morning says I would rather have sick call than go to work, he never would go to work or he would have 365, 1983 a year."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2119.208,2133.793,"Some of the prisoners apparently come pretty close to filing that many Your Honor, I realize and that is a problem, but the Second Circuit in the 1974 decision Bishop versus Stoneman examined the full accumulation of instance."
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2157.775,2160.039,"Well, do you think this complain shows there?"
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2160.039,2161.062,I do indeed Your Honor.
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2163.551,2171.85,"Well, I start over with a very great difficulty of a man that has a 600 pound bale for long that he cannot move."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2171.85,2175.044,That is very difficult to understand Your Honor.
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.044,2183.029,"Is it rather impossible, the man that has 600 pound weight for along with and to work four more hours before he gets a pay?"
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2183.029,2189.707,I think what happened with the pound that bale -- we were in such a difficulty here Your Honor; it is hard to tell just what happened.
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2196.947,2204.301,(Inaudible).
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2204.301,2206.572,It is very hard to understand.
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2207.805,2212.973,But once you have worked the lead --
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2212.973,2222.093,"If that is what he was trying to say it is hard to understand what he was trying to say Your Honor that a 600 pound bale fell on him, that would be hard to believe."
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2222.093,2224.207,(Inaudible) did not fail.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2224.207,2229.036,If indeed a 600 pound bale fell on him that would be hard to believe.
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2235.406,2242.73,(Inaudible).
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2242.73,2248.06,I think it is a question of what is he trying to say rather than do we believe him or do we not believe him.
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2435.974,2447.088,"As I read this Appendix, the magistrate ruled that it could not be filed, or these are not permitted to be filed --"
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2447.088,2450.489,It was filed and an immediate dismissal recommend Your Honor.
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2450.489,2456.791,"No, he says I permit it to be filed, isn't that what he said?"
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2456.791,2461.254,Permission to file in forma pauperis be granted.
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2464.862,2469.364,So he allowed it to be filed in forma pauperis.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2469.364,2471.284,"In forma pauperis, that is correct."
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2471.284,2473.461,"Well, that is not what I asked."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2476.057,2480.933,I do not know under any provision of which he could deny the permission to file it Your Honor.
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2480.933,2486.182,"Well, we get back to what we raised in Attorney General, was Mr. Estelle served?"
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2486.182,2493.32,There is no summons or vindication whatsoever of service in the record Your Honor therefore on the record we have to assume he was not.
1976.75-929,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2493.32,2500.743,"Well, how can you complain about the state not filing something while they did not know about it."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2500.743,2514.543,"The blame does not lie with the state there Your Honor, the blame lies with the District Court and the magistrate were not requiring that the state be served in (Inaudible) and wherever the blame was and the end result is that the District Court did dismiss a petition without any response and pleading Your Honor."
1976.75-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.141,2531.885,What you are arguing for then is the exception to the normal provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure where a defendant can simply come in and file a one sentence motion to dismiss and argue the sufficiency of the complaint.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2538.02,2538.579,He could do it.
1976.75-929,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2544.509,2553.597,"Well, but supposing he does not attach anything, the Rules of Civil Procedure do not require you attach anything in the way of the evidence to a motion to dismiss."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2559.818,2572.661,"I think for a Pro Se Petition and a 1983 action such as the one here, the courts should not dismiss these cases without at least looking at the medical records and requiring some response and pleading."
1976.75-929,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2675.352,2691.533,"Well, in all these cases, it would be essential in a case such as this for the Court to come to some judgment as to how gross or how deviant the performance, the medical personnel was."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2691.533,2694.384,"Whereas you might not have to in one case, Your Honor you might have it the --"
1976.75-929,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2694.384,2710.404,"But In this one you would have to look at the course of treatment, and come to some conclusion as to whether the doctors were indifferent or whether they were merely negligent or whether their treatment was adequate."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2710.404,2727.083,"Well, in this case Your Honor I would urge that the Court look at the actions of the non-medical prison personnel, nine separate instances, which I have set out in brief, in three of which I discussed with the Court just a minute ago and I think you will find that those completely aside from diagnosis and completely aside from treatment."
1976.75-929,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2727.083,2749.815,"Well, as I understand the suggestion that at least they stand it out to be deliberate indifference of the prison officials that when if ever do we get into the question of the adequacy of the medical treatment under your submission."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2749.815,2763.02,"Your Honor I think I discussed that somewhat in my colloquy with Mr. Justice Stewart a little while ago that you have the situation you likely did in Robinson versus Jordan if you are going to look at that, of course one of the initial quetions is are you going to look at it at all."
1976.75-929,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2763.02,2772.644,"Well, under your suggestion would -- looking at the adequacy of the medical treatment be required?"
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2772.644,2774.797,It would be one of the factors you would look at.
1976.75-929,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2777.734,2783.967,But the basic standard would be deliberate indifference of prison officials to the medical needs of the inmate.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2783.967,2819.378,"That is correct Your Honor, and the medical treatment would be or denial of medical treatment would be one aspect of this, and when you look at a deliberate indifference standard -- if you are talking, and you can establish deliberate indifference to the needs of all of the prisoners in the prison system, this of course is relevant to an allegation of deliberate indifference to the needs of one of the prisoners in the prison system, and the fact that at many times there is one doctor available to 17,000 prisoners is relevant to the care afforded or the interest and the needs in the situation of one of those --"
1976.75-929,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2819.378,2825.531,No matter how adequate his particular treatment of a particular inmate may be.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2825.531,2827.899,"I do not think, I think that would be going be going too far."
1976.75-929,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2830.663,2833.993,Would that be relevant only in a class action?
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2833.993,2859.223,"It would certainly be more relevant in the class action Your Honor, but it would not be totally irrelevant in the case such as this, and I would like to call the Court’s attention on this point that in their brief the Attorney General’s office does not allege if there was any real prejudice or that the outcome of decision by the Fifth Circuit was in anyway influenced substantially by their reference to this Appendix."
1976.75-929,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2877.055,2899.633,"Mr. Hedges, talking about the standard that you would have a supply, in your brief you state that allegations and mere negligence by prison medical personnel or disagreement as to the diagnosis do not constitute action of proclaims under the Civil Rights Act, have you changed your position on that?"
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2899.633,2900.396,"No, I have not Your Honor."
1976.75-929,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2903.645,2913.237,If this complaint alleged nearly negligence on the part of the doctors you would not be --
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2913.237,2916.97,"Well, I do not think I would be arguing this case in this fashion."
1976.75-929,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2931.555,2933.256,There is a Texas Tort Claims Act.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2933.256,2933.942,Yes sir it is right.
1976.75-929,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2933.942,2936.629,And it is available to inmates of countries.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2936.629,2940.793,Yes it is Your Honor and that would be the solution from your negligence.
1976.75-929,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2940.793,2946.699,You are relying on averments of negligence against nine medical personnel.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2946.699,2957.08,"More than mere negligence, but grows indifference to the needs that this individual, just an insistence on completely ignoring him on several occasions."
1976.75-929,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2957.08,2961.702,Do you argue that that rises to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2961.702,2968.224,"If there is a pattern of such conduct against such an individual, yes Your Honor that is exactly what we would argue."
1976.75-929,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2968.224,2971.743,Under the facts I have read in this complaint?
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2971.743,2978.059,"Yes, Your Honor, we argue that the delivered indifference against this individual does amount to Cruel and Unusual Punishment."
1976.75-929,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2978.059,2984.55,It is the only possible federal constitutional claim in these cases; there is no procedural due process claim.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2984.55,2985.972,"Yeah, there is not."
1976.75-929,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2985.972,2988.648,And there is no other possible procedural claim?
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2988.648,2989.487,There is not Your Honor.
1976.75-929,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2989.487,2990.378,The feel is there.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,2990.378,2992.2,There is not.
1976.75-929,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3170.752,3185.171,"Mr. Hedges Is it really fair that Judge Duhé (ph) has said that he applied the hands-off in prison matters approach, because I was on an impression, he was residing in some major piece of litigation involving a review, all the medical records within the Texas system."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,3185.171,3186.348,Doctrine Judge Duhé (ph).
1976.75-929,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3186.348,3188.182,Isn't that correct or am I misinformed?
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,3188.182,3198.408,"Your Honor we cannot tell from this case whether Judge Duhé (ph) really even reviewed the magistrate’s decision or not the Lawrence versus Wainwright case, which is the hands-off doctrine case as in the magistrate’s decision."
1976.75-929,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3207.191,3208.163,I see.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,3208.163,3209.682,"So that was the standard, which was not --"
1976.75-929,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3209.682,3214.264,"If I am correct in believing, he does have some major case pending or he decided something involving that."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,3214.264,3214.885,That is correct.
1976.75-929,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3218.797,3225.553,I see.
1976.75-929,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3225.553,3238.322,"Magistrate’s report states that he requested that then plaintiff to clarify, and particularize the allegations and depravations."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,3244.728,3248.996,It is not and must not have been a response Your Honor.
1976.75-929,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3260.201,3262.38,But I think we must assume that he did.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,3267.749,3271.245,"It is not in the record, which I received when I was appointed by the Fifth Circuit Your Honor."
1976.75-929,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3271.245,3274.484,I was also puzzled by the last comment you made.
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,3286.041,3291.643,"No, it is impossible to tell from the records Your Honor what degree of review there was."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,3300.813,3310.467,"We run the great danger of the courts abdicating their responsibilities to the magistrates, and letting the magistrates make these recommendations, I have no indication whatsoever if that occurred in this case."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,3314.936,3315.966,"Certainly not, Your Honor."
1976.75-929,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3315.966,3323.76,"Mr. Hedges one other question, there is the -- did docket entry make reference to a motion to vacate the District Judge’s order, I could not find that."
1976.75-929,1,21012,daniel_k_hedges,,3327.106,3331.636,"That simply requested that if he vacated, it is also Pro Se."
1976.75-929,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3331.636,3333.328,And no additional backed allegation?
1976.75-929,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3333.328,3338.956,"No, there were not."
1976.75-929,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3338.956,3344.5,Mr. Pluymen you have about three minutes left.
1976.75-929,2,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,3344.5,3355.949,"Your Honor, the apparent from our arguments today and more apparent from the two briefs that counsel and I had no disagreement, this is the law to be applied."
1976.75-929,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3541.978,3548.591,Perhaps the head counsel here is trying to agree with you that it is a correct reading.
1976.75-929,2,17946,bert_w_pluymen,,3548.591,3556.95,As far as the medical record is concerned should the Court call up the medical record in every case.
1976.75-929,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3601.677,3603.904,I think your time is up now counsel.
