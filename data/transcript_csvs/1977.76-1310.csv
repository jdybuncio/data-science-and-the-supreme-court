1977.76-1310,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.038,"We hear arguments next in number1310, Houchins against Station KQED."
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,41.752,45.408,"Thank you Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court."
1977.76-1310,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,94.372,97.099,Mr. Booty can I interrupt with one question?
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,111.577,113.407,Yes Your Honor.
1977.76-1310,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,371.985,381.875,What opportunity did members of the media have to become one of the 25 admitted on these tours?
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,381.875,390.321,"They had at the commencement of the tours Your Honor, better access than anyone else because the announcement of the tours was made through the media."
1977.76-1310,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,410.744,414.48,Basically the tours were organized on a first come first serve basis.
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,414.48,418.792,"Exactly, they were and are."
1977.76-1310,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,418.792,427.264,Did one of the briefs or the records state opinion that they were overbooked some weeks in advance?
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,427.264,447.199,"They became, the first six months of the tours became booked very quickly, quite possibly before the end of July, the first tour was on July 14, 1975 and probably before I do not remember, my recollection Your Honor is that before the end of July the tours had been booked."
1977.76-1310,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,447.199,465.345,And so if there were some occurrence in the jail that might have been of public interest there would be no way for representing it to the media to get into the jail unless he had been signed up several weeks in advance?
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,465.345,472.343,"That is correct, he could not have gone on one of tours, that of course is not the only means of access Your Honor."
1977.76-1310,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,491.971,495.377,You are still outlining access that was available.
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,495.377,497.297,To the public.
1977.76-1310,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,506.448,509.25,"It has an addition to these rights, the public additional rights."
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,509.25,512.809,Yes Your Honor that is what I am saying.
1977.76-1310,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.806,521.558,"In any event under the existing regime, the media has all these same rights that the public has of access."
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,521.558,523.414,Yes exactly.
1977.76-1310,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,523.414,527.422,Plus some additional ones that have been granted to it by the Sheriff's office.
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,527.422,528.89,That is right Your Honor.
1977.76-1310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,528.89,537.069,"Mr. Booty you have been outlining, what I gather are general rule, general policies of the Sheriff's office."
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,551.167,567.697,"Yes, it would, there is nothing in the record and in the case Your Honor to indicate any alternative means to these and as I say I am not finished, but this media or pardon me this access package taken as a whole is the entire package."
1977.76-1310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,736.414,747.04,"When you say the public right, are you talking about some term that has meaning in Constitutional law?"
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,747.04,748.082,"Yes, I think I am."
1977.76-1310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,751.417,754.344,Is the Sheriff of Alameda county an elected official?
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,754.344,756.372,"Yes Your Honor, he is."
1977.76-1310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,756.372,763.029,And I presume if the public in Alameda county thought they were not getting enough access they could vote against him in the next election?
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,763.029,764.648,No question about it.
1977.76-1310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,764.648,771.849,And what other right of access does the public have?
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,775.137,777.469,Well.
1977.76-1310,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,777.469,779.706,Under the Constitution of the United States.
1977.76-1310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,779.706,785.604,As interpreted by this Court.
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,785.604,790.33,Well it is not entirely clear.
1977.76-1310,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.077,842.615,Was not Pell really a decision that said whatever the public access is the media access need to be no greater.
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,842.615,847.549,"Indeed, that is exactly what the Court said."
1977.76-1310,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,864.904,873.688,But more specifically Mr. Booty you do not seriously contend that the whole problem could be solved by having zero access to public and press both?
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,873.688,874.173,Certainly not.
1977.76-1310,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,875.167,876.065,Why do not you?
1977.76-1310,0,33783,kelvin_h_booty_jr,,876.065,878.236,Well that is not --
1977.76-1310,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,878.236,881.404,It is a perfectly logical position to take.
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1427.348,1428.452,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-1310,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1428.452,1445.57,"What do you have to say about rights of an individual who walks in on the day when the press has a scheduled tour and says I have a camera, I am an amateur photographer and I want to go along."
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1450.54,1456.106,First of I would like to correct the state of the evidence.
1977.76-1310,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1497.262,1525.836,"Do you think it is a matter of prison or jail administration, the Director or Sheriff could say, it is more convenient to keep these two categories separate, that is we will have general public visitation on the first Monday in every months and we will have media representatives on the second Monday of every month."
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1525.836,1527.878,I think it is permissible.
1977.76-1310,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1527.878,1529.075,As an administrative matter.
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1529.075,1531.578,For an administrator of the jail or a prison to --
1977.76-1310,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1531.578,1540.061,Any constitutional question involved in that kind of a decision or is that just routine administration of the institution?
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1540.061,1559.267,A constitutional question arises when as in this case the Sheriff limits access by reporters either to zero as before this case was filed or to these antiseptic guided tours that he initiated right after we filed suit.
1977.76-1310,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1560.893,1571.344,"Well if he gives the media precisely and exactly the same access as the public, do you think there is any constitutional problem involved?"
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1571.344,1590.985,"I do, if that access is zero or if the access is not reasonably sufficient to prevent consummative conditions in the jail, then we would have a situation as they have in South Africa where the press is effectively precluded from reporting on jail and prison conditions."
1977.76-1310,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1590.985,1600.604,What part of the Constitution do you draw on to say that there is a right to access to take pictures and do these things?
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1600.604,1604.31,Well this is a First Amendment case.
1977.76-1310,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1635.943,1661.164,When you say unjustifiably interfering with acquisition of information for publication then it is a justiciable question in every case whether for instance the Supreme Court of United States excludes the press from its conferences or whether the Federal Aviation Administration excludes the press from its executive sessions?
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1661.164,1664.081,Well I do not about justiciable.
1977.76-1310,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1664.081,1666.331,Well it -- you are tested any way.
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1685.172,1687.19,"Yes, that is our position."
1977.76-1310,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1695.264,1698.931,But only because that is a justifiable decision on the part.
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1698.931,1699.517,Yes.
1977.76-1310,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1702.456,1719.428,"But in each case, you could go into the United States District Court of whatever district you want and under 1331 argue a constitutional question as to whether or not the decision of the particular agency was justifiable."
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1719.428,1728.334,"Theoretically yes, but in fact there are not any other agencies that we are aware of, that treats information the way the Sheriff does."
1977.76-1310,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1749.364,1760.735,Let us suppose the President decides to have Cabinet meetings open to the media with television and all the other instance.
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1766.418,1767.306,No of course not.
1977.76-1310,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1767.306,1772.278,Well then what significance is it that some other prisons in this area have different practice?
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1772.278,1776.526,Because it shows how unjustifiable the Sheriff's practice is.
1977.76-1310,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1777.419,1789.061,"Well if President opens the Cabinet meetings to TV, then how could United States Court of Appeals or Court of Claims have a justifiable reason for excluding them?"
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1789.061,1795.117,"Well I think, I do not know what the President's reasons might be for opening Cabinet meetings."
1977.76-1310,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1811.191,1817.487,Well then suppose the United States Courts of Appeals all decide to open their conferences to television.
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1826.943,1830.707,"I do not think that they would have to, no."
1977.76-1310,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1830.707,1834.385,Then what someone else does is really not very relevant.
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1835.557,1840.906,Well it is only relevant to show how unjustifiable this Sheriff's practice is.
1977.76-1310,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1869.005,1873.306,There was I presume access under the Sixth and the Fourteenth Amendment.
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1873.306,1876.902,Well an Attorney could go out and interview his client in the visiting room.
1977.76-1310,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1876.902,1878.069,At any reasonable time?
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1878.069,1894.586,"Yes of course and of course there was mail by prisoners to people on the outside at the time we filed suit the Sheriff's rule for the bad prisoners, from mentioning the name or action of any officer, that was changed immediately after we filed a suit."
1977.76-1310,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1914.874,1928.995,"Well at the time, at the time this suite was started could a member of the press interview a prisoner, during visiting hours if the prisoner was willing to be interviewed?"
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1928.995,1936.3,The practice as I understand it was that anybody could visit any prisoner.
1977.76-1310,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.3,1937.248,Including the press?
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1937.69,1939.483,If you happen to know one.
1977.76-1310,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.558,1951.033,Well how about recording the interview with a willing prisoner?
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1951.033,1952.971,No that would not have been permitted.
1977.76-1310,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.971,1954.585,Or a photograph?
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1955.364,1979.047,"That would not have been permitted unless reporters obtained the four consents mentioned by Counsel, the prisoner himself; that is certainly reasonable, his lawyer; that is certainly reasonable and the Sheriff required the consent of the District Attorney; for reasons unknown to us and unexplained and the Court having jurisdiction of the case."
1977.76-1310,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.422,1990.586,What was the rule?
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1991.863,1993.904,Same rule.
1977.76-1310,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1993.904,1995.802,On visitors on visiting.
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,1995.802,1998.899,"Same rule, that has not changed."
1977.76-1310,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1998.899,2001.655,"And the Court did not order, a change?"
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,2001.655,2004.455,No.
1977.76-1310,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2044.405,2076.275,"What would you say if the old fashioned system that existed at least a century ago of having Boards of visitation reported semi-annually or quarterly to the local governing body, were created and you had six citizens designated by the Mayor or by the Court or by someone who made these visits regularly and reported publicly."
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,2080.69,2084.331,"No it would not Mr. Chief Justice, it would be helpful."
1977.76-1310,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2097.164,2112.889,"I did not put any limit on it and indeed at times beginning with the colonial days these boards of visitors, visited such institutions, just the way bank examiners do today, unannounced."
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,2112.889,2128.669,"If they were charged with a gathering information about an event of public concern and were in a position to go out to the jail and investigate, find out what happen, report it to the public promptly that would serve the same purpose."
1977.76-1310,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2154.277,2156.461,How do you read them?
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,2156.461,2168.726,We think that the whole assumption of the Pell and Saxbe decisions is that there be reasonably sufficient access to prevent concealment of conditions.
1977.76-1310,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2174.65,2199.489,"Well you do claim I suppose you certainly could reasonably claim that even though the right of access of the communications media is no greater than that of general public that perhaps because of the technical needs of communications need media, if the equality needs to be provided in a different kind of way."
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,2240.589,2241.296,Yes.
1977.76-1310,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2241.296,2247.192,Just in order to preserve and provide the very equality to which the media is entitled.
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,2247.192,2250.211,Exactly.
1977.76-1310,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2309.968,2316.319,Well how far does you argument go?
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,2344.722,2346.001,That is right.
1977.76-1310,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2346.001,2360.482,It knows only through press officers at the White House and yet does that mean that for some reason or another the fact that the public is not admitted at all that the press then must be?
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,2360.482,2361.085,No.
1977.76-1310,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2361.085,2363.621,"Well, then what is your argument?"
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,2363.621,2365.016,"Well, we are not."
1977.76-1310,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2365.016,2378.577,"Let us assume in this particular county jail the public was not admitted at all, except in terms of the -- that is the general public members of the families were and lawyers were and doctors were."
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,2386.672,2387.279,Yes it is.
1977.76-1310,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2387.279,2389.113,I do not understand that.
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,2389.113,2392.399,"Well that was the situation before this case was filed, not only was the public --"
1977.76-1310,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2392.399,2404.232,"I am talking here not about policy or prudential considerations or wisdom or lack of it, we are taking about what is required by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, else this case should not be here."
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,2404.232,2404.887,That is right.
1977.76-1310,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2404.887,2414.249,And why then does the mere fact that the public does not have access in thereby confer a right upon the press to access.
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,2417.089,2423.329,If both press and public were wholly excluded as they were before this case was filed.
1977.76-1310,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2423.329,2432.187,"And as they are from many areas, of public life, of a governmental life, they are excluded from the war room over in the Pentagon and I assume."
1977.76-1310,1,46437,william_bennett_turner,,2432.187,2433.252,Indeed and should be.
