1991.90-408,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.176,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-408, County of Yakima v. Confederate Tribes and Bands of the Yakima Nation, and 90-577, vice versa."
1991.90-408,0,32810,jeffrey_c_sullivan,,44.077,47.279,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.724,201.045,"Mr. Sullivan, on land within a reservation, where a fee title is held by an Indian member of the tribe, but it was patented and the title was issued; and if that land is later transferred, does State law govern what it takes to make a transfer and pass title?"
1991.90-408,0,32810,jeffrey_c_sullivan,,201.045,201.662,Yes.
1991.90-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.662,211.885,"And what about if the owner were to die without leaving a will, what law would govern the passage of that land?"
1991.90-408,0,32810,jeffrey_c_sullivan,,211.885,217.02,I believe that the... if the... if it's a tribal member--
1991.90-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.02,218.436,If the owner is a tribal member.
1991.90-408,0,32810,jeffrey_c_sullivan,,218.436,223.09,--I believe that the fee lands would pass under the provisions of State law.
1991.90-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,230.244,233.446,"Have there been cases involving that, to your knowledge?"
1991.90-408,0,32810,jeffrey_c_sullivan,,233.446,239.7,"--I don't believe it ever has been raised, or any case in which it has been a problem, Your Honor."
1991.90-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,239.7,243.235,Thank you.
1991.90-408,0,32810,jeffrey_c_sullivan,,243.235,248.104,"In 1906, this Court was called about in Goudy v. Meath to address this issue."
1991.90-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,353.537,358.223,"Mr. Sullivan, excuse me for interrupting you again."
1991.90-408,0,32810,jeffrey_c_sullivan,,374.85,375.766,--We don't know that.
1991.90-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,384.955,389.657,"Well, were the patents issued during the trust period or after the trust period?"
1991.90-408,0,32810,jeffrey_c_sullivan,,392.173,393.478,The record does not tell us that.
1991.90-408,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.382,411.94,"Well, it might make a difference if the statute only applies to lands patented during the trust period, or to lands patented at the expiration of the trust period."
1991.90-408,0,32810,jeffrey_c_sullivan,,415.975,422.045,We believe... I would... I can't disagree that that could be a reading given to the proviso.
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1534.236,1538.806,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1595.659,1601.98,I think he said that we really don't have to decide that in order to decide this case.
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1601.98,1604.765,"That's true, but it's--"
1991.90-408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1604.765,1606.115,And relieved at but.
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1616.49,1624.476,"--Well, on the Yakima Reservation, tribal law and State law is concurrent."
1991.90-408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1644.307,1652.413,Has the tribe restricted the transferability of lands owned in fee by tribal members?
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1652.413,1657.365,"No, that's not part of the tribal law and order code."
1991.90-408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1674.708,1677.91,"In Washington, are stamps required on a deed when it's recorded?"
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1677.91,1680.461,They used to be but they're not now.
1991.90-408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1685.765,1691.586,Are the deeds routinely recorded in the office of the Yakima County Recorder?
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1691.586,1695.038,"Yes, deeds are recorded."
1991.90-408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1695.038,1698.156,And I take it that the State recording statutes apply?
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1701.025,1709.012,"No, there's no conflict between tribal law and State law with regard to recording requirements."
1991.90-408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1709.012,1712.064,"Well, it's one thing to say no conflict."
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1733.663,1741.0,"Well, that question hasn't come up."
1991.90-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1849.038,1864.464,"Well, if... if the... if the act of Congress... if we were to find an act of Congress that authorized the imposition of these real property taxes, and it was after the treaty, then if your... your construction of the treaty would be abrogated to that effect, would it not?"
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1864.464,1864.964,--Well--
1991.90-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1864.964,1867.38,A treaty doesn't govern over a later statute.
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1867.38,1876.336,"--In order to abrogate the treaty, it is my understanding of this Court's decisions on that, the abrogation has to be clear and specific."
1991.90-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.412,1898.435,"Do you agree that if it did provide unambiguously for State taxation, the treaty would be abrogated?"
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1900.637,1904.172,"No, I agree that that's the status of the law."
1991.90-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.611,1924.918,"Well, how much clearer can you be than to say that... that under certain circumstances the... any restrictions on the taxation of land shall expire?"
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1924.918,1931.006,"Well, I believe that that's not clear."
1991.90-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1933.191,1934.091,"Well, how would you make it clearer?"
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1934.091,1937.393,"--Well, I would make it clearer by saying, and--"
1991.90-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.393,1939.845,"I would just say it again, and I really mean it?"
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1939.928,1944.88,"--No, when the fee patent is issued, this land shall be subject to State taxation."
1991.90-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.165,1947.782,"Well, shall be removed."
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1953.569,1963.007,But that statute was passed... or the proviso was passed in 1906 at the height of the assimilation and allotment era.
1991.90-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1965.543,1967.495,"Well, I know, but now you're getting into something else."
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,1976.101,1990.944,"--If Moe... to me, Moe is the logical extension of McClanahan, Mescalero, the Kansas Indians, Bryan v. Itasca County... all those cases that I've mentioned would support the position that we bring to this Court today."
1991.90-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1999.05,2013.457,"--Well, you think the... you think the... the later statutes really repeal the General Allotment Act, and for all intents and purposes... or this part of... at least this part of section 349?"
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2013.457,2014.559,--Well--
1991.90-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.559,2015.859,Did it or didn't it?
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2015.859,2017.344,--I don't use the word repeal.
1991.90-408,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.129,2027.95,"Well, you can't have two statutes existing... regulating the same subject in a contradictory way."
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2035.722,2044.827,"Well, what the Court... what this Court has done, particularly in Moe, is looked to the policies behind the allotment and assimilation legislation."
1991.90-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2050.629,2064.389,"But ordinarily... ordinarily, simply a change of direction on the part of Congress, so that Congress is doing things differently in the are of Indian relations now than it did earlier doesn't repeal an express statute."
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2064.389,2074.828,"Well, this is the enactment of the Indian Reorganization Act and legislation thereafter wasn't a change in direction."
1991.90-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2082.398,2085.684,"Well, what about the rule against implied repeals?"
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2095.907,2099.959,"--No, I can't."
1991.90-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2099.959,2103.328,"Well, doesn't the rule against implied repeals govern?"
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2103.328,2105.347,"No, ah--"
1991.90-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2105.347,2106.047,Why not?
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2106.047,2132.915,"--Because I can't point to anything in the Indian Reorganization Act that says directly repeals or contradicts the main provision of 25 U.S.C. 349 which provides that on the issuance of a patent in fee, the allottee shall be subject to the general criminal and civil jurisdiction in the State in which that allottee resides."
1991.90-408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2146.219,2157.293,Is it necessarily inconsistent to say that both the Indian tribe could tax the land as well as the State and county?
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2166.632,2178.19,"No, the tribe would have authority to impose its taxes on fee lands."
1991.90-408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2185.712,2196.502,"Well, and even if the tribe did choose to tax, it wouldn't be... it wouldn't mean that there couldn't be another taxing jurisdiction that also had that power."
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2196.502,2215.065,"Except this Court has said, to give States taxing jurisdiction over Indian tribes and their people require... requires a clear and unambiguous intent on Congress' part to effect... effectfully--"
1991.90-408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2215.065,2222.052,"Well, I guess this Court in that early Goudy case thought it was clear enough."
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2222.052,2224.837,"--Well, what Goudy held--"
1991.90-408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2224.837,2226.456,Section 349.
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2226.456,2227.906,--That's true.
1991.90-408,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2245.667,2251.821,It said that by virtue of the language to that effect in section 349.
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2251.821,2253.921,That's right.
1991.90-408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2270.997,2279.953,"Moe never explicitly distinguished between fee lands and other lands, did it?"
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2279.953,2283.487,"Yes, it did, in my opinion."
1991.90-408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2283.487,2283.756,"Well, correct me if I'm wrong."
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2286.625,2287.808,The--
1991.90-408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2287.808,2291.993,The issue was... in Moe was the general policy... general powers to tax.
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2291.993,2304.42,"--But the opinion in Moe provides that even on fee lands, the general taxing authority for personal property taxes in the State of Montana does not exist."
1991.90-408,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2304.42,2306.503,"Well, as to personal property tax."
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2313.323,2314.057,"No, it did not address that in Moe."
1991.90-408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.109,2411.369,"But in Moe, if we had found the personal property... a personal property tax could... should... could be imposed, we would have had to find that the entirety of the State... of the State's law would also apply."
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2461.327,2479.038,"Well, it's significant because why should one Yakima member have to pay taxes to a jurisdiction that he pays no other taxes to, on one parcel of land, while the other Yakima member not have to pay taxes?"
1991.90-408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2479.038,2480.173,"Well, cause the statute says so."
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2503.718,2507.853,"Well, that's true, but that same distinction could have been made in Moe."
1991.90-408,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2507.853,2509.705,"No, I don't think so."
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2526.297,2531.665,"Well, I would argue that the proviso wasn't intended to be that dramatic."
1991.90-408,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2605.063,2606.682,Can I ask you one question before you sit down?
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2606.682,2607.048,Sure.
1991.90-408,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.048,2611.55,At the beginning you said you were relying on the provisions of the treaty with the Yakima Nation.
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2617.388,2619.804,"Well, the... my brief--"
1991.90-408,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2619.804,2621.006,Quotes from the--
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2621.006,2621.64,--quotes those provisions.
1991.90-408,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2648.991,2649.674,--That's what I thought you said.
1991.90-408,1,38868,robert_wayne_bjur,,2654.242,2661.062,"Well, the General Allotment Act was the beginning of an effort to abrogate that."
1991.90-408,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2679.503,2683.289,"Thank you, Mr. Bjur."
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2684.991,2698.299,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-408,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2749.099,2750.983,But not real property.
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2750.983,2751.783,--but not real property.
1991.90-408,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2758.937,2763.889,"Well, when did the Solicitor General or the Justice Department adopt that view of Moe?"
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2763.889,2778.815,"Insofar as the Solicitor General's Office is concerned, the first time I'm aware that we looked at it is the first time that we were asked to look at it, which was in connection with filing the court of... an amicus brief in the court of appeals in this case."
1991.90-408,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2778.815,2783.851,So the Government is... the Government has maintained the same position since it first addressed--
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2783.851,2798.293,"There was... there was a... an opinion by the Solicitor of the Interior Department which has since been repudiated... I think it's the use of the word solicitor, that it wasn't clear... it was an opinion of the Solicitor of the Interior Department in 1979 that did not give that construction to Moe with respect to real property taxes."
1991.90-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2954.876,2957.578,--Do you think Moe really just overruled Goudy?
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2957.578,2962.632,"It did not... it did not, because, again, let me... because of the distinction I was drawing."
1991.90-408,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.312,3065.745,But it doesn't say that.
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3073.865,3084.457,"--But a rule of preemption, under this Court's cases derived from statutes and treaties is not commonly... the word restrictions is not commonly used to describe that."
1991.90-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3084.457,3104.536,"Well, it... it seems very strange to say that the section 349 said all these restrictions would be removed and the States may tax land, but you say they can't because there's another restriction that hasn't been removed... preemption."
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3104.536,3107.572,But that's exactly the rationale the Court adopted in Moe.
1991.90-408,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3109.422,3112.357,"Well, I certainly... I wrote Moe, and I certainly don't agree with--"
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3114.107,3118.475,--No... what the... not with respect to separate tax immunities as such.
1991.90-408,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3137.77,3138.72,"Well, they certainly did--"
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3145.457,3147.29,"--No, it's not... with all respect, Justice White, it's not."
1991.90-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3167.585,3171.155,So you're really saying there later arose a preemption policy--
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3171.155,3171.488,--Right--
1991.90-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3171.488,3175.107,--which intervened.
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3175.107,3180.261,"--Precisely, Justice White, and was not... it was the reinstatement of the prior regime, prior to the General Allotment Act."
1991.90-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3196.521,3209.613,"Well, let's just assume there was a time between the General Allotment Act and preemption, where there wasn't any preemption."
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3209.613,3211.279,That's correct; there was.
1991.90-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3211.279,3218.469,"All right, and... in that period of time, States were permitted to tax by virtue of the General Allotment Act."
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3218.469,3223.087,"Right... and even after the IRA, with respect to lands outside of reservations."
1991.90-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3223.087,3224.003,"Yes, yes, yes."
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3224.003,3225.687,They may continue to do so.
1991.90-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3226.205,3240.43,"So what you're saying is that this preemption policy, wherever it came from, in effect overturned the State's authority to tax pursuant to section 6."
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3240.43,3241.93,"--Exactly, which is what the Court held in Moe."
1991.90-408,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3243.965,3244.815,Well that... so you don't say that repealed it.
1991.90-408,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3244.815,3245.832,"--No, it did not repeal it."

1991.90-408,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3272.599,3275.015,"Mr. Sullivan, do you have rebuttal?"
1991.90-408,3,32810,jeffrey_c_sullivan,,3276.484,3280.836,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-408,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3366.025,3368.791,When was Public Law 280 passed?
1991.90-408,3,32810,jeffrey_c_sullivan,,3368.791,3371.929,It was passed in 1953.
1991.90-408,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3446.588,3460.098,"Do you agree with the Government when it says... when they say that you do agree with the preemption submission in the sense that you can't tax unless Congress says so, specifically?"
1991.90-408,3,32810,jeffrey_c_sullivan,,3460.098,3461.765,"--Yes, we agree."
1991.90-408,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3461.765,3466.602,"When did that... has that always been the rule, forever and ever?"

1991.90-408,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3469.454,3478.476,"The Government says that after the General Allotment Act, some preemption principle suddenly arose."
1991.90-408,3,32810,jeffrey_c_sullivan,,3479.678,3499.556,"--Well, through this Court's rulings, by saying that, in fact, the general... I think it was clear to the Congress in 1906, myself, that they were going to be subject to all taxes, and that the Court has since... since that time, an attempt to balance and interpret the way Congress has gone back and forth in what we are left with on our reservation."
1991.90-408,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3508.329,3511.78,When was that the... when was that... when did this Court first say that?
1991.90-408,3,32810,jeffrey_c_sullivan,,3511.78,3516.351,--I believe in McClanahan.
