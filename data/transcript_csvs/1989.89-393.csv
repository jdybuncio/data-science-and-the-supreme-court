1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We'll hear argument now on No. 89-393, Harry P. Begier v. Internal Revenue Service."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,11.056,11.808,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,166.891,171.462,"All the payments you've described, Mr. Winterhalter, were within the preferential period?"
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,171.462,172.978,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.952,238.587,What particular funds was the court of appeals talking about?
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,238.587,240.356,"Your Honor, I'm not certain I understand your question."
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,249.812,252.414,Simply money drawn on its general operating account?
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,252.414,253.03,That is correct.
1989.89-393,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,277.481,280.516,"Well, what about the language of the statute?"
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,280.516,283.385,My second point would be that the clear language of the statute--
1989.89-393,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,283.385,285.568,"Well, you had better start with that, hadn't you?"
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,287.837,298.228,"--I would believe, Your Honor, that the clear language... the plain wording of the statute expressly requires that for this trust to be created the taxes must be withheld or collected."
1989.89-393,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,303.613,314.42,"Well, what does it... doesn't the... doesn't the law say that these withheld taxes are to be held as a trust fund?"
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,314.42,315.52,"Yes, it does."
1989.89-393,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,318.456,318.991,Yes.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,318.991,320.041,--provides that--
1989.89-393,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,320.041,321.191,Yes.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,321.191,328.68,"--Justice White, provides that any taxes which are collected and withheld shall be held in trust."
1989.89-393,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,344.79,347.809,"Well, it doesn't really say that, does it?"
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,360.801,361.168,--That--
1989.89-393,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,361.168,372.443,It... it provides automatically by statute that whatever amount is withheld for these taxes is automatically in trust for the government.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,373.476,376.395,"--The statute says expressly that, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-393,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,377.311,384.101,So why does it have to be segregated to comply with the statute?
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,384.101,391.92,"--I would represent to the Court, as has this Court on other occasions, that there must be a trust raised for a trust to be established."
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,404.58,407.28,You're... you're not now saying that it has to be segregated.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,422.709,423.959,That is exactly correct.
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,423.959,426.511,"Now, that would be different for a sales tax, I suppose."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,436.449,437.301,That is exactly correct.
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.301,443.639,But with the withholding of... of wages there's--
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,443.639,444.172,The property is--
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.172,445.039,--there's nothing to identify.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,445.039,445.589,--That is correct.
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,445.589,446.757,You just paid him... paid him 80.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,457.28,458.299,"Yes, there is money."
1989.89-393,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,459.615,468.821,"Well, whatever the law says... that... that amount is going be held in trust, and the money was there to be held in trust."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,468.821,469.69,--Not necessarily so.
1989.89-393,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,469.69,471.023,"Well, it was paid."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,471.023,472.408,"Yes, it was paid."
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,472.408,481.497,"Mr. Winterhalter, let's go back to that second clause of 7501 that Justice O'Connor referred to."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,504.361,505.863,"Yes, it can."
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,506.296,509.732,You... don't you think that's... might be what it intended here?
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,509.732,511.434,"--No, I do not believe it did."
1989.89-393,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,532.097,547.19,"Well, suppose what the company did in this case with respect to monies that was paid from the general account, drew one check to the general account and then immediately... pardon me... drew one check from the general check to the special account--"
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,547.19,547.857,Yes.
1989.89-393,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,547.857,550.225,--then a second check special account to the government.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,551.175,552.011,Absolutely.
1989.89-393,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,554.543,558.83,And... and you couldn't set it aside as a preference that putting it in the trust was a preference?
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,561.116,566.568,"Well, I think in the situation which you have raised in your hypothetical, there is the... there is the designation."
1989.89-393,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,576.726,580.428,But it's not... it's not a preference to create a trust res?
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,580.428,580.961,"--No, I do not--"
1989.89-393,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,580.961,584.732,But it... but it... but it is... but it is a preference to directly to pay the IRS?
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,584.732,585.582,--Let me correct that statement.
1989.89-393,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,585.582,586.232,That... that doesn't make sense.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,586.232,589.867,I believe that it would be a preference to create a trust res for any party.
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,603.359,616.084,"Mr.... Mr. Winterhalter, it... it seems to me... I don't... I don't understand why you say... why you say that there has to be a res in order for a trust to be created."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,654.842,661.398,"My point is, Justice Scalia, that there must be some act, some separation."
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.195,689.132,"It could be created in the abstract, but you can't give it effect in the abstract."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,693.869,696.336,--I don't believe I disagree with that.
1989.89-393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.336,697.405,But when must it be created?
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,718.318,721.103,If they held the 200 in their general operating account?
1989.89-393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,721.103,721.703,Yes.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,721.703,723.972,And then paid it directly to the government?
1989.89-393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,723.972,726.924,"Yeah, a week later, but still within the preference period."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,726.924,735.796,"Presuming that the other elements of a preference have been satisfied, I would believe that that... I would believe that that would be a preference."
1989.89-393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,752.556,755.408,Other than the fact that they did use the money to pay the government?
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,756.61,758.126,That is... that is correct.
1989.89-393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,758.126,765.466,"Well, what do they... they have to put it... you're... they have to put in a separate account before the... in... in... before the preference period begins."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,765.466,771.703,I'm... I'm not saying to create the segregation itself or to create the designation it has to be placed in a separate account.
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.126,820.766,"Well, what if the statute... this clause we've been talking about... said any paid amount of tax so collected or withheld shall become the property of the United States?"
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,820.766,825.17,I... I still don't believe you have reached that threshold of identifying the trust res.
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,829.122,834.86,But this statute would not have... the statute I'm talking about says nothing about a trust.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,841.514,853.572,"--If there has been no withholding, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not believe that the trust... well, you're... instead of putting the property in trust, you're creating a statute which would in effect transfer title to the property directly to the government--"
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,853.572,854.024,Yes.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,854.024,859.392,--upon the operation of the statute.
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,870.549,879.555,"Well, I... I have the feeling that the statute Congress did enact is not far different from--"
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,879.555,883.107,I would respectfully disagree with Your Honor.
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.107,884.459,--I'm sure you do.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,915.312,920.816,I believe that Hornbook trust law would... would look to the intent to the trustee in that situation.
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.816,921.216,"Well, that's right."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,922.584,923.084,Yes.
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.084,924.618,I don't have to do it at the moment that it's created.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,924.618,925.036,Yes.
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.503,933.976,"Now why isn't it... and it's also Hornbook trust law, as I understand it, that you can declare in trust a portion of a fungible account."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,939.178,939.88,"Yes, you can."
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.88,940.713,Okay.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,959.691,967.78,You would be talking... I... my... my response to that would be it would not be a trust because you would be transferring title to the funds to the government on that time.
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.78,968.896,I'm not using it as check.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,984.306,986.075,What in effect as--
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,986.075,987.142,As opposed to my real estate.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1006.155,1021.331,"--Mr. Justice Scalia, I would present to you that the trust which is required to be created in order for 7501 to be attached... to attach, this trust to be created, must relate to the funds collected from employees' wages."
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1041.411,1050.517,There is no... there's no... how do you identify... look the statute applies not only to... to funds collected but also to funds withheld.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1064.292,1065.027,But this is--
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1065.027,1071.431,"So, you have to rely on my declaration of a fund later, it seems to me."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1071.431,1074.133,--I would respectfully disagree.
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1074.133,1075.116,That's for a sales tax.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1087.307,1096.563,"The trust language, Mr. Justice Scalia, under 7501 does not suggest that the trust attaches to monies collected and which should have been collected."
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1100.098,1100.831,Or withheld.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1100.831,1102.198,--or withheld.
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1102.198,1103.633,xxx the problem?
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1103.633,1117.025,"But if we fund only net payroll, if the employer pays only net payroll while the... the employee takes the advantage of the tax credit, the employer does not pay it."
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1120.861,1127.748,"Well, he withholds by the act of paying the employee only the net, I would think."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1129.784,1130.867,Yes.
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1132.236,1146.127,"So, he is with... if I... if I hire you for $100 a week and your gross is $100 and your net is $80, when I pay you $80, I have by definition withheld $20, even though I don't have the $20."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1146.127,1146.996,That's correct.
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1152.298,1158.102,"Well, if you're looking for something that meets all the requirements of Bogurt on trusts, I agree that it can't."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1174.979,1182.585,Because there's been no connection between the funds withheld from the employees and the trust funds paid to the government.
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.585,1183.669,There doesn't have to be a connection.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1183.669,1184.635,I believe that there does.
1989.89-393,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.635,1186.371,The res was created later.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1196.06,1202.998,I would represent to Your Honor that if there is the designation... if you... if you go through the steps to establish the existence of a trust res--
1989.89-393,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1202.998,1206.784,But... but why isn't the payment to the government the designation?
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1206.784,1207.384,--Because--
1989.89-393,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1207.384,1211.688,Why... why is doing something directly less of a designation than doing it indirectly?
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1211.688,1215.556,--Because in the payment to the government you are transferring title to the property.
1989.89-393,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1247.527,1257.717,"Well, the Congress set up a scheme whereby avoidance could be had for items that were property of the debtor."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1267.489,1269.441,I would respectfully disagree.
1989.89-393,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1269.441,1271.643,"Well, that's the statutory scheme."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1271.643,1278.464,But there is no nexus between the funds collected and the monies paid to the government.
1989.89-393,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1287.502,1289.438,"Well, there is no tracing problem here."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1297.358,1299.394,At that time they transfer title.
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1411.148,1413.767,This is the Bankruptcy Code you're referring to?
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1413.767,1414.685,That is correct.
1989.89-393,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1550.474,1558.644,"Of course, Congress could have rejected that because it would have extended to state and local government units, too, the way you have expressed it, couldn't it?"
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1558.644,1559.829,That is correct.
1989.89-393,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.445,1587.647,"Only as to the extent of trust funds, though."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1591.635,1591.985,Yes.
1989.89-393,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1626.289,1634.443,"Well, on that basis it wouldn't do you any good to segregate these funds that you've withheld."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1634.443,1637.895,Under the Section 507 or 523 analysis?
1989.89-393,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.895,1646.017,"Well, I thought you said a while ago if you actually segregated these withheld funds, they would not become property of the estate."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1646.017,1646.684,That is correct.
1989.89-393,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1646.684,1648.535,And there could be no avoidance.
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1648.535,1649.135,That is correct.
1989.89-393,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1649.135,1662.812,"Well, but the argument you've just made from that other provision of the law on the preference I would think it would... I would think that would cover the withheld funds that are segregated also."
1989.89-393,0,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,1662.812,1670.032,"Mr. Justice White, under those sections they clearly had contemplated taxes which should have been collected and which were not collected."
1989.89-393,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1700.92,1702.47,"Very well, Mr. Winterhalter."
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1705.372,1708.324,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-393,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1782.456,1783.556,May I... may I interrupt you right there?
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1783.556,1784.073,--Yes.
1989.89-393,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1784.073,1787.324,Those forms proved that that's the amount that should have been--
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1787.324,1787.741,No.
1989.89-393,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1787.741,1788.209,--set aside?
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1788.209,1788.593,No.
1989.89-393,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1792.145,1793.511,But where were they withheld?
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1797.382,1799.165,--There were no funds placed in a bank account.
1989.89-393,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1801.167,1804.803,"I know, but when you have a... when you file a form that says gross wages X--"
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1804.803,1805.153,Uh-huh.
1989.89-393,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1805.153,1811.273,"--and net wages X minus the tax, that isn't proof that the amount withheld was actually withheld."
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1815.844,1820.046,"The filing a piece of paper their identifying it court as genuine, and the document says--"
1989.89-393,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1820.046,1820.581,It's genuine.
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1820.581,1822.231,--And it says... it says we did it.
1989.89-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.668,1828.284,"Well, withhold means simply not paid."
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1828.284,1828.819,Exactly.
1989.89-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1828.819,1829.77,"Well, okay."
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1833.405,1834.238,Not at all.
1989.89-393,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1834.238,1835.757,--just that they did not paid that amount.
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1835.757,1836.224,Not at all.
1989.89-393,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.732,1849.165,"Oh, I see."
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1849.165,1852.2,"But when there is a withholding, that's my simple point."
1989.89-393,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1852.2,1853.233,xxx.
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1853.233,1853.633,Right.
1989.89-393,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1853.633,1855.569,I still don't... maybe I'm stupid.
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1880.267,1881.969,There has been a withholding in that case.
1989.89-393,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1882.552,1883.585,What has been withheld?
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1883.585,1891.175,"--Well, they've have had to pay less... they've have had to pay less than they would have paid... they had to reduce... they cannot pay gross wages."
1989.89-393,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1914.773,1917.408,But there is no asset representing the amount withheld?
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1917.408,1918.008,"Well, that's right."
1989.89-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.45,1930.733,You just mean not paid.
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1930.733,1931.985,Not paid is all I mean.
1989.89-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.985,1936.12,All right.
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1944.21,1945.293,That's basically right.
1989.89-393,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.848,1964.956,"You're... you're not suggesting that in the strict sense of trust law, the filing of a withholding... a return showing tax withheld creates any sort of a res, are you?"
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1964.956,1965.306,--No.
1989.89-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1984.568,1988.655,"Mr. Martin, I'm... I'm willing to concede that you can create a trust by law."
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,1990.272,1990.705,Right.
1989.89-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.705,1993.457,"But you... you know, you can't make black white by law."
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2005.081,2005.866,Uh-huh.
1989.89-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.866,2008.483,And you can't decree the existence of a corpus by law.
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2008.483,2009.385,I agree.
1989.89-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.385,2016.056,"So, we... we... we have to find some corpus to identify for the legal consequences that you want to attach."
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2016.056,2016.656,I agree.
1989.89-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2016.656,2021.043,"Now, at... until the check was written at least, that corpus could have been anything."
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2030.149,2030.999,And with that--
1989.89-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2030.999,2032.783,But you... you would apply it even before the check was written.
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2038.504,2038.937,--Yes.
1989.89-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.043,2049.443,"Wow, boy, that--"
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2051.395,2053.931,But you don't have to decide that... fortunately.
1989.89-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.476,2081.664,"I... I assume that what you assert the Federal Government can do by using the device of trust law, you are willing to acknowledge that state governments can do as well."
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2081.664,2082.449,Absolutely.
1989.89-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2082.449,2093.656,"So, a state government could say, henceforward, any taxes owed to the state shall be a trust and they would... they... they would acquire a preference under bankruptcy law."
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2097.108,2100.162,"If... if they have a parallel system, sure."
1989.89-393,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2218.572,2222.191,What other purpose is 7501 used for?
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2247.924,2250.96,"Well, that's... that's not what Congress was doing in '34."
1989.89-393,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2279.877,2281.895,There was no withholding in 1934.
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2283.764,2291.351,"Yeah, in '34... it dealt with the excise taxes only and said that... that money was held in trust."
1989.89-393,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2344.386,2362.697,"Mr. Martin, in... in the case of the special fund that is created that is a separate earmarked bank account, if the employer coming upon hard times decides to change his mind or its mind and takes the money back, is... is there some kind of criminal liability?"
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2362.697,2363.916,Yes.
1989.89-393,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2385.797,2400.639,"And... but that... but that special liability, that special criminal liability doesn't apply if there is simply a failure to earmark funds that are in the general account and those funds would then disappear or what?"
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2400.639,2401.591,It could apply for willful--
1989.89-393,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2401.591,2403.158,If it's a trust in either event--
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2403.158,2403.608,--Right.
1989.89-393,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2419.136,2426.507,--But... but is the gravamen of the offense the invasion of an identified trust corpus?
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2426.507,2427.224,No.
1989.89-393,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2428.409,2430.559,"In other words, it's just failure to withhold?"
1989.89-393,1,17885,brian_j_martin,,2430.559,2432.392,Failure to turn... to deposit--
1989.89-393,2,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,2445.985,2452.805,"I do, Your Honor."
1989.89-393,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2507.475,2508.659,"Thank you, Mr. Winterhalter."
1989.89-393,2,38457,paul_j_winterhalter,,2508.659,2509.242,--Thank you.
1989.89-393,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2509.242,2512.194,The case is submitted.
