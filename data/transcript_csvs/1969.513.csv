1969.513,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,39.223,42.275,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,162.871,170.85,Did that motion contain any new matter that he hadn't known the day before or the week before?
1969.513,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,170.85,172.519,"The record doesn't show, Your Honor."
1969.513,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,172.519,185.158,"Well, is it reasonable, can any inferences be drawn as to whether this was some discovery overnight or whether it was a new idea after he learned that he had received an adverse decision?"
1969.513,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,185.158,205.438,"Oh, I don't know what one -- I believe that one cannot draw inferences from the record because there isn't anything in the record at all to suggest when this impeachment proceeding was initiated, if it was initiated and was initiated and what the -- what any of the facts surrounding that proceeding were."
1969.513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,210.788,214.021,"But we don't even know whether this is true or false, is that correct?"
1969.513,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,214.021,214.175,We don't know --
1969.513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,214.175,214.898,The factual statement?
1969.513,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,214.898,217.078,"We don't know it's true or false, Your Honor."
1969.513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,285.202,294.574,And we don't know if Mr. Hopkins was a lawyer or what he was so far as the record goes?
1969.513,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,294.574,299.565,"We don't know, I don't -- I think Mr. Hopkins was not a lawyer."
1969.513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,299.565,304.341,"And we -- do we know and we don't know anything about Mr. Charles Anderson, III?"
1969.513,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,304.341,307.324,"No sir, less in about him than about that of Mr. Hopkins."
1969.513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,307.324,324.564,"And do we know anything -- suppose we could take judicial notice, although I certainly don't have any actual notice of how in New Orleans you get a judge remove from office as being unfit therefore or for any other reason."
1969.513,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,331.076,373.889,"Well, we do know that there was then a procedure under the Louisiana Constitution, Article 9 of the Constitution which provided that upon the petition of any 25 citizens of the state in which they alleged that a judge was guilty of one of a fairly long list of offenses ranging from high crimes and misdemeanors to habitual drunkenness and including incompetency, corruption, favoritism, extortion, oppression in office, and gross misconduct that upon a filing of a petition with the district attorney by 25 citizens so alleging that the district attorney had to initiate impeachment proceedings."
1969.513,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,373.889,377.769,"Where, before what form?"
1969.513,0,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,377.769,380.014,"The Supreme Court of Louisiana, Your Honor."
1969.513,1,37074,neil_dixon,,1935.576,1939.962,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.513,2,36947,melvin_l_wulf,,3711.608,3713.961,Nothing whatsoever one way or the other?
