2000.99-7504,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,9.833,13.226,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Ms. Brinkmann:"
2000.99-7504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,113.662,118.6,"But counsel, that's not what the statute says."
2000.99-7504,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,130.683,130.876,No.
2000.99-7504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,158.381,158.452,Excuse me.
2000.99-7504,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,171.885,172.772,--That's correct.
2000.99-7504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,172.772,172.772,"But you're still maintaining that if you successfully complete the program, if you're a model prisoner and everything else, you had a right to get that benefit?"
2000.99-7504,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,172.772,184.073,"Justice, I think that's the next case."
2000.99-7504,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,186.855,187.994,"Well, what does the statute say?"
2000.99-7504,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,187.994,189.314,It says may.
2000.99-7504,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,189.314,194.404,"--The statute says may, but let's consider the structure of it."
2000.99-7504,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.943,275.665,"Well, you're talking about legislative history, Mr. Meierhenry, and those of us who resort to legislative history usually do so only where something is ambiguous."
2000.99-7504,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,281.418,288.994,"I don't think there's anything necessarily ambiguous if you use another meaning of the word, give permission to."
2000.99-7504,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,321.617,324.503,And you may... your sentence may be reduced.
2000.99-7504,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,324.503,325.648,"Right, but--"
2000.99-7504,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.648,329.212,"See, you've got to deal with that word may, Mr. Meierhenry."
2000.99-7504,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,325.648,349.519,"--No, I'm... what happened in this case, Your Honor, was that Chris Lopez, before he ever walked in the institution, has been categorically eliminated because he has a sentence enhancement for preconviction activity."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1537.81,1542.832,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-7504,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1554.27,1562.619,"Ms. Brinkmann, I take it that discretion was exercised in the regulation adopted by the Bureau of Prisons."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1562.619,1571.23,The regulation and program statement that the Bureau of Prisons promulgated was a statement of policy of how the Bureau of Prisons will exercise its discretion.
2000.99-7504,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1571.23,1586.243,"I notice that in an amicus brief it's argued that the regulation was promulgated without following the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, but I gather that issue was not developed below and is not here."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1586.243,1587.719,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-7504,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1616.42,1631.271,Are there any other instances of statutes... are there any instances of statutes where the Bureau of Prisons is explicitly authorized to make distinctions and decisions based on preconviction conduct?
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1631.271,1633.349,"Yes, Your Honor, many."
2000.99-7504,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1670.019,1683.84,"Well, do you think the bureau could switch back and forth under that section that you just referred to and say, although Congress said all nonviolent people should be treated this way, we think some of these should be treated the way violent people are?"
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1683.84,1684.841,"No, Your Honor."
2000.99-7504,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1688.143,1704.359,"Why isn't the same true here, that Congress has said nonviolent offenders shall be eligible for this, and the Bureau of Prisons has said categorically some nonviolent offenders will not be eligible?"
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1704.359,1711.259,"Because of the broad grant of discretion given the Bureau of Prisons by the express statutory language, Congress using the term may."
2000.99-7504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1729.867,1740.198,"Suppose the bureau says, we're not going to release in 1 year anyone guilty of a hate crime, violent or not, we don't like people who commit hate crimes, could they say that?"
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1740.198,1741.177,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-7504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.621,1749.043,"Or offenses, you know, against the United States Treasury."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1760.874,1761.765,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-7504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1773.298,1773.696,Right.
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1773.696,1774.544,--fraud at entry.
2000.99-7504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1774.544,1784.657,"Why is a firearm use not arbitrary and capricious, but... and hate crime, is that arbitrary and capricious, or not?"
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1785.867,1789.846,We think within the broad expertise of the Bureau of Prisons and--
2000.99-7504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.846,1790.548,That's okay.
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1790.548,1791.626,--If the--
2000.99-7504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.626,1794.439,"Treasury, stealing from the Treasury is not okay."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1794.439,1800.109,--We... I don't believe it would be arbitrary and capricious.
2000.99-7504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1800.109,1800.549,Oh.
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1800.549,1800.8,I think that--
2000.99-7504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1800.8,1801.966,So all of those are okay.
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1801.966,1804.157,"--They very well may be, Your Honor."
2000.99-7504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1811.343,1869.161,"Well, but isn't this argument available to just that point, that it is perfectly clear from the legislative history that the object of allowing the 1-year reduction is to provide an incentive without which the drug treatment program could not be expected to work. I gather it's a difficult thing, and there just isn't enough inducement for somebody to force himself through this unless there really is going to be a substantial reward, and it seems odd to me that if that is the object, that Congress would have wanted, for example, to exclude the entire class of gun carriers who are obviously much more dangerous gun carriers, I assume, when they're under the influence of drugs, from the inducement that would lead, if the statistics are correct, to a reduction in the number of drug-using gun-carriers."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1874.615,1876.28,"Several answers, Your Honor."
2000.99-7504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1888.287,1895.379,"Well, that may be, but the concern of the Congress was that we need an inducement to make our program effective."
2000.99-7504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1895.379,1907.418,"Why... if that is their premise, why would they exclude such large categories, or entire categories of offenders from that inducement?"
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1907.418,1917.68,"--Congress' determination was that they would give the Bureau of Prisons the authority to grant that kind of incentive because, as Mr. Meierhenry said, otherwise the bureau--"
2000.99-7504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1917.68,1930.768,"Well, that's the conclusion, but in providing authority, why would they want to give the Bureau of Prisons the authority to exclude entire categories from an inducement which they thought was necessary to make the program work?"
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1930.768,1937.952,--The legislative history does not support the proposition that the incentive is necessary for participation.
2000.99-7504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1952.472,1952.867,Okay.
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1952.867,1953.586,--in penalogical matters.
2000.99-7504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1953.586,1954.301,May I interrupt?
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1974.888,1980.154,"There was certainly evidence that there were State prison systems that had this type of incentive, and it was quite effective."
2000.99-7504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1980.948,1981.842,Where was the evidence?
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1983.686,1999.284,"--I believe it was in some hearings, and there was some discussion in some of the reports concerning some... a program in New York, for example, but Congress did not then mandate that the Bureau of Prisons grant early release to everyone who successfully completed the program."
2000.99-7504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1999.284,2007.217,"But don't you... can we not fairly infer, might we perhaps not infer, be able to infer simply from the text itself--"
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2007.217,2009.061,"No, we don't believe--"
2000.99-7504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2009.061,2022.09,"--that Congress thought the inducement was important, and if it thought the inducement was important, why would it want to preclude the inducement from working in whole categories like this?"
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2022.09,2025.779,--It wanted to give the Bureau of Prisons the authority to decide--
2000.99-7504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2025.779,2029.794,"But that... with respect, I don't think that goes to my question."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2037.318,2042.091,--The Bureau of Prisons has not eliminated the inducement entirely--
2000.99-7504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2042.091,2043.902,For the categories... for the categories.
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2043.902,2044.173,--only for certain categories.
2000.99-7504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2055.818,2065.938,So you're saying we've got to look beyond this statute to the fact that there is a whole universe of statutes in which the Bureau of Prisons is given quite extraordinary discretionary powers.
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2065.938,2069.201,We point to that to support the clear text of the statute.
2000.99-7504,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2072.634,2073.08,"No, but the clear text just talks about discretion."
2000.99-7504,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2090.605,2097.849,"Why are they experts in saying, for example, hate crimes should be excluded but heroin possession might not, or something like that?"
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2109.052,2110.873,"Your Honor, we would disagree with that."
2000.99-7504,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2128.697,2133.571,But that all applies to the conditions of his confinement while he's there.
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2141.458,2142.501,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2000.99-7504,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2143.736,2143.736,What are the statutes which allow them to do that?
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2144.673,2143.736,--They make decisions about furlough.
2000.99-7504,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2153.726,2157.459,But those are things that happen in... good conduct release determines the conduct in prison.
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2160.167,2166.855,"Your Honor, also it depends on the criminal history of the individual, as does placement in a community correction facility."
2000.99-7504,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2205.73,2214.532,"So it would be permissible, I suppose, for the Bureau of Prisons to decide that any person who entered the country illegally would be ineligible for this program."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2214.532,2216.74,Subject to arbitrary and capricious review.
2000.99-7504,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2216.74,2218.222,"Well, it wouldn't be arbitrary."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2222.433,2226.576,"Yes, Your Honor, and all this does is eliminate one incentive to the program."
2000.99-7504,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2237.588,2249.239,"Ms. Brinkmann, may I ask how the Bureau of Prisons implements this with respect to possession of drug offenders who do not carry firearms?"
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2262.279,2263.276,Yes.
2000.99-7504,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2275.54,2286.893,"How is that? You've just answered my first inquiry about, it's discretion both ways, exercises discretion to have categories of inclusion, exclusion."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2300.746,2303.225,"Your Honor, it is case-by-case."
2000.99-7504,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2315.062,2316.507,"Yes, but we passed that hurdle."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2317.327,2331.434,"--After all of that is completed, yes, that is when early release is granted. It may not be up to 12 months, because in the exercise of discretion the Bureau of Prisons tempers the amount of early release, depending on the completion of the program."
2000.99-7504,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2348.801,2359.389,"--Let's take the case of a nonviolent offender who does not come within the bureau's regulation as the gun, and so forth."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2365.808,2368.252,"If they successfully complete the program, yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-7504,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2394.385,2397.684,And they are regarded as nonviolent offenses?
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2397.684,2411.189,"--In some instances they may be, Your Honor, and the Bureau of Prisons has set forth this regulation in order to further its purpose of consistency and even-handedness in applying this program, and to give fair notice to prisoners."
2000.99-7504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2439.02,2466.625,"The difficulty with that argument, that assuming that the incentive does increase the success rate of the scheme, the Bureau of Prisons argument seems to say, we would rather have gun-carriers using drugs released a year later than former gun-carriers not using drugs released a year earlier, and that doesn't seem quite so rational."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2466.625,2475.171,"--We think that's precisely the type of expertise, though, that Congress relies on the Bureau of Prisons to bring to this type of decision."
2000.99-7504,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2476.892,2496.166,"No, but the way I just stated it, it seems irrational, and are you saying that the Bureau of Prisons has a reason to say that my factual assumptions just don't operate, that in fact the gun-carriers just do not seem to be subject to this inducement and therefore it's better not even to get into the question of early release?"
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2497.186,2510.743,"--Their theory, as they set forth in the program statement, is that the use of a gun in the course of a drug transaction increases the likelihood of use of force and violence, and for that reason granting early release is not appropriate."
2000.99-7504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2519.906,2543.215,"Ms. Brinkmann, can I go back to one of your responses to the Chief Justice? When he pressed you on the question of previous convictions for violent crimes for... you mentioned some specific crimes, and he asked, are they nonviolent crimes, and you said in some instances they are, but in some instances... or in some instances they aren't, you said."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2545.621,2546.24,Yes.
2000.99-7504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2546.24,2587.602,"And I assume that if we read the may, or more precisely if we read the excluded category of violent, of persons in prison for a violent offense as being exclusive, so that the Bureau of Prisons cannot add to that category, the result, I gather, would be that you could have somebody who happens to be in this time for a nonviolent offense, but who was convicted five times before of the most heinous, violent offenses, including murder, and that person would have to be released."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2587.602,2588.91,"Precisely, Your Honor."
2000.99-7504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.956,2614.798,"So it's quite plausible that when Congress was enacting this thing, that one thing was obvious, we don't want someone--"
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2614.798,2615.056,--Yes.
2000.99-7504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2615.056,2620.709,"--who's in there for a violent offense to get out a year early, and there may be some other categories, too."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2626.04,2641.453,"Absolutely, Your Honor, and that is totally supported by the text, because of the point I think Your Honor and some of the other members of the Court made, when you look at the language of the neighboring statute using the word shall to mandate the provision of the substance abuse treatment program."
2000.99-7504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2652.469,2653.209,That's not the point.
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2676.968,2678.718,"--And we believe it's clearly not, Your Honor."
2000.99-7504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2691.131,2697.003,Do we give the bureau chevron deference on that question as to whether that provision was meant to be exclusive or not?
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2697.003,2705.054,"Yes, we believe so, Your Honor, and we believe that it's regulation here is a authoritative statement of its implementation of the statute."
2000.99-7504,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2705.054,2724.196,"May I ask about the regulation? The whole regulation isn't quoted in your brief, but the part that you have quoted on page 4 refers to the offense for which... the current offense is a felony, b) that involved the carrying and so forth of a gun, so the regulation we're fighting about in this case is one that speaks only to the current offense."
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2724.196,2725.153,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.99-7504,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2725.153,2730.413,Then is there another regulation that disqualifies people because of their recidivism character?
2000.99-7504,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2730.413,2730.751,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-7504,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3182.353,3184.442,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.99-7504,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3184.442,3184.442,"Counsel, I assume under your argument that we would have to strike down subsection 4 of the regulation, which applies to inmates who have a prior felony or misdemeanor."
2000.99-7504,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3194.283,3184.442,"Yes, Your Honor, I think that's correct."
2000.99-7504,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3223.4,3226.831,Could I ask you about your response to Justice Kennedy?
2000.99-7504,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3263.68,3272.822,"Correct, as a convicted person, and maybe my definition isn't quite right, but I mean, when you... even when you get the chevron, the gap here, there is no gap."
2000.99-7504,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3288.843,3300.048,"Well, but Justice Scalia's question would push it further than that and say it also, as I understood it, would leave discretion to acts committed long before you were sentenced this time."
2000.99-7504,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3300.048,3303.908,--And I don't... Congress did not address that.
2000.99-7504,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3306.169,3306.948,"Well, even if--"
2000.99-7504,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3317.12,3320.335,"Because Congress, in creating the incentive--"
2000.99-7504,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3320.335,3322.508,Why do you want to hold that ground?
2000.99-7504,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3333.277,3361.882,"--I think one of the questions asked by one of the members of the bench in the INS v. Yang that my colleague brought up, some 4 years ago, she was asked about the authority of the Attorney General, and the question was, it's a longer question, but the last part was, would it be within her, the Attorney General's discretion to say, I will never exercise my discretion in favor of a waiver, and Ms. Brinkmann answered, yes, Your Honor, we believe it would be."
2000.99-7504,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3388.647,3390.262,We didn't say that argument was right.
2000.99-7504,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3390.262,3391.562,I understand that--
2000.99-7504,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3391.562,3392.243,"We just said it could be argued, right?"
2000.99-7504,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3392.243,3393.005,--but I think it summarized--
2000.99-7504,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3393.005,3394.333,And you're proving that it can be argued.
2000.99-7504,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3393.005,3410.448,"--Your Honors, we would ask the Court to overrule the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and find that the discretion that the BOP has is attendant to within-the-prison and not preconviction activities."
2000.99-7504,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3410.857,3412.626,"Thank you, Mr. Meierhenry."
