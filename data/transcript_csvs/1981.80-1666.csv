1981.80-1666,0,35047,larry_salustro,,15.76,36.089,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the narrow issue of the constitutionality under the establishment clause of an exemption provision in Minnesota's Charitable Solicitation Act."
1981.80-1666,1,17614,barry_a_fisher,,1770.435,1824.939,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, after 17 years with a charitable solicitation statute like other states, categorically, neutrally, evenhandedly exempting all churches, Minnesota amended its statute, taking that exemption away from some but not other churches, subjecting them to the statute's comprehensive regulatory and licensing requirements, including extensive recordkeeping, CPA certification, substantial record filings, expenditure limitations, access, disclosure, and publication of church documents, and an open-ended nationwide investigation, all provisions, I think, which comrephensively facilitate a sustained, detailed enforcement audit as to what are bona fide religious expenditures, solicitations and religions."
1981.80-1666,2,35047,larry_salustro,,3685.95,3698.675,"The argument has been made here that our provision, the criteria has to be supported by a factual inquiry."
