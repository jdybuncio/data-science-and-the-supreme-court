1975.74-1042,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.712,We will hear arguments first this morning in Ernst and Ernst against Hochfelder.
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,17.481,22.389,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1042,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,257.855,258.98,Killed his wife first?
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,258.98,260.514,Yes sir.
1975.74-1042,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,284.355,294.49,"Does the record show that in every transaction for the escrow account, the checks were paid to Nay personally and not to First Trust?"
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,294.49,297.856,Yes sir.
1975.74-1042,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,400.978,401.524,Unopened?
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,401.524,404.113,"Unopened, yes sir."
1975.74-1042,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,448.965,457.235,"Mr. Berner, is the term aiding and abetting a familiar one to members of the security bar?"
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,457.235,458.779,It is becoming familiar.
1975.74-1042,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.779,460.32,Where did it come from?
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,460.32,464.379,"It comes from, I think it comes from the criminal law originally."
1975.74-1042,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,464.379,468.237,How did it get over into the civil law?
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,468.237,483.608,"Well, I think it first came over in -- in Fischer versus Klotz, a case in the -- in the Southern District in the late 60s and in the Seventh Circuit, in Brennan versus Midwestern Insurance, the Seventh Circuit adapted the analogy."
1975.74-1042,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,537.328,538.778,Negligent aiding and abetting?
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,538.778,540.726,"Yes sir, negligent aiding and abetting."
1975.74-1042,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,651.691,658.88,"Where did the B-2 come from, B-2 in this case?"
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,658.88,661.505,Clause B-2 in Rule 10b-5?
1975.74-1042,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.7,685.189,"Well, the B-2 does not refer -- It does not have that fraud language?"
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,685.189,686.031,"No, it does not and it --"
1975.74-1042,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,686.031,687.209,It is so worded that --
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,687.209,690.568,It does not have language as to fault at all.
1975.74-1042,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,709.77,724.115,"Well, is part of your submission then that B-2 just is not within the reach of -- if it is construed this way, not to require scienter of any kind that it just not authorized by the statute?"
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,724.115,727.602,Yes sir.
1975.74-1042,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,779.695,789.855,Do you suggest that the statute deals in terms of affirmative action rather than commissions?
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,789.855,802.536,I believe it deals in terms of both affirmative actions and of omissions and an omission can be as a culpable as an affirmative action.
1975.74-1042,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,978.151,989.108,"Well, the respondents had a couple affidavits of that, I thought that the mail rule would have sure alerted auditors to do more than Ernst and Ernst did here?"
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,989.108,994.251,"Well, I think that the respondent has submitted three affidavits."
1975.74-1042,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,998.457,998.76,Okay.
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1021.442,1070.49,"Well, that is an issue that as I mentioned in the beginning, the question of negligence or not can also win this case for Ernst and Ernst and as a result at least in those terms that is quite important for Ernst and Ernst and I believe that a reading of the three affidavits submitted by the respondents makes it fairly clear that the respondents, two of the three are auditors, one is not an auditor, of the two auditors, one has never audited a brokerage house, but he is leased as an auditor and they say that as a -- it is a matter of personal opinion that they expressed that they would do, one says would employ additional audit procedures if you found this rule."
1975.74-1042,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1185.228,1189.343,Did they allege reckless or willful misconduct in their complaint?
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1189.343,1204.357,"No, they allege that Ernst and Ernst knew or should have known but as the brief of the Hochfelder, the respondents points out, they never characterized that conduct."
1975.74-1042,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1237.389,1247.085,Did they argue on this Seventh Circuit that there was sufficient evidence or would be a trial to support a finding of recklessness or willfulness?
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1247.085,1250.754,It was not that clear in the Seventh Circuit.
1975.74-1042,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1269.229,1273.298,"Well, the Seventh Circuit said in fact that at common law, Ernst and Ernst could not be held --"
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1273.298,1274.087,That is correct.
1975.74-1042,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1274.087,1274.971,-- under the Ultramares?
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1274.971,1280.337,That is correct which would eliminate a finding of fraudulent of reckless conduct.
1975.74-1042,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1281.514,1289.579,Was there a claim here in the pleadings of reliance on the Ernst and Ernst certificate?
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1289.579,1291.634,"No sir, not direct reliance."
1975.74-1042,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1318.001,1322.081,"Would it derive from the mail, the opening of his mail?"
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1322.081,1322.192,Opening of the mail.
1975.74-1042,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1322.192,1324.957,And the fact that he did not take the vacations?
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1324.957,1335.525,"Well, the record does not support he did not take vacations, but for the record is clear to contrary, but vacations, weak internal accounting controls and there are two other elements."
1975.74-1042,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1466.646,1481.386,"May I ask Mr. Berner, I think the commission suggests that they should have an opportunity to amend their complaint to affect the theory of reckless and the intentional rather than negligent conduct?"
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1481.386,1482.253,Yes sir.
1975.74-1042,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1482.253,1482.879,What do you think?
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1484.037,1489.248,I think the commissionâ€™s suggestion is improper.
1975.74-1042,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1523.198,1529.969,Incidentally was there suggestion involve as to the statute limitations questions?
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1529.969,1535.536,"Well, the statute limitations questions exist now and the statute would be the same."
1975.74-1042,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1538.951,1553.781,"Mr. Berner, if the general rule is that even an intervenor is not allowed to raise a new theory in the case, would the SEC simply as an amicus have any right to raise a new theory at this stage?"
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1553.781,1560.989,We felt that the suggestion was gratuitous and it is not supported by any case authority as to their standing.
1975.74-1042,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1564.664,1570.41,Does it not suggest something like the common law action?
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1570.41,1586.384,"A common law action, a 10b-5 is not the only statute or the only theory upon which a plaintiff can proceed in this case, can a common law --"
1975.74-1042,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1586.384,1588.825,"On what theory, did they proceed, on 10b?"
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1588.825,1591.122,"No, only on 10b-5."
1975.74-1042,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1591.122,1603.678,"But now, if the SEC suggestion is construed to be a suggestion for a common law claim then it is a different theory, is it not?"
1975.74-1042,0,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,1605.695,1609.258,"Well, I would not call it a different theory."
1975.74-1042,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.391,1626.126,"Very well, Mr. Berner."
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,1629.689,1635.222,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1042,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1834.881,1840.616,Do you say it would have necessarily uncovered the mail rule that you just described?
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,1840.616,1844.966,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1975.74-1042,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1893.254,1898.224,With whom do you suggest there was collusion here?
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,1902.476,1908.231,There was no collusion here that I suggest.
1975.74-1042,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2085.728,2094.309,"Well, Mr. King supposing they do fail to check into that, that would still be no more than negligence, would it?"
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2094.309,2102.57,I suggest that it would be the grossest sort of negligence and gross negligence of the public accountant as evidence of fraud.
1975.74-1042,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2102.57,2119.552,"Well, that is just a lot of words, negligence, gross negligence, evidence of fraud, but those are three fairly separate things and I do not think it helps analysis to simply garble them all together?"
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2119.552,2127.469,"I did not mean to garble them, Mr. Justice."
1975.74-1042,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2127.469,2135.139,"Mr. King, do you understand you are now arguing that was fraud, a fraud of Ernst and Ernst?"
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2135.139,2140.578,Our complaint does not allege either negligence or fraud.
1975.74-1042,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2140.578,2145.366,But in your interrogatory as you expressly disclaim that is fraud?
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2145.366,2146.435,Yes.
1975.74-1042,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2146.435,2149.829,"Are you standing on that interrogatory, are you now changing the course?"
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2149.829,2152.342,Of course I stand upon it Mr. Justice.
1975.74-1042,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2152.342,2155.736,Well then you are not charging forward?
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2155.736,2166.056,"Well, I asked, if necessary leave to amend the complaint to charge gross negligence equivalent to fraud."
1975.74-1042,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2166.056,2167.307,In this court?
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2167.307,2168.246,Yes.
1975.74-1042,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2183.131,2188.986,"So, you are asking that the case be remanded to allow you to amend your complaint to chargeable?"
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2188.986,2193.024,That is correct.
1975.74-1042,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2193.024,2195.306,When was this suit instituted?
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2195.306,2198.328,In 1971.
1975.74-1042,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2198.328,2206.773,"And this is the first time that this it has occurred to you, four years?"
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2206.773,2223.932,"Well, it only occurred to me when this Court allowed certiorari on the opinion of the Seventh Circuit."
1975.74-1042,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2548.197,2560.468,"Mr. King, neither you nor Mr. Lassers has cited in your briefs the Blue Chip opinion."
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2570.33,2590.6,"I think there is a footnote in the Blue Chip case that might have a bearing on 17a-5, but our complaint did not mention 17a-5 and I would avoid it."
1975.74-1042,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2661.599,2673.571,The Court of Appeals stated that plaintiffs admitted lack of reliance on the financial statements prepared by Ernst and Ernst?
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2673.571,2675.479,We never saw the financial statement.
1975.74-1042,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2683.269,2684.717,But you never saw the financial statement?
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2684.717,2685.93,We never saw it.
1975.74-1042,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2685.93,2698.626,"And you agree of the clients therefore, did not rely on what you contend are the failures of Ernst and Ernst correctly to audit the accounts of this company?"
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2698.626,2708.722,"I agree that we never saw the financial statement, but I think our loss was a direct result of Ernstâ€™s failure to properly audit the company."
1975.74-1042,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2721.718,2751.109,"What if all the factual situation was the same and Mr. Nay had a sideline dealing in second mortgages and did that through the private mail rule and that the whole scheme involved forgeries of the second mortgages, would you think that the same kind of liability would follow in that kind of a case?"
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2751.109,2757.526,I would think you could assume an isolated transaction by Nay --
1975.74-1042,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2757.526,2758.865,"Well, I mean a series."
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2758.865,2761.62,A series of isolated transactions?
1975.74-1042,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2768.684,2770.283,And he was using the money for what?
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2770.283,2774.073,That I am not sure.
1975.74-1042,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2774.073,2776.895,"Well, why was the company bankrupt?"
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2776.895,2787.029,"Oh! That was an originally back in 1938, a tremendous theft of some $474,000.00."
1975.74-1042,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2787.029,2791.795,Why was the company -- what was he doing to the company that led its failure?
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2795.005,2816.698,"His failure was a suicide when he no longer could put all the bank out in Colorado to whom he was short some $475 -- the company was short some $474,000.00 and mind you this is incorporated for 35,000."
1975.74-1042,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2825.178,2833.904,I think you are cutting onto your colleagueâ€™s time.
1975.74-1042,1,45215,willard_l_king,,2833.904,2838.334,Thank you.
1975.74-1042,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2838.334,2839.83,Mr. Lassers.
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,2839.83,2842.642,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1042,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2880.029,2885.185,Have you tried -- you are talking about the case against Ernst and Ernst?
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,2885.185,2885.804,Yes sir.
1975.74-1042,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2885.804,2887.915,I thought it went off on a summary judgment?
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,2887.915,2888.474,It was.
1975.74-1042,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.328,2928.464,"Before you carry on, our attempt to the response to interrogatories on page 86 of the appendix in which you say, we do not contend that Ernst and Ernst employed any scheme or auditors to defraud."
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,2929.867,2939.264,No sir because what we are saying there was we do not contend that Ernst and Ernst was in league with Nay.
1975.74-1042,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2978.521,2983.171,"On the negligence basis, would there be a cause of action under state law against Ernst and Ernst?"
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,2983.171,2986.655,Under state law?
1975.74-1042,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2994.58,2998.693,"In this case, four years, you took for discovery?"
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,2998.693,2999.697,Yes sir.
1975.74-1042,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2999.697,3001.239,Extensive discover?
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3001.239,3003.0,"Well, yes."
1975.74-1042,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3003.0,3005.769,And did you find enough of fraud?
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3005.769,3009.44,I think we found enough to prove it.
1975.74-1042,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3009.44,3011.295,Why did you not allege it?
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3011.295,3012.005,What?
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3012.005,3016.468,"Well, we did our discovery after we filed our complaint."
1975.74-1042,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3016.468,3018.993,"Well, you still could have amended your complaint, could you not?"
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3018.993,3020.02,"No, but --"
1975.74-1042,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3020.02,3021.42,Could you not?
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3021.42,3024.28,"Well, we could have asked, but if --"
1975.74-1042,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3024.28,3025.317,"Well, did you ask?"
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3025.317,3033.411,"No sir, because Ernst and Ernst never raised this issue that we have to prove recklessness until we got here."
1975.74-1042,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3033.411,3033.792,But it was your lawsuit.
1975.74-1042,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3034.326,3035.484,It is your lawsuit.[Laughter]
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3035.484,3041.926,"Well, that certainly is true, but we felt that we had alleged enough."
1975.74-1042,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3041.926,3051.913,"But if you got a claim for negligence and a claim for fraud, certainly you will allege both of them, do you not, you do not say negligence is good enough to get by and so we will not worry about fraud even though we cannot rule (Voice Overlap)?"
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3051.913,3063.196,"Well, because fraud is a much more difficult thing to prove, but and I like to say this about the mail rule because I do not think the full flavor of the mail rule has come through to the Court and that is this."
1975.74-1042,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3116.167,3116.794,Mr. Lassers?
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3116.794,3117.782,Yes.
1975.74-1042,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3117.782,3125.658,"What do you suggest the auditors should have done, should have said why he do that and the answer would have been, well, because Mr. Nay likes to open his own mail?"
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3125.658,3139.74,"Well, I say that at that point, and Mr. Meyer, our expert CPA says that that would have been enough to trigger a warning to him that further investigation was --"
1975.74-1042,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3139.74,3142.263,"Well, that would be the further investigation."
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3143.937,3144.792,Right.
1975.74-1042,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3144.792,3146.601,"Well, because he likes to open his own mail."
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3146.601,3160.255,"Right, then our expert said, if he had not been allowed in effect to look at that mail and if that practice had not been stopped as an extreme, he would have withdrawn from the audit."
1975.74-1042,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3163.397,3173.272,Why does that your colleague do have said that an accounting firm is not to certify unless another person in the organization sees the mail?
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3173.272,3177.817,"Well, I do not know if I could go that far?"
1975.74-1042,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3177.817,3181.735,But you would go that far if the auditor were not permitted to look at it?
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3181.735,3214.393,"Well, I think that our auditor says that he would have not certify and now I want to stress to the Court, Section 17a of the 1934 Act which I think is essential to this action here because that is the Section which says the brokers have to keep books and records and it says that the auditor must have a certified audit once a year so that the audits that Ernst and Ernst was performing were not audits."
1975.74-1042,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3252.083,3259.163,Mr. Lassers is 17a before us on this petition for certiorari?
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3259.163,3260.088,Yes sir.
1975.74-1042,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3260.088,3262.108,Did you file any cross-petition?
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3262.108,3286.112,"No sir, but as I understand the rule that we relied on 17a in the Seventh Circuit and the Seventh Circuit decided the case on the basis of 17a and we are a respondent, and therefore, we are in a position to assert anything that is in support of the judgment below."
1975.74-1042,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3286.112,3288.556,"Mr. Lassers, let me ask you."
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3296.288,3297.261,"Well, our position --"
1975.74-1042,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.261,3300.832,"I did not know that, is there a private cause of action under 17a?"
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3300.832,3301.979,"Well, there may be."
1975.74-1042,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3306.07,3307.622,"Well, the Court of Appeals did not say so, did it?"
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3307.622,3308.449,"No, it did not."
1975.74-1042,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3308.449,3310.649,"Well, then we could not affirm on 17a?"
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3310.649,3316.325,Our position on 17a as we are suing under Section 10b and our position on 17a --
1975.74-1042,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3316.325,3327.159,"Well, if we reversed the Court of Appeals on 10 and decide against you on the 10b, you have lost the case, have you not?"
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3327.159,3330.1,"No sir, your Honor."
1975.74-1042,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3330.1,3331.372,What about 17a then?
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3331.372,3347.133,"Our position on 17a as we are suing under 10b, and our position is that Section17a sets up the duty and it also sets up the standard that has to be adhered to under 10b."
1975.74-1042,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3347.133,3351.474,"Yes, but you do not whether you could stay in court under 17?"
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3351.474,3358.587,"Well, that would be an issue before this Court whether there is an implied cause of action under Section 17 as such."
1975.74-1042,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3358.587,3362.092,"Well, the Court of Appeals certainly did not decide there was?"
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3362.092,3363.542,"No, they reserved the question."
1975.74-1042,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3363.542,3364.32,Well.
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3364.32,3372.913,"And as I read the Seventh Circuit, they held that there was a -- that the Section 17 set-up a duty and the standard."
1975.74-1042,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3372.913,3378.547,"Only if we wanted to decide an issue, the Court of Appeals did not decide is 17 here?"
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3378.547,3394.864,"Well, I think 17 is here in the sense of a setting up the standard and that we are suing under 10b about the standard of care that the auditor is responsible for is laid out for and very precisely under 17."
1975.74-1042,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3445.061,3449.651,"Mr. Lassers, could I ask you a question which I should have asked your colleague Mr. King."
1975.74-1042,2,45341,willard_j_lassers,,3454.485,3455.664,"Yes, he is."
1975.74-1042,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3455.664,3467.457,Thank you.
1975.74-1042,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3467.457,3471.086,Mr. Gonson?
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3471.086,3475.108,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1042,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3697.061,3703.304,"Mr. Gonson, is there anything that Securities Exchange Commission itself can do to a fraudulent auditor?"
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3703.304,3708.629,"Well, certainly there are remedies that are available to the Securities and Exchange Commission."
1975.74-1042,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3732.617,3736.862,"You seem to anticipate my next question, have they taken any action against Ernst and Ernst?"
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3736.862,3740.247,"In this case, not to my knowledge Your Honor."
1975.74-1042,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3740.247,3748.881,"But what role if any, do you think Section 17a of the Exchange Act plays or ought to play?"
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3748.881,3758.533,"Well, this raises a question to which of course Justice White eluded earlier and that is that it does not appear to have been ruled out in the court below and the question --"
1975.74-1042,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3758.533,3763.991,"Well, it is discussed in part two or part three of its opinion -- part two of its opinion?"
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3763.991,3765.481,"Yes, there is a question as to whether --"
1975.74-1042,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3765.481,3767.131,It is just saying that it was a statutory --
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3767.131,3781.696,"Yes, it implied that right of action could be created and beyond there of course there would be the question whether in this case the requirements of Section 17a as it existed at the time of this action that were met which is a separate factual --"
1975.74-1042,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3781.696,3811.539,"But you are going as I understand you, you are a little beyond meats and bones of this case and talking generally about what the rule ought to be and it was in that connection that I asked you a question what role if any, do you think, what function if any do you think that Section 17a ought to play in deciding the question of civil liability of accountants to investors under 10b?"
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3811.539,3837.651,"That rule of course, I am speaking much more broadly in respect as to the order to broker dealers in that rule is of course the rule that relates to the order of broker dealers and the commission has not prepared a position your Honor today with respect to what Rule Section 17a should be playing this case rather we are addressing ourselves to the role of Section 10b and 10b-5."
1975.74-1042,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3936.244,3947.674,But do the terms not manipulative and deceptive both at least to the common mind convey a sense of intent as well as the objective result of the actions?
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3951.143,3955.071,"Well I would respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
1975.74-1042,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3981.44,3989.206,What is the manipulative practice that could be negligently carried on?
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,3989.206,4009.637,"I am not sure what a manipulative practice that could be negligently carried on is, but I think I know what a deceptive practice that could be negligently carried on and that is the kind of a practice where a person, through failure to it adhere to the standards of his profession like an accountant causes financial statements to be deceptive and to mislead persons."
1975.74-1042,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4009.637,4011.21,The statute does not use the word practice.
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4022.954,4024.447,That is true Your Honor.
1975.74-1042,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4090.649,4123.81,"For the cause of action that has been implied and the problem is how to construe the law and with respect to the standard of performance is to be required, now why should we not look to some other provisions in the Act to see what -- for some guidance and if you did what would be the nearest guide with the standard, Congress has provided a whole range of standards in various sections?"
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4135.64,4137.975,"Well, we note in our brief Your Honor."
1975.74-1042,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4142.93,4144.77,"Well, no I disagree."
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4151.22,4158.863,"I am saying that Your Honor, that even though in a particular case, a person may be held to have negligently violated the law, it still might be improper to impose damages --"
1975.74-1042,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4158.863,4168.381,"I understand that, but I still wanted to -- at the outset we want to know whether the proof of negligence is enough."
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4177.841,4181.091,"Your Honor, that is correct."
1975.74-1042,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4181.091,4188.111,Are there some questions that are pretty close to this that require more than just negligence?
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4188.111,4196.462,"Yes, Your Honor, there are a series of sections that require, that would impose liability absolutely without fault --"
1975.74-1042,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4196.462,4197.401,Less than negligent?
1975.74-1042,3,37945,paul_gonson,,4197.401,4198.0,That is correct.
1975.74-1042,4,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,4478.249,4511.913,"With respect to the question that has attracted some attention as to what is alleged in the complaint, what the theories are and what the facts are, I would point to the third defense of Ernst and Ernst in its answer filed in this case which says, it is in page 24 of the appendix, in which statements made that Ernst and Ernst had no knowledge of any conduct of Nay alleged to be fraudulent in the second count, without such knowledge, Ernst and Ernst could not aid or abet Nayâ€™s alleged fraudulent conduct."
1975.74-1042,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4527.885,4542.035,"You mean to say that aid or abet without any knowledge would be quite different from the use of those terms as words of originally field of criminal law, would it not?"
1975.74-1042,4,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,4542.035,4569.058,"My point is that when we -- by this defense we raise the issue as to the level of culpability and this defense tends to set up fairly clearly that the petitioner who was defendant below would take the position that without some knowledge, some scienter, there could be no recovery."
1975.74-1042,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4661.479,4683.714,"As part of the alleged fraudulent conduct in the scheme on the part of Nay was that he used for securities, he used the stationery and he used the office and the communications were sent to him at First Securities and if had told the plaintiffs when you communicate with me about this escrow business you have to do it through lock box 1, that would -- might well have raised their suspicion."
1975.74-1042,4,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,4685.464,4685.781,Well --
1975.74-1042,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4685.781,4686.587,That is part of the fraud.
1975.74-1042,4,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,4690.402,4709.796,"That is as alleged, but it also is reasonable to assume that he specifically told these people to address all mail to him in connection with the escrow to his attention or to him personally because as the record indicates he told them he did not want anyone at First Securities to know about these investments."
1975.74-1042,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4717.399,4726.318,"So, that is in your point of view that it alert them as much -- should have alerted them as much as the hypothetical which Mr. Justice Stewart gave you about the --"
1975.74-1042,4,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,4726.318,4732.383,"It should have alerted the respondents, yes sir."
1975.74-1042,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4732.383,4734.961,May I ask a question.
1975.74-1042,4,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,4747.675,4748.266,I did not.
1975.74-1042,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4794.411,4796.307,"The full extent of it was $9,000.00?"
1975.74-1042,4,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,4796.307,4797.379,Yes sir.
1975.74-1042,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4797.379,4800.121,"And this is an oral report, was it not?"
1975.74-1042,4,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,4800.121,4807.573,"No, this was on the certified financial statements that were to be submitted to the Midwest Stock Exchange."
1975.74-1042,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4807.573,4810.295,But the communication between was oral?
1975.74-1042,4,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,4810.295,4813.879,"Yes sir, it was oral, but it is memorialized in a memorandum."
1975.74-1042,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4820.712,4826.955,"But I think there is some point made at the fact that this was done orally and not officially and in writing, is that not correct?"
1975.74-1042,4,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,4826.955,4831.474,"Well as I understand it yes, the argument is that it was done informally rather than formal."
1975.74-1042,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4833.334,4837.796,"Well, among other things, I think it may be means oral nature of it."
1975.74-1042,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4837.796,4840.502,But did you say it was confirmed in writing?
1975.74-1042,4,38792,robert_l_berner_jr,,4840.502,4847.299,"No, the fact of the telephone conversation between Mr. Hooker and Mr. Rothling is the subject of a memorandum."
