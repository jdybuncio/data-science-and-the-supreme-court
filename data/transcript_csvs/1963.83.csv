1963.83,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.829,"Number 83, Frank Costello, Petitioner, versus Immigration and Naturalization Service."
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,15.099,20.835,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.83,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,84.367,86.453,What was his status before (Inaudible) in Italy --
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,86.453,101.442,"Because he had forsworn Your Honor, allegiance to Victoria Emmanuel and as far as Italy was concerned and he is concerned, it does not recognize him as an Italian citizen."
1963.83,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,202.737,207.067,Why was it germane (Inaudible)
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,207.067,228.352,"It becomes germane, if the Court please, because of prejudice that inured to the petitioner as the result of the government's instruction and the lower court's instruction of 241 (a) (4), which I shall show you in just a moment."
1963.83,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,803.238,817.977,"Do you think 241 (b) (2) means when it talks about such crimes, you mean the first one or the second one?"
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,825.336,827.034,Yes sir.
1963.83,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,827.034,830.564,If (Inaudible) convicted of one crime within five years?
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,830.564,831.417,That isn't an issue.
1963.83,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,831.417,832.829,"And that's not an issue, this is two crimes?"
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,832.829,833.318,Two crimes.
1963.83,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,833.318,834.111,Then in that kind of a case.
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,841.572,851.236,"I think it's the crime which makes him deportable because obviously he wouldn't ask for the recommendation in the first crime because he wouldn't be deportable for the first crime, but the second --"
1963.83,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,851.236,853.812,But as for the -- .
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,853.812,854.8,Sorry?
1963.83,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,854.8,855.563,You go ahead.
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,855.563,870.446,"But in the second crime, when it appeared to him from the statute as an alien that he would be deportable, he would ask the court to recommend of course, against deportation, and if the court would pass upon it, it would only be in the frame of reference of the second."
1963.83,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,870.446,871.815,"Of the second, second."
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,871.815,873.731,Yes.
1963.83,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,875.449,893.17,(Inaudible)
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,893.17,894.453,Yes.
1963.83,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,894.453,896.675,(Inaudible)
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,896.675,901.948,We don't argue Your Honor that he should profit from his own fraud.
1963.83,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1476.344,1484.689,(Inaudible)
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,1484.689,1495.314,"I think you'll find them, Mr. Justice Goldberg, in pages 32 and 33 where we discussed Jordan v. De George and some of the cases that I have just talked about."
1963.83,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2295.666,2308.053,(Inaudible)
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2308.053,2311.508,I was saying he wouldn't be here today for a different reason.
1963.83,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2313.221,2314.328,(Inaudible)
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2314.328,2328.794,"I think he wouldn't be here today, to tell you possibly he wouldn't be here today because the question wouldn't have arisen because number one, he could have taken steps to avoid his deportability in 1954 before the sentencing court."
1963.83,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2337.577,2348.929,(Inaudible)
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2348.929,2352.693,If he'd been convicted two times and –
1963.83,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2352.693,2354.455,Or not given him relief --
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2354.455,2358.718,-- not given him relief.
1963.83,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2358.718,2359.978,He would be deported?
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2359.978,2366.858,"Well, there would be still – there would still be the question with respect to – oh! If he had never been naturalized at all, you say?"
1963.83,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2366.858,2367.321,Yes.
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2367.321,2367.859,Alright.
1963.83,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2367.859,2374.114,"(Inaudible) nevertheless he could still, if (Inaudible)"
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2374.114,2374.879,Yes sir.
1963.83,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2374.879,2377.12,(Inaudible)
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2377.12,2377.544,Yes sir.
1963.83,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2377.544,2400.404,(Inaudible)
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2400.404,2414.701,"Your Honor, my position as I can show you does not different really from the government's position with respect of the very questions which you're posing and I want to show you what their position is."
1963.83,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2676.145,2695.909,(Inaudible)
1963.83,0,23411,edward_bennett_williams,,2695.909,2702.378,The statute seems to me quite clear Your Honor that either the application must be made within 30 days by an alien.
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3050.428,3052.736,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1963.83,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3117.085,3126.004,(Inaudible)
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3126.004,3126.563,Yes sir.
1963.83,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3126.563,3137.405,(Inaudible)
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3137.405,3140.092,I am not certain of 241 (a) (6).
1963.83,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3164.223,3168.577,(Inaudible)
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3168.577,3171.742,"No, I am quite sure that is not the case."
1963.83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3213.402,3218.092,They all are from -- the whole section enacted in 1952.
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3218.092,3219.048,"Oh, yes it was."
1963.83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3219.3,3221.383,By a single Congress –
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3221.383,3223.123,That is correct.
1963.83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3390.305,3395.916,"Certainly he, it can be assumed, he thought he was a citizen at that time and so did everybody else."
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3395.916,3402.978,"Well, in the case of actual fraud, my question extend to which he is –"
1963.83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3402.978,3404.679,He had (Inaudible) –
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3404.679,3406.381,That's correct.
1963.83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3406.381,3420.706,If he hadn't been guilty of fraud no matter how undesirable he might be or – he obviously couldn't be deported no matter how many crimes he committed.
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3420.706,3425.287,We cannot deport him because he is not now an alien.
1963.83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3463.951,3470.366,"How prior, which prior status, it seems to me that your other one is going to his prior status?"
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3470.366,3506.976,"No, we say whether or not he was a citizen, one holding a defective citizenship or an alien at the time that he committed the crimes and the time he was convicted, nevertheless whichever of those statuses existed, the mere fact of conviction is the fact that establishes his criminal propensity and it's only his criminal propensities that are now relevant to his present desirability and if you're now an alien, and is presently undesirable, he maybe deported."
1963.83,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3532.178,3533.354,Which word?
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3533.354,3551.747,"Is, the fact that it says aliens who, any alien who is convicted of and has been or shall have been and the other ground for deportation by and large are phrased in different language; has been, shall have been, has been or make it after be etcetera."
1963.83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3625.032,3632.548,"Because, is was not used, some other form of the word to be, part to future (Inaudible)"
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3632.548,3633.576,No.
1963.83,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3668.346,3670.692,(Inaudible)
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3670.692,3671.198,That is correct.
1963.83,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3671.198,3676.892,(Inaudible)
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3676.892,3689.038,"I would add the point that the basic committee report, the result of the original study in describing this provision uses the language has been."
1963.83,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3703.652,3712.18,"Well, Mr. Barnett, is this position is someone inconsistent with your argument about the reason for passing the relation back to --"
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3712.18,3713.816,"No, no."
1963.83,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3726.853,3728.646,"Well, you don't wait then?"
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3728.646,3731.647,I would like to defer the development relation back to them.
1963.83,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3734.261,3770.424,"Well, I guess that you say that Congress really didn't cope with some of this wording and that this was by accident and that they certainly would have been tended to have thought of it to put some other way, but if they passed the relation back, if you suggest that they passed the relation back to provision just to take care of despairing of the situation (Inaudible) then that's the focus on the problem and one way or the other though I can't see how that can be both ways."
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3770.424,3776.634,I don't think Congress was that subtle in adopting the relation back provision.
1963.83,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3788.982,3805.059,"Mr. Barnett, did I understand it to say that the first study that was made of this section that is here in the present set suggested that they say ever has been?"
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3805.059,3806.81,"They didn't, they didn't address themselves to the issue."
1963.83,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3819.349,3834.391,"Well, I wanted to ask you this question if the original study suggested that or pointed out that it should be that way, wouldn't in fact they didn't do it that way?"
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3844.649,3868.266,"I think not because they introduced the bail at the same time the report was filed and the report recommended the retention of the provisions providing for the deportation of aliens who have been convicted and at the same day, the same day that the report was filed, Senator McCarran filed the basic omnibus bill, McCarran having been the --"
1963.83,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3868.266,3870.618,Do you think he liked subtlety in these matters?
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3878.759,3886.692,"The, well, one way or the other he shouldn't have introduced the report of he shouldn't have introduced the bill, but if he was aware of --"
1963.83,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3886.692,3888.95,"What are we governed by, the report or the bill?"
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3888.95,3899.934,We govern by the bill and I'm not really trying to place that much reliance on the report because it was not focused on in the report.
1963.83,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3899.934,3903.605,But you are arguing it?
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3903.605,3918.403,"I point in response to question that there is this usage in the report which I say really it doesn't -- if it does show anything, it shows a lack of awareness or the significance of tense."
1963.83,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3921.331,3941.741,"And the mere fact that they didn't use the same tense in the bill that they introduced, that they used in the study that was reported, but about the same time indicates that they didn't understand the difference between the two?"
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3941.741,3947.102,"Well, if the tense is important, I think it does indicate that Congress was unaware of that significance."
1963.83,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3947.102,3950.565,"Why do you say that, what do you base that on?"
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3950.565,3967.438,"Well, the fact that the report in describing the provision which allegedly has this very significant tense is that makes all the difference in this application, it was described – well, I'll read you what the report says."
1963.83,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3969.925,3973.462,"I think I get report all right, but I just don't see how you can –"
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3973.462,3983.8,"Now, well, I don't think anyone who thought that was significant that is, made the difference would have written a report that shifts tense into another tense."
1963.83,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3983.8,3992.465,"Well, couldn't you say that they didn't – well the reason they didn't use that tense was because they didn't want it to be applied that way."
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,3992.465,3997.22,"Well, that would support my argument I think, that they didn't mean it to be applied."
1963.83,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3997.22,4003.703,"Oh, but, they did, they used the present tense purposely."
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4003.703,4005.318,"Well, it maybe they did."
1963.83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4042.371,4055.188,"Would your -- wouldn't your argument apply if the citizenship had been defective for some reason other than fraud, some just technically defective?"
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4055.188,4058.247,"Yes sir, yes sir, if it were revoked."
1963.83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4061.829,4064.546,For some technical reason after its acquisition?
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4064.546,4068.518,"I would like to point out to the Court, I think we don't make that much of a point of it."
1963.83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4095.956,4097.819,I think there was something wrong about the affidavit –
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4097.819,4098.649,"That's right, that's right."
1963.83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4098.649,4101.176,I think that was the case in the Brancato case in the Sixth Circuit.
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4107.214,4108.497,I am not sure what –
1963.83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4108.497,4113.176,And the distinction was sought to be made there between fraudulent procurement and illegal procurement.
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4113.176,4117.971,"Yeah, I think the fraudulent representation there was about the technical defect."
1963.83,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4137.017,4161.877,(Inaudible)
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4161.877,4166.18,"Yes sir, yes sir, that's correct, that's correct."
1963.83,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4167.006,4168.524,(Inaudible)
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4168.524,4174.002,There is a possible argument that the relation back provision doesn't pick up that new ground for denaturalization.
1963.83,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4241.101,4246.357,(Inaudible)
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4246.357,4258.931,"Oh, no no, conviction should be a requirement but if Congress meant by this to protect some one in his exercise of his prior status when he was a citizen."
1963.83,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4483.145,4500.701,In order to probably to make this analogy during the Eichenlaub case and this one we have to push accept you affirmance that the word ‘is' means as saying as ‘has been' in the future maybe.
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4500.701,4501.843,Well maybe
1963.83,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4501.843,4503.345,We have to accept that in order to --
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4503.345,4504.214,"Yeah, that's right."
1963.83,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4504.214,4505.854,to make the analogy.
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4505.854,4520.386,"Except for the reasons given by the court may have a broader impact than the identity of the language, but I do argue that it is conducted and maybe conducted and have the same implications for this purpose."
1963.83,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4520.386,4521.547,Yes.
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4528.995,4546.933,"Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Scolberd of Section 6 drives from the Internal Security Act of 1950 which you will find in our brief at Page 16 in the discussion of the main language."
1963.83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4633.862,4645.444,"If Congress would have really wanted to be careful along the lines you suggest, they would have enacted in each one of the sections the Eichenlaub language, wouldn't they?"
1963.83,1,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,4645.444,4650.478,"No, the other, the other section used has been I think would not pose the problem."
1963.83,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4691.768,4704.502,"Just before you leave the first - your first basic point, you read the Brancato case in the Sixth Circuit as being contrary to what you told us?"
