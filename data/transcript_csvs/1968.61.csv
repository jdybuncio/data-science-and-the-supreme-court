1968.61,1,28425,harris_weinstein,,22.702,27.268,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1968.61,3,28425,harris_weinstein,,247.563,249.181,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.61,5,28425,harris_weinstein,,331.425,346.356,"B, after A, which directs that respondent pay to the appropriate source any fringe benefits provided for in the above-described contract."
1968.61,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,379.727,385.502,I don't quite understand the-- what are the appropriate sources?
1968.61,5,28425,harris_weinstein,,385.502,416.706,"These are set out in the contract, agreed in the contract itself which are on the record, Mr. Justice Stewart - I think on page 66 - and it sets up several funds to which payments are to be made, there is a health and welfare trust, there's an apprentice trust, there are two other funds then below, there is a roofer's fund."
1968.61,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,444.755,446.82,I see.
1968.61,5,28425,harris_weinstein,,446.82,455.236,In finding this paragraph of the order was beyond the Board's power.
1968.61,7,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,1582.633,1586.093,"Mr. Chief Justice, may It please the Court."
1968.61,9,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,1695.429,1697.342,"Yes, sir."
1968.61,11,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,1897.23,1900.049,"Or the employees restored, yes."
1968.61,13,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,1901.253,1903.641,They could have ordered the employees to be reinstated --
1968.61,15,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,1904.453,1909.909,And they could have ordered back pay and that's specifically provided for under the statute.
1968.61,17,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,1913.232,1918.081,"Well, that's the very hard question in this case, Mr. Chief Justice but --"
1968.61,19,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,1922.086,1942.91,"The reason, I think, first of all goes to the fact that if they had discharged the employees, they would have done so with an Anti-Union Analyst and I do think that it could be a distinction between the employer acting with the Anti-Union Analyst and an employer acting mistakenly but in good faith."
1968.61,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.004,2023.276,What was the Unfair Labor Practice Union?
1968.61,19,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2023.276,2027.1,(Voice overlap) was refusing to sign the contract --
1968.61,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.1,2028.524,Which is a violation of what?
1968.61,19,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2028.524,2030.055,Section 8(d).
1968.61,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.1,2061.148,Your argument then doesn't rely at all on whether or not there was an action under 301 available to the union?
1968.61,19,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2086.282,2087.13,That is correct.
1968.61,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.139,2091.889,So you're relying on that also.
1968.61,19,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2091.889,2100.316,We're relying on that but obviously under (Voice overlap) the Evening News there is contract jurisdiction.
1968.61,21,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2694.046,2695.998,"Yes, sir."
1968.61,23,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2741.423,2742.087,That's right.
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2752.306,2752.782,That's right.
1968.61,25,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2764.461,2773.256,"Well, I cannot under this --in compliance proceedings on the Board, may the Board make a similar determination?"
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2773.256,2775.325,"I've never known that, Mr. Justice Black."
1968.61,25,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2782.154,2791.476,"Well, I mean, I've certainly have back pay orders or adjustments to back pay depending on whether or not the affected employees have really tried to get other work in that sort of thing."
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2794.063,2800.558,"Well, its' normally done in the context of the back pay hearing without official --."
1968.61,25,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2800.558,2815.301,"My question really was, in a back pay hearing it might not be a determination of the amount do in a way of fringe benefit which might take into account some of the things which you think an arbitrator will?"
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2815.301,2823.22,"I don't have that confidence in the Board, Mr. Justice Brennan when in these cases like I just read Adams Jerry and so are they, they looked at the agreement."
1968.61,25,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2852.866,2857.562,"No, I just asked you what you said by a little contract?"
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2857.562,2863.201,"A very low competence in interpreting competence, in interpreting Collective Bargaining Agreement."
1968.61,25,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2863.201,2869.928,Is that command which trying to shift himself from a judge to the jury in order to appeal to the equitable (Inaudible)?
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2869.928,2875.096,"Well, this is the system that we are under, Mr. Justice Black."
1968.61,25,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2898.266,2898.465,(Inaudible)
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2898.465,2901.269,"I was about to say there are -- Excuse me, sir?"
1968.61,25,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2901.269,2915.572,"Suppose this fringe benefits, the amount of these fringe benefits was just a mathematical question of that so many mandates, would your argument be the same?"
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2915.572,2932.983,"Well, no it would not because an arbitrator still could be able to say, as I mentioned under this circumstances, I'm going to say that equity dictates at the employer not have to pay even though it was trickily calculated."
1968.61,25,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2934.787,2938.856,"Your argument would be the same then as well, that is this."
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2939.397,2942.844,"Yes, it would be the same."
1968.61,25,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2946.492,2947.828,It would be the same.
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2951.793,2953.114,"Yes, sir."
1968.61,25,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2970.997,2972.13,(Voice overlap) pretty clear?
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2972.13,2977.508,The parties have contracted even though the language is maybe clear and unambiguous.
1968.61,25,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2981.854,2984.353,Have an arbitrator which decide the equity of?
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2984.353,2985.267,"Yes, sir."
1968.61,25,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2985.267,2986.701,Just kind to review it if they accept the agreement?
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,2986.701,2988.248,"Yes, sir."
1968.61,25,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2997.712,3006.681,"Well, I understand that originally, they took the position that the respondent did not design the contract because he didn't recognize this bonding?"
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3006.681,3008.397,"That is correct, that position was there."
1968.61,25,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3008.397,3014.459,"And then, nothing would gone until this action went into the NLRB?"
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3014.459,3015.44,That is correct.
1968.61,25,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3015.44,3018.223,"And then, it was found that it was a contract."
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3018.223,3019.22,That's correct.
1968.61,25,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3019.22,3024.969,"And now, you shift your position in saying that you want to operate under the contract which still are the same."
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3024.969,3028.296,"Well, we've offered the same, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1968.61,25,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3031.404,3037.662,The fact that you didn't sign it is a reason that the NLRB took jurisdiction?
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3040.671,3041.722,It was up to the expert.
1968.61,25,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3041.722,3042.38,Is that right?
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3042.38,3043.193,That is correct.
1968.61,25,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3070.178,3085.588,"Well, I gather it sensually that your argument law is that, are the Board simply has no authority, power, whatever words you want to use to enter the kind of order they did here as to the fringe benefit, am I right?"
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3085.588,3086.27,Correct.
1968.61,25,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3086.27,3112.406,"And this is on the ground that this is a contract matter and that section dealing with sanctions has to be interpreted as not authorizing a sanction which goes to the interpretation to the agreement itself that that must either be a matter for the arbitrator because this arbitration provision here or in any event for the Courts since there is no arbitration proceedings, is that it?"
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3112.406,3114.692,"Yes, sir."
1968.61,25,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3114.692,3118.034,You have the proceeding divided up in two parts?
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3118.034,3118.222,"Yes, sir."
1968.61,25,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3118.222,3121.761,The Board to determine one part and an arbitrator will know it.
1968.61,25,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3121.761,3123.231,Nothing unusual about that.
1968.61,27,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3210.707,3215.671,"If the Labor Board permits the arbitrator to determine this, yes, sir."
1968.61,27,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3215.671,3243.47,"Now, apart from what the arbitrator will determine on what your construction of the trilogy, which you call it trilogy, if the Board says that our opinion, our order means that you have to pay what you're obligated under the contract and that's to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the contract."
1968.61,27,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3249.028,3251.916,I think that's what law would be.
1968.61,27,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3264.114,3272.652,"I know you say that and then the arbitrator may or may not allow it and if he does agree with you, the Court may or may not overrule."
1968.61,27,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3272.652,3278.02,"It would be very surprised, Mr. Justice Fortas, that the Court will overrule an arbitrator."
1968.61,27,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3280.323,3283.365,That's because of what Justice Douglas wrote in the trilogy.
1968.61,27,18448,charles_g_bakaly_jr,,3283.365,3289.992,Of what this Court said.
1968.61,29,28425,harris_weinstein,,3353.179,3397.035,"If, Mr. Chief Justice of Court pleases, I simply suggest that all the arguments that have been advanced in this court, in that arbitration which were not advanced before the Labor Board and the Court of Appeals are all disposed of by Mr. Justice Douglas as an opinion for the Court in Carrie against Westinghouse where the Court discusses the considerable length of the relationship between arbitration and Board proceedings, makes clear that these are alternatives available to the complaining party and goes so far to say that in the event of conflict, the Boards ruling would have coursed to take precedents."
1968.61,29,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3438.929,3442.272,"Well, let me see of (Inaudible) statute."
1968.61,29,28425,harris_weinstein,,3480.878,3482.889,"Yes, sir."
1968.61,29,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3482.889,3490.892,"Then they say that to the Board, they will report to the Board that the compliance officer will pay $25 to the trustees."
1968.61,29,28425,harris_weinstein,,3525.425,3530.176,"Mr. Justice Fortas, the Board's decision is that it has the option."
