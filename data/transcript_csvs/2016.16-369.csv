2016.16-369,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.555,"We'll hear argument first this morning in case 16-369, County of Los Angeles v. Mendez. Mr. Rosenkranz."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,8.555,28.79,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Your Honor, when a police officer reasonably thinks to himself, as Deputy Conley did here, this is where I'm going to die, he has to be free to make the split-second decision to defend himself and those around him."
2016.16-369,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,34.255,47.195,"You know, I have a -- it is a very moving statement, and one that I totally agree with, but we're not asking the police officers to make that choice."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,81.68,82.42,Understood.
2016.16-369,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,82.42,120.24,"Or -- or was justified in whatever he or she did to protect themselves. So let's take the situation, which I think you concede in your brief, that of the police officer who, in the dead of night, in -- dressed in casual clothes, breaks a window in someone's home and walks into their home. And we have given them the Second Amendment right to victims, people who own homes, to possess firearms to protect themselves."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,172.275,200.45,"Understood, Your Honor. And the answer to that question is quite likely the officer, but not because of the provocation rule, but rather because the officer has committed a clearly unconstitutional act, which is not just entering, but also failing to knock and announce, clear violation of clearly established law, which then proximately causes what -- what unfurls next."
2016.16-369,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,200.45,217.685,"Well, let's -- let's break that down, because I see two scenarios in this for which a victim could -- could recover. One is an unconstitutional violation that proximately causes an injury."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,235.465,236.12,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.16-369,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,300.66,301.37,That's where I have -- '
2016.16-369,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,301.37,302.21,Can I --
2016.16-369,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,302.21,302.66,I'm sorry.
2016.16-369,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,303.04,319.855,"Can I ask about the first theory, because you said if there was a violation -- excuse me -- of the knock-and-announce rule, and a death or an injury proximately caused by that violation, then there could be recovery. Is that what you said?"
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,319.855,322.85,That is what I said.
2016.16-369,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,322.85,323.04,Yes.
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,323.04,333.235,"So let me just -- let me just amend with one -- I said one additional thing. Knock-and-announce violation, and that violation is a violation of clearly -- clearly --"
2016.16-369,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,333.235,333.95,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,333.95,334.48,-- established law.
2016.16-369,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,334.48,351.66,"And this is qualified immunity context; everything has to be a violation of clearly established law, quite right. So I guess the question is, why is this case any different? In other words, this case you don't have the knock-and-announce violation; you have a different constitutional violation, which is an unauthorized entry."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,399.155,401.86,"Your Honor, so -- let's just be clear where we are."
2016.16-369,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,410.39,412.635,"It's -- it's a simple question, Mr. Rosenkranz."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,412.635,412.805,Yes.
2016.16-369,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,412.805,415.21,You said something about knock and announce.
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,422.49,424.58,"For a very simple reason, Your Honor."
2016.16-369,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,435.26,437.98,That is an unauthorized entry into somebody's home.
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,437.98,438.52,"Yes, it is."
2016.16-369,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,438.52,441.55,So that is the clearly established constitutional violation.
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,441.55,441.97,Correct.
2016.16-369,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,441.97,461.215,"Why isn't the proximate cause -- why it -- why wouldn't it be that a death or injury that results when somebody barges into, goes into somebody's home without legal authorization, that one of the things that foreseeably can result from that is a shooting?"
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,461.215,469.17,"Well, Your Honor, the answer is that calling the judge in advance would not have made a bit of difference in this case."
2016.16-369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,469.17,470.39,Well suppose --
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,470.39,471.435,The facts --
2016.16-369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,471.435,480.805,"Suppose this case, police arrest without a warrant a man who's having dinner with his family and friends, white collar crime."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,505.24,508.11,"That's correct, Your Honor, because the warrant requirement --"
2016.16-369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,508.11,511.66,Then -- then we simply have no way to enforce the warrant requirement.
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,528.22,529.32,"Your Honor, I'm not saying --"
2016.16-369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,529.32,531.44,You want us -- you want us to write that in the law.
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,531.44,536.14,"I'm not saying no damage, but certainly not the physical injury that occurred here."
2016.16-369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,538.52,540.37,"Yeah, let's stick with this -- with this hypothetical."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,550.17,550.91,If the search --
2016.16-369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,550.91,554.02,"And if that's -- and if that's so, I'd like the citation for that case."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,554.02,555.17,"Your Honor, if the search --"
2016.16-369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,555.17,555.62,For -- for that.
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,555.62,567.14,"If the search would have happened no matter what, yes, there may be humiliation, sure, because, I mean, if -- if the warrant would have prevented that humiliation, then you could sue for it."
2016.16-369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,567.14,568.36,"Now, let's assume that it wouldn't."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,571.9,574.09,Then -- then there's definitely no damage.
2016.16-369,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,576.15,600.195,"Can -- can you tell me if Paula Jones on your theory -- Paula Hughes -- Paula Hughes, the homeowner, who was -- there was no warrant and she was placed in a car and treated rather badly, would she have a 1983 claim?"
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,600.195,606.72,"She may well have a 1983 claim, Your Honor, for -- for the poor treatment when she was not actually a criminal."
2016.16-369,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,636.19,637.5,But it might very well change --
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,637.5,637.53,Proxima --
2016.16-369,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,637.53,638.22,-- proximate -- proximate.
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,638.22,639.2,As proximate cause.
2016.16-369,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,639.615,641.41,It might very well change the outcome.
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,681.09,695.67,"Your Honor, every fact that you've recited beyond not having the warrant is a fact that you've inserted into the scenario that is all about giving notice to the -- to the suspect."
2016.16-369,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,709.53,722.86,"Well, it's -- it's possible. I mean, I take the point, Mr. Rosenkranz, it's possible that you have a warrant in your pocket and you don't say anything about it, although that would seem like very silly -- stupid police work."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,754.025,756.1,"Your Honor, I -- I disagree."
2016.16-369,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,828.56,833.8,Why -- why do you break -- why is everyone breaking it down in this way? That's what I'm having trouble with.
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,833.8,834.57,"Well, Your Honor --"
2016.16-369,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,834.57,837.315,"Why -- why -- why not just say, look, there was a seizure."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,865.28,865.74,"Well, Your Honor --"
2016.16-369,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,865.74,871.565,"If you look at the whole situation and say, you know what this is like? It's like the classic tort case."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,892.305,906.76,"Well, Your Honor, what's wrong with that is -- is that this Court's methodology is to -- especially in cases involving personal liability to officers, is you start with a violation of clearly established law."
2016.16-369,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,913.28,918.365,"I mean, if you break it down temporally, second by second."
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,920.58,921.11,Right.
2016.16-369,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,924.62,925.29,Save your rebuttal.
2016.16-369,0,23018,e_joshua_rosenkranz,,925.29,948.98,"But let me answer very briefly, though, that -- that what you've done now with the excessive force piece is to focus not on the decision that the officer makes at that moment, which is the critical decision under Graham, but to find that what he did was unreasonable, even though the court of appeals and the district court found it to have been reasonable at that moment. Thank you, Your Honors."
2016.16-369,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,948.98,961.455,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky."
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,961.455,965.19,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We have two questions in this case."
2016.16-369,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1016.44,1037.365,"So, why is it that every Graham case we look at, all the car chase cases, every single one of them, we -- when we're talking about the situation facing the officer, we look at everything the officer and the victim did that led up to the moment of confrontation."
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1097.125,1116.295,"Well, you're right that you're looking at all of the facts and circumstances, but those that bear on whether the use of force is reasonable. And just to give an example, in Plumhoff, which is one of the car chase cases that the Court addressed, the district court in that case said well, the police officer was chasing him, so the police officer helped create the dangerous situation, and this Court in footnote 3 of its opinion said: No."
2016.16-369,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1123.31,1123.73,But why isn't --
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1123.73,1124.19,-- from the public.
2016.16-369,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1124.19,1133.26,"-- how they do their job, because they have to know -- they have to know what reasonable people will do."
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1179.82,1189.44,"Well, as a general matter, Section 1983 is about courts setting clearly established constitutional rules for the police that the police have to follow."
2016.16-369,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1198.96,1199.15,So is it --
2016.16-369,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1199.15,1199.39,Counsel --
2016.16-369,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1199.39,1222.24,"-- for a police officer to pull a gun and shoot a driver that has no guilt associated with him or her? Not an armed felon, just a normal person to stumble into the street and say, I'm a police officer, I'm going to seize that person and stop myself by being injured by shooting that person?"
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1222.24,1230.13,"Well, I think you would ask in that question what -- whether there really was a threat that the officer was responding to, and I think you're positing a situation where there really wasn't a threat there."
2016.16-369,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1248.885,1253.46,"Counsel, it -- it -- I just want to put the discussion so far this morning in the right framework."
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1275.54,1276.065,Sure.
2016.16-369,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1288.35,1301.88,"So as -- as that's describe -- is the label what's wrong? I -- I would think of provocation is something fairly immediate, something that causes the pulling of the gun by the -- the victim or something like that."
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1309.22,1321.87,"I mean the thing that's wrong is what the Ninth Circuit is doing, which is saying the police created the situation by doing things that are not constitutional violations, but that the Ninth Circuit later finds, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, to be reasonable -- unreasonable."
2016.16-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1362.08,1362.41,But isn't --
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1362.41,1362.75,So the best --
2016.16-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1362.75,1372.62,"-- isn't that a little bit different than the provocation rule at 25(a) where they say there was no warrant and therefore there's -- those are two different things, right."
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1372.62,1372.71,Right.
2016.16-369,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1392.22,1392.51,Do you --
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1392.51,1392.82,-- with the Ninth's --
2016.16-369,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1392.82,1409.905,"-- before -- can I just -- do you agree in general, before you address the question in particular, do you agree in general what that framing -- that if there is an independent constitutional violation and if it does proximately cause the injury, then there's a 1983 action?"
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1409.905,1411.56,"In general, yes."
2016.16-369,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1444.59,1459.035,"So that seems fair enough. But then the question might become, whether here or on remand, whether an unauthorized entry, where there was a clearly established violation, whether one could say that that was the proximate cause of the shooting."
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1459.035,1459.56,Yes.
2016.16-369,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1501.3,1507.04,But one of -- a warrant violation is just -- it's -- it's just saying unauthorized entry.
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1524.96,1525.375,Right.
2016.16-369,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1531.1,1532.83,"Doesn't have to, normally. It doesn't have to --"
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1532.83,1533.68,Proximate cause --
2016.16-369,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1533.68,1537.16,"Or -- you know, proximate cause is just we filter out the really fluky stuff."
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1537.16,1552.26,"Well, I -- we understand proximate cause in the scope of the risks as being what are the natural and probable consequences of your actions, what are the risks that make the conduct tortious, what bad things do you think are going to occur if you do this. And in the warrant context, we're talking about police showing up at the door."
2016.16-369,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1566.77,1570.445,Well -- and also if you could get to Justice Kennedy's hypothetical.
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1570.445,1571.355,Okay.
2016.16-369,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1592.98,1593.27,"No, no --"
2016.16-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1593.27,1594.52,There -- there is probable cause --
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1594.52,1594.74,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2016.16-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1594.74,1596.33,But there was a failure to get a warrant.
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1596.33,1596.58,Yes.
2016.16-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1596.58,1597.575,And there should have been a warrant.
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1597.575,1597.91,Right.
2016.16-369,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1610.54,1613.5,"And if the humiliation is the same either way, no damage?"
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1613.5,1617.7,I'd -- I'm not saying that it depends on whether proximate cause and you could have gotten a warrant.
2016.16-369,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1642.45,1642.8,Thank you --
2016.16-369,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1642.8,1644.8,Can I ask a follow-up question on that?
2016.16-369,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1644.8,1644.89,Sure.
2016.16-369,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1644.89,1668.705,"Isn't -- if, in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical that there had been an application for a warrant, isn't it entirely possible, particularly under the facts that he hypothesized, that the judge would say you don't need an arrest warrant in this situation? You can ask the defendant's attorney to bring the defendant in and surrender."
2016.16-369,1,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1670.975,1671.325,Sure.
2016.16-369,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1672.98,1678.465,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feldman."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,1678.465,1711.735,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If the Court reaches the constitutional issue in the case, we believe that the Court should adopt the following standard: Where a government official takes action that foreseeably creates a need for the use of force and results in that use of force, Graham Scott balancing should be applied to determine whether that action is objectively unreasonable. And we are not, as Petitioners' counsel suggested, suggesting to this Court that it adopt a new breed of a constitutional tort."
2016.16-369,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1725.62,1727.09,Can you repeat that standard?
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,1727.09,1760.62,"The standard that we suggest that this Court adopt is that where a government official takes action that foreseeably creates a need for the use of force and results in that use of force, Graham Scott balancing should be applied to determine whether that action is objectively unreasonable. Under Graham and Scott, courts would, of course, consider the governmental interest at stake, the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests, and the relative culpability of those affected by the decision."
2016.16-369,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1760.62,1776.99,"Are you defending the Ninth Circuit's statement at page 22A of the Petition Appendix? ""Here the District Court held that, because the officers violated the Fourth Amendment by searching the shack without a warrant, which proximately caused the plaintiff's injuries, liability was proper."""
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,1776.99,1781.11,That is an appropriate way to find liability in this case.
2016.16-369,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1781.11,1785.63,I -- I just don't see the proximate cause between failure to get the warrant and what happened here.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,1785.63,1788.315,"Well, there were two proximate causes here."
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1806.17,1807.36,"Well, not the second one."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,1815.96,1817.04,That's right.
2016.16-369,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1867.08,1869.18,That's -- that was a different context.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,1961.37,1982.03,"I wouldn't agree that it's anomalous, but I also think that, at least in this case, unlike in Sheehan, the Court doesn't have to decide whether objectively unreasonable behavior alone is enough because we also happen to have an unlawful entry, which wasn't present in the Sheehan case. When the officers entered, they were no different than trespassers."
2016.16-369,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1982.74,1985.53,"Well, but that's a different way of looking at the situation."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2009.37,2015.385,"Let me give you a few examples, Justice Alito, of why it's important to focus on the predicate conduct."
2016.16-369,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2037.67,2039.455,"Well, it may very well be a seizure."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2046.53,2046.97,It -- it --
2016.16-369,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2046.97,2058.66,"And that would be the situation in the hypothetical that Justice Sotomayor mentioned, which was presented in your brief, where the police officer jumps in front of a car and doesn't allow the driver enough time to stop."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2071.745,2081.695,And there's nothing wrong with that approach either in the Kentucky v. King argument. I think Justice Kagan referred to that as the holistic unreasonableness approach.
2016.16-369,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2105.14,2108.84,But the Fourth Amendment doesn't prohibit unreasonable interactions.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2126.895,2140.235,"Well, in the examples that we've given where the police officer goes into someone's home in the middle of the night or stands outside someone's home brandishing weapons or jumps out of a car brandishing weapons, that's the beginning of the interaction."
2016.16-369,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2179.605,2185.59,"So how? How is that? That is, what I think the argument on the other side is in response, I was looking saying look holistically."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2189.445,2189.81,Right.
2016.16-369,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2189.81,2195.22,"The question is, would any reasonable person think that that was unreasonable? Now, we break it down."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2224.325,2224.67,Right.
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2249.88,2250.14,I don't see --
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2250.14,2250.7,-- for harm to occur.
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2250.7,2260.835,"I don't see you say if you take away one that -- if you take away the failure to get the -- the search warrant, the -- the harm still occurs."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2260.835,2261.34,Right.
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2262.13,2267.215,So -- so why do you look at that as the basis for 1983 liability?
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2267.215,2282.07,"Because what they're doing, Mr. Chief Justice, is they are changing the legality of the conduct, but they are not changing the conduct. When you change the legality of the conduct, but you don't change the conduct, of course this --"
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2282.07,2285.71,"Well, then it's not -- it's -- it's -- and this, I think, is the argument on the other side."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2302.975,2308.18,The conduct is what we use to define proximate cause.
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2308.18,2308.545,Okay.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2308.545,2309.43,The entry --
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2309.43,2309.85,Right.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2309.85,2312.14,-- or the entry without notice.
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2312.14,2312.39,Right.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2312.39,2316.28,That either did or did not proximately cause the harm.
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2316.28,2316.75,Right.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2316.75,2319.58,It has to be illegal.
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2319.58,2326.645,But -- but then why are we talking about the failure to get a search warrant? Why -- why did that make a difference?
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2326.645,2335.55,It made a difference in this case because it is what makes the conduct of the police officers unconstitutional.
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2335.55,2338.47,That does not proximately cause --
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2338.47,2343.27,"Well, the conduct of the officers proximately caused the injury."
2016.16-369,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2343.27,2347.36,"I guess I'm not understanding, Mr. Feldman, why you're quite making this distinction."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2358.48,2358.74,Right.
2016.16-369,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2358.74,2380.81,"Now the question is, is it a but -- is it a proximate cause of the inquiry? And it -- and it seems to me that you have to make a case -- and tell me if you agree or don't agree: You have to make a case that unauthorized entry, that one of the -- one of the things that foreseeably can happen with an unauthorized entry is that the person whose home it is will react with violence."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2380.81,2383.9,"I agree with you completely. And, of course --"
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2383.9,2384.23,Well --
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2384.23,2389.06,-- the foreseeability issue was the issue that was extensively litigated in the trial courts.
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2389.06,2399.31,"Well, but I don't see how you can agree -- I don't think it's -- addresses at least my concern, which -- why and in what way did the failure to get a warrant cause everything that followed?"
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2399.31,2402.44,It was the entry that caused --
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2402.44,2404.09,It was the entry. I'm with you there.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2404.09,2404.16,Yeah.
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2404.16,2410.41,I understand that. But the failure to get a warrant did not cause the entry.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2410.41,2427.915,"As I understand courts' applying proximate cause analysis, we begin with the conduct and we ask ourselves, did that conduct directly -- that's the proximate cause issue -- did that conduct directly lead to the harm?"
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2427.915,2428.58,Right.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2428.58,2433.81,"If we answer that question yes, we then look at whether that conduct was illegal."
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2433.81,2433.98,Okay.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2447.775,2454.28,The -- the entry -- I apologize.
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2456.06,2457.59,"Well, I'm asking the same thing over and over again."
2016.16-369,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2457.59,2457.92,Can I say this --
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2457.92,2458.11,-- same thing --
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2458.11,2473.325,"But I guess maybe I just -- you -- you -- as I understand your theory, the failure to get a warrant caused -- that's why we call it a provocation, I guess -- caused the -- the entry which caused the -- the confrontation; is that right?"
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2473.325,2477.55,I wouldn't say that the failure to get a warrant caused the entry.
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2478.48,2478.57,Right.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2478.57,2481.58,-- decision to enter is what caused the entry.
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2481.58,2481.82,Exactly.
2016.16-369,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2484.79,2501.78,"Well, can I suggest why it might matter? I mean, there are two kinds of entry: One is -- let's -- for these purposes, one is an authorized entry and one is an unauthorized entry. Now the question is, what kind of conduct does each of those kinds of entries provoke? If you're an authorized entry, you don't really think that it's going to provoke violence."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2506.32,2506.5,Well --
2016.16-369,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2506.5,2513.39,-- proximate cause -- the -- the proximate results of each of those two different kinds of entry are very different.
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2513.39,2518.15,"Counsel, if I could interrupt you to ask a question. (Laughter.)"
2016.16-369,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2518.15,2530.5,"Why is it that whether it's authorized or not, you don't think it's going to prompt violence? The fact that you have a search warrant, you may have a search warrant, say, I've got to execute a search warrant to pick up this armed and dangerous felon; you may still think that's going to prompt violence."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2550.204,2556.64,"If the officers don't have a warrant and they enter, they are trespassers."
2016.16-369,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2560.885,2563.77,"Well, let me give you two situations."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2609.565,2618.915,"I would agree, Your Honor, that in those circumstances, it would not be more likely that there would be violence in one situation or the other."
2016.16-369,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2618.915,2621.72,"Well, then, then I don't see where there's proximate cause."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2621.72,2632.435,"Well, the proximate cause comes from the two things that the officers did that led directly and foreseeably to the confrontation and the violent confrontation with the homeowners."
2016.16-369,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2642.93,2650.05,"You're making a presumption there that I think you have to address, which is, yes, they entered without a warrant."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2685.6,2695.42,"Well, let me start by clarifying that the courts below did, in fact, address the full panoply of exceptions to the warrant clause."
2016.16-369,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2695.42,2698.66,So we're assuming that the entry was unlawful.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2700.75,2701.485,Correct.
2016.16-369,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2701.485,2701.77,Yeah.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2751.74,2752.15,Right.
2016.16-369,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2752.15,2754.37,It's not justified for them to attack the police.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2755.08,2756.38,They know that they're police officers --
2016.16-369,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2756.38,2764.24,"""You know, I know -- I know you're a police officer, but I don't think you really have an exception to the warrant requirement, so I'm going to shoot you."" They can't do that, can they?"
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2764.24,2765.02,No.
2016.16-369,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2765.02,2765.91,So --
2016.16-369,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2765.91,2774.44,"Mr. Feldman, you said there are two kinds of entrance; right? One is a trespasser entrant, and one is a nontrespasser entrant."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2774.44,2774.965,Right.
2016.16-369,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2774.965,2777.685,"A guest entrant, let's call the person; right?"
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2777.685,2778.14,Right.
2016.16-369,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2778.14,2784.485,"And when a trespasser enters your home, different sets of things foreseeably happen --"
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2784.485,2785.175,Correct.
2016.16-369,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2785.175,2786.935,-- than when a guest enters your home.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2786.935,2787.655,Correct.
2016.16-369,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2787.655,2794.0,"So it's not just an entry. The question is, who's entering: a trespasser or a guest?"
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2794.0,2794.765,Correct.
2016.16-369,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2821.025,2822.35,"But -- but here, wait, wait."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2825.215,2825.37,Uh-huh.
2016.16-369,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2825.37,2827.535,And don't answer it if it's a red herring.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2869.425,2873.57,It absolutely does make a difference to the result.
2016.16-369,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2873.57,2875.064,Because?
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2875.064,2879.855,Because the legal principles that apply in those circumstances are different.
2016.16-369,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2903.19,2907.495,"What -- just thinking, you know, we want policemen to protect themselves."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2923.785,2924.37,Correct.
2016.16-369,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2924.92,2933.91,"That's, I think, what your argument is in respect to the warrant, if not the knock and announce, you can't deal with that anymore."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,2949.12,2954.48,"Well, in a sense that's the Petitioners' test, but -- but not quite."
2016.16-369,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3082.9,3086.89,Let's go to that superseding cause document.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,3114.77,3115.495,Correct.
2016.16-369,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3115.495,3116.14,All right.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,3146.56,3164.225,The difference is culpability. The test that we have proposed for superseding cause allows police officers to avoid liability if they can show either that the intervening act was unforeseeable or culpable.
2016.16-369,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3166.85,3168.88,"This is standard tort law, right?"
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,3168.88,3170.115,"Yes, it is."
2016.16-369,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3206.96,3213.7,"Well, why wasn't there -- what was the super -- why wasn't there superseding cause here after the failure to get the warrant?"
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,3213.7,3215.83,There was no superseding cause --
2016.16-369,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3215.83,3229.05,"You -- you -- my understanding of your argument is you have not -- that you are defending the Ninth Circuit's holding that because the officers violated the Fourth Amendment by searching the house without a warrant, that was the proximate cause, you're defending that."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,3229.05,3231.69,I believe that is a correct holding.
2016.16-369,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3231.69,3235.275,I -- I think that's a difficult position to defend.
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,3235.275,3241.315,"Well, had it not been for the entry, there would not have been any shooting."
2016.16-369,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3270.12,3281.715,"Well, I -- I think that's the correct way to argue the case, and based on that, then we can have our discussion as to whether or not it -- the -- it was indeed proximate."
2016.16-369,2,34440,leonard_feldman,,3281.715,3310.175,"Thank you.
