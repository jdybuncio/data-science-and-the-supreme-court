1993.93-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.007,"We'll hear argument now in Number 93-489, O'Melveny & Myers v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation."
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,9.006,12.359,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,116.449,131.22,"Mr. Lee, you don't challenge, I take it, the Ninth Circuit's view that a law firm in this situation is under a duty of inquiry when it prepares a private prospectus like this?"
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,131.22,136.813,"We do challenge it, Mr. Chief Justice, but it's not one of the issues... we think they erred as a matter of California law in deciding that."
1993.93-489,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,136.813,138.463,But you're not asking us to--
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,138.463,138.984,That is correct.
1993.93-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.525,146.176,--And you are satisfied that California law is what governs in this case?
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,146.176,146.907,--That's the issue.
1993.93-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.579,151.331,But if any State law governs--
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,151.331,152.17,"--Oh, yes, that is correct."
1993.93-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,152.17,152.611,--it's California.
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,152.611,153.302,That is correct.
1993.93-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,153.302,158.304,"It is the law of California, and do we know what the law of California is on the imputation defense?"
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,158.304,159.015,I certainly do.
1993.93-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.959,164.111,What about the Ninth Circuit--
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,164.499,164.799,Excuse me.
1993.93-489,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.799,173.825,"--There are very few cases on this imputation defense, and it doesn't seem all that clear to me what the California law might be in any event."
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,173.825,176.776,"There are enough, Justice O'Connor, and I would refer you simply to four."
1993.93-489,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,180.7,181.599,Mr. Lee--
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,181.599,182.03,Yes.
1993.93-489,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.03,198.112,"--would you tell us preliminarily whether the Ninth Circuit made any determination of the content of California law, because if it did not, perhaps it might on remand and a conflict would be unnecessary."
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,205.775,229.761,"Well, the case certainly could be decided on the ground that under Federal common law as it existed... and we discussed this briefly in our reply brief... as it existed prior to Erie v. Tompkins, we think we would win this case, but the clearer... the ground on which certiorari was granted, and I think the clearer and the easier way to decide the case, is to decide the issue of State law."
1993.93-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.746,292.994,"Mr. Lee, why should... assuming that they did rely on Federal law, why shouldn't we give them the job of... I mean, we have enough trouble figuring out what Federal law is."
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,300.769,302.529,"That would be a possibility, Justice Scalia."
1993.93-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.529,303.881,"It's what we normally would do, isn't it?"
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,303.881,307.615,"That would be a possibility, and in the usual case, that is what you normally do."
1993.93-489,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,361.911,369.234,"Mr. Lee, can you give us instances in which this Court functions as a court of first view, which is essentially what you're asking us to do?"
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,379.612,385.836,"--There are cases that are cited in the last couple of pages of our reply brief, Justice Ginsburg, in which this Court has done that."
1993.93-489,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.865,413.175,California have a certification proceeding?
1993.93-489,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,413.175,414.166,"They do not, unfortunately."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1184.751,1188.103,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1295.885,1299.698,The FDIC isn't claiming the benefit of the bargain on the land.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1303.462,1311.596,"--The expenses of floating this scheme, and then having to withdraw it, and those expenses were considerable."
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.91,1318.272,To whom would they have brought this information?
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1320.262,1323.915,--In the first place to the directors and officers of the bank.
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1323.915,1325.126,Who already knew about it.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1325.126,1335.162,"Yes, they already knew about it, but to have the law firm bring it to their attention might have stopped them from going forward with the scheme, but more importantly, they shouldn't have signed on to the PPM."
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1336.444,1341.976,"Well, that might be a... you know, a dishonorable thing to do, but I don't see how there's any causality here."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1344.448,1350.402,--Because the law firm certification is necessary for shares in this partnership to be sold.
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.672,1367.085,"--If the investors were suing, it would be a different matter, but they've already been made whole."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1367.085,1373.52,"Right, but the bank is suing, and the bank is suing... the FDIC is suing in place of the bank, and that's the point I wanted to make."
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1375.593,1398.717,"Well, Mr. Bender, before you get to the FDIC's position, isn't it true that so far as California law is concerned... leaving aside the California law that determines what defenses will be recognized, isn't it true that under California law, so far as the injury that the FDIC is trying to recover for, there's but-for causation in the law firm's failure, but there's not proximate causation, isn't that correct?"
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1398.717,1399.787,"--No, I don't think that's correct."
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1403.249,1405.562,Let me ask you a further question anyway.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1419.513,1419.813,Yes.
1993.93-489,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1459.789,1469.746,So you do say that there has to be an underlying Federal rule determining the scope of duties of the counsel to its insured institution.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1469.746,1472.707,"No, not the scope of duties, and not the rule of negligence."
1993.93-489,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1481.223,1490.139,"But I'm not sure what the source of law is for you to prevail if, as Justice Souter said, there's no proximate causation under the law of California."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1490.139,1499.015,"Because under the law of California there's a duty to the bank, and under the law of California, the allegation is that the petitioner was negligent."
1993.93-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1511.242,1515.384,"Well, you're just really picking whatever favors the Government out of California law, then."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1530.094,1533.266,It's not whatever favors the Government in some proprietary sense.
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1559.382,1574.072,"--Yes, but the Government is always presumably acting on behalf of citizens, and it seems to me that by substituting whatever furthers the interest disclosed by the statute for whatever favors the Federal Government really isn't a substitution at all."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1586.01,1594.745,"No, it's not whatever gets us the greatest recovery, it's whatever adequately provides for compensation for the harm done to the Federal Deposit Insurance--"
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1594.745,1599.811,"Well, you never want to recover more than 100 percent, so once again, I don't see the distinction that you're making."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1599.811,1601.3,--It's the harm done to the fund.
1993.93-489,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1633.36,1638.605,But then it seems to me that you should be proceeding under something other than 12 U.S.C. 1821.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1638.605,1640.176,"Why is that, Justice Kennedy?"
1993.93-489,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1640.176,1651.883,"Because your whole hypothesis is that you are succeeding to a cause of action that exists under the State law, and under Justice Souter's hypothetical question, that isn't true, and you say you prevail anyway--"
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1651.883,1652.604,No--
1993.93-489,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1652.604,1662.121,"--and it seems to me that what you're doing is basing a substantive right of recovery, one which formulates the duty of the professional, as a matter of Federal law."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1666.465,1677.471,"--Well, Federal law initially applies, but as this Court knows, the presumption is that in cases involving the FDIC we will use State law as long as the State law adequately protects the Federal interest."
1993.93-489,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1677.471,1693.553,"Mr. Bender, would you clarify, because Justice Kennedy's question raised a point that I didn't think you were contesting, that the claim initially... the claim for negligence against the law firm arises under State law, is that not so?"
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1693.553,1697.065,It's almost metaphysical.
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.555,1716.548,Why do you allow the State to insist on negligence?
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1724.174,1731.627,--Because I think the presumption of the Federal scheme here is that professionals who work for a federally insured bank shouldn't be absolutely liable.
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.609,1732.987,Why make that presumption?
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1736.13,1736.69,--Because it would be--
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1736.69,1744.326,"The presumption is that the normal responsibilities which existed before the FDIC took over continue afterwards, and that nothing changes simply because the Government steps in."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1747.569,1748.899,--And we don't challenge that.
1993.93-489,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1762.568,1769.952,"But you borrow... even the initial claim, it's just the Federal law picking up the State law, even though this is successor liability."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1775.075,1778.177,"But it's the bank's claim, it's not the stockholders' claim."
1993.93-489,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1779.729,1782.271,"But if the bank had a claim, it was under California law--"
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1782.271,1783.23,Right.
1993.93-489,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1783.23,1797.411,"--not under Federal law, but you say that claim that the bank had then gets transformed into a Federal claim and if the State law continues to apply it's only by grace of the Federal law."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1797.411,1809.228,"And if State law totally eliminated the bank's claim in this situation, that might raise a federalism problem, and Federal law might have to come in and say that that's not sufficient to protect the Federal interest."
1993.93-489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1843.461,1849.214,"Well, what is the State law with regard to the imputation defense in these circumstances?"
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1849.214,1851.685,"It's not entirely clear, Justice O'Connor."
1993.93-489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1869.938,1872.689,"Well then, why do we need a Federal rule?"
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1872.689,1876.493,You need a Federal rule in case State law should hold otherwise.
1993.93-489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1876.493,1883.677,"Well, wouldn't you think normally the court would determine what the State law is before deciding such a question?"
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1883.677,1888.66,"In this case, the Ninth Circuit divided the issue in an interesting way."
1993.93-489,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1913.476,1915.118,"Well, maybe we should just send it back."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1915.118,1929.897,"--Well, I don't think you should, and the reason we acquiesced in certiorari here is because the defense that was raised by the petitioners in the district court and in the court of appeals is one which if it were viable would be a very important defense."
1993.93-489,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1950.892,1957.744,"Mr. Bender, this goes back to a question that was raised in the course of Mr. Lee's argument, is this conflict really necessary?"
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,1968.922,1981.149,"--The reason for resolution is because that issue is raised... there are many, many of these lawsuits involving over $1 billion in asserted liability that are brought by the FDIC all around the country."
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2018.886,2019.684,Of course.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2024.149,2025.27,--It's worse than that.
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.664,2064.094,Why is that unique to the Federal Government situation?
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2065.666,2069.608,"--I think it is, and therefore we think that California would hold the same way."
1993.93-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.608,2072.719,"Why isn't it State law, then, rather than Federal law?"
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2072.719,2075.841,"Well, it's Federal law if the State law doesn't provide that."
1993.93-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2075.841,2079.804,"I know, but that's just grabbing whatever is best for the Government."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2079.804,2086.119,"No, it's not grabbing what's best for the Government, Chief Justice Rehnquist, it's establishing a minimum base of Federal law that's necessary."
1993.93-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2086.119,2099.076,"But it seems to me your arguments, as Justice Scalia suggest, don't show why the Federal Government here is in any different position than anyone else who might have been hurt by this sort of transaction."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2099.076,2101.84,"I agree with that, that the Federal Government is in the--"
1993.93-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2101.84,2104.222,Why should there be a special rule for the Federal Government?
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2104.222,2110.446,"--There should be a special rule if a State, as petitioners argue here, were to depart from that rule."
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2116.76,2125.574,But your argument seems to me simply to boil down to the fact that there ought to be a Federal common law rule whenever the State common law rule isn't good enough.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2125.574,2127.517,--Isn't adequate to protect the Federal interest.
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2147.519,2153.212,"Well, what is there intrinsic in your argument that addresses the need for a common law rule as distinct from the need to amend the statute?"
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2153.212,2163.881,"--The statute was written, we believe, in light of the background that this Federal common law necessary to preserve the Federal interest would be available."
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2165.15,2165.942,How do we know that?
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2165.942,2167.322,--The Federal--
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2167.322,2172.345,"I mean, it seems to me the rabbit is coming out of the hat, but I mean, you put the rabbit in the hat."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2173.766,2177.579,"--Well, the question is... the statute I take it you're referring to is FIRREA in 1989."
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2177.579,2177.999,Yes.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2177.999,2188.946,"The question is, assuming that there was... and we think it's clear that prior to that time there was this minimum base of Federal common law necessary to preserve the interests of the Federal program."
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2198.913,2211.232,"But nobody could identify that common law, nobody could identify that debt until we first apply the statute and find some deficiency in the statute, and then we say, aha, there must have been the bed of common law that was assumed to prevent this unfortunate result."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2211.232,2212.23,"No, I don't think so, Justice Souter."
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2212.23,2216.534,You've got to be able to discover it some way other than in order to chink up whatever's wrong in your case.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2216.534,2225.46,"I don't think so, because I don't think the statute purports to be a total package of what the Federal Government's rights are, nor does petitioner."
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2252.188,2261.364,"But I don't know why that isn't a good argument simply for concluding that the Feds take the common law as it was, including the common law defenses, and you take the bitter with the sweet."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2261.364,2264.746,"Well, because that's not what the Court has held over the years, and I think it would be wrong to hold that."
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.352,2276.424,"Let's talk about D'Oench, Duhme."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2292.534,2293.275,--Right.
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2293.275,2300.58,"And the legislation at issue in that case was undoubtedly enacted on the assumption that Federal courts applied Federal law, period."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2307.313,2307.583,Right.
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2307.583,2314.119,--and I don't think Congress when it passes a statute like this assumes that there's some brooding Federal law that governs all of this stuff.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2314.119,2319.902,"Well, they assume that there's a body of common law that is going to be applicable and available to the FDIC."
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2319.902,2327.138,"Oh, I think they assume there's a body of State common law, State by State, and that the rights of parties on financial transactions are going to be determined by State law."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2327.138,2332.061,Even when State law would mean that the Federal interest was not adequately protected.
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2332.061,2334.0,Which is why they have exceptions in there.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2340.414,2352.543,"Then the question in this case is whether you can assume that Congress, in passing FIRREA, meant to say, all defenses that the State would provide are available, except those we specifically exclude here."
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2352.543,2353.575,Why shouldn't we assume that?
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2353.575,2357.098,You shouldn't assume that because I don't think that was Congress' purpose in passing it.
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2388.096,2388.987,But not at all costs.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2396.071,2398.354,But there's no... there's no significant cost here.
1993.93-489,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2417.806,2428.725,"Was there any attempt, Mr. Bender, in the district court to determine whether that was indeed the content of California law, so you don't need to... you don't need to displace California law?"
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2434.72,2435.501,--No.
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2472.934,2483.76,"Mr. Bender, you said a second ago that the point here is to prevent the defense from being used against someone against whom under State law it couldn't have been used."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2499.121,2501.572,I think you have to see it in time sequence.
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2540.517,2545.711,"So you're saying the claim is... the relevant claim is the depositors' claim, not the bank."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2545.711,2546.251,Exactly.
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2589.849,2591.701,--things that they already know.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2592.691,2595.373,"--But Justice Scalia, it's not just the directors."
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2601.367,2601.878,Whatever.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2604.659,2605.18,"--No, no."
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2632.679,2640.934,"The duty is the same, it's just that people who didn't used to be able to sue for the violation of that duty can now sue for the violation of that duty."
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2642.764,2644.126,I wouldn't concede that they didn't used to be able to sue.
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2647.127,2647.548,The bank?
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2647.548,2647.959,--The bank.
1993.93-489,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.459,2650.41,I'm not talking about the creditors.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2654.622,2657.364,--The bank is the creditors when the bank becomes insolvent.
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2769.286,2778.012,"--Mr. Bender, was it in FIRREA that they specifically provided for directors' liability in certain cases where the liability might have been doubtful under State law?"
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2778.012,2778.894,Yes.
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2778.894,2789.301,Isn't that a pretty good reason to assume that Congress did it's picking and choosing when it decided the extent to which State common law might need to be modified to protect the Federal interest?
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2789.301,2796.184,"No, because I don't think FIRREA... FIRREA added administrative claims against directors or administrative penalties, but that's different from--"
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2796.184,2811.354,"Well, didn't it do it... I may be wrong on this, but didn't it do it at least on an arguably more... on a standard of liability that was arguably more onerous to the directors than any standard of liability at common law that would have sufficed for recovery?"
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2811.354,2812.876,--For those administrative penalties.
1993.93-489,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2812.876,2813.177,Yes.
1993.93-489,1,37685,paul_bender,,2813.177,2820.851,"But that did not supplant the State common law, the Federal common law which will absorb the State common law, of directors' liability for negligence."
1993.93-489,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2849.459,2850.25,"Thank you, Mr. Bender."
1993.93-489,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2852.702,2859.677,We're told that Federal common law is necessary in order to vindicate the Federal interest.
1993.93-489,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.134,2884.822,"May I ask you, Mr. Lee, on 1821, do your California cases address the question whether this defense would be available if the suit had been brought by a depositor as opposed to the bank?"
1993.93-489,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2884.822,2890.616,"I think not, but let me address that right now, because--"
1993.93-489,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2890.616,2895.741,Then is it not fair to say that the State law is unclear on the precise issue that we have before us?
1993.93-489,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2895.741,2903.115,"--No, because the precise issue of the depositors is not before this Court, and I... that's one of the most important things that I need to clarify in this rebuttal."
1993.93-489,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2903.115,2916.384,"We wouldn't have this suit, I suppose, if the provision read that FDIC shall acquire all rights of the depositors, as opposed to saying, all rights of the bank."
1993.93-489,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2916.384,2920.355,"Of course, and you don't even turn to State law because the Federal statute is--"
1993.93-489,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2920.355,2929.191,"Doesn't the statute say precisely that, it succeeds to all rights, titles, powers, and so forth, of the institution, and of any stockholder, member, account-holder, depositor, and so forth?"
1993.93-489,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,2929.191,2933.825,"--Yes, but on the second issue of the standing in the shoes, it deals with that expressly and on its own."
1993.93-489,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3141.881,3142.441,Mr. Lee--
1993.93-489,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3142.441,3142.782,--Yes.
1993.93-489,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3142.782,3144.942,"--I mean, there's always to some extent mixing and matching."
1993.93-489,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3153.126,3153.787,Exactly.
1993.93-489,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3153.787,3154.849,There's always some mixing and matching.
1993.93-489,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3154.849,3156.739,"Exactly, and we don't object to that."
