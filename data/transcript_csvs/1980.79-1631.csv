1980.79-1631,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.092,We'll hear argument next in Democratic Party of the United States v. La Follette.
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,112.641,119.715,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,181.957,202.199,"Mr. Eastman, I take it we have to deal here with the Article II, Section 1 provision, each state shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof shall direct a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled."
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,227.267,233.765,I think the... I don't believe they could do that.
1980.79-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,234.342,235.358,"Well, why don't you believe they could do that?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,235.358,238.247,"--Well I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the question--"
1980.79-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,238.247,238.809,It's a--
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,238.809,246.712,"--the question is not who the electors would be in the electoral college; the question is, who will be the delegates to the Democratic National Convention."
1980.79-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.375,296.52,"--The statute speaks in terms of appoint, not regulate the selection of... well, what if the state just decided to dispense with any sort of intervening elections or caucuses or anything else and said, we hereby appoint John Doe, Richard Roe, et cetera, as Wisconsin's elector to the electoral college in December, 1980?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,296.52,308.953,Well I had a sense that there are a number of decisions of this Court that would probably preclude that.
1980.79-1631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,311.185,315.31,"Well as far as the Constitution goes, the state could do precisely that, couldn't it?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,315.31,320.026,"--I think as far as the Constitution's literal language, that's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.79-1631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,320.026,329.07,And just sort of be completely oblivious to the Republican and Democratic conventions and to their nominees.
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,329.07,332.943,"That might be possible, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.79-1631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,333.459,334.271,As far as the Constitution goes.
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,334.271,334.709,--That's correct.
1980.79-1631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,334.709,337.302,"Because the state hasn't done anything like that, has it?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,337.302,338.098,"Well I think that's correct, absolutely."
1980.79-1631,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,359.464,367.289,But for purposes of your case you can concede that the state could do what Mr. Justice Rehnquist has suggested.
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,373.286,375.646,"I thought I did, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,406.321,420.737,"But certainly an act of the Wisconsin legislature that just named certain electors would likewise have all the objections to which you pose to the Wisconsin open primary law, would it not?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,420.737,432.077,"I don't think it would, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because it wouldn't be dictating to the democratic party how it conducted its convention and which delegates it selected."
1980.79-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,436.217,438.653,"It would be dictating to both parties, it would be dictating to both parties, in effect."
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,438.653,454.507,"It wouldn't be dictating how they selected their nominees because as far as Wisconsin's nominees were selected... as far as the state of Wisconsin was concerned the nomination of the major parties would be irrelevant, under your hypothesis."
1980.79-1631,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,454.507,458.943,"Mr. Eastman, how many states do you know have open primaries today?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,458.943,466.564,"There are only two, Mr. Justice Blackmun; the state of Wisconsin and the state of Michigan."
1980.79-1631,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,492.257,505.517,"Well does your proposal... what does your proposal involve; someone declares his party affiliation as he comes into the polling place, is that sufficient?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,505.517,507.594,That's sufficient under the national rule.
1980.79-1631,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,513.044,519.715,"And then what do you do, hand him a democratic ballot, or a republican whatever-it-is that he declares?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,519.715,526.665,"The details of voting are left to the state party and to state law, and it varies from state to state."
1980.79-1631,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,541.424,543.111,So that he can't cross over in the--
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,543.111,544.205,No.
1980.79-1631,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,544.205,548.89,"--If it's machine voting, he might cross over after he gets into the cubicle."
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,548.89,549.405,No.
1980.79-1631,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,554.387,556.793,And then... such as separate voting machines for each party?
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,556.793,561.901,"--Separate voting machines or blocking off the republican and independent lines, or whatever third party--"
1980.79-1631,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,561.901,562.946,As each voter comes in?
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,562.946,564.04,--That's correct.
1980.79-1631,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,571.647,573.35,"No, but you're making substantial detail."
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,589.732,594.45,"--It's simpler, but there are numerous states that have closed primaries."
1980.79-1631,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,598.277,604.976,"Well that's on the theory that the primary is a substitute for the party convention, historically, is it not?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,604.976,608.21,--I think that's generally the correct history--
1980.79-1631,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,608.21,612.115,Quasi-private or quasi-public.
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,616.628,619.205,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,630.747,640.587,"Mr. Eastman, do you contend the Wisconsin statute is unconstitutional, or merely that the national party need not seat delegates selected pursuant to the Wisconsin statute?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,640.587,646.397,"Mr. Justice Stevens, I think the latter is closer to our position."
1980.79-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,647.054,648.662,"That's what I understand it to be, and if so, is it a proper appeal?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,648.662,663.017,"--I think it's a proper appeal because the Wisconsin statute, as applied by the Wisconsin Supreme Court and, I think, the Wisconsin Supreme Court's order was faithful to the statute's requirements, not an opinion, but the order."
1980.79-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,663.017,663.64,I see.
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,663.64,666.295,I think that the statute as applied to the Democratic party is unconstitutional.
1980.79-1631,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,666.295,669.747,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, counsel."
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,690.457,692.801,"Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court:"
1980.79-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,741.437,751.261,What do you think the Supreme Court of Wisconsin would have done had the national party failed to comply?
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,754.495,757.041,I believe so.
1980.79-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,789.636,793.446,"Mr. Eastman, may I pursue that subject a moment?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,803.599,804.412,That's correct.
1980.79-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,804.412,806.661,And the National Committee went ahead and seated the delegates anyway.
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,806.661,809.644,"It did so, Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,809.644,812.783,Does the National Committee really have much interest in the issue?
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,821.295,824.559,"I don't think that's correct, Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,857.265,857.874,"Right, yes."
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,861.528,865.761,It's... we contend that the Wisconsin statute is unconstitutional--
1980.79-1631,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,865.761,872.149,"Well, if you're ordered to comply with it, suppose... if you're ordered to comply with it, now we covered that before lunch, that's unconstitutional under your view."
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,879.006,882.615,--There would be nothing unconstitutional about that sort of statute.
1980.79-1631,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,882.615,886.629,"Well why... tell me why the case isn't moot, then?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,903.012,923.629,"The case is not moot, Justice White, because one, the Wisconsin order was not limited to the 1980 convention; the order has continuing effect and would continue to require the Democratic Party in the 1984 convention to seek delegates selected in accordance with the open primary."
1980.79-1631,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,923.629,924.347,I see.
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,925.769,926.393,Sir?
1980.79-1631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,926.393,928.299,"Do you know where the order is, in the--"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,928.299,933.499,"Yes, the order is in the appendix to the jurisdictional statement at page 42(a)."
1980.79-1631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,933.499,934.515,--Thank you.
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,935.811,939.997,"Blue, and thick; it's the thick blue."
1980.79-1631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,939.997,943.668,42(a)?
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,943.668,944.541,Yes.
1980.79-1631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,944.541,946.963,But not over 30 pages.
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,946.963,951.274,It's the appendix to the jurisdictional statement.
1980.79-1631,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,951.274,963.145,"Mr. Eastman, isn't it a little unseemly that the state party of your own party is on the other side of the counsel table here?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,963.145,970.611,"As you know, the Democratic Party is not always of one mind on many of the issues that it confronts."
1980.79-1631,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,970.611,973.452,I suppose that's the only obvious answer you could give.
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,975.889,979.154,"It is not a monolith, for good or for ill."
1980.79-1631,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,979.154,986.62,"But it does demonstrate, that they are content with the Wisconsin statute and system?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,986.62,989.447,The state party is content with the system.
1980.79-1631,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1019.559,1027.963,Are they open to the risk that the National Convention might decline to seat the delegation that is so selected?
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1027.963,1031.336,"There is that risk, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1631,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1055.935,1059.074,Wouldn't it be rare for delegates not to be seated?
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1059.074,1069.118,--It's rare for delegates not to be seated when the selection process otherwise complied with all the National Party's rules for selecting the delegates.
1980.79-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1069.118,1080.114,"Well, if you're not attacking the statute on its face, so to speak, why isn't this case moot?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1080.114,1098.621,"The case is not moot because the Wisconsin Court's order, which I think faithfully reflects the Wisconsin statute as applied to the Democratic party, continues to require the Democratic party to seat delegates from Wisconsin that are selected in part by non-Democrats."
1980.79-1631,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.621,1100.839,Well it just says the presidential preference primary.
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1108.242,1119.768,"I interpret that as being generic and in any event, as I said, the order itself is consistent with the Wisconsin statute which requires the National--"
1980.79-1631,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1119.768,1127.063,"I don't know why you don't... I don't know why you back off from saying your claim is that the statute, that the open primary is unconstitutional."
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1127.063,1131.514,"--I didn't... if I appeared to back off it, I didn't mean to, Mr. Justice White."
1980.79-1631,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1133.357,1137.495,Well I thought you just said that except for this order there's nothing wrong with an open primary statute.
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1137.495,1139.527,--I hope I didn't say that.
1980.79-1631,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1140.386,1140.697,It was--
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1140.697,1151.366,"--there's nothing wrong with an open primary statute as applied to another political party, specifically, for example, the Republican party which has no objection to a... an open primary."
1980.79-1631,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1151.366,1157.082,--So you are saying this statute is unconstitutional in the face of a contrary party rule?
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1157.082,1157.909,Exactly.
1980.79-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1157.909,1180.056,"Well why can't the Democrats simply set up their own machinery for choosing delegates in Wisconsin and outside of the state system and in full compliance with the National Democratic standards and send them to the Democratic National committee, then?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1180.056,1185.523,"Justice Rehnquist, the Wisconsin Court did not leave us that option."
1980.79-1631,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1201.673,1212.294,And you said the Wisconsin... you say the Wisconsin Court has no jurisdiction whatever to tell the Democratic party what standard should be followed for seating delegates to its convention?
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1214.699,1220.915,"--The state has no power, because when, if it tries to do so, it violates the parties' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights."
1980.79-1631,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1220.915,1223.04,"It's made the final order here, though."
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1240.236,1240.626,"I believe that's quite different, Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1631,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1275.566,1290.871,"I think what your position must be, that the state of Wisconsin through its courts or legislature, has no more authority to tell the Democratic Party which delegates should be seated than it would with the Moose Lodge or the Knight's of Columbus?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1290.871,1295.729,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1295.729,1304.538,"Well but are you saying that the Democratic National Committee's action in various aspects is not ""state action""?"
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1304.538,1315.252,"The question of whether and under what circumstances the Democratic parties' action... state action is not presented by the case, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1631,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1315.252,1322.546,"In answer to the Chief Justice's question, you say it's just like the Moose Lodge or the Knights of Columbus, which clearly are private organizations."
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1328.857,1334.276,I think it is a private organization but this case is much different from the Moose Lodge case.
1980.79-1631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1335.056,1339.227,The point is that the state can't tell the Moose Lodge who to take as its members.
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1341.428,1341.631,"--That's correct, that's correct."
1980.79-1631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1347.006,1351.801,"And we had a case here in this Court, one of the parties to whom which was Moose Lodge, but that's quite different."
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1351.801,1352.847,That's right.
1980.79-1631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1352.847,1358.736,"The question there was whether the action of that organization was state action, that's quite a different question."
1980.79-1631,0,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,1367.044,1369.418,"That's right, Justice Marshall."
1980.79-1631,1,17632,bronson_c_la_follette,,1504.941,1508.986,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court:

1980.79-1631,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1767.568,1769.537,"Mr. La Follette, could I ask you just one sort of basic question?"
1980.79-1631,1,17632,bronson_c_la_follette,,1790.278,1828.717,"--This Court has recognized that states asserting authority under Article II of the Constitution have... are... have wide interests in regulating the conduct of primary elections and determining the qualification of voters in order to protect the integrity of the electoral process; Storer v. Brown, and most recently, Marchioro, are relevant on this point."
1980.79-1631,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1867.982,1871.449,It's no part of the constitutional electoral process?
1980.79-1631,1,17632,bronson_c_la_follette,,1871.449,1872.948,--It is no part of the constitutional electoral process.
1980.79-1631,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1913.104,1932.157,"Has it been known, Mr. Attorney General, or at least has it been thought and said that sometimes the opposing political party will enter the primary if an open primary is available, for purposes of confusing and embarrassing the opposition?"
1980.79-1631,1,17632,bronson_c_la_follette,,1932.157,1950.51,"Your Honor, the record which has been stipulated here contains all of the relevant studies and scholarly articles which relate to that question and they all conclude that there is no evidence of raiding in this case."
1980.79-1631,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1968.034,1977.827,"But what you're saying then, is that the Democratic National Convention meeting off in Memphis, Tennessee or in New York cannot have a different view of the matter?"

1980.79-1631,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1988.074,1991.119,What is the constitutional concern in a primary?
1980.79-1631,1,17632,bronson_c_la_follette,,1991.119,2023.824,"To maintain the integrity of the electoral process, Marchioro said, recognized that the important role that the parties play in the selection of national and state candidates grants significant authority in the states to regulate those elections in terms of all of the regulations that election laws presume, voter qualifications, to... in order to insure the integrity of that process."
1980.79-1631,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2034.336,2043.598,"Mr. Attorney General, isn't the real problem here that Wisconsin is extending its long-arm into the convention in another state?"
1980.79-1631,1,17632,bronson_c_la_follette,,2043.598,2048.737,"I'd like to address that question, Your Honor."

1980.79-1631,1,17632,bronson_c_la_follette,,2359.549,2362.626,It is a matter of disenfranchisement.

1980.79-1631,1,17632,bronson_c_la_follette,,2436.831,2439.673,I would say we have the right--

1980.79-1631,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2478.173,2486.248,"Well now, the choosing of electors is in the Constitution; there's nothing in there about political parties."
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2486.248,2488.481,"Well, it's up to the state to determine how--"
1980.79-1631,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2488.481,2489.606,"To choose their electors, yes."
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2489.606,2490.309,--to choose their electors.
1980.79-1631,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2534.868,2541.053,What about the states which begin this process at the precinct level with caucuses?
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2547.411,2550.143,"Yes, I would say that."
1980.79-1631,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2550.925,2563.561,That the state could regulate that the caucuses must take place between 7 o'clock and 10 o'clock in a home on the main street or something of that kind?
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2563.561,2568.261,The National Party is regulated as to when these primaries take place.

1980.79-1631,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2603.372,2605.574,Classic did not involve a Negro.
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2605.574,2607.652,"--I think, I think when--"

1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2609.729,2610.823,--Pardon?
1980.79-1631,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2610.823,2614.383,The U.S. against Classic did not involve a Negro.
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2614.383,2619.382,"Well, the White Primary cases and there's a generic statement, did involve blacks."
1980.79-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2753.998,2761.965,"But if you say that, Mr. Friebert, it seems to me that you haven't explained how you justify the injunction."
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2776.037,2788.063,I think the theory on which the injunction was entered is the basic power that a state has when it is in the regulating area of voter qualifications to make its laws effective.
1980.79-1631,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2839.916,2843.618,"Well now, that's the issue here, isn't it, as my brother Stevens has indicated?"
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2854.676,2855.317,--Yes.
1980.79-1631,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2855.317,2860.392,"And that is what makes the controversy here, isn't it?"
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2860.392,2877.996,"Well, I think it's an illusory controversy, they come... the National Party comes in and claims a great deprivation of the First Amendment rights without in any way demonstrating that any of their other programs for selecting delegates would have any different kind of apportionment."
1980.79-1631,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2886.897,2895.191,Well I know that your Court said the impact was speculative and therefore the case was over just on that ground.
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2895.191,2895.816,Yes.
1980.79-1631,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2895.816,2902.267,But it went on to say that even if it isn't... even if it were substantial there's a state justification.
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2902.267,2902.736,Yes.
1980.79-1631,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2902.736,2903.937,"Now, do you make that claim too?"
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2903.937,2906.312,I don't get into the state justification--
1980.79-1631,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2906.312,2909.733,"You mean, you stop short of that?"
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2909.733,2909.982,--Yes.
1980.79-1631,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2913.013,2922.368,"The state Court went that far, and if it easier to accept that branch of its judgment than the other--"
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2922.368,2925.539,--I agree.
1980.79-1631,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2925.539,2929.145,"--Or do you, you back away from that part of it, though."
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2929.145,2938.767,"I don't back, I back away... the way the state party way of presenting the brief, because I don't have to reach that question, because of several reasons."
1980.79-1631,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2968.302,2993.261,"Mr. Friebert, what if the Democratic National Committee had never come into the Wisconsin courts, and the Wisconsin primary had proceeded according to Wisconsin law and then when it came time for credentials hearings or a seating at the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic National Committee simply refused to seat the Wisconsin delegates?"
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,2996.337,2997.072,No.
1980.79-1631,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3072.011,3074.868,"When you say they, you mean the Democratic National Party?"
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3074.868,3076.024,"The National Party, yes sir."
1980.79-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3076.024,3078.991,That isn't quite... I don't think that's a fair statement of their position.
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3082.897,3085.802,They just won't let them be... any meaning to them.
1980.79-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3091.486,3097.641,"Just as they did in Cousins v. Wigoda, that delegation was elected pursuant to Illinois law and they refused to seat then."
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3097.641,3104.279,"--I think Cousins v. Wigoda, it doesn't... it's not the best applicable case to this."
1980.79-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3126.176,3130.222,"Well if you're not concerned with who the delegates are, you can't possibly justify the injunction."
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3130.222,3137.641,"--We care how they vote at the convention on the first ballot, and beyond, and that's the only thing we care about."
1980.79-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3154.995,3160.587,"Yes there was, the Illinois law provided one method of election and the other slate was not elected pursuant to that method."
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3160.587,3167.334,"--No, the Illinois law was neutral on the process by which delegates could be chosen."
1980.79-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3201.211,3206.585,Well aren't you using Wisconsin law in an effort to circumvent the national rule in exactly the same way?
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3209.364,3225.967,"--No, it's not... the state party of Wisconsin is not the Wisconsin legislature and what we had in Illinois was a state party or a Chicago party attempting by its slate-making processes--"
1980.79-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3225.967,3227.482,Which complied fully with the Illinois statute.
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3227.482,3230.917,"--It did comply fully, but they didn't comply with the party rule--"
1980.79-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3230.917,3233.652,"Didn't comply with the parry rule, it's precisely the same situation here."
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3233.652,3251.768,"--Because they were slate-making; they was no juggernaut between the state party, the national rules and the Illinois law, which is true here, and besides that, it was going to a different interest."
1980.79-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3269.636,3271.932,It's binding with respect to who the delegates would be.
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3271.932,3283.101,"--Yes, but not the more fundamental point as to who should be President of the United States, that's a lot more important to the public than who the delegates are, it seems to me."
1980.79-1631,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3283.101,3292.582,"Did I understand you correctly, to say that Wisconsin's interest was in how the delegates voted at the convention?"
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3292.582,3295.438,"On the nomination process, yes."
1980.79-1631,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3295.438,3296.5,At the convention?
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3296.5,3297.313,Yes.
1980.79-1631,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3298.749,3302.248,"Under the long-arm, that's a rather long arm, isn't it?"
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3302.248,3326.036,"--Oh, I think it's the first step in the process by which people become President or nominees for President of the United States, and it is intertwined in the voter qualification dowers that we have as a state, subject to Congressional regulation in a federal election and also under the 12th Amendment as a part of a complex process for its electors--"
1980.79-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3326.036,3339.842,"Mr. Friebert, why couldn't the state interest you described be adequately protected by a statute that said whoever the delegates are they shall vote, at least on the first ballot or on the second ballot, for the presidential candidate who receives the largest vote in the primary?"
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3339.842,3344.669,--That's a choice that the Wisconsin statute gives; a winner take all statute.
1980.79-1631,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3351.62,3353.4,I see.
1980.79-1631,2,39217,robert_h_friebert,,3353.4,3353.775,Thank you.
1980.79-1631,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3353.775,3357.164,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Eastman?"
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3357.164,3363.442,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't feel the need to say anything further, but I'm prepared to answer questions."
1980.79-1631,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3363.442,3365.504,Let me just ask this one question.
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3386.98,3393.087,"No, it would not, so long as the primary was an open primary and non-Democrats--"
1980.79-1631,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3393.087,3401.569,So the open primary objective is not merely the selection of delegates but also the determination of the person for whom they might vote?
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3401.569,3402.645,"--Absolutely, Justice Stevens."
1980.79-1631,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3424.512,3429.65,"Mr. Eastman, the Wisconsin delegation was in fact, seated last summer, was it not?"
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3429.65,3432.133,"--Yes, it was, Justice Stewart."
1980.79-1631,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3433.117,3438.021,"Although there was a stay of the... of the Wisconsin Supreme Court's order, was there not?"
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3438.021,3438.552,--Yes.
1980.79-1631,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3460.951,3464.667,"So there's really no alternative, at least there was no other delegation?"
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3464.667,3469.087,"That there was no other delegation, it was impractical for us to try to create one."
1980.79-1631,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3469.087,3471.024,And why isn't this moot?
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3471.024,3472.962,It isn't moot for several reasons.
1980.79-1631,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3531.077,3562.207,"Mr. Eastman, would you say that, that the state of Wisconsin is constitutionally prohibited from legislating, allowing a closed primary as you want, the declaration of the Democratic loyalty, but saying that delegates from the Fourth and Fifth, votes from the Fourth and Fifth Districts shall be counted as electing so many delegates; in other words, having a congressional district apportionment?"
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3562.207,3576.529,If I understand your hypothesis to be that the issue would not be necessarily closed versus open primary--
1980.79-1631,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3576.529,3576.951,Right.
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3576.951,3577.823,--but the apportionment of delegates--
1980.79-1631,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3577.823,3578.105,Right.
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3578.105,3609.406,"--yes, apportionment of delegates selected from the state, but actually selected to... by the State Party to be at the convention, yes, I would say that the Democratic National Convention and the Democratic Party could decide on the apportionment of delegates from the state on the method of apportionment, and that if the state mandated a different one, the state could not constitutionally enforce that different allocation."
1980.79-1631,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3609.406,3617.715,Even if the state said apportion according to the vote and the Democratic Party said winner take all?
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3617.715,3620.072,I think that's correct.
1980.79-1631,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3621.51,3623.446,"It's true, you would take the same position both ways?"
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3623.446,3623.618,--Yes.
1980.79-1631,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3623.618,3651.608,"Now the Democratic Party has rules, does it not, requiring that state delegations be representative of various, or have certain quotas of various age groups and genders and... there being only two genders... and be racially diverse in some of them, does it not?"

1980.79-1631,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3659.527,3678.205,"So that if a state law should say, men only for example, or people only over 35, or something like that, that would also in your view be unconstitutional because it would impair your constitutional right of free association?"
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3678.205,3681.47,"So long as there was a contrary party rule, yes."

1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3731.856,3749.067,"That is our view, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and in fact, that very issue was brought up in the context of the Republican Party's allocation of its delegates in certain states, in a case decided by the D.C. Circuit not long ago, the Ripon case, which is cited in the briefs."
1980.79-1631,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3757.221,3758.407,It wasn't a state action?
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3758.407,3759.766,"No, it wasn't quite the same thing."

1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3775.636,3775.978,Yes.
1980.79-1631,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3776.4,3779.618,--Because the statute is still of operative force.
1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3779.618,3780.008,--Yes.

1980.79-1631,3,39133,ronald_e_eastman,,3794.799,3802.14,"--While I can't imagine the Democratic Party adopting that rule, I would take the same position."
1980.79-1631,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3802.14,3803.061,"It would be the same issue, wouldn't it?"
