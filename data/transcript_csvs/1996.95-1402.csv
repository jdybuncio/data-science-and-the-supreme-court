1996.95-1402,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.647,"We'll hear argument next in No. 95-1402, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. the Estate of Otis C. Hubert."
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,22.967,32.992,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1402,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,122.36,125.413,"And in that case it was the decedent's act that did it, as I recall."
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,129.116,145.636,"It was... actually if I remember Stapf correctly, there was an option given to the heir as to how to take under the will or not take under the will, and it dealt with the specifics of the Texas community property rules."
1996.95-1402,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,146.778,160.385,"In any case it didn't involve a charge which was wholly contingent at the time of death and which simply arose later and then, under the statutory option, was charged against the marital share."
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,160.385,162.218,"--No, nor does this case."
1996.95-1402,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,170.023,171.135,But we don't know what the expenses are--
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,171.135,171.452,--Exactly.
1996.95-1402,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,171.452,174.725,"--and we don't know that there's going to be a... for example, a will contest or something like that."
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,174.725,175.025,Exactly.
1996.95-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,211.299,221.435,"Mr. Jones, if we value the estate at the time of death, why don't we also value these encumbrances at the time of death?"
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,245.31,246.091,Yes.
1996.95-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,246.091,247.043,--present value of--
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,247.043,254.918,"Right, and to understand that, you have to understand almost every issue in the case, most of which we haven't touched on yet, but there is a short answer to that."
1996.95-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,296.325,298.435,"--Well, but the executor has the election, does he not?"
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,298.435,298.996,Absolutely.
1996.95-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,299.587,307.36,"And if the executor elects to pay the deduction out of the estate, I can see why that should reduce the estate."
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,335.741,340.964,"--Well, they... I think I can give you an example that would suggest, if I understood your point, that they are the same."
1996.95-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,404.935,410.368,But your dollar-for-dollar theory doesn't recognize discounted value... time value at all.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,410.368,411.57,--The dollar-for-dollar--
1996.95-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,411.57,412.441,It's completely arbitrary.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,412.441,423.809,"--The dollar-for-dollar theory, as you have described it, recognizes that this issue serves at the border between the estate tax and the income tax."
1996.95-1402,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,467.707,473.049,You're not suggesting that a relatively large estate is usually resolved within a year.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,473.049,476.762,"--Well, I don't know how to answer that in terms of the size of the estate."
1996.95-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,482.526,484.427,May I ask you a question?
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,509.524,510.036,I--
1996.95-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,510.036,511.984,"Presumably the cost of filing a will, something like that."
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,511.984,513.537,--The cost of what?
1996.95-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,513.537,516.399,"Filing a will or probate court fees, something like that."
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,519.101,519.371,Right.
1996.95-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,524.263,528.415,So that necessarily some expenses could be deducted against income and some could not.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,528.415,530.278,We're only talking here--
1996.95-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,530.278,530.819,Is that correct?
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,530.819,532.9,"--Well, absolutely, but let me--"
1996.95-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,532.9,536.513,And that's why I can't understand your hypothetical in your reply brief.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,536.513,538.563,--Let me see if I can help you.
1996.95-1402,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,552.491,552.961,Right.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,552.961,557.035,Those are the kinds of administration expenses that we're talking about in this case.
1996.95-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,582.412,589.867,"Mr. Jones, throughout your brief, you put the marital deduction and the charitable deduction together."
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,617.634,620.896,"Well, the point is that it need not produce a taxable estate."
1996.95-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,635.104,636.376,"--Well, I just asked a question."
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,657.061,663.085,"--Yes, because what the... in that example, the problem that is addressed is that you get a choice."
1996.95-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,687.3,702.421,"So, if in fact they have some patents or something that are worth $11 million, but it costs $10 million to make them valid, all they have to do is pay tax, income tax, on $11 million, i.e., come up with about $4 million they don't have."
1996.95-1402,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.715,738.363,"Mr. Jones, I believe you were about to answer Justice Breyer's question tendered just before lunch."
1996.95-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.363,742.827,You just should say no.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,745.189,760.748,"Well, I don't recall frankly whether to say yes or no, but what I recall is that your hypothetical was where an asset of the value of $11 million is left to the spouse and it takes $10 million thereafter to, shall we say, perfect title to the asset."
1996.95-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,842.902,863.916,"Mr. Jones, could I follow up your discussion of how although the marital deduction is evaluated as of the time of death, you can take account of later developments and make them retroactive back to the time of death, such as the administrative expenses?"
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,924.336,933.22,"Because the... in your hypothetical, because the obligation to pay these expenses is on the marital gift, you have to value that obligation in valuing the gift."
1996.95-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.22,934.252,It isn't on the gift.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,937.564,941.408,"But in your hypothetical, the income would accrue to the marital gift."
1996.95-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,961.28,965.814,--But it isn't clear at the date of the gift whether the trustee will charge it against the income or not.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,965.814,981.322,"It doesn't matter in valuing the gift, but what matters in valuing the gift is knowing that this obligation is in fact imposed on the marital interest, the marital... the property transferred, whether it is imposed out of corpus or out of income."
1996.95-1402,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1020.879,1024.592,Why was the Commissioner so late in discovering Stapf?
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1024.592,1029.575,"The Commissioner has cited Stapf in prior cases, and I think that you--"
1996.95-1402,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1029.575,1033.097,But in the lower court proceedings in this case?
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1033.097,1045.664,"--When the case came up to this Court, it had already been cited in the Commissioner's favor by three or four other circuits, and I think that the other circuit decisions were directly on the point of administration expenses."
1996.95-1402,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1045.664,1046.875,Whereas Stapf wasn't?
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1046.875,1069.389,"Stapf was not directly on that point, although Stapf answers that question by the Court's discussion at the end which says that administration expenses are like other claims against the estate, and when... in that when the marital bequest is burdened by the obligation of paying those expenses, that in effect leaves that portion of the estate to someone else rather than to the spouse."
1996.95-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1069.389,1073.884,Was the language in Stapf dependent upon the widow's option at all?
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1073.884,1075.704,No.
1996.95-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1076.385,1079.918,It's simply the fact that the administrative expenses were paid out.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1079.918,1084.209,"--Having taken that option, the question then was how to calculate the deduction."
1996.95-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1148.323,1154.876,"Mr. Jones, may I go back to a point I raised this morning and perhaps you can straighten me out on it."
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1200.686,1201.377,In Estate of Street.
1996.95-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1201.377,1201.908,Yes.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1228.554,1229.034,No.
1996.95-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1229.395,1231.786,--analogy don't you use discounted value?
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1231.786,1241.093,"When you take an... when you incur an administration expense, and you claim it on the estate tax return, you don't take it in the year that you expended it."
1996.95-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1277.597,1281.718,"Well, why shouldn't the match be between the value of the estate at the date of the death?"
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1289.965,1293.217,Congress has not directed us to make that kind of calculation.
1996.95-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1312.518,1314.95,What has Congress specified for the charity?
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1316.031,1316.912,--That was for the charity.
1996.95-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1322.126,1325.007,--I thought you said something... didn't you just say something about marital deduction?
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1325.007,1342.728,--2056(b)(4)(A) and 2055(c) are respectively the marital and charitable provisions that deal with the reduction in those deductions when the estate taxes are ultimately paid when those liabilities... when that obligation burdens those interests.
1996.95-1402,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.258,1393.643,"Of course, what (b) tells you to look at again is not to the treatment of the charitable deduction under 55(c), but rather to the treatment of the gift."
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1393.643,1397.714,"--And again, this is real... this is critical, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1418.888,1434.729,And in your view that was not predicated at all upon the special election that the wife had to make in that case because it seemed to me at first reading that you were turning the present election that the executor has into a purchase case.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1446.096,1447.156,It really--
1996.95-1402,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1447.156,1450.278,And it seems to me you're just extrapolating that and saying every election is a purchase.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1450.278,1454.451,--It really doesn't matter how the administrative expense obligation is paid.
1996.95-1402,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1483.821,1501.411,"But the meaning then of the introductory phrase in (b)(4)(B), where the interest in property, et cetera, is encumbered, I guess has to be read to mean it will always be encumbered by an administrative expense."
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1501.411,1502.463,If it is encumbered.
1996.95-1402,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1503.384,1505.185,Unless there's a contrary direction.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1505.185,1509.229,"--Well, the marital interest isn't necessarily subject to administration expenses."
1996.95-1402,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1510.798,1512.739,But in a... certainly in a residuary case--
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1512.739,1513.14,--In--
1996.95-1402,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1513.14,1515.3,"--if there's no contrary instruction, it always will be."
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1515.3,1515.841,--Yes.
1996.95-1402,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1515.841,1519.995,And it will always fit within your so-called purchase analysis.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1519.995,1525.829,It... that obligation is what the statute refers to as an obligation in connection with the passing of the interest.
1996.95-1402,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1535.826,1537.667,May I just ask you one more question?
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1542.111,1543.851,"--Well, they said both, Justice Souter."
1996.95-1402,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1543.851,1547.012,"Well, the initial phrase refers to encumbrance."
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1547.012,1551.227,And the second phrase says any obligation imposed in connection with the passing of the interest.
1996.95-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1573.55,1575.023,Is that the regulation that deals with marital deduction?
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1576.223,1577.034,That is correct.
1996.95-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1577.034,1579.505,You say the two are to be treated alike.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1579.505,1583.889,The same principles apply because in all of these situations--
1996.95-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1583.889,1596.247,So that you could have a case where the entire... everything is left to a charity and you could end up on the example that you gave with a taxable estate.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1596.247,1598.468,--Only if they avoid taxes on the income side.
1996.95-1402,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1613.698,1616.931,Even if the expense is incurred for the production of that income.
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1619.212,1624.124,"if it's incurred for... solely for the production of income, then we have a question about whether it's truly an administration expense."
1996.95-1402,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1636.342,1645.979,"Isn't that the solution for the Government, to define more closely and carefully what is the administrative expense, distinguishing it quite clearly from those expenses--"
1996.95-1402,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1645.979,1654.375,That would not be a solution because in this case it's our understanding that substantial amounts were expended in a will contest and in litigation concerning the estate.
1996.95-1402,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1672.696,1674.827,"--Very well, Mr. Jones."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1676.219,1678.12,Thank you.
1996.95-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1722.649,1729.632,"If the expenses are payable... administrative expenses are payable from the corpus, I take it there's still a deduction on the fiduciary return?"
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1729.632,1741.372,"--There comes a point in time when it must go on the fiduciary return, but in our view if it goes... if a dollar of corpus goes to administrative expenses, it cannot go to the wife and it cannot go to charity."
1996.95-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1741.372,1741.621,No.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1742.532,1742.903,Yes.
1996.95-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1742.903,1748.736,"Let's say that you elect not to take the expenses, the administrative expenses, from the estate."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1752.548,1753.788,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1753.788,1754.91,--that's attributable to the corpus.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1759.231,1764.955,"You can take the deduction, but if you use corpus there, it does reduce the available corpus to go--"
1996.95-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1764.955,1766.067,"No, no."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1769.669,1770.28,"--Yes, sir."
1996.95-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1770.28,1772.772,Can you still take the deduction from the income tax?
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1772.772,1773.163,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1781.537,1782.549,Let me ask one more question.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1782.549,1783.037,"--Yes, sir."
1996.95-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1783.037,1793.986,"Suppose the State law provides that the expense of administration is to be paid from corpus, and it's a $50,000 expense."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1793.986,1794.834,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1794.834,1803.37,"But the income is so great that it greatly exceeds $50,000 and they credit all of the income at the end of the year to corpus."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1810.286,1815.328,"In speaking of corpus, we have to speak in terms of the corpus as it existed as of the date of death."
1996.95-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1833.37,1843.848,"All right, so that even though the wife ends up in both cases with the same, in the example where the administrative expenses must be paid from corpus, that does reduce the marital deduction."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1843.848,1845.869,"In our view, yes, and that I believe was the effect of--"
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1845.869,1847.87,"Well, it isn't really restricted to the date-of-death corpus."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1854.724,1855.375,"--No, Your Honor."
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.551,1882.083,"No, I don't understand now."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1894.001,1894.652,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.652,1896.613,What is the marital deduction?
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1896.613,1902.296,"If those expenses are paid out of income, the marital deduction is the full amount of the corpus."
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1905.138,1906.718,They're paid out of corpus.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1906.718,1908.471,--The marital deduction is reduced in that instance.
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.471,1911.412,"So, it is not the corpus as of the date of death."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1915.566,1924.001,"If... the hypothetical was there were $2 million in date-of-death corpus that comes in, and we know for distribution purposes we use the exact same date for valuing."
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.994,1936.149,"You don't know that $200,000 goes to administration expenses until 3 years later."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1936.149,1936.767,"No, but--"
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1936.767,1939.189,"As of the date of death, it says all $2 million goes to the wife."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1939.189,1944.314,"--But you have to trace it under... as I read Ballantine, Roney, and that line of cases, you have to trace it."
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.577,1951.099,And you're saying... you're oversimplifying by saying everything is looked at from the date of death.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1958.043,1959.863,You absolutely trace it wherever it goes.
1996.95-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1959.863,1976.435,"Is it normally... in an estate if suppose the person dies and they have $10 million in assets, but they know that $200,000 will inevitably be spent on administration, is the value of that estate $9,800,000 at date of death?"
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1976.435,1977.824,The value of... and if we assume it's all going to wife.
1996.95-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1977.824,1978.245,Yes.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1978.245,1978.615,Then--
1996.95-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1978.615,1979.356,Forget where it's going.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1988.663,1989.613,--Then you would do it precisely as we did in this estate.
1996.95-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1990.354,1995.489,But I'm saying for purposes of tax is the estate valued at $9.8 million?
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,1995.489,1995.797,--No.
1996.95-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2000.221,2004.422,"Even if we know for sure there will be $200,000 of administrative expenses."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2004.422,2005.574,You just trace the corpus.
1996.95-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2005.574,2009.828,"So, they evaluate it at $10 million."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2009.828,2010.465,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2010.465,2010.826,Okay.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2010.826,2020.724,"There are three points, time permitting, that we'd like to focus on is, one, the single most important point in reaching the right decision in this case may be the most basic."
1996.95-1402,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2123.281,2136.94,"At some point in your discussion, would you explain to me why the Government is wrong in deciding Stapf as controlling in this case, or do you think we have to modify Stapf in order to reach the result you propose?"
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2136.94,2142.114,"Actually, Your Honor, we applied Stapf in this case in the distribution of the property here."
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2187.252,2189.104,I don't understand what difference that makes.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2197.9,2198.281,--Yes.
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.281,2199.84,--it would reduce the marital deduction.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2199.84,2202.742,"Corpus has to go there, yes, Your Honor."
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.742,2206.135,Why is it different if it's placed upon income?
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2206.135,2207.417,Two reasons.
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.142,2288.818,"Yes, but I mean, an obligation... it is certainly an encumbrance upon corpus to say that all of the interest from this corpus must be used for a certain purpose."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2301.397,2307.26,--That proceeds on the assumption that it's an absolute commitment at the time of the date of death that all must go.
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.897,2365.709,They say that only applies to the existence of the power and not to its exercise.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2365.709,2370.043,"--Actually, no, Your Honor, because in that particular circumstance, it's a gift tax ruling."
1996.95-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2518.167,2521.86,"May I ask one question which I think is... let's take a normal estate, a smaller estate."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2521.86,2522.15,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2522.15,2523.832,Much... $2 million.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2548.397,2549.328,It may proceed that way.
1996.95-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2550.069,2560.495,"Now, suppose a Martian comes along... a Martian, somebody not related... and happens to pay the $200,000 and therefore the estate is now really $2 million instead of $1.8 million."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2597.99,2599.191,"Well, Your Honor--"
1996.95-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2599.191,2601.302,And we shouldn't change the law normally because of your case.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2601.302,2603.285,"--First of all, I would say--"
1996.95-1402,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2603.285,2605.014,Even if they concede that your case is a fluke.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2606.336,2609.787,"--I would say that... I would say this, Your Honor."
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.672,2872.698,Isn't the Government correct in its reply brief in simply saying that election is always of value to the estate that doesn't... that isn't large enough to quality for the estate tax?
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2872.698,2874.191,No.
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2874.191,2879.604,That alone is a common enough situation to justify the existence of that option provision.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2879.604,2885.708,"Well, I mean, it's true that there are circumstances where there is no meaningful election, but you cannot--"
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2885.708,2886.689,There are circumstances.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2886.689,2887.449,--Right.
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.449,2891.131,Most estates aren't big enough to have to worry about the estate tax anyway.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2891.131,2907.273,"Well, to be sure, the estate taxing is imposed on a very small sliver of the American population, but the fact of the matter is I don't think it's an answer to say we have a meaningful election available to all citizens, to say yes, there are some circumstances where it doesn't do you any good to exercise the election."
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2907.273,2908.282,Is that right?
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,2913.266,2930.418,"Not that it will be of benefit to everybody, but I would say to proceed on the assumption that there are those who don't have a meaningful election because they don't have an estate tax return that's due does not address the problem that those who need the meaningful election ought to garner some benefit from the election."
1996.95-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3041.059,3046.173,"Mr. Aughtry, Justice Breyer raised a question of really does this matter much."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,3055.478,3059.241,"To the extent that I'm conforming with my State law fiduciary duties, yes, ma'am."
1996.95-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3059.241,3062.083,"So, is this just a fluke case?"
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,3064.086,3066.617,I don't believe that it's a fluke case.
1996.95-1402,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3070.28,3071.889,What is that danger?
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,3071.889,3082.025,The danger is that this concept of date-of-death valuation is a concept that is being... we think is being undermined here with the concept of opening the door to hindsight.
1996.95-1402,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3154.463,3157.004,At that time he hadn't seen the Internal Revenue Code.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,3157.004,3164.521,--I know.
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3236.116,3239.298,"Unless the charge is against the corpus, then we do use hindsight."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,3239.298,3240.129,You trace the corpus.
1996.95-1402,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3246.614,3250.245,"It's a universal principle, if you're willing to ignore it with respect to the corpus."
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,3250.245,3251.197,--No.
1996.95-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3271.709,3272.46,Mr. Aughtry--
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,3272.46,3273.061,"--Yes, sir."
1996.95-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3273.061,3276.852,--in your brief you gave us seven independent insufficient reasons for affirming.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,3276.852,3277.643,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3277.643,3280.035,Which one would you rely on if you had to pick one?
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,3280.035,3280.966,Symmetry.
1996.95-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3280.966,3281.677,The number one.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,3281.677,3282.749,"Yes, sir."
1996.95-1402,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3282.749,3283.477,Thank you.
1996.95-1402,1,20500,david_d_aughtry,,3283.477,3312.169,"Symmetry, I submit to you, is far preferable to the sort of chaos that we've tried to describe as best we could in our brief of a disappearing residuary, of the downward spiral, of multiplier effect, and of the unnecessary conflict created between the Commissioner's recent construction of this regulation adopted 40 years after the fact, the conflict between that construction, the Commissioner's own estate tax regulations and rulings... we've cited 69-56."
1996.95-1402,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3326.737,3328.607,"Thank you, Mr. Aughtry."
1996.95-1402,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3330.279,3332.431,I have two points I will try to make very briefly.
1996.95-1402,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3384.944,3385.916,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
