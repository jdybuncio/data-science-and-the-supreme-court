1987.86-1357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.871,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 1357, United States Department of Justice versus Kenneth Michael Julian and Margaret J. Wallace."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,14.822,18.93,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-1357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,107.66,129.604,"Mr. Kneedler, there are provisions of the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act that specify certain types of information in the reports that I guess both sides agree may be deleted or excluded from any report before release."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,129.604,130.37,That's right.
1987.86-1357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,131.978,132.572,Right.
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,144.225,156.204,"Well, the reports contain a wealth of information concerning the individual's background, but also the background of his family, his relationships with associates, employers."
1987.86-1357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,160.797,165.825,"Well, I suppose most of that would be covered by Exemption 6?"
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,165.825,167.7,It may or may not be.
1987.86-1357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,168.731,174.791,I'm just wondering what's left after you take out the sensitive things and take out what Exemption 6 covers.
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,174.791,185.085,"Well, there's also information that's furnished by sources of information that may not be regarded as so confidential that the defendant can't even see that information."
1987.86-1357,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,238.266,245.871,What's to prevent him from making a copy for his own use or his counsel from making a copy in these days of copying machines.
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,245.871,263.709,"Well, the rules do not permit that and the standard procedure, Rule 32 C at sentencing, for example, says that the defendant and the counsel for the Government may read a copy of the report."
1987.86-1357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,303.833,307.379,"But the Rule doesn't apply to the Parole Commission, I gather?"
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,307.379,311.034,"No, but the Parole Commission from the outset has followed directly parallel procedures."
1987.86-1357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,327.215,331.058,"Yes, but it makes it very hard to argue that it falls under Exemption 3."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,331.058,351.283,"Well, we submit that it does because Rule 32 specifically provides that the report is to be returned to the Court upon the completion of sentencing, and obviously the defendant can't get a copy of the report from the Court unless the Court in its discretion permits him to do so."
1987.86-1357,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,362.592,365.84,Do you have any case that upholds your position on Exemption 3?
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,365.84,373.963,"--There's no case specifically relating to the presentence reports, no."
1987.86-1357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.224,436.923,Doesn't that exemption also require that either the inability to obtain it be absolute or that the specific standard for making it available be set forth?
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,436.923,437.407,No.
1987.86-1357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.407,438.718,What's the specific standard here?
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,438.718,443.249,There are actually three separate subparts to Exemption 3.
1987.86-1357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.171,496.123,"Doesn't that last exemption have to be absolute, that is, matters to be withheld."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,498.169,507.651,"Well, if that were true, it would be redundant with respect to Exemption 3(a) which does require that it be absolute and that there be no discretion."
1987.86-1357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,576.856,584.088,But I guess there is a split of authority on whether they are inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums.
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,585.588,589.179,There's not a split of authority on that question.
1987.86-1357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,664.04,669.771,"Mr. Kneedler, you can't say that just incorporating it into the deliberative process is the criterion."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,676.893,678.112,Right.
1987.86-1357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,696.387,707.086,--Do you think it could encompass an NAM memorandum if the law required the agency to consider NAM memoranda?
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,707.086,715.535,"Well, I think it would depend on whether the statute effectively made the NAM part of the Government's decisionmaking process."
1987.86-1357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,767.515,773.888,"But the are in those consultant cases, the consultants are really working for another agency in any case."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,775.466,776.121,"Well, not necessarily."
1987.86-1357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,901.246,911.946,Are those cases where the defendant after incarceration is suing to get some change in his status and requests through discovery a copy of this report?
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,911.946,929.047,"No, the cases that we've relied upon have generally been where third parties have sought copies of the reports, either in connection with pending civil litigation or in some cases in criminal litigation where the defendant has sought the report of a Government witness or a codefendant."
1987.86-1357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,937.232,948.635,"But one would think though, just as a matter of off the top of the head so to speak, that if the sort of suit was brought that I described, that probably this would be available to a plaintiff suing the Government."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,948.635,949.727,"Well, it depends."
1987.86-1357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,966.142,971.032,But why shouldn't that defeat Exemption 5?
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,971.032,979.935,Because the subject of the report just like any member of the public could get a copy of the report only upon a showing of special need.
1987.86-1357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,983.637,986.667,"Well, nothing is routinely handed out in litigation."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,989.336,990.788,That's right.
1987.86-1357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1001.817,1019.732,"Well, then are you saying then that for the number of Section 5 or subsection 5 privilege to attach, it's enough that in the litigation where the person would ultimately obtain discovery, they have to make a showing that they need it?"
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1019.732,1025.603,"--Well, that's the general rule under Exemption 5."
1987.86-1357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1080.365,1093.486,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, do you take the position that the Parole Commission may not give a copy to the defendant if it chooses to do so?"
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1093.486,1094.126,"No, we don't."
1987.86-1357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1114.134,1119.271,Could the defendant possibly get a copy under the Privacy Act?
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1119.271,1119.911,--No.
1987.86-1357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1205.206,1207.003,"Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a question."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1234.414,1241.536,"Well, I think no."
1987.86-1357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1245.958,1249.689,"Well, the need is it's relevant to the lawsuit, that's the special need."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1249.689,1251.548,It's relevant but the question--
1987.86-1357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1251.548,1257.234,"Which is generally the test in any discovery proceeding, it's got to be some showing of relevance."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1257.234,1260.624,--But it's quite clear that presentence reports are not generally available.
1987.86-1357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1260.624,1267.324,But also you don't have an awful lot of litigation between inmates and the particular agency having custody of it.
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1279.757,1287.208,"Well, what might happen is that the Court might readily find that he has a special interest in it, and a special need to see it because the litigation relates directly to the presentence report."
1987.86-1357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1287.208,1293.237,But the fact that it's needed in litigation would in those facts constitute the kind of special need that you're talking about?
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1293.237,1300.751,"Yes, because that directly parallels his right to read the report at sentencing and again prior to his parole hearing."
1987.86-1357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.996,1310.652,The special need arises out of his status as a litigant.
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1310.652,1316.696,"No, his special need arises out of the fact that he presentence report is placed in issue in the case concerning him in particular."
1987.86-1357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.696,1317.071,Right.
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1317.071,1323.991,He might have a suit against the Parole Commission or the Bureau of Prisons that does not relate to his presentence report.
1987.86-1357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1323.991,1328.723,And it wouldn't be routinely available because it wasn't relevant.
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1328.723,1336.314,"Well, it might still be relevant, and even under the Civil Discovery Rules, it doesn't have to necessarily be admissible."
1987.86-1357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1339.078,1346.42,I just can't imagine a trial judge turning down a request to see a report that he had a right to see earlier in a discovery situation.
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1346.42,1353.495,"Well, the Court might well take that into account in deciding whether the defendant should be able to see it."
1987.86-1357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1370.706,1373.189,Even if it was going to be an exhibit in the lawsuit?
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1373.189,1380.89,"Well, if it was an exhibit in the lawsuit, then the Court would be deciding that it should be admitted, but in terms of discovery."
1987.86-1357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1383.499,1396.088,"Well, tell me something else, what really is the Government seeking to protect from... I just have a difficult time understanding what it is the Government doesn't want to turn over to somebody that has already seen the material."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1396.088,1400.853,It's the question is turning over the document itself.
1987.86-1357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.853,1401.697,"Yes, I understand that."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1401.697,1402.775,It's the difference between the hard copy and--
1987.86-1357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1402.775,1403.943,Or making a Xerox copy.
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1406.849,1409.286,--There are several considerations here.
1987.86-1357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1470.402,1488.004,"Mr. Kneedler, as I glance at the Grolier case, it looks to me as if what the Court was saying there was where you're having a claim of work product privilege, and the Court has overcome that privilege in an earlier litigation."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1503.311,1511.136,"Well, the principle under Exemption 5 is a general one that this Court has stated on three or four occasions."
1987.86-1357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1518.993,1522.523,"But there isn't any privilege here on the Government's side, as I see it."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1522.523,1523.007,"Oh, there is."
1987.86-1357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.314,1545.389,And this is a Governmental privilege that's recognized in litigation?
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1545.389,1546.139,Yes.
1987.86-1357,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1557.573,1564.773,"Mr. Kneedler, once you give them a copy of it to look at it, is somebody in there with him as he's looking at it?"
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1564.773,1566.848,The practices vary from district to district.
1987.86-1357,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1580.876,1581.485,Is he allowed to take it to his office?
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1581.485,1591.074,Some districts would give it to the defense counsel and allow the defense counsel to arrange for the way in which it would be disclosed.
1987.86-1357,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1591.074,1592.465,"Well, then all the things you're worried about would have happened."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1592.465,1595.356,Not necessarily because there's--
1987.86-1357,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1595.356,1597.558,You're afraid that he'll show it to somebody.
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1597.558,1599.666,"--Well, and not just show it but distribute it."
1987.86-1357,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1615.206,1618.299,I don't see how it can possibly be confidential once you show it to him.
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1618.299,1622.001,"No, confidential not just from the defendant but to the world at large."
1987.86-1357,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1622.97,1624.814,"Well, but the defendant can talk to the world at large."
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1624.814,1637.995,"--He can but there's a big difference as far as the probation officers are concerned, as far as they see it from the defendant being able to show an actual copy and just being able to recount what his recollection is."
1987.86-1357,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1646.32,1647.444,That's a lot of speculation.
1987.86-1357,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1647.444,1658.128,"Well, in a FOIA case, the test is not whether the privilege that is recognized elsewhere is thought to be wise or not."
1987.86-1357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1670.186,1671.78,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1987.86-1357,1,22390,eric_robert_glitzenstein,,1673.967,1688.493,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1987.86-1357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.155,1758.465,"Mr. Glitzenstein, the fact that the request is by the subject of the report is it conceded that that's irrelevant?"
1987.86-1357,1,22390,eric_robert_glitzenstein,,1765.915,1773.538,"Your Honor, I believe that Exemption 6 was crafted to deal precisely with the distinction between first party and third party requests."
1987.86-1357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1808.65,1828.375,"Well, that's true as far as personal privacy is concerned, but as far as exposing the identity of people who spoke about the individual were, what they said, and other such matters, that could be obtained not only by the defendant but by anybody, presumably."
1987.86-1357,1,22390,eric_robert_glitzenstein,,1828.375,1832.999,"I think again, it would depend upon an analysis of the particular exemption involved."
1987.86-1357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1856.74,1863.425,"But if it has to go to the defendant, it has to go to the rest of the world, isn't that right, except for those personal matters that relate only to the defendant."
1987.86-1357,1,22390,eric_robert_glitzenstein,,1871.592,1874.154,"I believe that's basically our argument, yes, Your Honor."
1987.86-1357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2076.964,2084.712,"Mr. Glitzenstein, do you concede that a court would not be required to give the defendant a copy under Rule 32?"
1987.86-1357,1,22390,eric_robert_glitzenstein,,2084.712,2086.163,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.91,2178.705,"Mr. Glitzenstein, now you could say the same thing with respect to the Rule."
1987.86-1357,1,22390,eric_robert_glitzenstein,,2214.131,2229.078,"First of all, Your Honor, I would like to just emphasize that I think that clearly is what Congress did both in the plain language of the two statutes by not adopting Rule 32(c)(3)(e) and in legislative history of the Parole Act where it authorized independent determinations."
1987.86-1357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.078,2233.858,"You're saying Congress is privileged to make no sense if it wants to, and I agree with you."
1987.86-1357,1,22390,eric_robert_glitzenstein,,2242.197,2255.145,I think the reason it makes sense is when you look at the purpose of Rule 32(c) was essentially to give the Court control over that document up until the end of the sentencing process.
1987.86-1357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2370.129,2375.456,"All those good things you've just said, those good uses all relate to use by the particular defendant."
1987.86-1357,1,22390,eric_robert_glitzenstein,,2392.403,2406.258,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, again, I think that Congress did focus on the need of the particular defendant in passing the Parole Act, where Congress specifically required that the document be made available to the prisoner, it did not impose any limitations."
1987.86-1357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2477.057,2491.505,"Mr. Glitzenstein, do you concede that some lower courts have recognized a sort of privilege against disclosure to third parties generally of these presentence reports?"
1987.86-1357,1,22390,eric_robert_glitzenstein,,2491.505,2503.827,"Your Honor, I think it is clear that some lower courts have in some instances withheld copies of presentence reports from third parties trying to obtain them from sentencing courts."
1987.86-1357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2677.462,2691.221,Is there any case which you have found in which a court has said a third party may get a presentence report after the conclusion of the sentencing process?
1987.86-1357,1,22390,eric_robert_glitzenstein,,2691.221,2704.404,There are cases I know that have indicated that presentence reports may upon a substantial showing of need be disclosed.
1987.86-1357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2710.543,2713.416,But that's under the specialized need standard.
1987.86-1357,1,22390,eric_robert_glitzenstein,,2713.416,2715.213,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1987.86-1357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.968,2994.398,"Mr. Glitzenstein, the argument you just made that there are other protections which would keep away from the public or from any requester information that impinges upon some privacy right or some other Governmental interest, you can always make that argument under Exemption 5, can't you?"
1987.86-1357,1,22390,eric_robert_glitzenstein,,3023.278,3036.149,"Your Honor, I think if one looks at the classic Exemption 5 privileges which the courts early on incorporated into the Exemption and the ones that are highlighted in the legislative history, one would have to come out a different way on that."

1987.86-1357,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3341.778,3342.95,"Well, it's not really absolute."
1987.86-1357,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3351.119,3353.166,"No, it's but that's true of a lot of privileges."
1987.86-1357,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3443.116,3444.974,"Your time has expired, Mr. Kneedler."
