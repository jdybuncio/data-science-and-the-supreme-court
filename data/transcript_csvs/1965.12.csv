1965.12,0,46372,walter_g_treanor,,10.13,22.616,"Mr. Chief Justice, I move the admission of Paul Bender of the District of Columbia Bar for purposes of arguing this case on behalf of the United States."
1965.12,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,22.616,29.226,Does it make it (Inaudible) for that purpose.
1965.12,0,46372,walter_g_treanor,,31.656,35.314,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.12,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,855.077,863.687,"Mr. Treanor, I understand your point that the Commission gave far too narrow a definition to the phrase ""connecting line""."
1965.12,0,46372,walter_g_treanor,,867.096,876.844,"Mr. Justice Stewart, our definition would be this, if a line has a physical connection, it is obviously a connecting line."
1965.12,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,917.709,920.789,"That's a tailor-made definition for this case, of course."
1965.12,0,46372,walter_g_treanor,,920.789,921.684,Yes sir.
1965.12,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,922.192,923.772,Including even a direction south.
1965.12,0,46372,walter_g_treanor,,925.279,927.324,Yes Sir.
1965.12,1,37685,paul_bender,,1037.156,1040.695,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.12,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1157.042,1161.986,"Ultimately, this case does carry, does it not, on what you referred to as the dry legal definition?"
1965.12,1,37685,paul_bender,,1161.986,1167.8,"Yes, it does and I shall address myself to that."
1965.12,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.542,1422.81,(Inaudible)
1965.12,1,37685,paul_bender,,1422.81,1426.937,Only if it's discriminatory.
1965.12,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1426.937,1431.118,(Inaudible)
1965.12,1,37685,paul_bender,,1431.118,1433.172,"Well, another --"
1965.12,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.172,1458.739,Let's assume that the Great Northern -- Great Northern came into the (Inaudible) would that be a violation subsequent to 3 (4)?
1965.12,1,37685,paul_bender,,1458.739,1459.119,"Well, if it didn't --"
1965.12,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1459.119,1471.134,(Inaudible)
1965.12,1,37685,paul_bender,,1471.134,1477.591,"Well, the section only deals with discrimination in rates, fares and charges between connecting lines."
1965.12,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1485.206,1493.018,(Inaudible)
1965.12,1,37685,paul_bender,,1493.018,1500.664,"Well, there's a general provision of the statute which gives us the Commission power to I think it's, is it one?"
1965.12,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1520.997,1527.873,So in my case (Inaudible)
1965.12,1,37685,paul_bender,,1527.873,1534.401,"I would think, in any case, there would be no violation of 3 (4) unless rates, fares or charges were involved."
1965.12,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1534.401,1539.151,Before imposing a duty to maintain interchanges of traffic?
1965.12,1,37685,paul_bender,,1539.151,1540.135,Yes.
1965.12,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1540.135,1541.812,And I suppose to that extent that â€“-
1965.12,1,37685,paul_bender,,1541.812,1546.074,"Well, I -- if by through route you mean that you let traffic go through, yes."
1965.12,2,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,2248.658,2252.19,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.12,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2357.705,2359.424,(Inaudible)
1965.12,2,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,2359.424,2361.222,In the proceeding before the Commission.
1965.12,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2416.635,2421.968,(Inaudible) Beiber route.
1965.12,2,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,2421.968,2432.435,"Bieber is a through route like participated in by Santa Fe, Western Pacific and Great Northern up to Portland and two points served by Great Northern."
1965.12,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2432.435,2436.841,(Inaudible)
1965.12,2,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,2436.841,2441.066,"No, like most through routes in this country, it's by voluntary arrangements between the carriers."
1965.12,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.799,2457.398,(Inaudible)
1965.12,2,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,2457.398,2458.724,No.
1965.12,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2458.724,2460.741,(Inaudible)
1965.12,2,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,2460.741,2462.903,"That is correct, sir."
1965.12,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.903,2475.689,Was not what?
1965.12,2,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,2475.689,2488.446,"A connecting line, and secondly that even if it was connecting line there was not assuring a sufficient similarity of transportation conditions to warrant rate equality."
1965.12,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.518,2511.649,Well you are urging that (Inaudible)
1965.12,2,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,2511.649,2513.859,It's not being litigated before this Court.
1965.12,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2513.859,2520.778,So you don't say that -- you don't argue that therefore the case be (Inaudible)
1965.12,2,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,2520.778,2531.966,"No indeed, because their 3 (4) argument is an entirely separate prong and an entirely separate ground for the relief which they sought."
1965.12,3,23924,frank_s_farrell,,3892.501,3897.538,"May it please the Court, I represent the railroad appellees in this case."
1965.12,4,46372,walter_g_treanor,,4960.951,4964.738,Addressing myself Mr. Chief Justice to the second part of the question.
1965.12,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5053.645,5065.039,Well would you just say it's common practice in the railroad industry to and has been through the years to do what you are urging here to be done?
1965.12,4,46372,walter_g_treanor,,5065.039,5066.719,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice that --"
1965.12,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5066.719,5068.146,I have no knowledge on what would be done.
1965.12,4,46372,walter_g_treanor,,5068.146,5076.044,-- that this is our position and we think the fact that there has been no litigation on it suggest one of two things.
1965.12,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5093.344,5102.714,Why is it the -- why would you suggest the Great Northern was not -- did not impressively support you in the hearing or why wasn't it the complaint?
1965.12,4,46372,walter_g_treanor,,5102.714,5114.14,"I respectfully suggest, Mr. Justice White, that I believe the reason is that the Great Northern is presently and at that time was actively engage in a merger with the Northern Pacific."
1965.12,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5143.29,5150.59,"Tell me, Mr. Treanor, Northern, now let's see, Great Northern has the physical connection with Western Pacific?"
1965.12,4,46372,walter_g_treanor,,5150.59,5151.376,Yes Mr. Justice Brennan.
1965.12,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5151.376,5154.928,"And as this merger goes through your problem is solved, isn't it?"
1965.12,4,46372,walter_g_treanor,,5154.928,5158.25,"No sir, it is not, for two reasons."
1965.12,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5163.014,5166.14,"Well it has, you don't have a physical connection."
1965.12,4,46372,walter_g_treanor,,5166.14,5179.555,"But we have a physical connection but not at the common gateway, we lose our standing to bring a complaint on the discrimination statute because the connection is down here and their connection was a Southern Pacific is up at Portland and over several other places."
1965.12,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5276.732,5294.196,(Inaudible)
1965.12,4,46372,walter_g_treanor,,5294.196,5314.038,"I can't answer that I believe Mr. Justice White, the term ""through route"" is not a part of Section 3 (4) it does not appear and therefore you do not have to have a through route situation before they can be audit to treat their common connections equally."
1965.12,5,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,5457.705,5460.247,May I ask some clarification.
1965.12,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5460.247,5460.515,Yes.
1965.12,5,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,5460.515,5463.234,Is there a proper definition of connecting line?
1965.12,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5463.234,5465.103,"No, I mean this."
1965.12,5,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,5478.071,5482.978,Only that -- I only meant to say the first time such a concept of connecting line.
1965.12,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5482.978,5504.753,"Yes, well I'm relating it to this situation here and what I like to know is just how that has been handled in practice in as much as there is no law on the subject, no cases, no issues brought before the courts on this precise issue."
