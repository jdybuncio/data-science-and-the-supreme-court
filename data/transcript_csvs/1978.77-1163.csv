1978.77-1163,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.092,We will hear arguments first this morning in 1163 on the consolidated cases Friedman and others against Rogers and others.
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,26.82,29.966,"Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court."
1978.77-1163,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,142.512,149.031,"What do the Texas Statute is provide about group practice of Medicine, the general practice of Medicine?"
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,149.031,154.451,"Your Honor, the Texas Statutes are silent regarding the group practice of medicine."
1978.77-1163,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,209.478,215.597,"I take it Mr. Niemann, a commercial optometrists may not join the TOA or may he?"
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,215.597,217.773,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1163,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,236.348,245.253,"Counsel, Mr. Justice Blackmun I understood asked you kind of an either or question and you said, ‘that's correct'."
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,249.726,252.919,He cannot.
1978.77-1163,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,278.909,284.973,"In your view, The Texas Law prohibit commercial optometry altogether constitutionally?"
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,284.973,289.048,"Yes Your Honor, I think they could."
1978.77-1163,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,330.656,333.385,"Well, that's kind of secular, isn't it?"
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,344.79,347.321,The law was enacted by the legislature.
1978.77-1163,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,353.569,355.906,Because it's to your benefit.
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,355.906,357.621,That's correct.
1978.77-1163,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,618.986,623.791,"Let me perhaps you have told us this but I want to get clear in my mind, what is the total membership of the board?"
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,623.791,624.943,Six.
1978.77-1163,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,624.943,628.759,And their member serve for how longer term?
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,628.759,629.98,Four I believe.
1978.77-1163,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,629.98,631.686,Staggered or?
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,631.686,634.203,Staggered.
1978.77-1163,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,634.203,636.373,How do they become members?
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,636.373,637.866,By appointment of the Governor Your Honor.
1978.77-1163,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,637.866,639.881,Appointment of the Governor.
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,641.993,654.972,"Let me add another step; there is a unitary appointment, which must be confirmed by the Senate which meets every two years, and they serve until they are either confirmed or unconfirmed by the Senate."
1978.77-1163,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.428,667.211,"I need a classification on this point, supposing is there provision in the statute for what happens if a member of TOA is appointed and confirmed and starts to serve and then resigns from the association?"
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,667.211,670.607,"Under those circumstances, it would be a vacancy and the Governor --"
1978.77-1163,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,670.607,674.705,"No, resigns from TOA, not from that, from the Board."
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,683.558,694.872,"Your Honor, the question is never risen, and I would think that the statutory construction of that law would require his continuing membership in TOA, but I don't know."
1978.77-1163,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,694.872,700.571,"Do you mean by that that he would be removed, he would be removed if he resigned."
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,704.969,709.601,"Your Honor, I really don't know."
1978.77-1163,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,990.201,998.353,"Mr. Niemann, isn't there perhaps some inconsistency between that argument and your rejection of the first argument your opponent makes."
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1004.861,1011.688,"Apparently there it might be construed as an inconsistency Your Honor, but it is not."
1978.77-1163,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1044.781,1051.778,Do you say that legislative group agreed a group of prejudice but the court can't.
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1051.778,1055.548,"In the future Your Honor, that's correct."
1978.77-1163,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1058.852,1079.924,"Well, is that the judiciary deciding their prejudice or the judiciary saying that we accept the presumption that the legislature adopted to justify its statute and given that presumption, must the legislature not out of -- I mean must not the judiciary out of difference to the legislature say yes, we will accept the proposition, these people are biased."
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1079.924,1086.118,"Your Honor, biased toward law enforcement is what the legislature had in mind."
1978.77-1163,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1159.669,1165.005,"It is not a matter of his choosing not to associate with TOA, he is ineligible, isn't he?"
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1165.005,1165.914,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1163,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1167.238,1175.106,"So it is not quite accurate to say that if he chooses not to associate with TOA, he is ineligible to be on the majority."
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1182.129,1184.133,That's correct.
1978.77-1163,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1211.143,1214.277,What is this rights?
1978.77-1163,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1214.277,1218.832,Isn't there a general rule that you can be excluded.
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1226.151,1228.479,I am not quite sure that I understand the question Your Honor.
1978.77-1163,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1228.479,1233.117,"That when a vote is taken on a Board, there is the no way for Dr. Rogers to win."
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1233.117,1235.07,"Your Honor, I might point out that --"
1978.77-1163,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1235.07,1239.457,Is that true or not?
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1239.457,1252.809,"It is a vote deals with enforcing the law and the four members of the TOA on the board vote to enforce the law and Dr. Rogers votes against enforcing the law, then there is no way he is going to win."
1978.77-1163,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1252.809,1255.12,That was not my question.
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1260.018,1263.404,"There have been many occasions Your Honor, when Dr. Rogers has been on the majority."
1978.77-1163,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1267.65,1271.68,I thought you said earlier that these people just don't get along at all.
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1271.68,1280.178,"They don't get along, but they still agree on some things Your Honor, and in the way of license, your license renewal, and enforcement of some of the laws, they have common interests."
1978.77-1163,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1291.918,1304.851,"My point is I don't see any difference between being a minority of two or one, or being a minority of 89."
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1311.936,1313.153,"Your Honor, I might ask."
1978.77-1163,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1313.153,1314.873,Am I right?
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1314.873,1323.734,"Yes, you are, but I would point out that there is no constitutional right that a minority always has the right to be in the majority."
1978.77-1163,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1361.681,1368.049,"Now how many coordinates you say that he has all the rights and everything, but he just gets out of voting."
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1368.049,1379.75,He gets out of voting Your Honor because of his philosophy of non-enforcement and his opposition to the anti-commercial optometry Provisions of The Act.
1978.77-1163,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1380.649,1383.265,Is there any allocation (Inaudible) nowhere?
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1383.265,1384.138,"No, Your Honor, this is a case to first impression."
1978.77-1163,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1384.138,1388.61,Where you used to take a (Inaudible) and put in the statute.
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1388.61,1392.002,No there are no other federal cases Your Honor.
1978.77-1163,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1411.974,1413.857,"Mr. Niemann, excuse me."
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1426.632,1428.17,No Your Honor.
1978.77-1163,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.01,1458.908,One other question if I may.
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1477.003,1484.068,"Your Honor, if I may summarize them by referring back to my statement of fact."
1978.77-1163,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1498.929,1502.227,Are those statutory provisions or they are ethical rules?
1978.77-1163,0,34908,larry_niemann,,1502.227,1504.099,Those are statutory provisions.
1978.77-1163,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1538.488,1540.441,Ms. Prengler?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1540.441,1543.076,"Mr. Chief Justice, and May I please the Court."
1978.77-1163,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1663.092,1667.034,"Opticians are just manufacture the licensed appliances, don't they?"
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1667.034,1667.407,That's right.
1978.77-1163,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1667.407,1668.487,Fill a prescription?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1668.487,1671.257,That's right and they are not licensed in Texas.
1978.77-1163,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1671.257,1675.316,"In Texas, can a patient come directly to an optician?"
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1675.316,1679.909,"Yes, patient can come directly to an optician to get glasses if they have a prescription from a doctor."
1978.77-1163,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1679.909,1681.871,"Well, that's what I mean."
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1685.425,1686.554,That's correct.
1978.77-1163,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1686.554,1691.873,An optician cannot deal directly with the patients as far as diagnosing them.
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1691.873,1692.519,That's correct.
1978.77-1163,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1693.804,1694.415,Right.
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1694.415,1695.902,Right.
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1768.559,1778.125,Is there any explanation or any reason for not borrowing the group practice of optometry?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1782.415,1789.818,"That's right, you can practice in association with other optometrists, but you have to practice under the names of all the optometrists."
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1804.873,1815.069,"So the statute just bars how you hold yourself out to the public, or just what kind of words you use in representing yourself to the public?"
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1815.069,1819.762,It requires that the individual optometrist hold himself out in his own name.
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1819.762,1823.457,But any other aspect of group practice is not forbidden?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1823.457,1824.572,No.
1978.77-1163,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1824.572,1830.41,"It's not too different from a full disclosure requirement of the Securities Act, resembling that in that case of court."
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1830.41,1840.905,"That's what we would contain, that's correct, that it – and in fact it requires that the optometrists give more information to the public."
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.905,1848.89,"In billing, in any communications or in advertising the -- all of the names must be given?"
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1848.89,1850.03,That's correct.
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1850.03,1853.569,You cannot send a bill out under just a trade name?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1853.569,1854.22,That's correct.
1978.77-1163,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1862.512,1870.102,As I understand it -- your state does permit to practice under a partnership name so long as the partners devote at least 50% of their professional time to --
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1870.102,1871.348,Yes that's correct.
1978.77-1163,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1881.948,1890.591,"Well, so Smith and Jones Optometrists can practice such a partnership so long as Dr. Smith and Dr. Jones devote at least half their time to the partnership work."
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1890.591,1891.032,That's correct Your Owner.
1978.77-1163,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1891.032,1898.435,"But now, can they practice as Smith and Jones Optometrists and also have as partners, Brown, Black and Green."
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1898.435,1899.455,"Yes they can, that is specifically --"
1978.77-1163,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1899.455,1901.258,Even though they are not mentioned in the partnership name?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1901.258,1904.752,That's correct.
1978.77-1163,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1904.752,1912.602,But if they have name like Cromwell and Selevan there must be a Cromwell and a Selevan who spend half their time.
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1912.602,1914.464,That's correct and the statute also --
1978.77-1163,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1914.464,1918.116,"There might be 100 others who are not named, is that so?"
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1918.116,1922.687,That's right.
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1946.952,1963.46,Do your cases explain or is there any reason for distinguishing between unincorporated groups that use a trade name and partnerships that use just two names and maybe 100 partners?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,1963.46,1966.614,The court did not speak to that particular issue.
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.931,2010.026,"Could there be under the Texas Law, be two named partners doing business and spending 100% of their time on the job, and they have as employees 50 others who aren't partners?"
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2010.026,2012.948,Yes.
1978.77-1163,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2050.333,2062.775,"Couldn't that still happen if you had a -- I just want to be – if you had a Smith and Jones partnership, with 45 other partners who are not named and that partnership operated offices all over the state."
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2062.775,2076.467,They could not operate offices all over the state under the statute because that particular name could not be used all over the state unless they could somehow spend 50% of their time there or the time that the particular practice was open for business.
1978.77-1163,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2076.467,2080.94,There can be only two branches at most wouldn't it?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2080.94,2082.956,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2083.804,2104.649,But two other partners of the 100 men partnership could open the offices in some other place and being named partners and all the other unnamed partners could shift around and all the employees could move in and out of these various branches I take it.
1978.77-1163,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2104.649,2109.013,But each of the named partners has to spend at least 50% of his time on the partnership business in an office.
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2109.013,2111.187,That's correct.
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2111.187,2125.338,"But if there are 100 partners or 50 partners, two can be the name partners in one place and two in another place, right or not?"
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2125.338,2129.141,"They could not be the namedpartners because under the statute, it would be prohibited."
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.952,2157.12,"So if I have four partners and two members, the four can practice as a partnership in Dallas by -- Smith and Jones can use their name, and Brown and Jackson can be the two named partners in Fort Worth."
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2157.12,2160.156,That's true.
1978.77-1163,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2356.73,2363.217,May I ask you a question about Texas Law generally with respect to trade names and trade marks.
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2373.058,2374.403,I believe so Your Honor.
1978.77-1163,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2374.403,2380.305,"Now I realize under your current law, you couldn't write just the trade name, you are talking of that."
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2399.348,2402.225,"I would think that it would be Your Honor, I don't know but I would say --"
1978.77-1163,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2402.225,2403.155,It usually is.
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2403.155,2404.723,Yes your honor.
1978.77-1163,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2404.723,2407.587,Are there any cases in Texas that deal with this so for as you know?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2407.587,2410.242,"As far as I know, no sir."
1978.77-1163,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2414.978,2424.018,I wonder why you don't argue that a trade name is property and not speech.
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2435.243,2436.995,Okay.
1978.77-1163,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.109,2450.253,May I ask you Justice Powell prompted a question for me.
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2473.489,2478.126,Only if the state could find the type of abuses that are present in this particular case.
1978.77-1163,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2478.126,2481.853,"Are the abuses essential to your argument, I guess what I am asking."
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2481.853,2483.387,"Yes, the abuses that were --"
1978.77-1163,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2483.387,2494.557,"If they are essential and if the other side would have persuaded, so those abuses could be prohibited by specific prohibitions but also prohibiting the trade name, does you case then collapse?"
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2494.557,2504.805,"No, we would contend that the state would have a right to restrict the use of a trade name assuming that there has to be some reason."
1978.77-1163,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2504.805,2518.298,"Are you making a distinction between a chain of cleaning establishments, the quality cleaners on the one hand and other establishments that are dealing in services relating to health."
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2518.298,2518.53,That's correct.
1978.77-1163,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2518.53,2522.064,I think that's the distinction that you make from Mr. Justice Powell's statements.
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2522.064,2535.69,"Yes sir, that would be certainly be a distinction in the use of a trade name to just sell products but certainly not have the same potential harms and consequences as it would in the health related field."
1978.77-1163,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2535.69,2555.561,What worries me is how much more information does an individual in a large city like Big D like Dallas get from the name NJ Rogers or the Rogers Optometric Corporation?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2555.561,2557.726,We think that he does get significantly more information.
1978.77-1163,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2557.726,2563.006,"Where it is I mean they don't know Mr. Rogers from far back, do they?"
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2563.006,2569.977,"No, but at least when the name is part of the practice, they can have an opportunity to check out the particular reputation of that optometrist."
1978.77-1163,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2569.977,2571.458,Where?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2571.458,2573.68,"Through their friends, through acquaintances, they can; it's more --"
1978.77-1163,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2573.68,2578.06,"Well, they can checkout the company too with friends and acquaintances?"
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2578.06,2586.396,They can checkout the company but there may be 100 optometrists at their company and that wouldn't give them the information as to the reputation of the individual practitioner.
1978.77-1163,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2586.396,2593.107,"Well, you don't know how many people NJ Rogers are perceiving to doing it?"
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2593.107,2598.373,"There are -- in this particular case, there are a great many."
1978.77-1163,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2598.373,2603.386,I mean normally these people are practiced as individuals.
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2611.839,2612.4,That's true but --
1978.77-1163,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2612.4,2615.027,-- or you don't know the technician is?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2615.027,2616.582,But the --
1978.77-1163,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2616.582,2618.954,You just don't know?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2622.849,2634.068,I think that the State of Texas has right in trying to do encourage the situation that you would know to encourage the doctor-patient relationship and encourage the possibilities.
1978.77-1163,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2634.068,2638.638,"Suppose, you put out on your door everybody that worked in there."
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2657.625,2662.181,The important relationship the state is trying to promote is the doctor-patient relationship.
1978.77-1163,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2662.181,2665.879,"Well, with this I am true at this."
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2688.281,2690.849,That would certainly provide more information than just the practice underneath --
1978.77-1163,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2690.849,2694.262,They will be qualified under your law?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2694.262,2705.34,That's correct because the legislature felt that the abuses were so potentially harmful to the public that they outlawed the trade name practice completely.
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2718.0,2728.831,"I take it if the single practitioner can practice under his own name and with 20 employees, all of them were doing same thing here."
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2728.831,2729.385,That's correct.
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.385,2741.279,And that patients will come and visit anyone of those of employees and perhaps never see them in whose name is on the door?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2741.279,2742.684,That's possible.
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2742.684,2750.113,And none of these other -- none of the names of the employees have to be on the door or on any stationary or anything?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2750.113,2751.546,They have to be in the office.
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.582,2755.463,Their licenses?
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2755.463,2755.6,Yes.
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.6,2757.892,"But they don't have their names, not have to be listed?"
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2757.892,2758.976,No.
1978.77-1163,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2758.976,2762.405,They just have to have the license on the wall.
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2762.405,2763.057,That's correct.
1978.77-1163,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2763.057,2772.753,"But if the practitioner, whose name is there, is he subject to this 50% work at the office?"
1978.77-1163,1,21386,dorothy_prengler,,2772.753,2781.016,Yes.
1978.77-1163,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2781.016,2784.703,Mr. Keith?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,2784.703,2788.701,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the court."
1978.77-1163,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2824.739,2834.694,"When you say a package of information, do you mean that its quality and reliability and that its continuity of the organization, that sort of thing you mean by the package?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,2834.694,2835.807,That is correct.
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2888.848,2909.584,"Well, Mr. Keith, supposing that Dr. Rogers instead of being the optometrist business, was in the business of a murder for a hire, could he take out an ad in the paper, not withstanding a prohibition in Texas Law, saying, I have been a successful murderer for hire for 30 years?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,2909.584,2915.504,No Your Honor and the court spoke specifically to that court in the Pittsburgh Press case.
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2925.182,2935.14,"Well, that's what the state argues here too, isn't that, that the underlying activity, this particular type of practice is illegal and therefore he may not advertise it as such."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,2935.14,2936.734,"That's the argument, yes sir."
1978.77-1163,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2936.734,2938.871,"Then again gets a little circular, do they?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,2941.262,2947.481,That's correct but the underlying activity that here is the practice of optometry is legal.
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2980.744,2981.464,By all means.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,2981.464,2988.901,"In this way, Dr. Rogers practices under the trade name Texas State Optical."
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3085.308,3109.293,"So I am sure many securities registrants have taken the position with the SEC that they have disclosed everything that needs to be disclosed and that nonetheless the SEC has taken the position that, ‘no, you have not, you have either not disclosed a fact that ought to be disclosed or one of the statements you are making is misleading'."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3120.216,3126.382,"Well sir, we have made full disclosure and let's put that to rest."
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3159.734,3160.834,The Supreme Court of Texas?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3160.834,3161.589,Yes sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3280.729,3322.256,"But this is a regulation of business and it is my understanding of the constitution that states are entitled to adopt prophylactic rules, that perhaps may sweep more broadly than is necessary if they are intended to prevent deception, that very likely some people who would have no intend to deceive will be required to seize certain practices or perhaps disclose more than would be required if you were to judge each case on an individual basis, but that is what a statute is all about it; it avoids the necessity of judging each case on an individual basis."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3322.256,3327.461,"Yes, this is respectfully your Honor, a regulation of speech and not of conduct."
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3382.536,3398.095,"But the state also said, you may not practice under a trade name and if the state's substantive provision in that regard is permissible, certainly it can prohibit the advertising of a trade name."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3398.095,3411.498,"The substantive provision would be business conduct, and the state could otherwise regulate business conduct without stamping out all element of speech and that is what the state has chosen to do."
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3411.498,3422.018,"Well, are you saying that when the state regulates business conduct, it must follow some sort of a least restrictive alternative tests that has previously been reserved for the First Amendment cases?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3422.018,3422.494,Yes sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3441.037,3445.041,"Mr. Keith, you mention a Carp case."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3468.134,3471.109,Your honor –
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3471.109,3473.797,Is Dr. Carp still in business?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3473.797,3474.863,"No sir, he is not."
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3474.863,3477.639,Does Dr. Rogers operated under the same name all over the state?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3477.639,3478.583,Yes sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3478.583,3482.611,Could he operate under ten different names?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3482.611,3494.796,"Yes sir, unless such practice and I think this is the key; unless such practice constituting some type of fraud, deception or misrepresentation."
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3494.796,3508.136,"In the Carp case, Dr. Carp operated three offices in one city within two blocks of each other, each under a different name, with the same man supervising them."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3513.287,3522.575,"It would be possible unless Your Honor there were some type of fraud or deception, then the statute speaks, and if that becomes deceptive, then he cannot."
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3522.575,3526.1,Question might be whether or not it's inherently deceptive?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3526.1,3526.875,Yes sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3538.441,3552.815,"In the Carp case, the optometrist as I understood it, can circulate among the 71 offices, so that the one who served you today might be in an entirely different city next month."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3565.108,3574.494,"Respectfully sir, that is still possible today, under Justice White's example, where one man employed 20 optometrists."
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3585.409,3587.8,Certainly.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3587.8,3590.174,Answering the Court's question with respect to Carp.
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3595.672,3597.768,Quite buy the trade name?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3597.768,3610.397,"He would buy up Mr. Johns and then he would claim to use the name John's Optical, then he would buy up Dr. Smith and he would claim to use the name Dr. Smith and these two offices would be two blocks apart."
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3614.684,3618.166,You mean you can't buy a trade name in Texas.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3618.166,3624.31,"Yes sir, you can buy an optometric practice, but you can operate in office but you cannot operate it under someone else's name."
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3624.31,3634.709,"Yes, but most of Dr. Carp's names didn't have the name of any individual, I recall one, maybe I am wrong."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3634.709,3636.209,Luck Optical.
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3636.209,3650.94,"Luck Cutraid Optical or with that effect, Luck, one price optical, could you sell that trade name in Texas together with the business associated with it?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3650.94,3657.068,"Yes sir, under the general law of Texas, the trade name is an item of property that can be conveyed."
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3657.068,3658.687,"That's the general law around the country, as I have understood it."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3658.687,3659.871,Yes sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3700.137,3704.607,But the book is supposed to convey information forthwith.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3704.607,3704.815,Yes sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3704.815,3714.842,"The trade name conveys information, meaningful information if its merely a trade name rather than the name of a doctor only after it acquires a secondary meaning."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3714.842,3715.282,Yes sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3715.282,3717.011,And that may be years.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3717.011,3727.903,"That is true but in this instance of the Plaintiff, in this case, he has acquired that secondary meaning after 39 years of the highest form of quality service and integrity."
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3727.903,3734.223,"I am sure that is right, I was not thinking about Dr. Rogers, I was just generalizing about the defect of that statute."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3734.223,3746.292,"Yes sir I appreciate that, but the trade name and the court has recognized it does convey valuable information and the facts Dr. Benham's testimony in this case reflects the same example."
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3746.854,3758.012,What you wouldn't - - would you say Texas could not require that optometry be practiced only by individual practitioners?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3758.012,3759.718,If there were illegitimate --
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3759.718,3763.642,This is a general rule that if you want to practice optometry you do so by yourself.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3763.642,3765.809,"Yes sir, I believe the state could adopt that rule."
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3765.809,3772.618,And what about not only you must practice by yourself but you must practice under your own name.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3772.618,3777.832,"No sir, that's where the ruler runs afoul of the First Amendment."
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3779.316,3785.76,You say that the Texas could not require that people who individual practitioners to use their own name in the practice.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3785.76,3793.362,That is correct sir because the trade name and the use of the trade name conveys valuable information.
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3807.315,3811.702,"What information does this -- this is in the commercial area, I take it is in that."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3811.702,3813.149,"Yes sir, it is."
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3813.149,3820.682,What information does the trade name convey to somebody?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3820.682,3834.005,"It conveys information with respect to integrity, quality of service, price, convenience, availability, hours of service, length of service to the community, your grandmother and my aunt and our next door neighbor."
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3834.005,3837.987,Something that is -- just take my example now.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3851.077,3851.655,Yes sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3851.655,3852.38,What is it?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3852.38,3862.301,"As Justice Powell indicated, the trade name would convey this information after the public had become -- had come to associate with it."
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3863.064,3868.221,"Well, only if that happened and the same thing that happened with the individuals' name."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3868.221,3875.416,"Yes sir, in the course of time but the trial court here found as a matter of fact that this trade name had developed the association."
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3875.416,3885.453,But wouldn't the only reason that trade name acquire any secondary meaning or convey some information is because of the kind of service that the people behind the trade name gave.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3885.453,3892.479,"Yes sir and that would be true whether that service was good or bad, it would convey in a word quickly --"
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3892.479,3905.411,"But if suddenly tomorrow, the same people are not behind the trade name, is there any reality to this meaning of the trade name?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3914.114,3915.737,Let us say for example --
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3915.737,3918.308,"It happens all the time, doesn't it?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3918.308,3921.976,If the Court Mafia were to come in and take over and you are just another --
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3921.976,3925.525,"No, just some lousy optometrist came in and took over it."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3928.075,3934.056,"Then immediately that trade name would begin to connote lousy service, poor integrity, poor quality."
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3934.056,3946.58,"Not for a while and that Texas says, if you are going to change the people, they just don't want the people behind the trade name to change without it being noted."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3946.58,3958.839,"Mr. Justice, while the State of Texas could simply say that in the practice of optometry, you cannot change ownership of a trade name period, that would be a permissible --"
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3958.839,3971.57,"But it is just said if the people who have given the value to this trade name are suddenly they are no longer and have been replaced by somebody else, please put it on the letterhead, put it on the door or something."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3971.57,3974.569,Or that it is not subject to being conveyed.
1978.77-1163,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3975.904,3984.912,"Weren't we told a little while ago that unless the person whose name appears, spends 50% of his time there, you can't use that name?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,3984.912,3997.887,"That is the present provision and that is the provision -- that is a part of the prohibition, the blanket suppression of the use of the trade name and that's what the Texas Court struck down."
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3997.887,4018.09,"But that is itself a substitutive prohibition, not a prohibition of speaking about something that is lawfully permitted, I think as White said, what Texas is saying is that if you are practicing optometry, you may not do so under a trade name because of the potential for deceptiveness."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4033.783,4040.096,"No, respectively sir, it is not a substantive regulation, it is a suppression of speech because the very use of a trade name."
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4055.732,4070.084,"Well, supposing in a securities case, the perspective corporation is named the (Inaudible) States and the Securities and Exchange Commission decides that, that has a potential for deceptiveness."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4080.015,4080.537,No sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4088.894,4099.017,But you said the state cannot legislate a prophylactic rule that it is got to deal with a case by case basis.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4099.017,4103.569,"Well, not necessarily on a case by case basis."
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4109.83,4111.975,What about the subject of trade names?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4123.234,4128.612,"No sir, only the state could prevent him from using any type of deceptive name."
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4128.612,4130.939,Including a trade name?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4130.939,4138.033,"If they were deceptive and in this instance, the trail court found as a matter of fact that this is not a misleading or a deceptive name."
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4138.033,4143.759,And you feel that three judge district court has right to substitute its judgment for the legislature on that?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4143.759,4152.1,"No sir, but it is required to make a finding of fact just to whether or not this question, this use is or is not misleading."
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4152.1,4161.453,The three judge district court in dealing with a constitutional challenge to a statute is required to make a finding of fact as to whether a trade name is misleading?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4161.453,4173.524,"Yes sir because if it were misleading, then there would be no impermissible infringement on speech because the court has held that the state can suppress misleading speech."
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4206.66,4219.194,"Could Texas require that if you want to do business under a trade name, you must go up to the state house or down to the county clerk's office and file a statement of the names of the people who are behind the trade name."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4219.194,4221.115,Yes sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4221.115,4222.899,And keep it constantly current?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4222.899,4231.221,"Yes sir and prohibit as you suggest respectively sir, and prohibit the transfer of that name in the practice of a profession."
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4231.221,4235.304,But you don't think they can make them put the names on the door.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4235.304,4238.06,"Yes sir, I think they can make them put the name on the door as well."
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4238.06,4247.287,Can they make them put the names of everybody in the group on their stationary and in their advertisements?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4248.788,4254.017,"No sir, if that becomes necessary, they can, but that is not what they have done Mr. Justice White."
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4264.061,4270.68,"Is it doing a business under a trade name, if you use a trade name and then give all the names."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4270.68,4271.822,"Yes sir, it would be."
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4278.274,4286.646,"If you really would not care very much, if you had to put down all the names, would you really want to use the trade names?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4286.646,4298.013,"Yes indeed because the trade name is valuable, it has a substantial communicative value and thus is of substantial value to my client."
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4298.013,4302.979,You want to value that past activity as given to it even though the people are different.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4302.979,4303.289,No sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4321.039,4323.668,I did not get a direct answer.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4327.863,4329.816,"No sir, they are not presently required to do so."
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4329.816,4333.746,"Alright, if they could be, you say it would be alright?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4333.746,4335.352,"That is my belief, yes sir."
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4335.352,4344.486,"Well, does that mean all other names of all of the offices on all of the office doors?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4344.486,4353.873,"If there were some interest of the state to be served by such and this did not become an oppressive burden to speech, I would think so, yes sir."
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4353.873,4356.538,But is it oppressive burden of speech?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4356.538,4370.874,"If I am required to list 200 names on a letterhead, that would become oppressive because it could not write anything else on the paper and thus it would constitute I think an impingement of speech, but the state has not done that."
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4370.874,4373.978,"So, what is your answer to my question."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4386.92,4407.114,"Yes sir, I believe the state can require until it becomes an oppressive burden and effectively deny a speech, and that is my intellectually honest belief that it is not unreasonable until it constitutes a denial of speech."
1978.77-1163,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4407.114,4420.184,"Do you see any analogy between the situation you are discussing and the rule of this court that required you to sign your own name to this brief, not your firm's name?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4426.318,4432.576,Yes sir and I made the identical disclosure to this court that Dr. Rogers makes to his patient.
1978.77-1163,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4447.771,4456.54,"So, not the advertising to extent there is any advertising material."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4460.511,4466.124,"That would be done in the name of Texas State Optical, yes sir and in his trade name."
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4466.124,4469.295,Which he can put on the prescription?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4469.295,4471.554,"Yes sir, he can put that on the prescription and it is --"
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4471.554,4474.146,I thought he had to put his own name on.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4474.146,4477.468,He can put his own name on there as well.
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4477.468,4478.795,I thought he had to put his own name.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4478.795,4480.44,He must put his own name on the prescription.
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4480.44,4481.443,That was my question.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4485.817,4487.801,"That is correct, yes sir."
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4496.115,4500.83,Not Dr. Rogers didn't -- Dr. Rogers did not sign all of those prescriptions?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4500.83,4503.912,"No sir, no sir, the man who perform the examination --"
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4503.912,4508.913,"Now when he made that advertisement, then the people get idea that he will."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4508.913,4516.196,"No sir, because he does not hold out to the public that he is present and he is performing the examination."
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4518.579,4530.075,"In fact, Mr. Keith, is it not true that he may not, not only does not, but may not disclose his ownership of 64 of the 65 offices he owns."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4537.856,4545.172,"Yes sir, he may not hold himself out as practicing in that office and that may be different."
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4545.172,4554.015,"Well therefore is it not true that even though he is the Managing Director in a sense of all of those offices, nothing in those offices would so reveal."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4554.015,4555.203,That is correct.
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4555.203,4559.259,Now do you challenge the statutory provision that requires that non-disclosure?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4559.259,4560.211,No sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4560.211,4560.722,You don't?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4560.722,4570.612,"No sir, because in the case of Dr. Carp, there was a suggestion that some type of misrepresentation arose."
1978.77-1163,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4570.612,4572.875,"Who was that, Wichita Falls?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4572.875,4576.808,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4590.718,4604.536,"Do you think there is a higher value and Dr. Rogers being able to tell the public that TOA, the trade name whatever it is operates the office else where, than his ability to tell them that he operates, he does not assert to write it to disclose his own connection with these other offices."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4604.536,4620.723,"Yes sir, there is a higher right, because he is in association with others and they have developed as Justice Powell suggested a secondary meaning of goodwill and reputation attended to a high quality of service through many, many years."
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4620.723,4627.812,But couldn't he get the same secondary meaning attached to his own name if it was made clear that he is the dominant figure in all these offices.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4627.812,4641.628,It might but he has been at this for 39 years and it would be very difficult to start over and acquire the same reputational interest and goodwill in any reasonable period of time and it is this interest which is not only --
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4641.628,4644.696,Because that is a property interest?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4644.696,4652.812,"Yes sir, it is a property interest, the reputation and goodwill."
1978.77-1163,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4747.475,4755.639,"Mr. Keith, you mentioned the Federal Trade Commission Regulation, do you think that has any bearing on this case?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4755.639,4757.47,Respectfully I do not sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4766.029,4768.583,"Mr. Keith, you talk of constraining information."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4782.087,4782.931,Yes sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4782.931,4798.655,"What if 64 of the offices do and sit and the 65th has a different opening and closing hours and has a very crabby receptionist, and has different things, wouldn't that 65th office get the benefit of the information as the other 64 which would not be true?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4798.655,4803.869,And if those facts occurred and there is no evidence in this record --
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4803.869,4810.109,"Certainly we cannot assume that in fact all 65 offices are precisely identical in all respects, can we?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4810.109,4816.389,"I think that is correct Your Honor, but the trade name does not guarantee human inviolability."
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4816.389,4821.77,"But it does not really guarantee any specific item of information will be true in the 65th office, does it?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4821.77,4822.99,"That is correct, but it does --"
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4822.99,4825.444,Then what information is constrained?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4825.444,4846.854,"It does represent that this bundle of services is available and if this constitutes a misrepresentation, then the state has another statute, it does not need to rely on the trade name ban, it has another statute to preclude and suppress that misrepresentation."
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4846.854,4855.633,I understand but you have not identified for me any specific item of information that is constrained by the enforcement of the statute.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4855.633,4857.519,It is the entire bundle of information.
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4857.519,4860.465,Which may or may not be true in particular cases.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4860.465,4871.319,Which factually Your Honor under this record is true except with respect may be to the enthusiasm which one or another professional may apply to his work in any given day.
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4871.319,4877.034,This record shows that all 65 are equally graded?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4877.034,4887.343,"Rather Your Honor, the record is absolutely silent, the record says that these offices all operate in this manner and there is no suggestion to the contrary."
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4887.343,4892.47,But you can say that two doctors are equal.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4892.47,4896.461,No sir and the record does not suggest such.
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4901.208,4902.166,How many optometrists.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4902.166,4904.71,I would think substantially 100.
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4904.71,4910.414,But is there anyway in the world that those 100 could be the same?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4910.414,4911.165,No sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4911.165,4922.444,There are 100 different reasons with 100 different offices operating in 65 different places under 65 different circumstances.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4922.444,4940.782,"But at the same time Your Honor neither could every associate or every lawyer at Covington & Burling, be the same but the use of the name Cromball & Solomon (ph) or Covington & Burling does convey to the listener a reputation for integrity, ability, industry, service to the client."
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4940.782,4944.104,Not in all 64 of these offices?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4944.104,4944.806,That's correct.
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4944.806,4946.847,Do they have 64?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4946.847,4959.248,And not in any one of the offices are both lawyers of the same industry ability and integrity but as a whole the trade name conveys valuable information with respect to that firm.
1978.77-1163,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4959.248,4968.911,"It is quite sort of like McDonald's hamburger, you know generally what to expect wherever you find it, isn't that the idea, even though there is a variation among cooks and among stores?"
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4968.911,4974.247,There is a lot of difference between having Dyspepsia and going blind.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,4974.247,4987.182,Yes sir but and that is true and the state has very carefully and very closely regulated the optometrist in his professional functions to make certain that he does provide a minimum standard of care.
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4987.182,5000.222,"Mr. Keith, if Covington & Burling decided they wanted to practice under the name “Big Judgments”, would they have a constitutional right to do so?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5000.222,5004.97,"Your Honor, could I state it differently, if my firm wanted to practice under the name “Big Judgments” --"
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5004.97,5009.662,"I will say ‘Quality Practice' then. Say what you said, would they have a constitutional right?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5009.662,5017.961,No sir because I think that represents some type of puffing that and some type of deceit associated with puffing.
1978.77-1163,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5017.961,5021.07,"They are defense counsel, so they practice under the name Small Ones."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5021.07,5023.741,"That would be more appropriate, yes sir."
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5026.476,5044.748,"What about the name “Prompt Service” something like, so it is something that they could demonstrate was not deceitful at all with respect to their own operation, could they have a constitutional right to use a name, you know some non-personal name just the trade like TOA."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5044.748,5045.346,Yes sir.
1978.77-1163,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5045.346,5046.525,You think they have a constitutional right.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5046.525,5056.719,"Yes sir because that involves the essential element of communication of speech and so long as it is non-deceptive, then it is protected by the First Amendment guarantee."
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5056.719,5067.253,"I couldn't protect myself in private practice from being called a Freebie Lawyer, but that is alright."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5067.253,5078.369,May I turn Your Honor respectfully for a moment to the question of equal protection raised in the matter of board appointment.
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5230.327,5252.016,"What if the incoming Governor of Texas, whomever that may be, were to announce as part of his platform that he was going to make sure that four out of the six members of the Texas Optometry -- Texas Board or members of the TOA during his administration."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5257.461,5263.773,"If that became a pattern or practice that became state policy, I think so."
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5274.568,5286.044,"What if say a Governor appointing judges says, I think we need more representation of certain groups, do you think someone who isn't appointed could challenge that?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5286.044,5299.07,"No sir, I do not until it became a policy that was discriminatory because of the exercise of a fundamental interest such as free speech."
1978.77-1163,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5299.07,5301.02,Until it became the equivalent of State Law.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5301.02,5302.864,Yes sir or --
1978.77-1163,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5302.864,5303.524,The equivalent.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5303.524,5305.355,"The equivalent of State Law, thank you."
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5305.355,5313.232,How about the state statutes that says that three members of the commission must be appointed from the opposite party?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5313.232,5317.134,That is the Federal Power Commission Regulation under Federal Law and --
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5317.134,5319.954,"No, I am talking about the Texas."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5327.044,5327.872,Yes sir but --
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5327.872,5331.331,"That on this commission, there have been so many members of the opposite party."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5331.331,5336.081,And the purpose there is to achieve a legitimate balance.
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5336.081,5338.24,"I assume so, they don't say what."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5338.24,5341.121,Yes sir and I do not know those cases frankly.
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5341.121,5342.62,"Well, may you know it is a fact then?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5342.62,5343.906,"Yes sir, I do know what is the fact."
1978.77-1163,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5343.906,5347.842,And nobody is objected to design level
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5347.842,5351.613,I am not aware of the basis of the decision in that respect.
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5351.613,5358.564,"There are statutes that provide that and so far as I know they have never been challenged, how do you distinguish them from this statute that you are challenging?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5358.564,5365.898,"Because in this instance, I am excluded from consideration because I have exercised this fundamental right."
1978.77-1163,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5369.169,5389.604,"Well, if they are sort of published in the agency and Federal Trade commission or a democratic vacancy on the Federal Trade Commission, presumably all people of the opposite party are excluded because they have exercised their First Amendment right of free association to belong to the party which vacancy doesn't belong to."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5389.604,5399.923,"Yes sir, but in the course of -- we are not speaking about just one appointment, we are now speaking about the course or let us say three appointments or four appointments."
1978.77-1163,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5441.866,5443.567,60 out of how many?
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5452.901,5454.185,I cannot answer that question in fact.
1978.77-1163,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5454.185,5456.322,"Then it does not mean very much, does it?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5456.322,5466.694,"Except that it represents, Your Honor, the fact that not only is your bias in the appointment but this has a substantial impact in the service upon the Board."
1978.77-1163,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5466.694,5470.924,Not unless you tell us the rest of the story.
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5470.924,5472.24,May I ask --
1978.77-1163,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5472.24,5474.796,"6 out of 600, is it in the record?"
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5474.796,5476.473,It is in the record yes sir but you would have to be --
1978.77-1163,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5476.473,5479.147,"From the record, you can tell us, but if it isn't, you cannot."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5479.147,5481.09,By post-submission memorandum.
1978.77-1163,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5481.09,5485.182,"If it is in the record, point out to where in the record that appears."
1978.77-1163,2,39660,robert_q_keith,,5485.182,5486.276,"Thank you, sir."
1978.77-1163,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5486.276,5487.045,Thank you gentlemen.
