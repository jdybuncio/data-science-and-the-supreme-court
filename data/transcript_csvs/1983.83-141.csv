1983.83-141,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.908,"We will hear arguments next in Hawaii Housing Authority against Frank E. Midkiff, et al.--"
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,76.916,82.302,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,595.103,598.539,Precisely when does title pass to the lessee?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,598.539,613.382,"Under that scheme, title passes from the landowner to the Hawaii Housing Authority at the time a judgment is made condemning the land, but it does not pass at that stage, Justice Brennan."
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,613.382,614.417,"Well, when is valuation?"
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,616.601,622.94,"The valuation process is determined by a jury trial, and the jury trial occurs before title passes."
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,627.475,628.559,Before title passes?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,628.559,629.511,Before title passes.
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,634.747,636.147,When is it paid?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,638.116,644.353,--Compensation is paid after the trial to determine what a fair amount of compensation would be.
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,653.642,664.517,"But after the Authority takes title, the valuation has been fixed and the money's been paid, when does the title pass to the tenant?"
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,664.517,666.05,"Well, it may never pass to the tenant."
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,690.917,691.901,Presumably?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,691.901,712.164,"--Well, because the statute is not entirely clear on that subject, and on its face the statute suggests, although its purposes I think would best be served by giving priority to the tenant, the statute really places discretion in the state to decide how best to dispose of the now disaggregated landholdings, and the--"
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,712.164,718.984,"Well, you said, I think, that the landowner is only one of a group of 25 or whatever that number is."
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,718.984,720.001,--That's right.
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,720.001,722.353,But he may end up not ever getting title?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,722.353,732.828,"Well, if it should turn out that circumstances changed and that the landowner no longer wants to purchase or no longer can purchase, because his eligibility must be determined both when the land is designated--"
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,732.828,736.613,"Well, how about the agency just doesn't want now to sell to him?"
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,737.53,743.617,--I think that I would argue that the agency doesn't have unfettered discretion simply to hold onto it.
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,759.061,760.145,And lease it to somebody else?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,760.145,761.311,Possibly.
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,820.886,828.973,Do you think the agency could just hang on until they can get a better price than the valuation put on in the condemnation proceeding?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,828.973,833.11,"Were it to do that, I think it might violate the prescription against running the system for profit."
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,894.815,902.319,"And then I take it if the occupant finally acquired title to the land, he could sell it?"
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,902.319,904.087,"That's right, the occupant could sell it."
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,904.087,905.737,No limitations whatever?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,905.737,906.639,Exactly.
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,938.408,944.062,And did you say the operation of the statute has simply been suspended pending the result of this litigation?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,944.062,944.998,"Well, not entirely, Justice Brennan."
1983.83-141,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,979.301,994.228,"Professor Tribe, I may be mistaken, but I thought there was one exception, and that was if the tenant ultimately acquired the property he could not sell within ten years."
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,994.228,997.18,Without giving the HHA an option first to purchase.
1983.83-141,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,998.513,1000.049,There is that exception?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1000.049,1001.299,"Yes, there are certain limitations."
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1013.29,1017.927,Is there anything in the statute which limits the time that the HHA can hold?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1017.927,1030.318,"If the HHA has not otherwise put the market... put the property up for sale and the purchase price is tendered, I believe within 60 days, title must then pass to the qualified purchaser."
1983.83-141,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.318,1041.876,"Mr. Tribe, does the Act apply to the undeveloped tracts of land that these group of landowners refuse to sell?"
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1041.876,1043.342,No.
1983.83-141,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1044.911,1046.161,"If it did, would you have the same arguments?"
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1046.161,1060.603,"--Well, I suppose if the argument were that their holding of the undeveloped land off the market is itself a sign of oligopoly and that they must be forced to put some of that on the market as well in return for just compensation--"
1983.83-141,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1060.603,1061.289,Wouldn't you have to?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1061.289,1070.811,"--I think we would be making exactly the same argument, though I suppose that the record in the case would look different and the findings that the legislature made would be quite different in character."
1983.83-141,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.806,1156.251,"Well, in Hawaii now is all the vacant land that was available now used up, that is available for individual single family dwellings?"
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1156.251,1157.517,"Well, Justice White--"
1983.83-141,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1157.517,1158.401,Is it pretty well exhausted?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1158.401,1163.155,--There certainly is a shortage of land for single family dwellings.
1983.83-141,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.094,1180.164,"As long as they don't, as long as they don't the available land is now taken up for single family dwellings?"
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1180.164,1183.366,"--There is some more, but the shortage is substantial."
1983.83-141,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1183.366,1196.875,And what percentage of the single family residential ownership is... or residential units is made up of--
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1196.875,1198.744,Of these leaseholds?
1983.83-141,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1198.744,1199.394,--Yes.
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1199.394,1215.504,"Well, I suppose the statistic that I think may be most responsive to that question, Justice White, is that of the single family houses on Oahu, the percentage that are on leased land has been rising up until at least 1978."
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1221.491,1223.36,"Well now, we're talking only about Oahu?"
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1223.36,1225.229,"That's right, because the problem is different."
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1225.229,1226.662,Is it different on Hawaii and Kaui?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1226.662,1227.395,That's right.
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1232.799,1234.75,"Well, the problem is quite different in the other islands, isn't it?"
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1234.75,1235.484,"--Well, the legislature--"
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1235.484,1239.202,Doesn't Oahu have half of the total population?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1239.202,1244.94,--It's the overwhelming population center and the overwhelming center of the urban residential problem.
1983.83-141,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1250.527,1261.402,"Is 33 percent or 30 percent, is that normally what standards are for moving into oligopoly?"
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1261.402,1272.542,"Well, but the relevant figure, Justice White, would not, I suppose, be the percentage of homes that are leased, but the percentage of land which is controlled by a group of people who thereby have market force."
1983.83-141,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1272.542,1284.933,"Well, I know, but you just suggested to me that the Act doesn't even purport to deal with the land that is just undeveloped."
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1284.933,1295.122,"But I was trying also to suggest, Justice White, that the economic incentives to hold that land off the market would be changed once competition was restored within the residential area."
1983.83-141,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.605,1298.157,Is that part of the findings?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1298.157,1313.584,"--It is suggested by the legislature that the practices, the market practices of deciding how much land to allow for residential development are affected by the concentration of market power."
1983.83-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1389.0,1408.978,"Mr. Tribe, in determining whether there is a public purpose should the Court look at all at the fact that only the application of private individuals can trigger the effectiveness of this Act--"
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1408.978,1410.163,I would think--
1983.83-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1410.163,1413.615,--and that should be possibly an important factor?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1413.615,1421.055,"--I would think, Justice O'Connor, that unless this Court is to overrule New Motor Vehicle Board v. Fox, that that really cannot be a factor at all."
1983.83-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1434.846,1452.574,"But certainly in the Grendel's Den case we had to look behind the actual ostensible purpose to determine whether it was in fact a secular purpose by the effectiveness of the church involvement, did we not?"
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1452.574,1454.192,"No, Justice O'Connor."
1983.83-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1472.988,1480.843,Certainly this involves exclusive power in a private individual to trigger the operation of the Act.
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1480.843,1488.08,"Quite often the judicial system relies on the exclusive action of a private individual to bring a suit, but that's the way government often works."
1983.83-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1544.534,1553.54,Do you think that the public purpose requirement requires or carries with it any requirement that the public purse be at risk?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1553.54,1555.475,"I think, Justice O'Connor, it doesn't."
1983.83-141,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1564.847,1573.436,Isn't that a sensible sort of a safeguard against a majoritarian taking?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1573.436,1590.898,"I guess, Justice O'Connor, the reason I don't think so, although it has some intuitive appeal, the reason I don't think so is that if the public decides that it wants to spend public money, let's say benefiting a crony of the mayor, so it will take a factory, turn it over to the mayor, I would think it makes matters worse, not better, that the mayor's friend doesn't even have to pay."
1983.83-141,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1612.478,1616.048,"Mr. Tribe, you're pretty half-hearted about the abstention doctrine."
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1626.154,1642.615,"--No, Justice Rehnquist, I believe abstention, unless we go with Justice Brennan's dissent in Thibodaux, that abstention was required, but the Court could quite efficiently say that in dictum and uphold this law on the merits, rather than dragging out what I think is frankly a wholly unsubstantiated attack against the validity of the law."
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1649.869,1659.042,"Well, I thought you suggested earlier that there are so many uncertainties about this statute and the whole scheme that we ought to wait until we hear from the state court."
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1659.042,1662.761,"If you think those uncertainties could invalidate it, then of course you must wait."
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1662.761,1665.379,Suppose we don't?
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1665.379,1673.652,"Then I think it would be proper for the Court either to require abstention or to decide that, since so much water has gone under this--"
1983.83-141,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1673.652,1683.507,"I thought you said earlier that it's presently pending in the Hawaiian Supreme Court, that you were going to urge upon us was reason enough for our insisting on abstention."
1983.83-141,0,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1683.507,1685.209,"--I would like to do just that, I would like to do just that."
1983.83-141,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1770.982,1777.719,Mr. Ashford.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,1777.719,1781.19,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1983.83-141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.225,1871.331,Is there any factual setting in our whole system that's comparable to the situation in Hawaii in terms of land?
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,1871.331,1882.472,"--Hawaii has somewhat of a unique land history, Your Honor, but that unique land history, despite what Mr. Tribe says, has got nothing to do with this."
1983.83-141,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1897.565,1902.635,I don't understand your comment about it being no greater a concentration than in the U.S. as a whole.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,1904.052,1906.254,"Yes, Justice Blackmun."
1983.83-141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1940.492,1950.466,"Well, do you really compare federal lands on that percentage with the land owned by this trust?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,1957.62,1958.556,"Yes, sir."
1983.83-141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1958.556,1960.706,"And they're doing it all the time over the years, aren't they?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,1960.706,1962.841,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.398,1976.017,What percentage of the land is owned by the State of Hawaii?
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,1976.017,1977.683,About 35 percent.
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1977.683,1978.683,On Oahu?
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,1978.683,1983.468,"That's in the state as a whole, and this statute has statewide application."
1983.83-141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2007.266,2015.539,"Well, do any of our cases suggest that the public use requirement of the Fifth Amendment is anything more than what the legislature says it is?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2015.539,2025.878,"Your Honor, our whole point in being here is to urge this Court not to surrender to mere legislative declarations."
1983.83-141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2030.216,2038.222,But what cases do you have in mind from this Court that say this Court should in effect second-guess the legislature as to a public use?
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2038.222,2042.606,"Justice Rehnquist, we're not here to ask this Court to second-guess the legislature."
1983.83-141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2042.606,2052.481,"Well, do you know of any cases that say that this Court may say that something said by the legislature is a public use is not in fact a public use?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2052.481,2073.811,"I would analogize it, Justice Rehnquist, to the situation, to the approach that this Court takes in examining regulations to determine whether those regulations effect a taking, and in that kind of analysis what the Court does is to look at the impact of the statute upon the owner's property."
1983.83-141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.766,2086.218,To decide whether there's been a taking.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2086.218,2087.702,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1983.83-141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2096.843,2098.793,But I don't think that follows at all.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2124.243,2126.445,"That is precisely our position, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.83-141,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2126.445,2140.52,"Well, actually, though, Mr. Ashford, didn't Berman and Parker say explicitly that review of a legislative determination of public use is at best an extremely narrow one?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2140.52,2144.824,"That is correct, it did."
1983.83-141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2204.945,2207.064,How many people joined him in that statement?
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2207.064,2212.551,"That was his concurring opinion, and that is our position here."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.863,2234.132,"Well, the legislature said more than that."
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2241.571,2244.772,"--Well, if this--"
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2244.772,2247.072,You say... it certainly is a reason.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2250.51,2254.295,"--Our point is this, Mr. Justice White."
1983.83-141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2342.27,2358.113,"Well, on your statement about the government being a conduit, wasn't that true in every one of the cases, not here, not in this Court that I'm aware of, where there was a waterfront clearance or a slum clearance?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2372.972,2395.571,"There is very definitely a difference between cases such as those Your Honor mentions, including Berman, and our case, Your Honor, because in those cases there is a government plan, there is a comprehensive detailed study made to bring about a certain change in the use of the land."
1983.83-141,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2423.222,2435.78,"Mr. Ashford, aren't typical antitrust divestiture orders just orders that you take from A to give to B, two private people?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2435.78,2450.805,"Justice O'Connor, I am not an antitrust lawyer, but my understanding of antitrust remedies are that, even with divestiture, the private owner is given an opportunity over a period of time to get rid of the title."
1983.83-141,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2497.353,2515.815,"Well, theoretically, I guess you could have a situation where the private lessee didn't end up paying the bill and the government agency continued to hold the property, is that right?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2515.815,2516.684,Under this statute?
1983.83-141,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2516.684,2517.484,Yes.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2517.484,2518.886,"Theoretically you could, Justice O'Connor."
1983.83-141,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2569.068,2576.972,"Well, is that an argument in favor of abstention, to let the state courts decide the operation of the statute or the policy?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2576.972,2584.244,"There hasn't been any question raised as to how the statute does in fact operate that I am aware of, Justice O'Connor."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2604.492,2606.925,"Well, what's wrong with that declared purpose?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2627.921,2634.344,Because of the aggregate of the methods under which this statute--
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2634.344,2636.811,The owner who has to sell gets his money out of it.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2636.811,2639.546,--But that is just compensation only.
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2640.748,2642.631,"I understand, I understand that."
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2648.152,2651.888,"I don't have any quarrel with that as a public purpose, but under this--"
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2651.888,2653.022,"Well, why isn't the case over, then?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2653.022,2666.296,"--Because under this statute and under the Constitution you cannot constitutionally accomplish that purpose by taking A's property and giving it to B, and that is the core of what the case is about."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.969,2678.171,But that's for the purpose of spreading the ownership of residential real estate.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2680.456,2688.229,"--If the Court please, a legitimate purpose must be accomplished by lawful constitutional means."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2706.94,2721.633,"Well, if that's just going to be your syllogism, how come it's a public use for a railroad to be able to go out and condemn property of a private person, and the title goes directly from one private person to another?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2721.633,2723.235,"There's more to it than that, Mr. Justice."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2723.235,2725.151,"Well, there's a public purpose."
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2728.62,2734.441,But the railroad is in effect similar to government itself.
1983.83-141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2746.331,2748.266,How about your common law easement of necessity?
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2748.266,2752.92,"--I'm not sure I understood your question, Your Honor."
1983.83-141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2752.92,2769.947,"Where a person who owns a parcel of property which has no access to a public road is entitled under many circumstances to condemn an access, one private owner condemn an access through another private owner's property in order to get himself to a public road."
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2773.501,2778.453,"I am only aware of two cases in which this Court has validated such takings, Your Honor."
1983.83-141,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2778.453,2789.01,"Well, do you think if something was uniformly subscribed to at common law in England and in many states in this country it needs this Court to validate it, to call it an accepted practice?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2789.01,2807.555,"There are differences between those cases and this, because it is not merely a private party ending up with title, as in the cases that you mentioned, but in this case the taking is initiated, financed and controlled by the private party."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.76,2889.876,"Well, suppose a group of farmers out West form an irrigation company and their object is to build some ditches and a reservoir and irrigate their farm, and when that company gets formed it suddenly has the power to condemn property, and it takes property from various people for the benefit of this group of farmers."
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2889.876,2908.253,"In that situation you have a scheme, Your Honor, which is wrought by government, if you will, and employed and brings about certain changes in land use, and it makes otherwise worthless land productive, and that is deemed to be useful to the economy."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2911.039,2917.443,"Well, is that very far from saying we ought to have... we ought to spread the ownership of residential property?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2918.645,2931.636,"--Justice White, in this case we end up with a multiplicity of owners, but we don't end up with a multiplicity of new uses or any new productiveness or anything of that nature, as always occurs--"
1983.83-141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2931.636,2937.19,"Well, but it's a much less cluttered use and ownership, is it not?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2950.866,2954.751,"--All of these properties are fully developed, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.83-141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2969.744,2983.921,"But you don't think that there is a state purpose, a public purpose in trying to take some of these fetters off of the ownership?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,2983.921,2987.372,"--Well, the property is now freely alienable, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.83-141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2997.478,3005.501,Then are you suggesting that the purposes of the legislature were not rational?
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3005.501,3015.975,"We think that the purposes were irrational, and the means that they chose to carry out those purposes were irrational, but our case does not depend upon that."
1983.83-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3026.915,3030.116,May I ask sort of a modified question.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3050.713,3053.315,That would be a regulation.
1983.83-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3053.315,3056.367,It would accomplish precisely the same purpose as this statute.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3056.367,3063.206,"If, Your Honor, there was a legitimate objective to be served by--"
1983.83-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3063.206,3069.943,The objective is to increase the ownership of real estate and improve the competition in the market for single family lots.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3069.943,3077.347,"--And they've chosen a means which is reasonably calculated to lead to that end, and I would say it would be constitutional."
1983.83-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3077.347,3080.215,Isn't this means reasonably calculated to lead to that end?
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3080.215,3087.071,But a due process test is not the only test that needs to be applied here.
1983.83-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3088.755,3090.69,"No, there's not a limitation."
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3094.892,3105.617,"There is a requirement also for public use, and it's our position that the public use requirement is not met when you have a taking merely from A to B with--"
1983.83-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3105.617,3120.292,"Well, my example, the hypothetical I gave you, contemplated that all the sales would be to other private purchasers, and I go farther and say that the statute only be enforceable by the suit of a private party, as you have under the antitrust laws an individual can bring suit."
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3128.815,3135.302,--The difference is in the fact that there is an express public use requirement which must be met.
1983.83-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3142.575,3148.728,So you would withdraw your objection if this statute said you must sell your land to the present owner?
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3155.482,3157.667,--That is what the statute in effect does.
1983.83-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3157.667,3163.738,"Well then, but my example... you said there's no problem with my example and my example would require that."
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3163.738,3173.927,"But your example I think, Your Honor, was a bit different, because you were taking about the property being sold to a wide variety of people and not to the particular person who was residing on it."
1983.83-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3173.927,3183.033,"Well, supposing the statute said the owner must sell off parcels of real estate to the present occupants until his ownership is reduced to no more than ten percent of the total acreage in the state."
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3183.033,3192.488,"I think that there would be a very good question, Your Honor, whether or not that would be, notwithstanding it's called a regulation, that it in fact is a taking, and then if so--"
1983.83-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3192.488,3198.578,"No state money involved, no state involvement at all except as a referee on the price, I suppose."
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3198.578,3202.88,"--But nevertheless, there's a mandatory obligation to sell."
1983.83-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3202.88,3205.998,Until you reach the ceiling.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3205.998,3214.921,"And that could constitute a taking, and if so then you have to have a public use, and your hypothetical assumes a legitimate public use."
1983.83-141,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3214.921,3220.825,The very public use that the Hawaiian legislature found to exist in this case.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3225.912,3227.246,"We don't concede to that as a public use, if the Court please."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3363.886,3370.623,"Was this Act challenged just as soon as the first application was made, or have there been a lot of transfers under this Act?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3370.623,3385.3,"There have been so-called ""friendly condemnations"", as the record reflects, where owners did go through the court process and there were transfers made."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.3,3387.333,"Why do you call it ""friendly""?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3389.335,3402.761,"No, I mean, Your Honor, that the HAA, the taking agency, and the party whose property was taken agreed beforehand upon the taking and the price to be paid and so forth, and that's in the testimony of Mr. of Kohatsu."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3402.761,3406.046,"Well, so then is there any history about what happened to the lots?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3406.046,3409.331,Any mystery about what happened to them?
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3409.331,3410.581,"Any history, history."
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3412.117,3413.85,"No, I don't, Your Honor."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3427.543,3431.012,And has the price generally escalated--
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3431.012,3431.947,It has.
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3431.947,3432.681,--or gone down?
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3432.681,3433.397,It has.
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3433.397,3434.264,Gone up?
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3434.264,3434.732,It has.
1983.83-141,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3437.515,3439.184,Mr. Ashford... go ahead.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3450.925,3454.027,"It hasn't operated to lower them, sir."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3454.027,3461.883,"Well, if as soon as the lots are sold the price goes up, the old system certainly didn't escalate the price."
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3461.883,3466.935,"A logical conclusion, Your Honor."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3466.935,3469.12,So there's no market power.
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3485.915,3488.45,"Yes, there have been, Your Honor."
1983.83-141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3488.45,3498.806,"Mr. Ashford, let me try again as to how you would distinguish what took place right here in Washington."
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3527.175,3534.829,"The Hawaiian situation, Your Honor, is entirely different, because when the sales were made here in Washington, D.C.--"
1983.83-141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3534.829,3542.502,"I realize it's quite different, but is it different in principle, in terms of the public nature of the purpose declared?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3542.502,3547.072,"--I think it is entirely different in principle, because there were massive changes in use of the property."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3586.28,3593.767,"What happens in the few cases, in these friendly suits or friendly sales?"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3604.742,3615.966,"All of these have taken place, according to my understanding, Justice White, under rulings from the Internal Revenue Service which have not taxed the proceeds as ordinary income."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3615.966,3629.892,"So that I suppose if your clients were forced to sell a lot of these, many, many lots under this Act... suppose the Act is uphold, so that there'll be hundreds of lots sold under this."
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3638.665,3640.382,I think that they will not be.
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3640.382,3641.617,Not be taxed--
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3641.617,3644.652,"I think that they have not been and that they will not be, if the Act is validated."
1983.83-141,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3644.652,3647.77,"--You mean taxed as what, income or--"
1983.83-141,1,18264,clinton_r_ashford,,3647.77,3649.403,"No, capital gain."
1983.83-141,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3672.553,3675.255,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Tribe?"
1983.83-141,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3675.255,3676.588,"Yes, briefly, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.83-141,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3830.271,3833.723,"Well, that's all the putative condemned asked for in Pennsylvania Coal against Mahon."
1983.83-141,2,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3833.723,3840.127,"--I suppose the condemned, though, might have been happy to have the law wholly invalidated."
1983.83-141,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3887.058,3889.06,"Thank you, gentlemen."
