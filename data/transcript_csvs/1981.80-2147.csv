1981.80-2147,0,17880,bernard_f_mcgovern_jr,,66.725,83.837,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a Title VII disparate impact case dealing with an employee selection process which as a whole had no adverse impact upon the Respondent's protected group, but which contained a component that did."
1981.80-2147,1,42441,thomas_w_bucci,,1684.275,1702.419,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the claim of discrimination by the Respondents in this case is that they were denied a promotional opportunity solely on the basis of the results of an examination that disproportionately excluded black candidates from promotional eligibility."
1981.80-2147,2,17880,bernard_f_mcgovern_jr,,2866.175,2914.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think Mr. Bucci and I can agree on one point, and that is, if there were but one component to this examination process, and if the appointing authority were required to go down the list, one, two, three, four, five, as the examination results ranked the candidates, then there would be a prima facie case, because the examination would in effect be the selection process."
