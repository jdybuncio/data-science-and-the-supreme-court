1965.750,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,30.013,40.87,"Mr. Chief Justice, I move the admission of Paul Bender of the District of Columbia Bar for purposes of arguing in these cases on behalf of the United States."
1965.750,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,40.87,55.656,Mr. Bender you may be admitted for that purpose.
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,55.656,58.845,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.750,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,317.427,319.206,And the discretion of the president is not --
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,319.206,320.347,Right.
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,558.454,574.19,"Let me see, Mr. Bender, do I correctly understand that here, the issue of which after exhaustion of the procedures, the strike occurs for these early wages, is that it?"
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,574.19,576.79,Wages and a notice issue also.
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,582.656,585.07,"But in any event, they were limited issues, were there?"
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,585.07,587.966,"Yes, just wages and that no decision, correct."
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,587.966,594.25,And then after the procedures had all been exhausted the union did go on strike because they're not satisfied with the --
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,594.25,595.191,Right.
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,595.191,597.604,"-- what was it, an award or something of --?"
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,597.604,599.348,No.
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,604.001,610.982,But in any event whatever it might be as I understand it this whole thing about the dispute over some limited issues.
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,610.982,611.215,Yes sir.
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,611.215,614.406,And then after everything had been exhausted there was a lawful strike.
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,614.406,619.807,That's the way you get a lawful strike in the industry. Let me say that now --
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,619.807,625.398,But the -- the carrier then insisted that it had the right and the fact to abrogate all other provisions of the agreement.
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,625.398,626.107,Exactly.
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,626.107,628.973,And substitute its own working conditions.
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,628.973,629.471,Right.
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,629.471,635.54,As -- not only the conditions related to the particular issues involved in dispute but everything else.
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,635.54,637.111,"Right, precisely."
1965.750,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,650.086,661.091,"Now, let me see Mr. Bender, the carrier takes the position that it was free to do this only after the strike -- only after the strike commenced."
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,674.82,676.728,"Under the Act, they were."
1965.750,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,676.728,677.609,How?
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,677.609,677.987,"Well, the Act --"
1965.750,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,677.987,678.717,They have chosen them?
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,678.717,685.689,Because the -- these labor organizations were they're designated -- had been the designated representatives of the employees in those classes.
1965.750,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,685.689,688.269,"But those employees went out -- were all out on strike, weren't they?"
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,688.269,700.209,"Well, the union members I assume were all out on strike, at least most of them were but under the Act there had never been a new designation of representatives and the Act does not contain any provision."
1965.750,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,709.514,710.8,And here they --
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,710.8,711.743,The only way you --
1965.750,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,711.743,718.445,I mean the union didn't lose them but -- but all of those employees were out on a strike.
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,718.445,720.112,The union members were out on a strike.
1965.750,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,720.112,723.226,All of them represented -- who have been represented by these --
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,723.226,723.485,Right.
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,727.973,729.11,Including the replacement.
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,729.11,730.693,Including the replacement.
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,730.693,738.738,And I gather your position is that the replacements have to work at least as regardless all issues are kept to in dispute.
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,738.738,740.506,Surely.
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,740.506,744.672,Under the working conditions of the contract specified.
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,744.672,749.306,We -- we believe that the replacements are entitled to the benefits of the -- or the agreements upon negotiate --
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,749.306,751.613,"Well, to be entitled but --"
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,751.613,752.329,"Well, and they must."
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,899.513,905.46,Well did the -- did the Court of Appeals suggest some statutory source for that authority?
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,905.46,916.384,"No, Mr. Justice Brennan it, as I read the opinion, suggested that it arose out of the right to operate of a railroad, out of the right to self-help during a strike."
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,956.202,957.774,"Well, what's it that it's suggesting?"
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,957.774,961.119,It came from the right of a carrier to operate.
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,961.248,962.125,Where is that?
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,962.957,964.4,I don't know.
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,965.83,967.003,They say it was constitutional?
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,967.003,969.333,"No, they didn't suggest it was a constitutional right."
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,984.964,989.603,Was there any suggesting that -- the statute by implication?
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,989.603,989.857,I don't --
1965.750,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,989.857,990.625,Is that right?
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,990.625,995.373,I don't find that in the Court of Appeals opinion and I don't see where it could be found.
1965.750,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,995.639,1003.386,Are you suggesting Mr. Bender that the railroad didn't have the -- it's not the right to operate at least fairly they're trying to operate?
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,1003.386,1003.995,Oh no.
1965.750,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1013.449,1018.84,"And you say that it's not a constitutional right, I mean true acts against right or cases like that, you think you can --"
1965.750,1,37685,paul_bender,,1018.84,1024.792,"Well, I suppose you might say there's an abstract right of a railroad operator --"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3175.054,3180.418,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3241.744,3244.049,What was the statute's [Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3244.049,3262.165,This is the position that Mr. .Bender suggested that there might be things such as the use of supervisors that we could do and that we didn't raise the question and that if the unions had been asked about it and there the disagreement it would go to the adjustment board.
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3269.24,3271.565,I thought you referred to something [Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3271.565,3272.83,"Oh, I did."
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3300.665,3304.311,"Well, is there anything in the agreement that gives you that right?"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3304.311,3306.236,"There is not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3306.236,3312.217,"Well, did you raise that question with the union?"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3312.217,3312.389,We did not.
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3312.389,3313.549,[Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3313.549,3313.86,We did not Mr. Chief Justice.
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3313.86,3324.674,In other words you never did it until after you had unilaterally adopted that factors and we're in the courts.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3324.786,3329.999,"We -- we didn't raise it with the unions, Mr. Chief Justice and they didn't raise it with us."
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3329.999,3330.771,Well I --
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3330.771,3331.464,That's correct.
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3331.464,3335.879,"Yes, but it was never raised by you until you're in the Courts."
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3335.879,3337.173,That is correct Your Honor.
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3337.173,3349.324,And was that a condition of not doing some of the other things that you were doing or it's just something that you demanded in the Court as a matter of relief?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3349.324,3362.227,"Mr. Chief Justice, we have never contended or asserted the right to do anything except what was necessary under the strike conditions in order to operate the railroad."
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3772.476,3775.907,What -- what happened [Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3775.907,3781.091,"Mr. Justice Brennan, we say that the agreement is there."
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3783.981,3786.396,[Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3786.396,3788.236,It's -- we say suspended.
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3788.236,3802.084,"I mean, for example [Inaudible] I gather that you don't -- they'll have a duty to bargain over the issue which was brought on the strike."
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3802.084,3803.285,None whatever Your Honor.
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3803.285,3804.263,There's none.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3804.263,3806.037,We -- we do not question that.
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3808.146,3810.013,Right.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3830.47,3843.839,"Well, Your Honor the -- at anytime the strike is settled, the agreements then become full blown, fully applicable and must without question be complied with in every respect."
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3843.839,3848.035,So that your position really is only during the continuance --
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3848.035,3848.426,That --
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3848.426,3849.753,-- to those determinations.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3849.753,3850.378,That is correct.
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3850.378,3856.659,The condition herein [Inaudible] so that you may in a factual manner operate the railroad [Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3856.659,3859.964,That is precisely our position Your Honor.
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3859.964,3864.002,"Now, may I ask this Mr. Devaney?"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,3910.39,3918.196,"Your Honor at any time, let us take the strike which began strictly as a wage dispute."
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4026.361,4031.84,"Well, I wondered if you could answer my question a little more specifically."
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4051.563,4052.874,"Oh yes, indeed Your Honor."
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4052.874,4063.674,You wouldn't have a right -- you wouldn't have a right to -- to renegotiate all those other -- those other provisions.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4063.674,4072.348,"We would have the right, Mr. Chief Justice to give a notice at anytime and to proceed to negotiate about changes, but --"
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4072.348,4072.918,Yes.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4072.918,4079.487,-- it would not have any effect until you've gone through all the procedures of the Railway Labor Act on that notice.
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4079.487,4100.178,You wouldn't have the right to say when the -- when you agreed on these wages now because you violated your agreement is struck we want to negotiate all these other -- other phases of the contract before.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4101.313,4102.591,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4103.787,4104.182,Yes.
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4105.011,4120.883,Then what -- what [Inaudible] settlement of the wages [Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4120.883,4123.999,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4211.927,4214.852,"Well, may I ask you just one question?"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4235.479,4235.61,This --
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4235.61,4240.005,Would that be subject to bargaining of what is all going through deviation of the [Inaudible]?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4240.005,4248.659,"Yes, but that is a subject for bargaining and there has been some bargaining about this variation."
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4261.444,4265.686,That probably would be urged [Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4265.686,4270.888,It has proved to be so up to this point that it is quite good.
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4270.888,4280.327,And if you don't agree what the [Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4280.327,4302.123,"There has been no notice, no separate notice given by the unions concerning this right because again like some of the other cases in which super seniority has been involved, they have all the seniority."
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4326.779,4329.649,What would be the settlement for that?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4332.633,4334.738,No.
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4360.563,4380.253,"Well, if you hired ten replacements [Inaudible] and that's all you needed to do, in some of the strikes on wages -- tomorrow morning those ten would continue to note that I gather until such time if it's in the basis -- one of the same job [Inaudible] --"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4380.253,4382.119,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1965.750,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4383.276,4387.301,You can bid only for vacancy -- a senior man can bump a junior manager.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4387.301,4388.887,That is correct.
1965.750,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4419.918,4420.979,During his absence --
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4420.979,4422.168,This in turn would permit --
1965.750,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4422.168,4422.983,[Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4422.983,4424.002,That's right.
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4431.661,4438.084,But you've ignored the -- you've ignored the fact lines in the replacements as I understand it.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4471.464,4471.71,Oh!
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4477.825,4479.287,You say you haven't done that?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4479.287,4480.126,No.
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4539.224,4548.427,-- all of your people -- all of your replacements whatever work they do nevertheless they're called or they fit within the existing classification.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4548.427,4551.118,That is -- that is exactly correct.
1965.750,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4554.459,4557.339,"You had 2,000 employees to put that?"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4557.339,4561.166,"We had approximately, that's slightly less than that Mr. Justice Clark."
1965.750,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4561.166,4563.535,"Yes, that number?"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4563.535,4564.781,No.
1965.750,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4575.215,4585.061,"Yeah, but you run in the railroad -- you did some good [Inaudible] schedule?"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4585.061,4588.457,"And Mr. Justice Clark, this is correct but one slight exception."
1965.750,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4629.055,4638.05,"What's the definite [Inaudible] 1,100 did not -- what happened to them?"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4638.05,4649.337,"Well, the -- a few of them were involved in the passenger that is the broader passenger business."
1965.750,2,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4695.901,4697.786,Would you need that --
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4697.786,4700.893,We would not need as many people as we had in the past.
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4700.893,4714.049,"May I ask you if an operating your trains at the present time, do you use the same number of employees on the train that you use under the collective bargaining agreement?"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4714.049,4715.863,"You mean on the operating crew, Mr. Chief Justice?"
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4715.863,4720.871,"Operating crew, yes."
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4720.871,4733.849,"With the trainmen, Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the 1959 rules as to them replaced and to effect on February 25, 1964."
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4756.412,4760.156,That's the same number of -- same number of trainmen you use.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4760.156,4761.456,"Well, the 1959 rule --"
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4761.456,4765.507,I mean -- I mean on each crew regardless of how -- how far that --
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4765.507,4766.328,That's correct.
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4766.328,4768.263,So you use the same number.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4768.263,4776.854,There had been no -- there has been no change from our past practice as far as the number of people and the crew --
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4776.854,4778.975,How about the engine crews?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4778.975,4781.974,You mean the engineer and fireman?
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4781.974,4783.415,Yes.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4783.415,4789.089,"On the engineer and the -- the fireman, there has been no change on that."
1965.750,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4853.71,4862.822,"I thought their contention and maybe I've misunderstood it is even more extreme than that that you couldn't hire him as a machinist, you have to hire him as an apprentice."
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4862.822,4866.772,"Well, I think that Mr. Justice Stewart is correct."
1965.750,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4867.142,4869.295,"In our study, that would be the logical result."
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4869.295,4879.282,And may I say that we have not -- we have not attempted to hire a person who is not qualified to bring him in and hire them as a journeyman.
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4914.379,4925.682,"How far [Inaudible] beyond what the District Court has said you may do, part of the -- how much further do you want to --"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4925.682,4945.322,"We felt in the first place, Mr. Justice Brennan that the -- that the fallacy of the District Court in the first place was to tie the hands of the carrier by saying that you have no flexibility to meet any condition that comes up."
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4962.805,4973.356,But then [Inaudible] do you want to go so far as the [Inaudible] the arrangement of this type -- the agreement shall be completely sustained?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,4973.356,4988.21,"We want to go only to the extent, Mr. Justice Brennan, that if we are required to deviate in some manner from those agreements in order to operate that we must have the right to do so."
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4997.634,5015.916,"[Inaudible] that's included there, that you want -- and you want to be allowed if in your business argument -- upgrading the railway and you must be so in the strike circle to the part of anything that --"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5015.916,5029.767,"Well, I think that it probably does mean that but it does not mean that they do not have both a full -- a complete and an adequate remedy for what we have done, every other railroad has it."
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5083.832,5093.911,[Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5093.911,5096.177,Your Honor this was -- it was correct.
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5114.003,5126.768,Are -- are you really suggesting that -- that all of these things you want to be free to do are minor disputes merely -- merely grievance type things under the contract.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5137.713,5140.203,Not major change Mr. Justice White.
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5162.635,5167.319,"No matter what kind of a change is instituted, whether it's minor, major, or anything else?"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5167.319,5171.779,"But there aren't changes in the agreement, Mr. Justice White."
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5173.328,5176.637,Then what is the adjustment board got to do with it at all?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5176.637,5185.596,"Because if there is not, compliance with the agreement then they have the power to remedy whatever violation has occurred."
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5191.043,5197.605,"Do you mean to say you aren't bound by the agreement then -- that if the adjustment board found you had violated it, they have to remedy it?"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5200.27,5200.316,Well --
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5200.316,5202.143,You're able to be free to violate it.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5202.143,5218.093,That's -- our first position is that -- our first position is precisely that the strike suspends or creates an emergency condition whereby these agreements are not affected during the period of strike.
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5221.616,5223.051,We'll you have to stipulate --
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5223.051,5233.894,But if we're wrong about that then the Court of Appeals was wrong in telling the District Court that you can interpret and imply these agreements.
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5265.463,5266.152,Is that red one?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5266.152,5269.122,"That's red one, yes, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5378.89,5380.56,[Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5380.56,5387.957,"So far as it's shown, Mr. Justice White, they were -- I don't know."
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5401.449,5408.436,Do you think they could do some systems of [Inaudible] not to hire them maybe not to [Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5408.436,5408.742,That --
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5408.742,5412.368,Not [Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5412.368,5413.488,That is correct.
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5580.141,5581.43,[Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5581.43,5583.172,"Yes, we have Mr. Justice White."
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5603.228,5622.482,"Are those -- were those cases with this that this causes [Inaudible] questions would rather search schemes, that is for the railroad to operate were charged with this violations of the agreements and that the court held no they were not violations --"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5622.482,5624.461,That is essentially correct.
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5647.419,5653.972,And the adjustment board [Inaudible] did this as a matter of interpretation within [Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5653.972,5665.411,Interpretation of the agreement is not really the -- the precise characterization.
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5674.57,5682.537,"Well, it may not run through this -- the board [Inaudible] as a matter of interpretation speaking of interpretation that would take it to be."
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5682.537,5683.3,Correct.
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5684.514,5688.995,Without having this -- under the one roof or the other?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5698.921,5700.183,That is correct.
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5701.497,5720.334,I understood you to say a little while ago that your practice during the strike has been used by all the railroads in the country for the past 40 years when they operate under strike conditions.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5734.401,5735.606,"No, Your Honor."
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5835.53,5836.365,19 when?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5836.365,5838.148,1922 which --
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5838.148,5838.642,22?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5838.642,5840.528,1922.
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5869.942,5873.175,With the laws of -- with the -- of the laws of the same as now?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5873.175,5873.699,No.
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5956.458,5963.507,Had there been any significant railroad strike since that time or what --
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5963.507,5963.676,Oh yes.
1965.750,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5963.676,5965.634,-- or was it the same thing?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,5966.881,5981.07,"Well, one that comes to mind immediately Mr. Chief Justice was the nationwide strike which was called in 1946 by the Engineers and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen."
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6171.927,6180.874,What was the -- during a strike like this who is the representative of your employees or do you recognize if there is one?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6180.874,6181.157,Oh!
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6189.18,6193.798,"Which employee, the ones on the strike or the ones who are working for you?"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6193.798,6199.374,All of them -- all of -- we haven't --we have never set the --
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6199.374,6204.545,But you don't -- but you don't think there's a duty to bargain about -- that you say --
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6204.545,6205.201,Mr. Justice White --
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6205.201,6209.035,They're the representative but during the strike not to bargain with your purpose?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6209.035,6209.949,No.
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6220.638,6221.12,I understand --
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6224.335,6224.553,Alright.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6224.553,6230.752,Now on everything else we say he has the -- he has a positive and absolute duty to bargain with the union.
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6230.752,6230.976,So –
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6230.976,6233.946,At least it only goes with the settlement of the strike.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6250.127,6262.791,That's true Mr. Justice Brennan but consider the -- consider the impossibility of going forward on the basis of bargaining about these emergency changes or the apprenticeship program.
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6309.898,6333.652,"Well [Inaudible] as Justice White suggests that of course you recognized that you need to continue bargaining with the union, but that it's limited to the issues involved in the strike and in settlement and certainly does not include any [Inaudible] workout arrangements that maybe involved with the replacements."
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6333.652,6335.425,That is -- that is correct.
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6335.425,6340.017,"Now, how about the -- how about grievances?"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6340.203,6342.685,"You would continue, Mr. Justice White."
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6342.685,6350.566,Do you think -- do you think that the contract continues for purposes of contacting grievances?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6350.566,6359.7,We believe that they would have the right to file any grievance that they might desire to file.
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6364.38,6368.117,Yes but that involves kind of a settlement on the property?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6368.117,6371.89,"Well yes, there is a procedure for that."
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6371.89,6377.359,"Well I know but who would you talk to about the agreements, the union or do you talk to somebody among your replacements?"
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6377.359,6377.762,No.
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6379.426,6382.295,What has been that [Inaudible] if you're having grievances [Inaudible] --
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6382.295,6392.446,"For -- for a very long period of time, Mr. Justice White, the unions were not processing grievances on behalf of replacements."
1965.750,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6395.527,6397.345,-- this type of [Inaudible]
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6397.345,6397.777,That is correct.
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6397.777,6400.877,Are they refusing to do so?
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6400.877,6411.676,"I do not know the answer, Mr. Justice White where a replacement has asked the union to handle his case and it had been rejected."
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6429.235,6441.235,Does all of your -- I take it to -- you also want to be able to -- you want to be able to say that the union Shop provision is suspended during the strike.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6441.235,6443.547,This was a -- we felt --
1965.750,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6443.547,6445.881,As I read your brief I take it that you do.
1965.750,2,44431,william_b_devaney,,6445.881,6468.683,"Well, this was a -- we ask as one of the -- we ask as one of the -- the conditions of the District Court that the District Court say that the union shop provision was not enforceable unless and until such time his membership was offered to the replacements."
1965.750,3,37685,paul_bender,,6718.892,6722.374,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.750,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7111.474,7124.161,I thought the -- I thought the railroad said that once the -- the wage matter was settled at the time that -- the contractors come back into force that in all of it's program point --
1965.750,3,37685,paul_bender,,7124.161,7149.65,"That's correct Your Honor, but what they did here and what the record shows they did, they put in these conditions of employment the so-called strike imposed conditions of employment, they said they were only to be temporary but actually what they did, they put those in, they codified them and written for them on September 1, three weeks later, September 24 -- September 25, they issued Section 6 notices which are substantially the same saying “We want this as the permanent change.”"
1965.750,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7176.812,7184.27,I gather that you don't object -- do you agree with the Government that self-help is permissible on their wage and notices?
1965.750,3,37685,paul_bender,,7184.27,7185.344,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1965.750,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,7185.344,7188.547,Your -- your comments only relate to conditions of employment?
1965.750,3,37685,paul_bender,,7188.547,7189.816,That's correct Your Honor.
1965.750,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7228.524,7231.232,Very well.
