1977.77-452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,42.123,We will hear arguments next in Mobil Alaska Pipeline Company against the United States and the consolidated cases.
1977.77-452,0,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,46.438,48.086,"Good morning, Your Honors."
1977.77-452,1,39230,richard_j_flynn,,1572.672,1575.746,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1977.77-452,2,23867,frank_h_easterbrook,,2178.332,2182.095,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,3995.216,3996.673,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.77-452,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4307.402,4309.286,Something like an occupying army?
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4309.286,4314.255,"Something like that, Mr. Chief Justice, very close."
1977.77-452,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4505.08,4512.58,Is it not also true that the price of the oil at the end of the pipeline is not really much affected by the rate?
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4512.58,4513.935,That is correct.
1977.77-452,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4513.935,4515.075,That is because?
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4515.075,4525.72,"That is because the price of oil in the west coast market is primarily set by competition with Saudi Arabian crude and, whatever these transportation rates are, the oil cannot go above that price."
1977.77-452,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4528.0,4533.509,Even if the original or initial price—
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4533.509,4543.247,New.
1977.77-452,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4543.247,4546.871,The cost to the oil could be competitive.
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4546.871,4548.422,"Yes, that is correct."
1977.77-452,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4548.422,4550.226,With the imported oil.
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4550.226,4552.157,That is correct.
1977.77-452,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4552.157,4556.331,Are there not some independent producers up there not tied into the pipeline?
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4556.331,4558.864,"Yes, but they are extremely minimal."
1977.77-452,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4729.613,4730.232,Mr. Attorney General.
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4730.232,4730.407,Yes.
1977.77-452,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4730.407,4736.354,"May I ask, on that refund provision, we have a refund provision on our state order."
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4736.354,4737.445,"In your state, I am sorry, yes."
1977.77-452,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4737.445,4739.212,Our state order includes the refund.
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4739.212,4741.635,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-452,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4741.635,4745.118,Does that supersede the ICC’s refund order?
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4745.118,4746.559,"Yes, I would assume so."
1977.77-452,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4746.559,4756.655,"If it does, then one of the questions presented by the petitioners is the validity of that refund provision in the ICC order."
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4760.57,4776.24,"As I understand it, the ICC state order requires the companies to keep the moneys isolated that would be collected between their interim tariff and the tariff which was ultimately approved."
1977.77-452,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4794.045,4795.357,"That is the greater, is it not?"
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4795.357,4795.873,I am sorry?
1977.77-452,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4795.873,4796.834,That is the greater.
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4796.834,4797.774,"Yes, as a matter of fact."
1977.77-452,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4797.774,4802.328,Does that swallow up the lesser?
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4802.328,4810.061,"In any event, if you rule in our favor, the money will come back to us through one vehicle or another."
1977.77-452,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4810.061,4812.931,Is it not a bit like a dependent relative revocation.
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4816.481,4819.024,"Something like that, yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.77-452,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4819.024,4820.884,"I think they do not have the same time period, do they?"
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4830.011,4832.396,That is correct.
1977.77-452,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4839.455,4843.667,So we must decide the rule of these reparations provision in the commission’s interim order?
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4843.667,4846.914,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-452,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4846.914,4860.259,"If we agreed with the petitioners that the refund provision were invalid and the ICC order, if that issue is still before us, that is pretty Para 50 for them as long as our refund order remains in effect."
1977.77-452,3,16001,avrum_m_gross,,4860.259,4866.664,"As I read it though, your order was somewhat contingent upon the validity of the ICC’s suspension order."
1977.77-452,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4897.64,4899.111,"Thank you, Mr. Attorney General."
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,4920.184,4928.207,"Your Honor, that very question intrigued the commissioners and intrigued all three of the Justices on the Fifth Circuit panel that we argued before."
1977.77-452,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4953.909,4962.11,Could they impose an impoundment requirement or does that stand flow with the suspension?
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,4962.11,4967.152,Impoundment in terms of a refund order.
1977.77-452,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4967.152,4970.67,Would there be any remedy absent to suspension?
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,4980.125,4986.152,"In a very literal sense and on the basis of statutory interpretation, the answer there would be no also."
1977.77-452,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4986.152,4988.155,Would there be a right to reparations?
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,4988.155,4990.755,"That is the critical element in all of this, Your Honor."
1977.77-452,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5129.482,5138.156,"Putting aside the question of the equities, whether they are relevant or not, there is a certain lack of parallel."
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5160.735,5191.365,"May I quickly respond, Mr. Chief Justice, by pointing out that although not neutral in that sense, the carriers when they sat down to calculate their rate had a formulation that existed for 35 years in the industry, that literally thousands upon thousands of pipeline rates had been calculated on the basis of and that this agency had never questioned in those 35 years."
1977.77-452,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5216.368,5225.116,Suppose that we disagreed with you on your reading of prior commission cases in terms of how it has construed the statute down through the years.
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5241.652,5246.495,"I would say it would have weight, but not controlling weight, Mr. Justice White."
1977.77-452,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5267.008,5278.565,It does not especially worry you that the amendment which was made with respect to changed rates and the burden of proof in the 15-7?
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5278.565,5280.895,"It does not worry us, Your Honor."
1977.77-452,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5302.305,5308.745,"Who has got the burden of proving the reasonableness of an original rate, as you call it?"
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5308.745,5310.155,"In a hearing, Your Honor?"
1977.77-452,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5310.155,5310.383,Yes.
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5310.383,5313.816,"In a hearing, we would have that burden."
1977.77-452,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5313.816,5317.192,Who has got the burden of establishing the unreasonableness of a change?
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5317.192,5317.887,I misspoke.
1977.77-452,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5318.267,5318.978,I thought you did.
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5318.978,5319.958,I am terribly sorry.
1977.77-452,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5327.08,5331.744,Who has got the burden of proving the reasonableness of a changed rate?
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5331.744,5335.119,The carrier in the hearing.
1977.77-452,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5342.795,5352.549,That shows some awareness by the Congress as a difference between a changed rate and an initial rate because the burden of proof is different.
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5352.549,5369.412,"It is reflective, I suggest, Your Honor, of the agency practice that had grown up, up to that point, where the concept of an initial rate achieved a life of its own."
1977.77-452,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5398.463,5413.12,Do you see any statutory difference between the Motor Carrier Act and the Interstate Commerce Commission Act for 15-7 purposes?
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5413.12,5421.799,"I do not believe it is clear, Your Honor, that under the Motor Carrier Act an original rate such as this could be suspended."
1977.77-452,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5421.799,5427.26,You take the same position with respect to the Motor Carrier Act as you do here?
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5427.26,5433.924,"I think that is a responsible position, but there is something even more important in the Motor Carrier Act and most of the others."
1977.77-452,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5460.998,5462.047,Mr. Kilcarr.
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5462.047,5463.419,"Yes, sir?"
1977.77-452,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5463.419,5479.622,"Is there any reason that you know of, other than tradition, which would prevent the ICC or the FERC in a 15-1 proceeding from holding it on an expedited basis and having witnesses and findings?"
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5479.622,5489.358,"I know of none, Your Honor, and we suggested just that alternative in the oral argument before the commission on June 27th that it could have been done on an expedited basis."
1977.77-452,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5489.358,5505.296,"Mr. Kilcarr, as a matter of curiosity, has the term “common carrier” as a matter of statutory definition included a pipeline company since 1887 since the conception of the Act?"
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5505.296,5514.254,"I believe it came into the Act later, your honor, and I cannot give you the precise date but the pipelines did come in, I think, under the Hepburn Act in 1906 but I am not sure."
1977.77-452,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5514.254,5520.581,I did know that pipelines really existed until about the late 1930s or so.
1977.77-452,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5520.581,5521.942,Yes.
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5521.942,5522.736,"No, they did."
1977.77-452,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5529.548,5530.635,Interstate pipelines.
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5530.635,5534.298,"Yes, sir."
1977.77-452,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5534.298,5535.119,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
1977.77-452,4,16336,andrew_j_kilcarr,,5535.119,5535.228,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1977.77-452,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5535.228,5536.197,The case is submitted.
