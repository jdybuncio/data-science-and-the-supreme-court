1964.22,0,26706,homer_s_carpenter,,16.4,21.885,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.22,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,71.273,72.465,These were westbound only?
1964.22,0,26706,homer_s_carpenter,,72.465,75.486,"Yes sir, westbound only, Justice Stewart."
1964.22,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,3879.339,3882.865,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.22,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3953.173,3967.362,"Mr. Ginnane, this (Inaudible)."
1964.22,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,3967.362,3970.619,We aren't always certain.
1964.22,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3999.095,4004.648,(Inaudible)
1964.22,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4004.648,4012.16,I found that the Commission's order was invalid and enjoined its enforcement.
1964.22,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4012.16,4015.664,"You could bring another case on another theory, couldn't you?"
1964.22,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4019.292,4022.835,I think that's right on reopening.
1964.22,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4043.846,4051.435,"Well, does the Commission have a substance (Inaudible) here?"
1964.22,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4051.435,4054.95,We say that the court below erred in two major respects.
1964.22,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4066.925,4074.336,They should think that the findings that it made are not adequate or to meet the attack as now being made upon the order.
1964.22,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4074.336,4076.92,That is correct sir.
1964.22,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4076.92,4095.363,"Why wouldn't the proper order here that hardly the Court should take as viewpoint at all be merely to vacate the judgment without reversing and without passing on the legal question, send it back to the Commission in view of its request to be allowed to make further findings?"
1964.22,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4095.363,4108.533,"Because sir, I believe that they would leave both the Commission and the parties at large and uncertain on the two matters -- on the two rulings of law of the court below."
1964.22,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4134.218,4137.518,The vacation would leave it fully undecided.
1964.22,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4137.518,4138.102,Except by --
1964.22,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4138.102,4148.35,It would leave -- that would vacate the judgment below and -- but we'll give you a chance but be on our understanding if you know what we mean.
1964.22,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4155.438,4156.113,Well it's --
1964.22,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4156.113,4159.548,We can't see whether there'd be any injury that's why I m asking.
1964.22,1,39331,robert_w_ginnane,,4173.849,4177.661,"Well, in effect sir, that's why the government didn't take an appeal."
1964.22,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4177.661,4181.176,Well that's -- maybe the government was right.
1964.22,2,22627,edward_a_kaier,,4982.782,4986.484,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.22,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5256.605,5258.647,What is the status of the rates now?
1964.22,2,22627,edward_a_kaier,,5258.647,5262.981,"The rates are in effect, Mr. Justice Black, and have been for five years."
1964.22,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5262.981,5268.679,So that the railroad would not be injured so far the rates are concerned.
1964.22,2,22627,edward_a_kaier,,5268.679,5269.422,That is correct.
1964.22,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5269.524,5270.58,By a vacation.
1964.22,2,22627,edward_a_kaier,,5270.58,5271.223,That is correct.
1964.22,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5285.217,5287.624,The issues -- the way you approach it.
1964.22,2,22627,edward_a_kaier,,5287.624,5289.139,The way we approach it well --
1964.22,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5289.139,5292.504,The validity or not of that rate service.
1964.22,2,22627,edward_a_kaier,,5292.504,5294.894,"Yes sir, yes."
1964.22,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5294.894,5312.068,"But the other point is I think so -- and what is wrong, it was trying to wait until the case can't be decided on the basis of all the facts and all the claims that are made."
1964.22,2,22627,edward_a_kaier,,5314.784,5320.828,"Well of course, the important thing, if Your Honor please, is that we are here."
1964.22,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5328.712,5333.644,"But you would -- undoubtedly, you wouldn't but they seem to think they can make that case stronger."
1964.22,2,22627,edward_a_kaier,,5335.627,5338.65,"Mr. Justice Black, it really isn't -- it really isn't that."
1964.22,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5353.676,5358.414,Then we are asked after we decide that to send it back to the Commission for more finding and so forth.
1964.22,2,22627,edward_a_kaier,,5358.414,5359.068,"Oh, no."
1964.22,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5361.47,5368.956,I know you wouldn't ask it but I understand they're asking that we leave it open so they can go ahead with the same proceeding.
1964.22,2,22627,edward_a_kaier,,5380.03,5391.523,"Well, I suppose they like to win eventually but I don't see that that's a reason, sir, for not deciding the legal questions, the applicability of 1(6)."
1964.22,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5391.523,5407.546,"But it's a mere legal question, that's what bothers me, if it's a mere legal statement of a broad principle knowing that the situation is not yet ready for a final decision on the merits of this case."
1964.22,2,22627,edward_a_kaier,,5410.314,5428.716,"I think that if you decide that legal question, you have decided the merits of this case because I submit there is no other basis upon which the Commission's order could be sustained if you decide that Section 1(6) did not apply."
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,7659.56,7662.834,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7820.595,7826.979,What the -- and I suppose that it does show that the erosion of your traffic was a rest issue.
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,7826.979,7828.561,To that I think it does show.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7828.561,7852.668,"I mean this is the real point, isn't it that -- and this is one of the real point, the comparison of the -- the comparison between what the new rates produce and what would have been produced with just the old rates, had you carried the same amount of traffic is meaningless unless -- unless you can show -- unless you can show that you would have carried the same amount of traffic --"
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,7852.668,7853.514,"That's the matter I want to cover, Your Honor."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7853.514,7856.502,"As a matter of fact -- as a matter of fact if you have to do rates, you might have only carried half as much."
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,7856.502,7857.572,That's correct.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7867.109,7867.809,Which --
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,7867.809,7872.165,"Which we may not have handled it, we have had to use the prior -- the previously effective rates."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7872.165,7881.888,"Which means that even -- which means that if you work making a million dollars off this new traffic, you weren't losing as much as you would have without the rate."
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,7895.347,7896.711,"I would go this far, Your Honor."
1964.22,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7930.226,7934.107,Is your three-day average still maintained?
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,7934.107,7935.431,"Your Honor, I don't know."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7940.104,7942.979,But they're still continuing these rates after five years.
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,7942.979,7944.918,"The rates are still in effect, Your Honor."
1964.22,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7947.538,7950.658,Although that New Haven now itself does have piggyback.
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,7950.658,7952.584,"New Haven does have piggyback, Your Honor."
1964.22,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7959.398,7966.235,Physical and (Voice Overlap) but I understood those were correct and perhaps that's outside the record.
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,7966.235,7969.415,They have not been entirely correct.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7969.415,7971.612,"Well, you got the big flatcar?"
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,7971.612,7972.547,"I'm sorry I couldn't hear you, sir."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7972.547,7974.34,You got the large flatcar that can carry trailers.
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,7974.34,7980.299,"We have some large flatcars, that's why this is a question of supply."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8743.5,8747.545,Does that conclude the argument on your side?
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8747.545,8748.4,"Yes sir, that does."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8748.4,8753.209,Could I ask you question through Mr. Hunt.
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8770.595,8774.569,"We have but well -- you said why it isn't the class rate, Your Honor?"
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8774.569,8775.421,Yes.
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8775.421,8781.806,"Well, it isn't a class rate because it doesn't relate to the uniform freight classification which Mr. Kaier's away referred to."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8781.806,8784.912,That so -- is that -- that's the --
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8784.912,8786.765,That's a missing -- that's a compelling reasonable maximum rates.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8786.765,8791.223,This is a prescribe -- this is a prescribed uniform classification --
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8791.223,8792.127,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8792.127,8796.739,-- to which the railroads must conform if you're going to have a class rate?
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8796.739,8798.044,I'm sorry I didn't get the last.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8798.044,8803.974,"Well, it's a classification that the railroads must comply with if they're going to publish a class rate, is that it?"
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8803.974,8807.989,That's correct and the class rate itself is prescribed as well.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8807.989,8818.254,"Well, I know but that -- it must prescribe with this -- comply with this classification and it's going to publish a class rate.How do you know when you published a class rate?"
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8818.254,8823.465,"Well, the Commission tells us, Your Honor, what class rates are and they tell us what the maximum --"
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8823.465,8825.418,"Well, why isn't this one?"
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8825.418,8828.977,Because this is not prescribed by the Commission obviously.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8850.528,8868.967,"Well, I gather that under the Commission's approach that within one area -- within one area there couldn't be both a class rate and an all commodity rate which the Commission would approve."
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8868.967,8872.233,"I'm not sure that I understand the question, your Honor."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8873.084,8883.432,Well in all -- in all commodity rate -- rates just couldn't ever exist within the same territory with a -- with a class rate.
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8883.432,8885.56,"Well, I don't think they're entirely saying that, Your Honor."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8895.18,8895.726,Oh I see.
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8895.726,8902.225,So in that sense they are saying you can have them but they really won't be much good to you except -- unless you want to move them next to you traffic.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8920.03,8925.314,"Well, why didn't it want to go through the jobs of -- of publishing some new class rates?"
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8925.314,8944.232,"Well, because if it had gone through an entirely new class rate system on publication of new class rates, then if they were called class rates and the Commission finally accepted them as such, then these would be the maximum then at which the traffic involved would move in transportation service."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8944.232,8950.861,"Well then, I suppose also those rates wouldn't have done the job you wanted them to do."
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8950.861,8952.303,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8962.186,8969.192,And have the other railroads involved here maintained their all commodity rates also?
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8969.192,8970.553,They still have them in effect.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8972.228,8975.555,"But all of them now have piggyback, including you."
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,8975.555,8983.268,"All of the lines involved are participating in this Section 2 rates to my -- the best of my knowledge do have piggyback service, that's correct."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,8986.785,8994.756,"Well, now would the experience of the New Haven assume that this case were remanded to the Commission a new findings?"
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,9008.958,9009.198,Yes.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9009.815,9015.083,"You'd have to go to a certain period of time on certain shipments and it was the study that was made with the railroad, wasn't it?"
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,9015.083,9016.025,That's correct.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9016.025,9024.148,"Now, I suppose that -- you would have a continued experience with the rates that might be examined."
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,9024.148,9026.464,"Well, we would have continued experience with the rates."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9031.453,9039.622,Unless you're -- you're having piggyback and other factors that just dried up to traffic that are moving on these -- on these rates.
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,9039.622,9048.447,"Well, we -- I -- I think that it's correct to say that piggyback and I think that it's common knowledge that it's becoming stronger and stronger as time goes along."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9055.796,9060.487,To the extent that the piggyback is taking the traffic and to that extent as this whole issue less important.
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,9060.487,9062.023,"I think it is, Your Honor."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9065.793,9066.089,But the --
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,9066.089,9067.827,And I think they are the important rates today.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9067.827,9071.471,The issue you're arguing about here then becomes progressively less important.
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,9071.471,9073.245,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1964.22,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9073.245,9082.876,"This is to say that -- that piggyback is getting now much more profit, you both were utilizing these empty boxcars whether they're not to be utilized."
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,9082.876,9091.114,"Well, we hope that we achieve these rates and at least to make maximum use of our boxcars, so that the boxcar rates will then be compatible with our piggyback rates."
1964.22,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,9091.114,9095.353,"Well, even though compatible with piggyback than a more desirable service."
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,9095.353,9108.634,"I think as a general rule, I think that's growing more and more so, Your Honor."
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9120.684,9124.196,"Well, that's was in the -- which case was that in?"
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,9124.196,9127.882,That was in the Eastern Central Motor Carriers Association v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9127.882,9130.217,That was on the Plan III of piggyback?
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,9130.217,9131.713,That was on Plan III piggyback.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9131.996,9133.585,That's not the mixture.
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,9133.585,9138.041,And that has a mixture but the trailers -- there are two trailers in a shipment.
1964.22,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,9141.743,9148.141,But now can -- the New -- the New Haven's piggyback is moving under that class three.
1964.22,3,22470,eugene_e_hunt,,9148.141,9151.97,"The New Haven does have Plan III piggyback, that's correct, Your Honor."
1964.22,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,9161.356,9162.424,Mr. Carpenter.
