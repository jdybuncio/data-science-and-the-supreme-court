1986.86-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.52,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 86-526, Caterpillar and others against Cecil Williams."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,19.878,26.9,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-526,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,172.626,180.282,"Counsel, how long were the respondents management employees?"
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,180.282,188.804,"--For varying periods of time that are not fully established in the record, but for varying times, Justice Blackmun."
1986.86-526,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,188.804,194.791,When in respect to the plant closing were they downgraded?
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,194.791,206.349,"The downgrades occurred as the plant began to shut down, and the respondents were offered these positions back in the bargaining unit to protect their employment."
1986.86-526,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,206.349,213.003,So that Caterpillar knew that the plant would close at the time they were downgraded?
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,213.003,219.757,"I'm not sure that's clear from the record, Justice Blackmun, but leave it at this."
1986.86-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,329.727,335.029,What was the allegation about the promise?
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,340.083,342.619,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,494.267,501.606,"But the complaint here, Mr. Skoning, disavows any reliance on the collective bargaining agreement."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,506.943,524.119,"I would respectfully submit that it doesn't, Your Honor, for the reason that what the plaintiffs have alleged in their complaint is really quite irrelevant to the question of the court's jurisdiction under Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act."
1986.86-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,533.51,537.045,"Well, what about the well-pleaded complaint doctrine?"
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,537.045,545.401,The well-pleaded complaint doctrine is still fully applicable to cases other than Section 301.
1986.86-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,565.613,568.582,Has any case of ours said what you just said in so many words?
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,568.582,569.349,Not precisely.
1986.86-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,569.349,571.766,So that's a new proposition you're urging on us?
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,571.766,573.251,"Correct, Your Honor."
1986.86-526,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,604.088,616.58,"Well, Mr. Skoning, it seems to me that you're contending that this contract claim is preempted because it violates some Federal labor principle of exclusive representation."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,649.616,664.375,"Justice O'Connor, we submit that the line of cases involving Garmin, Machinists, and Belknap, are really irrelevant in the context of a 301 case."
1986.86-526,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,672.398,674.465,"Well, I guess you missed the point of my question."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,681.421,695.311,"--The thrust of our argument is that the plaintiffs' complaint falls squarely within 301, because it falls squarely within rights and obligations governed by the collective bargaining agreement."
1986.86-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.648,718.026,"You wouldn't really say that... suppose... suppose while they were... before the plant shut down, these people were just let go; they were... their salaried jobs were terminated, and they were just let go."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,732.083,732.983,"Not at all, Justice White."
1986.86-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,738.653,754.662,"Well, how does the fact that they were demoted to the... to the bargaining unit, and then terminated, how do those facts change the basis for their claim?"
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,754.662,763.518,--These respondents were returned to the bargaining unit well prior to the negotiation of the 1983 collective bargaining agreement?
1986.86-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,763.518,763.887,So?
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,763.887,783.516,"And presumably, an arbitrator, if this case were ultimately to reach arbitration, could discover that in fact those very rights that they allege existed when they were salaried employees were part of the package of give and take at the collective bargaining agreement."
1986.86-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,798.141,801.743,But he says he's not suing for any of that in his complaint.
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,801.743,808.683,--It's our contention that what he says in his complaint is not the important factor.
1986.86-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.683,814.07,"Well, then you simply reject the doctrines of this Court that the plaintiff is master of his own complaint."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,814.07,815.27,"No, we don't reject that."
1986.86-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.662,842.32,"You're arguing that... you're arguing, I take it, that the... after they returned to the bargaining unit, there was a new contract negotiated."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,854.362,858.616,"That's not our contention... in this case, that is our contention."
1986.86-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,861.218,861.484,"Well, I know."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,876.41,878.929,"--That's correct, Justice White."
1986.86-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,904.645,922.339,"Well, it does involve a judgment here before this 301 preemption and removability, there does have to be some judgment as to whether or not these claims are independent of the collective bargaining contract or sufficiently involved in it that there is preemption."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,922.339,924.541,"--That is correct, Justice White."
1986.86-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,924.541,925.391,Then that's--
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,925.391,933.564,"That's the judgment that we submit the district court properly made on the basis of the complaint, and the collective bargaining agreement."
1986.86-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.564,935.266,"--It's purely a defensive matter, of course."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,970.772,1000.624,"Our contention is that if the respondents, if the plaintiffs in a case brought in state court are covered under the terms and provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, and their claims do not assert nonwaivable state rights... nonwaivable state rights, as opposed to the private consensual agreements that we have here... that that case is removable as a matter of law under Section 301 in this Court's decisions."
1986.86-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1013.599,1014.801,"Excuse me, before you go on."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1014.801,1015.351,"Yes, sir?"
1986.86-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1015.351,1020.253,Their claim does not depend on 301 at all.
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1027.692,1033.029,"Our... our position is that 301 governs this case, and therefore--"
1986.86-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.029,1034.595,"Well, you may be right, but that's a defense."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1039.933,1046.587,--This Court has said that under Section 301 preemption is complete.
1986.86-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1046.587,1047.355,You may be right.
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1052.057,1061.763,They have specifically alleged the facts that these respondents were in the bargaining unit at the time they were laid off.
1986.86-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1085.461,1091.265,"Even if they had said in their complaint, we expressly disavow any Federal cause of action."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1097.286,1100.49,They have attempted to say just that in this complaint.
1986.86-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1124.521,1126.205,You can't bring the state cause of action.
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1128.473,1145.935,--That you cannot bring it as a state cause of action because these employees were in the bargaining unit; they'd been in the bargaining unit for years; and the bargaining unit expressly covered the matters that they contend were covered independent of the collective bargaining agreement.
1986.86-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1145.935,1161.794,"Would you make the same argument if they were alleging that the side agreement that was made when they were in management capacity specified that at the time of termination that each of you would receive 500 shares of stock, something that would normally not be part of the collective bargaining agreement, and that's all they allege."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1167.698,1171.5,"Needless to say, that's not a situation covered by this agreement."
1986.86-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.5,1172.366,"--What's the difference, really?"
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1177.554,1186.442,I think to the extent the collective bargaining agreement rights and remedies afforded to the plaintiffs are intertwined with the stock issue--
1986.86-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.442,1187.025,They get something.
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1197.3,1202.169,"--That's a matter that is covered under Federal law, and that is complete preemption under--"
1986.86-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.169,1206.406,"You'd say that the stock option agreement would be preempted under Federal law, too?"
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1206.406,1207.589,--The stock option agreement--
1986.86-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1207.589,1213.56,I don't mean stock option; stock promise to give 500 shares when he retired.
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1221.499,1226.3,"--Obviously, the answer to that question isn't dispositive in this case."
1986.86-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.3,1226.819,I think it is.
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1226.819,1238.258,"Trying to answer the question directly, it's our position that if that agreement to give them stock at the time of plant shutdown--"
1986.86-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1238.258,1239.044,"Time of severance, right."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1239.044,1246.381,"--were in some manner intertwined with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, it would be preempted under Section 301."
1986.86-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1246.381,1250.685,"In other words, if the collective bargaining agreement says, this supersedes all side agreements of every kind?"
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1250.685,1253.304,"If there were language of that sort, of if there were other--"
1986.86-526,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1253.304,1256.589,"Well, what if there's language in the agreement that says, this does not supersede any side agreements?"
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1258.989,1270.663,"--If they had bargained over and expressly excluded that matter, expressly excluded it under the Court's decision in AT&T, then I think that would be actionable in state courts."
1986.86-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1270.663,1273.329,How do we decide this?
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1304.8,1314.322,"Justice White, the crucial fact is that these suits... this suit was brought well after the time they returned to the collective bargaining agreement."
1986.86-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1323.345,1327.963,"Well, I think we judge the case on the ground that the promise really was made."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1333.7,1334.652,--And Justice White--
1986.86-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1334.652,1335.735,Let's just accept that.
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1335.735,1337.002,--I accept that.
1986.86-526,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1337.002,1346.127,"And you say... and I suppose then that when they were returned to the bargaining unit, and... the breach occurred then."
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1346.127,1350.245,We don't contend that those promises are no longer valid.
1986.86-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1371.592,1377.812,"Well, then you're saying that they haven't pleaded the full contract that's in existence between the parties?"
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1377.812,1380.114,"Well, that in fact is the case."
1986.86-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1380.114,1386.768,But that isn't something that you... that you can raise to remove a case.
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1401.028,1415.871,"Our contention is that the issues raised in a 301 removal situation are, whether or not those plaintiffs were covered under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, first of all."
1986.86-526,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.316,1435.868,But how do we know that on the face of it?
1986.86-526,0,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,1474.81,1482.832,"Justice Scalia, I think that this Court's decision in the Taylor case really bears directly on the question that you've raised."
1986.86-526,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.954,1541.804,"Thank you, Mr. Skoning."
1986.86-526,1,24753,fritz_wollett,,1546.072,1550.393,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.86-526,2,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,2545.887,2552.041,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-526,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2640.429,2641.448,Not necessarily.
1986.86-526,2,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,2651.736,2652.37,--That's correct.
1986.86-526,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.517,2677.121,That's always the case where you have a federal defense.
1986.86-526,2,26084,gerald_d_skoning,,2682.24,2683.025,--That's correct.
1986.86-526,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2747.282,2747.948,"Thank you, Mr. Skoning."
