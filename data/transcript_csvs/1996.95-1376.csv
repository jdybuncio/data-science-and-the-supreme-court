1996.95-1376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.69,"We will hear argument next in No. 95-1376, Charles T. Robinson, Sr., v. Shell Oil Company."
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,21.645,27.849,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court:"
1996.95-1376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,128.696,144.845,"Well, if you're right, it's... it's a rather sure way to make... make sure you don't get a bad reference; you just file a complaint with the EEOC a couple of days after... or a couple of days before you're fired, even though the firing is completely justified."
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,144.845,153.062,"Well, that is not, in fact, what actually happens."
1996.95-1376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,153.062,160.415,"No, it may not be what in fact happened in your case, but it certainly might happen in a number of other cases if we sustain your position."
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,180.04,189.794,"There are, in fact, disincentives to frivolous charges built into Title VII, which hopefully would take care of that problem."
1996.95-1376,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,189.794,191.985,"Well, what are... what are they?"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,191.985,201.322,A principal brings a frivolous lawsuit under Title VII may be hit with attorney's fees and costs.
1996.95-1376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,201.322,205.566,"What about, are there any disincentives to filing a frivolous complaint with the EEOC?"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,209.338,216.272,"There... there are... no, the EEOC can't apply any disincentives like that."
1996.95-1376,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,220.385,236.164,"What other remedies are available to someone who, after he's... he's been terminated, thinks that a reference was erroneously made and given by the former employer?"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,240.508,246.482,--There are possible actions under State law.
1996.95-1376,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,246.482,247.133,Right.
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,247.133,258.48,But it is well established that Title VII is intended to give parallel remedies to any other remedies that may be available.
1996.95-1376,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,341.906,344.046,And that... that complaint was made here?
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,344.046,345.837,--That's exactly what happened in this case.
1996.95-1376,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,345.837,346.458,And... and the plaintiff lost?
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,346.458,347.179,Right.
1996.95-1376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,364.711,369.384,"Well, he'll file his charge if... if he claims the discharge is discriminatory?"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,369.384,369.713,--Yes.
1996.95-1376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,369.713,376.999,"He could... the employee could remain employed and file a complaint that a failure to promote was discriminatory, couldn't he?"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,376.999,378.02,That's right.
1996.95-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.827,414.452,It... it's the time of the discrimination that... that... that's relevant for 704(a)--
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,414.452,414.923,--Exactly.
1996.95-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,414.923,417.844,--and the person who is fired because he filed a complaint--
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,417.844,418.616,Exact--
1996.95-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.616,421.808,--was an employee at the time he was fired.
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,421.808,422.687,--Exactly.
1996.95-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,422.687,426.971,"So he would be... he would be well covered, even if ""employee"" means only current employee?"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,426.971,431.673,He would be covered by 7... 703(a).
1996.95-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,438.509,438.9,Well--
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,443.321,444.172,"Of course, if he's--"
1996.95-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,444.172,445.574,--as a means of retaliation--
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,445.574,446.723,"--Of course, that--"
1996.95-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.723,451.177,"--he would be covered under 704(a), even if 704(a) is just limited to current employees, right?"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,451.177,451.548,--That's right.
1996.95-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,451.548,452.266,Okay.
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,452.266,452.657,That's right.
1996.95-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.657,453.188,So--
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,453.188,482.277,"But the point I want to make is that Congress knew that people would be subject to retaliation under 704(a) when they were no longer employees, because there would be people who file charges alleging that they were discharged because of race and so on, and those people would necessarily be no longer employees at the time they might be retaliated against."
1996.95-1376,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,501.52,507.304,"--Well, do we have to look at the definition in the applicable section here of the word ""employee""?"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,509.435,519.302,"Un... unfortunately, that definition has... this Court has said that definition doesn't help us much--"
1996.95-1376,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,519.302,525.096,"Well, the definition says the term ""employee"" means an individual employed by an employer."
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,527.187,529.157,"--Well, this Court--"
1996.95-1376,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,529.157,533.321,"It could include former employees, a person employed?"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,533.321,535.782,--That is precisely what we're saying.
1996.95-1376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,548.293,551.245,--a purpose that's not relevant in this--
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,551.245,553.746,--That's right.
1996.95-1376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,553.746,559.681,--a traditional common-law type employee versus an independent contractor.
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,559.681,560.332,That--
1996.95-1376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,560.332,565.845,"So it's not... it's not circular for that purpose, but it just doesn't speak to what's at here?"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,565.845,567.003,--That's right.
1996.95-1376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,585.617,600.888,"Well, I understand it to be your position that the... circular though the... the definition may be, it is helpful to you in the sense that it is as consistent with the reading, who was employed by an employer, as with the reading, who is employed by an employer."
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,607.101,608.251,That's right.
1996.95-1376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,608.251,608.511,That's your argument?
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,608.511,609.192,That is exactly right.
1996.95-1376,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,609.192,609.783,Yeah.
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,609.783,620.529,"And... and in order to decide which of the multiple meanings the word ""employee"" has in this statute, one must look to the purpose of the statute."
1996.95-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,649.04,650.759,Why should Congress contemplate that?
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,677.527,678.178,--That's right.
1996.95-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,678.178,681.371,"Well, that... surely that would be unlawful, wouldn't it?"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,681.371,683.371,No question about it; this Court has said so.
1996.95-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,683.371,687.752,"Well, would... would you need this Act to... to prevent his... that's like sending somebody over to mug him."
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,687.752,689.815,"Yes, one does need this Act."
1996.95-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.815,690.856,You don't have to worry about that?
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,691.015,692.407,"Yes, one does need this Act."
1996.95-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,765.273,782.336,"I'm not sure... I'm not sure, in the context of a pension or a bonus, that there is not a sufficient ongoing relation, so that the discrimination that you are hypothesizing would be against an employee, even though the employee has been terminated."
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,797.243,800.055,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy, that's right."
1996.95-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,815.957,819.119,I... I was... I was just directing my... my comments to the pension and bonus example.
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,822.452,822.702,--Yes.
1996.95-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.192,858.004,--And it wouldn't violate this law?
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,858.004,858.836,--And it would not violate--
1996.95-1376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.836,859.274,But--
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,860.856,861.996,--Maybe not.
1996.95-1376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,863.098,868.682,"Well, you know, if a person has a vested pension and he's dismissed by an employer--"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,868.682,869.102,That's right.
1996.95-1376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,869.102,873.134,--there is no law that protects his enjoyment of that pension?
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,873.134,874.183,That is absolutely right.
1996.95-1376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,876.146,878.648,"Well, I mean, I said... and there... there's no law that protects his--"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,878.648,879.239,"--Yes, there is."
1996.95-1376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,881.029,881.95,--Yeah.
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,881.95,888.693,"But there would be no cause of action against the employer who announced a policy of simply, we will not give you any reference--"
1996.95-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,888.693,889.174,But I--
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,889.174,890.696,--and we will not even acknowledge you worked for us.
1996.95-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,890.696,898.411,--I thought in my earlier... I thought in our earlier colloquy that we just had that you agreed that in the pension and bonus example--
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,898.411,898.721,Yes.
1996.95-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,898.721,903.454,--the terminated individual would have a sufficient nexus--
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,903.454,903.674,Yes.
1996.95-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,903.674,908.759,"--for the purpose of pension, to be an employee, even under the Respondent's view?"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,908.759,909.347,Right.
1996.95-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,909.347,909.908,All right.
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,909.908,910.278,But--
1996.95-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,910.278,917.714,"So, then, I don't think we should talk about employers who are going to threaten former employees with cutting off their pensions."
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,920.636,923.487,"--Well, he could threaten not to give any reference--"
1996.95-1376,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.487,925.118,"Yeah, but can you speak for the... can you speak for the Respondent on that issue?"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,935.607,937.927,"--No, I... I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."
1996.95-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,937.927,943.581,"Well, but... but it... but it is certainly within the purview of a logical construction of his position?"
1996.95-1376,0,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,943.581,949.915,I... I'll... I'll leave that for Respondent to answer.
1996.95-1376,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,949.915,950.196,Very well.
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,959.51,966.384,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,998.546,1013.155,"If we are talking about what Congress might have intended, do you think Congress really intended that an action could be brought against an employer who makes a reference for a person after... after he's been discharged?"
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1017.549,1019.199,"--Well, I... I mean, I... I think that--"
1996.95-1376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1019.199,1019.88,Do... do you?
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1019.88,1024.204,--I... I think that's... that is quite a possible reach within Section 704.
1996.95-1376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1025.464,1028.256,"Well, I mean... but you're talking about what did Congress intend."
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1030.137,1036.221,--Congress... Congress made Section 704 very... a very clear and strong protection against retaliation.
1996.95-1376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.69,1054.683,"Well, what... what if, in this case, the... the thing... the request for references came 10 years--"
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1054.683,1056.495,--I... I... I'm aware of that hypothetical.
1996.95-1376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1078.097,1081.309,"--Well, but... we're... we're going to... we're going to have to cover them both, I gather--"
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1081.309,1081.95,"--Well, I... I... I--"
1996.95-1376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1081.95,1083.773,--either to not cover them both or cover them both.
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1083.773,1090.826,"--I... I acknowledge, Mr. Chief Justice, that that could plausibly come within the... within the reach of the statute, under Section 704."
1996.95-1376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.191,1112.66,"Suppose... never mind that... suppose the retaliation comes not from the employer but from the... the individual employee, and not within the scope of the business at all... whom the... whom the... the complainant charged with discrimination."
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1112.66,1113.331,--I--
1996.95-1376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1113.331,1121.437,That individual goes in the... scratches his car or slashes his tires or... or destroys his home or something of that--
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1121.437,1121.787,--Right.
1996.95-1376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.787,1122.498,--Would that be covered by this?
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1122.498,1123.139,Two... two points.
1996.95-1376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.638,1124.489,Would... would that be covered by the Act?
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1124.489,1124.98,--Not necessarily.
1996.95-1376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1124.98,1126.82,"So, not at all?"
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1126.82,1130.533,"Well, it... it has to be an employer, first of all, who is... through a Section 704--"
1996.95-1376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1130.533,1130.893,Okay.
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1133.996,1134.667,--Yes.
1996.95-1376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1134.667,1136.687,Not all retaliation is meant to be protected?
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1136.687,1137.148,It--
1996.95-1376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.148,1144.675,So all we're arguing about is whether one of the limitations is a limitation between present employer and former employer.
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1144.675,1146.113,"--Right, present employer and... and former employer."
1996.95-1376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.574,1226.587,I don't know why you'd give any references if there is even the slightest risk of your being sued for it.
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1234.331,1239.834,"--Well, I mean, first of all, the... the fact is that employers still do give references."
1996.95-1376,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1240.845,1246.71,"Well... well, isn't... isn't the answer going to be what you've just said... that if he doesn't, under your view of the case, it's going to be retaliation, too?"
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1246.71,1248.44,"--Well, it's only... it's only--"
1996.95-1376,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1248.44,1249.501,He must... he must... he must give a reference?
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1249.501,1252.413,--It's only retaliation if he treats people differently.
1996.95-1376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1259.599,1260.769,"But, Mr. Wolfson--"
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1260.769,1267.202,And it is certainly the employee's burden to show that there was... there was a different approach taken in his case and that it was caused by--
1996.95-1376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.202,1269.033,"--But, Mr. Wolfson, may I ask you a question right there?"
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1280.731,1291.309,"--Well, it doesn't say... the statute doesn't say specifically... 704, unlike 703, doesn't say discrimination in the terms, conditions or privileges of employment."
1996.95-1376,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1314.373,1323.149,"Yeah, but their policy assumes to tell the truth in all... in all... you know, whether they like the employee or not, they say, we didn't like this guy... that's discrimination?"
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1323.149,1327.733,--It... it's only discrimination if it... if it is effected by the retaliation.
1996.95-1376,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1329.053,1334.827,"Mr. Wolfson, wouldn't this play out in how... suppose this case had gone to court."
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1344.384,1344.865,--Well--
1996.95-1376,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1344.865,1348.585,That's a... that's a legitimate nonretaliatory reason.
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1348.585,1361.684,"--It could be the... the allegation in this case, of course, is that the... the... and it's... the complaint is reprinted in the joint appendix... the allegation in this case is that the reference was false, in fact, and that it was motivated by... by retaliation."
1996.95-1376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.195,1383.119,"I assume... I assume that the... that the employer cannot protect himself when he gets a request for a reference by simply saying, you know, I do normally give references, but I'm sorry, in the case of this employee, I don't want to say anything either good or bad, because he had filed a complaint and I'm worried about being prosecuted."
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1384.98,1385.351,--Yes.
1996.95-1376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.721,1386.71,--not giving a reference either way?
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1386.71,1392.804,"Certainly, if... if... if referring to the fact that that... that he's filed an EEOC charge."
1996.95-1376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1393.265,1398.51,So... so the only way for the employer to be sure that he... that he won't be sued is not to give any references for any employees?
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1398.51,1400.279,"--Well, not to treat any employee differently--"
1996.95-1376,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1400.279,1400.77,Yeah.
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1400.77,1405.202,--on the... on... not to affect a reference because the employee filed an EEOC charge.
1996.95-1376,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1472.027,1474.15,"Mr. Wolfson, I just want to make sure I understood the point you made before."
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1496.485,1497.596,--Right.
1996.95-1376,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1497.596,1499.747,Exactly the same problem for the employer.
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1500.949,1503.68,But nobody suggests that that's not covered by Title VII.
1996.95-1376,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1503.68,1503.95,--Right.
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1503.95,1504.849,At least--
1996.95-1376,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1504.849,1516.098,"But if... if the interpretation that you are opposing were the law, then the message to the employer is, don't keep that person on and give him time to look for another job; get rid of him."
1996.95-1376,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1520.81,1530.427,"--Well, I... I... I think it's... the result you point is... is... and this was pointed out, I believe, in the... in the dissenting opinion below... that that's one of the anomalies of that construction, which is it encourages--"
1996.95-1376,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1530.427,1533.259,"I don't think that was a question, Mr. Lenchek."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1538.943,1548.55,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1558.524,1563.747,Don't you think that language in the definition section can be read two ways?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1563.747,1564.539,"No, I don't, Your Honor."
1996.95-1376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1564.539,1565.199,"""Employed""?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1565.199,1566.001,"No, I don't."
1996.95-1376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1595.069,1602.065,"Well, but Title VII authorizes courts to order reinstatement or hiring of employees."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1604.035,1616.864,"Yes, but I... I think you get back to what Justice Scalia pointed out: If there is an event, a discriminatory event that occurs, then you look at the event and the status of the individual at the time the event occurred."
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1619.096,1620.067,"Yes, but not if the statute doesn't say that."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1622.571,1623.64,--That's true.
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1624.19,1625.482,And even though he's a former employee.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1625.482,1634.178,"Yeah, but I think you do have to look at the distinction between alleging discrimination under 703 and retaliation under 704, because they are not coextensive."
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.178,1636.629,There has been--
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1645.264,1646.686,No.
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1646.686,1647.295,So you agree with me?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1647.295,1648.907,"I... I do agree with you, Justice Scalia."
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1652.928,1654.26,Even if you lose the case?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1658.522,1660.946,"I would hope not, Justice Kennedy."
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1676.635,1685.9,"But you've already... you've already acknowledged that the word ""employee"", the word ""employee"", in this very statute, means former employee in a number of contexts."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1697.03,1702.023,"--Well, I would disagree, only to state, Justice Ginsburg, that, at the time the charge is filed, the status is irrelevant."
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1706.103,1707.536,"But the... the statute uses the word ""employee""."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1707.536,1708.136,Yes.
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1708.136,1712.649,"The statute uses the word ""employee"" to describe an individual--"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1712.649,1713.4,Yes.
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1713.4,1716.121,--who happens to be a former employee.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1726.388,1732.25,"I... I disagree with the construction, because I do think it depends on when you have to identify the employee."
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1736.714,1742.969,When the statute says an employee may file a charge within X number of days--
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1742.969,1743.41,--Right.
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1743.41,1747.431,"--does that word ""employee"" mean current employee and former employee?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1747.431,1752.974,It can mean either... it can mean an employee at the time the event occurred.
1996.95-1376,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1754.706,1760.631,"Yeah, but the person who's filling out the form, at the time he fills out the form is what the statute is talking about."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1764.803,1766.284,"--That... that's right, at the time he fills out the form."
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1768.545,1769.917,But that's a different argument.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1785.167,1788.407,"Your Honor, I do accept that argument."
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.506,1816.707,What you're saying is that the normal meaning is a current employer--
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1816.707,1817.328,--Exactly.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1817.328,1821.789,"--although, in some contexts, it's... it can be used differently."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1822.841,1823.421,Certainly.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1823.421,1825.953,"--in some contexts, you... you have to understand that it... it's being used differently."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1825.953,1826.614,That's right.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.113,1828.455,And you say this is just the normal context?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1828.455,1829.356,--That's correct.
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1836.499,1840.152,"Mr. Butler, I... I know there's an answer to this, and I'm really asking you for help on it."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1846.176,1846.847,That's right.
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1846.847,1848.056,Why--
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1848.056,1850.408,That's because if you look at who that--
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1850.408,1852.461,--That can't be right.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1852.461,1856.074,"--affects, the ""individual"" language is used for employment agencies."
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.396,1864.629,"You mean, it refers back... it says for--"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1864.629,1865.27,"--Yeah, I'm sorry."
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1883.459,1886.162,"--Well, it's not all that telling."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1892.816,1893.627,Yes.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.627,1901.462,"I mean, you can... you could want ""employee"" to include former employees without wishing it to include everybody in the world, former employee or not."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1901.462,1902.343,That's... that's certainly true.
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1912.839,1935.476,"Mr. Butler, would it cover a case where an applicant... an employee... current employee... doesn't get the promotion and is... stays on the payroll, continues to work, but is looking for another job; in the course of that job search, gets a reference which that employee says is retaliatory?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1944.9,1945.531,--That's right.
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1945.531,1949.334,"It may be a baseless claim, it may be a frivolous claim, but he has it?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1949.334,1950.646,That's correct.
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1950.646,1954.857,"So, now, let me go back to the question that I was putting before to Mr. Wolfson."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,1985.338,1992.33,"I would... I would agree with you to this extent: That once the employment is over, yes, 704 does not apply."
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1996.193,2000.167,"So the incentive for the employer, of your reading, is get rid of the person?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2000.167,2001.617,Yeah.
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2001.617,2004.418,"Then we insulate ourself, at least from the retaliation charge?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2004.418,2009.584,"To the extent an employer is motivated by a desire to give negative references, I'd agree with that."
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.142,2010.994,"Well, he doesn't have to fire him."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2019.139,2020.511,--Sure.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2020.511,2021.773,"That... that would handle the problem, wouldn't it?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2027.895,2028.896,That's correct.
1996.95-1376,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2068.563,2072.424,"But, of course, there, in... in the previous case, the test was whether a small employer is covered."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2077.228,2077.795,That's certainly true.
1996.95-1376,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2088.755,2089.536,"Yeah, but you've just admitted that."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2100.704,2104.186,--Perhaps I should have accepted his help.
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2111.65,2114.572,"You're sowing all sorts of dissension in the Court here, you know."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2114.873,2120.926,--I think the test that has been established does make some sense... not that I'm trying to divine the will of Congress from 32 years ago.
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2147.093,2152.957,"Mr. Butler, assuming... and I think we would all recognize that your interpretation is a reasonable one."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2169.216,2171.78,"Well, I would disagree in this case certainly, Your Honor."
1996.95-1376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2194.285,2199.646,"But the word ""employed by"" can mean past tense or present, I suppose?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2199.646,2204.759,"If you want to look at it from a linguist's standpoint, I think that's absolutely true."
1996.95-1376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2210.225,2210.553,"Well, I don't know."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2215.087,2235.58,"--I think if you... if you try to analyze the language into whether it's active or passive voice, and whether it's past or present tense, you completely lose sight of what any ordinary individual would read when they read 704... that an employer cannot do certain things to his employees."
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.58,2235.86,Yes.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2260.128,2263.159,"I... I would say it would be highly illegal, but not necessarily under this Act."
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.539,2265.36,What act would it violate?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2265.36,2266.842,--ERISA.
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2267.832,2268.473,"Oh, I see."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2270.914,2271.704,That's true.
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2271.704,2273.524,It would have been... it would have been perfectly lawful until ERISA was passed.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2273.524,2274.656,"Well, we--"
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2274.656,2278.938,"Indeed, you say, that's why they passed ERISA, right, to bag that guy?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2278.938,2285.203,--Exactly.
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2286.975,2293.129,You only find that out if you go into the legislative history of ERISA... and... and great doubts.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2294.148,2299.461,"I find the statute, alone, impenetrable, so the legislative history, I doubt it'd be any help."
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2337.966,2338.597,That's true.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2350.115,2350.706,That's crue.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2350.706,2351.717,--to a problem there.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2351.717,2352.378,That's true.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2356.839,2358.339,"No, you don't even have to show that."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2360.322,2360.933,"Oh, yeah."
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.933,2362.643,--It doesn't... doesn't have to be a term or condition.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2362.643,2363.143,I agree.
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2364.193,2381.925,"And so the... the... the problem that you brought up, which is a real one, about truthfulness in performance ratings and the remedy for that, do you make a false representation... all of that is just the same if you give the reference before the person leaves your employ."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2393.085,2394.032,Well--
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2394.032,2397.225,It's a not a reason to reject inclusion of former employees.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2397.225,2398.708,"--Well, timing is everything."
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2424.594,2435.132,"Well, your answer to me does say, then, for whatever reason, employers, you are home free by discharging someone; you will not be by keeping... keeping that person--"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2435.132,2436.561,--Well--
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2436.561,2438.624,"--in the current position, where the person is doing okay?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2438.624,2445.039,"--I would hesitate to say ""home free"", only because there are other acts, other statutes, other causes of actions--"
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2445.039,2446.449,At least for purposes of Title VII.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2446.449,2447.33,"--Yeah, for--"
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2447.33,2449.36,For purposes of the retaliation section.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2449.36,2452.433,"--For the... yes, for... if you narrow it down to the purposes of 704(a), yeah, I agree with you."
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2458.437,2464.892,"Mr. Butler, it just occurs to me, is it entirely clear that the... the phrase,"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2505.448,2506.189,Right.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2506.189,2507.508,--because he filed this frivolous complaint.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2509.121,2512.523,"Well, if he's no longer employed, my--"
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2512.523,2513.344,"No, no, he's still employed."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2513.344,2513.685,"--Yeah, oh--"
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.685,2514.246,He's still employed.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2514.666,2515.067,--I see.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2515.825,2516.176,--You see--
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2516.176,2516.767,--I... I don't think he is.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2527.115,2528.126,--Reasonably related to the employment.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2528.126,2528.396,Right.
1996.95-1376,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2528.396,2533.039,"Mr. Butler, does the Act itself, does it use the word ""retaliate""?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2533.039,2534.321,"No, actually, it does not--"
1996.95-1376,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2534.321,2536.612,So why are we talking about retaliation?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2536.612,2537.584,--It's a shorthand term.
1996.95-1376,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2545.779,2550.96,"Well, what if the employer treats everybody alike who has made a charge, he retaliates against them all?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2552.713,2560.728,"Well, the argument on the other side, Your Honor, would be that he's treating them differently than the people who have not made charges."
1996.95-1376,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2562.19,2566.932,"But it is... it's a... it's a short... ""retaliate"" is a shorthand form for the statutory language?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2566.932,2567.223,Exactly right.
1996.95-1376,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2588.778,2592.348,But wouldn't that evidence also show that you're... the discrimination charge has no merit?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2592.348,2593.279,Absolutely.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.358,2611.151,And then set forth those same reasons in the reference to the new employer?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2611.151,2613.112,"--They are the basis for the reference, yes."
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2613.112,2615.713,The same... the same reasons that had been affirmed in litigation?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2615.713,2616.664,That's correct.
1996.95-1376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2621.838,2631.023,"But since... since the language relied on is the same... you refer to discrimination... is that not the law of the case now, or--"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2631.023,2632.415,"--No it wouldn't be, Your Honor."
1996.95-1376,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2632.415,2632.926,--binding?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2632.926,2639.609,"It wouldn't be, Your Honor, because of it being two different statutes, and each statute has a separate basis for discrimination."
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2666.647,2667.379,"Well, nobody is disagreeing with that."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2672.47,2673.611,"Well, I think so."
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2673.611,2675.041,The question is whether you have to defend.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2675.041,2675.892,I... I think so.
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2683.469,2688.692,I go back to my question about how much of a trial is involved.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2714.328,2716.148,"No, I wouldn't think so."
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2719.761,2721.453,"Well, I don't know."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2745.581,2746.188,Yes.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2746.188,2750.321,"But, in fact, the motive here... the truth isn't a defense, is it?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2752.282,2753.214,You're exactly right.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2753.214,2755.204,--it doesn't matter that what you say is true?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2755.204,2756.075,That's right.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2756.075,2769.284,"So you have to convince a jury that this is not only true, but that the real reason you wrote that letter was... was what... I don't know... to be helpful to the new employer, rather than to retaliate against this fellow you've called hateful and odious?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2769.284,2770.065,Exactly right.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2773.136,2774.368,And the jury might not believe you?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2774.368,2775.527,--That's true.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2794.43,2804.776,"Indeed, if truth were a defense, this retaliatory cause of action would... would give this particular plaintiff no... no... no more benefit than would the normal libel law?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2804.776,2805.557,Exactly.
1996.95-1376,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2815.254,2816.885,"Mr. Butler... Mr. Butler, may I ask you one question?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2816.885,2817.286,--Sir?
1996.95-1376,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2817.286,2820.037,How often do you give references in discharge cases?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2820.037,2821.299,In discharge cases?
1996.95-1376,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2825.002,2826.312,In discharge cases?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2826.312,2828.603,Where it's discharge for cause?
1996.95-1376,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2829.043,2829.324,Yeah.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2829.324,2830.295,"Even at that, we will--"
1996.95-1376,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2830.295,2844.594,"And your solution for your case is... is a solution that will also preclude a claim in a case in which someone says... the employer says, Look, you file a charge against me, and I will see to it that you will never work in this business again?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2844.594,2846.364,--Your Honor--
1996.95-1376,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2846.364,2861.914,"So it's not... it's... well, what I'm getting at is that it is not just the frivolous case, the frivolous charge in your case, the reference, but it is also an instance in which an employer says you will absolutely never work in this business again?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2863.296,2871.353,"--It precludes any claim of retaliation by someone, after they've dis... been discharged, whether it's frivolous or whether it's serious."
1996.95-1376,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2871.353,2872.562,Okay.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2872.562,2873.514,You're... you're quite correct.
1996.95-1376,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2873.514,2877.077,And you could solve your problem by not giving references in discharge cases?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2877.077,2878.039,That's correct.
1996.95-1376,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2903.213,2905.755,But why wouldn't somebody who is not yet an employer retaliate?
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2934.413,2937.187,"--No, I don't, because that's not what the statute says."
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2941.758,2946.15,"It wouldn't be retaliation, of course, but the statute doesn't use the word ""retaliation""?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2946.15,2946.541,--That's right.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.172,2963.795,"But if you are a... a prospective employer and you turn down an applicant because I don't want to hire an applicant who has filed an EEOC complaint with his previous employer... this guy is a troublemaker... it wouldn't really be retaliation, but it would violate this provision, because it specifically refers to applicants for employment, right?"
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2963.795,2963.992,Yes.
1996.95-1376,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2967.404,2967.844,Retaliation.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2967.844,2968.686,That's right.
1996.95-1376,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2968.686,2982.775,"Yeah, but as... as a practical matter, it seems to me the... the situation, because it is not what's going to happen except among very, very stupid employers, because the... the retaliatory letter is... is not going to say, Don't hire this guy because he filed a complaint."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,2985.597,2986.518,That's right.
1996.95-1376,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2986.518,2998.186,"And... and the prospective employer who relies upon that is... is not drawing any distinction among employees, that... or among prospective employees... that is not a legitimate distinction."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,3000.297,3004.751,"I would agree; if it is a truthful reference, why should there be?"
1996.95-1376,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3011.075,3021.37,"Yeah, but I thought your argument... I thought your argument was that the person who is subject to this discrimination will have a cause of action under the statute against the prospective employer who relies upon the retaliatory letter."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,3021.37,3022.141,Well--
1996.95-1376,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3022.141,3028.216,"And unless the retaliatory letter is expressly based upon filing the EEOC complaint, that won't be true."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,3028.216,3028.654,--That's right.
1996.95-1376,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3038.021,3038.451,Right.
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,3039.012,3039.443,"--then you could make a case on that, yes."
1996.95-1376,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3039.443,3040.642,"--Yeah, that's a tough, uphill fight."
1996.95-1376,2,34101,lawrence_c_butler,,3042.445,3043.545,I... I would think not.
1996.95-1376,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3127.671,3129.462,"--Thank you, Mr. Butler."
1996.95-1376,3,16431,allen_m_lenchek,,3131.232,3141.29,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has additional questions, we have nothing further."
1996.95-1376,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3141.29,3144.206,"Very well, the case... the case is submitted."
