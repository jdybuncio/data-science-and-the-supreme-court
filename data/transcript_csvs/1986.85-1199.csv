1986.85-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,47.564,"Mr. Berger, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,47.564,63.24,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.449,210.937,And you say you raised a federal constitutional claim of this sort in the California Court of Appeals?
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,210.937,211.487,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,243.474,248.878,"For it, at any rate, to reach a different conclusion than the Supreme Court of California had reached."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,248.878,253.33,"--Well, that's true, and for any California court to reach a different conclusion."
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,294.007,302.18,"In California, I take it they say that you can get a declaration of invalidity and an injunction?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,302.18,302.847,That is what the California courts say.
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,302.847,303.497,And an injunction?
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,303.497,307.85,"Well, that I suppose would go along with the declaration of invalidity."
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,307.85,311.952,"Well, in any event, what's really left over is whether you can get damages for a temporary taking."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,311.952,318.106,"If you get a declaration of invalidity, what's left is compensation for the other period of time, that's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,318.106,324.176,And saying that you can't get damages for a temporary taking is a federal constitutional issue?
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,324.176,325.378,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,325.378,331.199,And just like whether there was a taking in the first place.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,331.199,335.418,It's a question of degree and of degree only.
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,335.418,338.786,"Well, you don't reach the remedy until you find there's a taking."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,338.786,342.405,In this case the complaint alleged there was a taking.
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,342.405,342.822,"Well, I know."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,342.822,344.122,Nobody challenged that.
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.122,345.122,"I know, I know."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,345.122,347.872,And the courts only dealt with the question of whether the remedy--
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,347.872,348.24,That's right.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,348.24,349.19,--was just compensation.
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,349.19,353.359,"But there were two constitutional questions and they just, they decided one of them."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,353.359,355.661,"No, they assumed one of them."
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,355.661,356.144,"Well, all right."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,361.798,364.481,But they assumed that the pleading under local law--
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,364.481,364.833,"Well, I know."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,364.833,365.8,--adequately alleged a taking.
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,372.653,379.509,All I'm trying to get at is that we needn't worry that there was no decision below that there was a taking.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,379.509,380.942,I agree with Your Honor that--
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,380.942,382.042,That's all I'm trying--
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,382.042,387.496,--you need not be concerned because the court below held it to be immaterial.
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,387.496,389.281,"--May I ask, Mr. Berger--"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,389.281,389.715,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,389.715,394.952,"--it seems to me there might be two different sorts of taking, and I'm just curious as to what your allegation."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,425.204,427.74,"I believe we do, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,428.906,437.929,"That even if the regulation is voided, that the temporary deprivation of use would have been so serious that it amounts to a taking of your property?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,437.929,442.0,--The detailed allegations are not that express in the complaint.
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,445.452,450.17,"I understand, that that's the taking and if it remains in place it's a taking."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,459.294,461.994,"--It seems to me that's implicit in the complaint, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,461.994,463.01,You think it's implicit in all allegations of taking?
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,463.01,463.944,It was never questioned in the courts below.
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,463.944,465.446,All allegations of taking?
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,465.446,468.314,"I believe it is, and as nobody ever questioned it--"
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,468.314,475.135,It certainly is at least theoretically possible that the temporary deprivation would not be serious enough to cross the constitutional threshold?
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,482.872,488.776,"--Well, in the colorful language of this Court in Loretto, taking doesn't depend on whether it's bigger than a breadbox."
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,488.776,490.561,That's a physical occupation.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,492.095,495.697,I understand that that was a physical occupation rather than a regulatory taking.
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,517.212,519.746,"But you're out of court now, you're out of court now."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,519.746,520.929,But that's a matter of fact.
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,520.929,521.664,You're out of court.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,521.664,528.168,The allegations are that the regulation did in fact take the use of property.
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,528.168,531.638,And you had no chance to prove it because you're out of court for another reason.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,531.638,532.672,"At this point, yes."
1986.85-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,532.672,536.923,"And do California rules allow notice pleading, the way the federal rules do?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,536.923,546.747,"Technically, it's called fact pleading, but the facts that are required to be pled in the complaint are equivalent to federal notice pleading."
1986.85-1199,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,579.368,584.439,May I ask you about the discussion of temporary taking.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,589.991,591.426,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,594.378,602.318,"So as of today, the argument in this case, are we to consider it as a temporary or a permanent taking?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,602.318,614.376,"Well, this temporary taking is now nine years old, and I strongly suspect from an economist's standpoint that if you have taken something for that long you've taken it permanently."
1986.85-1199,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,614.376,618.743,"If we leave the ordinance in effect, it'll be a permanent taking so far as we know, is that correct?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,618.743,619.543,"Yes, that's correct."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,619.543,630.468,"Well now, the case was litigated, though, was it not, under some temporary ordinance, as opposed to the one now in effect?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,630.468,634.539,"The case was originally filed under what they called a temporary ordinance, yes, ma'am."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,634.539,642.276,And you assert for our purposes here that that admittedly temporary ordinance is a permanent taking?
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,642.276,646.43,"That temporary ordinance was in effect for three years, of course, before they replaced it."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,656.953,662.022,But we are looking at it from the standpoint of that original temporary ordinance.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,662.022,673.83,"--I think-what this case involves is not the so-called temporary ordinance or the so-called permanent ordinance, but the County's pattern of regulation of this particular piece of land."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,683.203,685.055,"Well, that's the record we have in front of us."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,690.876,691.376,That's correct.
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,712.622,730.334,"Well, under your theory would a municipality or county that made it temporarily impossible to build on something because of road repair or something of that kind have made a taking then that requires compensation for that interim period?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,730.334,731.734,"--No, not necessarily, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,731.734,733.136,But possibly?
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,733.136,736.071,It would depend on what the facts showed.
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,745.261,746.677,"Well, some of these things take a while."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,753.282,753.516,"Yes, they can."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,754.016,756.766,And in your view that would require compensation.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,756.766,765.17,"--Under settled law, Your Honor, if access is totally deprived to property, that is the taking of the property interest and requires compensation."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,765.17,769.507,Even though it is admittedly for a temporary duration?
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,769.507,770.49,"Yes, ma'am."
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.943,811.567,"May I inquire, do they do this in California, what you've been saying in response to Justice O'Connor, that they routinely pay just compensation in dollars on these road repair situations?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,811.567,813.686,"--Not on minor road repairs, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,813.686,817.055,I thought in California the rule was they don't pay dollars for taking.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,818.521,821.522,I'm talking there about direct condemnation.
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.522,835.116,"But supposing they didn't... I think Justice O'Connor's question was supposing they didn't go through the compensation procedure, they just built a road in a way that denied access, all the use of an adjacent parcel of land, for 90 days."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,839.836,841.436,"90 days, I suspect--"
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,841.436,842.22,"Well, say six months."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,849.692,850.192,--Yes.
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,850.192,852.708,Would he be entitled to compensation in California--
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,852.708,852.925,Yes.
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,852.925,855.263,--for the same interference caused by road repair?
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,855.263,868.571,"I think if you looked at a case that the California Supreme Court decided called Jones versus People, which is precisely that case, where a parcel of vacant land was rendered inaccessible because of a freeway--"
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,868.571,871.623,"I'm talking about temporarily, not permanently."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,874.591,877.092,"--Well, eventually they did get access, eventually."
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,879.628,880.911,For a temporary period?
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,880.911,885.948,"And the Supreme Court said that damages had to be paid, just compensation had to be paid."
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,885.948,888.067,"Well, how does that square with Agins?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,890.3,894.471,They view regulations very differently from the way that they view anything else.
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.125,907.712,"So that if the state built a wall around this place because they thought it was too dangerous, the flood and all the rest, then you would have gotten compensation?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,907.712,909.212,I believe if they'd have done that--
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,909.212,911.58,"But not if they said, we'll post signs that say nobody can enter?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,913.096,914.929,--I believe if they had done that the courts would have viewed it differently.
1986.85-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,925.237,936.342,"Mr. Berger, did you argue to the Court of Appeals specifically in California that Agins was contrary to federal law, that Agins was unconstitutional under federal law?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,937.877,938.494,"Yes, we did."
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1021.56,1021.977,May I ask you--
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1021.977,1029.233,That it doesn't matter how you interfere with the owner's rights from the owner's standpoint.
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1032.601,1035.069,"--I understand, but you have a kind of a double-barreled claim."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1046.109,1046.743,That's correct.
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1046.743,1047.894,And that's a separate form of taking.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1057.835,1060.085,"Well, obviously we haven't gotten that far."
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.085,1063.739,"But you don't contend that in that situation you'd get the full value of the property, do you?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1063.739,1064.822,I sincerely doubt it.
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1075.63,1082.783,Supposing the appraiser found that at the date of cancellation of the regulation the property was even more valuable than it had been when you originally wanted to build.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1084.985,1087.735,That it was even more valuable?
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.263,1131.83,May I ask just one other question.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1145.44,1158.866,"If the property in fact... if the use of the property was taken during that interim, I believe that is a taking, and the taking would require a trial on what just compensation is due for that period of time."
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.866,1165.953,"So every time you invalidate a land use regulation, you'd be entitled to some compensation for the loss of use during the period it took to litigate it?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1165.953,1172.924,"I think it's potential, it's possible that there may be some cases where there in fact was no value lost."
1986.85-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1179.53,1195.789,"Mr. Berger, the Solicitor General has suggested that, rather than implying a damage remedy directly from the Constitution or inferring one directly from the Constitution, you would have the remedy of using Section 1983."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1214.517,1216.453,"Let me answer that in several ways, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1246.452,1248.721,Supposing it had been a federal regulatory taking.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1250.84,1254.375,1983 only works against state governments.
1986.85-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1254.375,1258.16,--Maybe that's why the Solicitor General thinks that that's better than applying it directly.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1258.16,1259.779,"It's something that he's totally uninvolved in, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1264.398,1266.6,"Well, it doesn't work against the state either, does it?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1266.6,1270.318,--You have Eleventh Amendment problems against the state.
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1270.318,1270.535,"Just municipalities, right, precisely."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1270.535,1273.254,"Yes, we're talking here only about local government agencies."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1273.254,1278.741,But you haven't commented on the underlying theory of the SG's suggestion in his brief.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1278.741,1279.907,No.
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1279.907,1283.275,That the Fifth Amendment is not self-executing at all.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1283.275,1309.426,"The underlying theory of the Solicitor General, Your Honor, I candidly found insulting to this Court because it was based on expressly stating that a whole raft of opinions of this Court, including most recently U.S. versus Clarke, in which this Court said the Fifth Amendment just compensation guarantee is self-executing, are simply wrong."
1986.85-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.913,1317.396,"Well, we just said, but we didn't hold it, because--"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1317.396,1319.282,"--That's true, you did say it."
1986.85-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1320.198,1321.9,--Where have we held that it's self-executing?
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1321.9,1322.916,--Let me show you in Jacobs.
1986.85-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.916,1323.582,Against government.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1323.582,1332.372,"In Jacobs versus United States, 290 U.S., this Court said in the holding the right to recover just compensation was guaranteed by the Constitution."
1986.85-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.583,1351.749,Where there's a taking.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1351.749,1352.165,Also--
1986.85-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.165,1355.717,"But if the court stops the taking, then there's no compensation."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1355.717,1356.201,--Of course.
1986.85-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.938,1368.009,"No, California says: We're not going to allow the taking."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1369.842,1371.858,I don't think they're saying that at all.
1986.85-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1371.858,1372.275,Your remedy is we will stop that taking.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1372.275,1373.377,That's a matter of fact.
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1383.649,1388.72,"What California says, if you take it without just compensation you've got to give it back, just as if you take--"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1388.72,1390.672,But you can't give back what's been taken in the past.
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1390.672,1391.205,--You cancel the regulation.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1400.46,1403.062,"That can be, yes, that's right."
1986.85-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1411.918,1415.453,"But they're two separate questions: what already occurred; when you give it back, has there still been a taking?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1415.453,1424.809,"I don't know that we've given it back, because what it does is it returns the regulation to the entity and tells the entity, draft a new regulation."
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1444.889,1447.424,But meanwhile you haven't had the use of your property in any event.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1447.424,1450.091,"Exactly, and that's entirely the problem."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1454.178,1462.684,"Well, Mr. Berger, do you think that local governments don't have authority to engage in flood control regulation?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1462.684,1467.136,"Oh, not for a minute do I make that assertion, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1468.171,1473.04,And does the church plan to rebuild on a flood plain where people have been killed?
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1474.659,1477.943,"The church can't plan to rebuild, because the ordinance won't allow it."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1477.943,1481.062,"If you get it struck down, that's the church's plan?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1481.062,1487.216,"If the ordinance were struck down, the church would like to be able to use the property the way it had used the property."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1528.655,1540.146,"Well, do you think that any time a local government says, in this particular location it's subject to flooding and no one may build there, that that is a taking?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1540.146,1541.046,It could be.
1986.85-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1557.942,1579.188,"Mr. Berger, suppose... is there anything that stands between your position and the Federal Government having to pay innumerable people nationwide some to be determined amount of compensation every time a regulation of the FCC or the FTC or any other federal agency is stricken down?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1579.188,1580.29,Is there anything that--
1986.85-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.29,1583.14,That stands between the position you're arguing here and that.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1583.14,1591.396,"--Sure, because in my situation what we are talking about is a regulation which totally deprives the owner of property of its rightful use."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1605.837,1615.027,"Well, how about a patented item or a designer drug of some kind, and you apply for federal approval and the regulatory process takes a long time."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1615.027,1618.395,That hasn't deprived you of the use of that.
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1618.395,1618.645,"Oh, yes."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1620.779,1623.431,"I don't believe that's technically true, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1624.716,1628.085,"Make that assumption, because I think there are some examples."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1628.085,1630.12,--Drugs is a different stories.
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1662.022,1665.626,"It's a little hard to distinguish that from your theory, frankly."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1665.626,1668.912,"--Well, I'm sorry that Your Honor is having that trouble."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1685.771,1692.027,But wouldn't your argument be exactly the same if your client had bought it ten days before the regulation went in effect?
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1692.027,1695.812,I don't think my argument would be quite as strong as if we owned it for 20 years.
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1695.812,1697.195,"You'd be making the same argument, wouldn't you?"
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1697.195,1700.633,If we bought it ten days before the regulation went into effect?
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1700.633,1705.751,"Sure, if you hadn't used it for 20 years, you bought the property ten days before and then the temporary regulation took effect."
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1705.751,1717.642,"Maybe, and we may end up arguing over the amount of damages, because if we had bought that property ten days before the regulation went into effect, after the devastating flood, I strongly suspect that the market price would have been virtually nil."
1986.85-1199,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1717.642,1721.344,But you would be arguing there had been a temporary taking.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1721.344,1723.177,There still may have been a taking.
1986.85-1199,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1727.831,1731.116,Not worth the attorney's fees.
1986.85-1199,0,35410,michael_m_berger,,1731.116,1733.516,"Probably not, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.151,1737.817,"Thank you, Mr. Berger."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,1739.15,1747.339,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1199,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1847.288,1853.025,"But doesn't that go beyond the ruling of the Court of Appeal, Mr. White?"
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,1883.544,1884.394,"--Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1986.85-1199,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1885.277,1887.162,That's a very strange procedure.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,1887.162,1888.529,Let me explain--
1986.85-1199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1888.529,1894.733,"We have to decide, do we want to avoid one constitutional question in order to get to another."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,1894.733,1903.089,"--Well, first of all, the constitutional question that I'm talking about has to have been raised as a prerequisite to reaching the remedy issue."
1986.85-1199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.89,1907.325,"Well, that's a different argument."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,1907.325,1907.942,It is.
1986.85-1199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1927.989,1930.673,"Well, it dispose the case on the basis that damages were not available."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,1930.673,1932.641,"It did, Your Honor, based on Agins."
1986.85-1199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1932.641,1933.81,So the case was over then.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,1933.81,1935.543,"It was over, that's correct."
1986.85-1199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1935.543,1936.543,"Well, they're out of court."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,1945.349,1953.038,"Justice White, there was a way in which they could very easily have gotten into court in this action and preserved the issue for this Court."
1986.85-1199,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1972.935,1975.22,But that isn't what the California Court of Appeals said here.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,1985.993,1986.826,That's correct.
1986.85-1199,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1989.394,1991.079,"Perhaps they could have, but it didn't."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,1991.079,1994.114,It never passed on the question of whether there was a taking.
1986.85-1199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.391,2013.242,"But that's not part of the case, Mr. White."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2052.051,2054.235,"Your Honor, I think that's correct."
1986.85-1199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2083.303,2084.636,"Not just colorably, but fully?"
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2087.022,2087.972,--That's right.
1986.85-1199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2087.972,2089.04,It has to be valid.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2089.04,2091.491,In order to reach the remedy question.
1986.85-1199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.636,2147.14,You want us to review the federal issue that was not decided below in order not to review the federal issue that was decided below.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2147.14,2152.194,"That's correct, because it is antecedent to reviewing the federal issue that is before the Court now."
1986.85-1199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2162.632,2168.053,"May I ask, though, the first cause of action, last allegation, is"
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2172.94,2173.523,That's correct.
1986.85-1199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2173.523,2174.406,Why doesn't that allege a taking?
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2174.406,2176.058,"No, that does not, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2188.598,2188.848,"Well, I understand."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2193.068,2193.485,--That's correct.
1986.85-1199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2193.485,2194.102,But they didn't do that.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2194.102,2199.222,"And in addition to that... no, they didn't allege anything but that it denies all use, which is the barest of conclusions."
1986.85-1199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.979,2236.597,Don't we also have to look at the survey?
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2236.597,2238.447,The survey?
1986.85-1199,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2238.447,2240.133,Or whatever the property looks like?
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2245.452,2248.238,"Well, the question is who has the burden of presenting the facts--"
1986.85-1199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2248.238,2252.206,It's very hard for an appellate court to try a case that hasn't been... to try an issue that hasn't been tried below.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2252.206,2253.056,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2271.854,2275.889,Why would we have to say without more that this didn't state a taking?
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2293.247,2296.449,Why would who go to the trouble of deciding the remedy issue?
1986.85-1199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.449,2296.982,The Court of Appeals.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2296.982,2299.567,Because that was the only issue in front of them.
1986.85-1199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.084,2307.805,"Well, it wasn't even in front of them on your theory, because there was absolutely no reason to even get to it."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2310.107,2310.707,--No.
1986.85-1199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2333.205,2335.824,You led the Court of Appeals into it?
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2335.824,2339.192,"We led the Court of Appeals into it, but the plaintiff has--"
1986.85-1199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.192,2344.78,"Dispose of this case on a remedy issue, forget all this business about taking."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2344.78,2347.882,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think that's correct."
1986.85-1199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.882,2349.417,"Well, that's what your motion was apparently."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2349.417,2349.917,"Well, but--"
1986.85-1199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2349.917,2350.267,Agins.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2350.267,2355.052,--But why was it the County's burden to do something beyond what was necessary--
1986.85-1199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.052,2361.558,"I don't know whether it was your burden or not, but you wanted to get rid of the case on this particular federal issue, namely Agins."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2364.177,2366.127,--I'm sorry.
1986.85-1199,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2373.032,2373.715,Right.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2373.715,2374.632,--for a taking.
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2457.869,2465.542,"Mr. White, did not the Court of Appeals, the California Court of Appeals, assume the correctness of the allegations in the complaint?"
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2465.542,2466.508,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2466.508,2467.577,You made a motion to strike.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2467.577,2473.029,But a motion to strike does not test the validity of the allegations.
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2478.6,2486.622,"Why did the Court of Appeals quote from Agins, the California Supreme Court case to the effect that there was a total taking of use?"
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2486.622,2488.538,What it said was--
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2488.538,2491.257,Referring to the ordinance that was in the complaint.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2491.257,2497.394,"--No, my recollection of what the Court of Appeals said was that if there is a total taking."
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2497.394,2500.196,"I don't think that's right, but you may be."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2501.382,2511.32,But there is only a total taking or a total denial of use that amounts to a taking if the County does not have the right to prevent that use.
1986.85-1199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2625.66,2626.41,Has the obligation to do it without condemnation?
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2631.563,2632.88,"--Well, the bottom line is this."
1986.85-1199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2737.113,2739.899,"Counsel, do we have to do that to decide this case?"
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2739.899,2741.549,I think the--
1986.85-1199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2741.549,2744.851,Do I have to find out how wide that canyon is?
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2744.851,2758.043,"--The Court does have to decide whether the bare statement of a denial of all use states a cause of action in the face of the record that I am discussing now, the facts that are in the record."
1986.85-1199,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2765.716,2783.844,"Well, Mr. White, supposing the California Court of Appeals had expressly said: The plaintiff's complaint in this case states only that the regulation denies them all use of their property; the Appellee says this is not enough to state a claim for taking; but under our pleading law we hold that it is."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2788.646,2799.937,"Yes, I do, Your Honor, because I think that the ultimate question of whether an adequate federal claim has been stated lies with this Court, not with the Court of Appeals in California."
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2824.636,2827.588,May I ask you a hypothetical.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2827.588,2828.271,Yes.
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2828.271,2829.321,You're talking about flood control.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2855.488,2865.344,"I think the question... I think, Justice Powell, the question would be whether the restriction was reasonably necessary to--"
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2865.344,2875.235,"Let's assume it was reasonably necessary; so that if you owned property within that area you get zero compensation, is that your construction of the Fifth Amendment?"
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2875.235,2877.918,"--Your Honor, I do believe that's correct."
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2902.718,2903.802,Let me give you another one.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2926.066,2927.132,"Oh, of course."
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2927.132,2928.168,Of course there would be?
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2928.168,2928.734,Yes.
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2928.734,2929.284,Why?
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2929.284,2930.62,If the state wanted to make a park?
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2930.62,2935.238,"A zoning ordinance, a zoning ordinance that zones a property for park use only."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2938.69,2942.242,I think I may have misunderstood your question.
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2945.36,2948.395,"--And you bought the property when it was zoned, say, for residential."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2967.606,2970.456,Do we have the safety element involved here?
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2970.456,2972.058,No safety element.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2972.058,2972.258,No safety?
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2974.191,2974.741,Wait a minute.
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,2978.495,2978.795,--Yes.
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3038.033,3043.252,"Would there be a taking, for which compensation would be allowed?"
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,3043.252,3046.787,"--In your zoning case, where they had zoned it into a park, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3046.787,3048.054,There would be compensation?
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,3048.054,3056.29,"Well, it would be a taking for which compensation would be required if the zoning regulation remained permanent."
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3080.858,3085.81,"Well, coming back to this case, let's assume that there had never been a flood, no threat of flood."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,3109.192,3112.227,"If permitted to stand, yes, I believe that would be a taking."
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3112.227,3112.677,It would?
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,3112.677,3113.26,Yes.
1986.85-1199,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3113.26,3115.596,"But because of the flood, that's the difference?"
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,3115.596,3116.112,Yes.
1986.85-1199,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3144.862,3146.695,Yours is limited to safety?
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,3146.695,3148.461,"--Absolutely, absolutely."
1986.85-1199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3233.817,3242.257,"Mr. White, just in case we reach the merits, do you want to say a few words about why we shouldn't imply a monetary cause of action?"
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,3242.257,3245.025,"Yes, Justice Scalia, I will."
1986.85-1199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3280.346,3282.465,"It sure does, except for the interim period."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,3282.465,3284.065,"Except for the interim period, that's correct."
1986.85-1199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3284.065,3284.915,"Now, why shouldn't we imply--"
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,3284.915,3291.569,Because the interim period is nothing more than a delay inherent in the regulatory process.
1986.85-1199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3302.191,3304.857,"--That may be, but during that delay the person has been deprived of the use of the land."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,3304.857,3305.809,But they do in all the other cases.
1986.85-1199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3312.944,3313.244,What other cases?
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,3315.529,3317.362,--A delay in issuing a building permit perhaps.
1986.85-1199,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3357.689,3382.637,"Well, Mr. White, there are some horror stories out there of local governments intentionally running these things through the mill indefinitely in a jurisdiction like California, with full recognition that if they lose on one they can make a minor modification of the requirement and go again and effectively deprive people forever of any use."
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,3385.339,3388.791,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't know of any horror stories."
1986.85-1199,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3394.961,3397.361,"Well, the Agins come pretty close, don't they?"
1986.85-1199,1,33568,jack_r_white,,3397.361,3402.282,"--Well, the Agins, I don't know what happened after the Agins decision was decided."
1986.85-1199,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3485.836,3487.288,"Thank you, Mr. White."
1986.85-1199,2,35410,michael_m_berger,,3489.573,3492.109,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1986.85-1199,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3570.442,3571.375,"Thank you, Mr. Berger."
