1964.489,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,46.427,"Number 489, United States, Petitioner, versus Atlas Life Insurance Company."
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,48.084,51.832,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, and may it please the Court."
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,240.065,241.492,Where is your chart up here?
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,241.492,242.702,The very back of our brief.
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,243.645,244.754,"All the way at back, I see."
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,244.754,245.886,"Yes, the very back."
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,245.886,246.32,Thank you.
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,246.32,251.542,And I shall refer to it to take simplified figures quite frequently.
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,342.767,349.963,"Mr. Solicitor General, would you let me try to simplify it and I hope I don't really complicate it."
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,351.519,353.498,Yes.
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,353.498,356.504,If $8 is needed for the policyholders' reserve --
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,356.504,357.715,Right.
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,357.715,359.92,-- $3 for the company.
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,359.92,361.065,Right.
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,361.065,371.409,And actually what they receive is $5 in the state bondage and $5 in General Motors.
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,383.916,384.552,Yes.
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,384.552,387.725,"Therefore, you have to take three of the tax -- of the state bond interest --"
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,387.725,389.09,You would have to -- surely you have to do that.
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,389.09,390.446,That -- wouldn't you?
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,403.0,403.766,Right.
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,405.035,405.684,Right.
1964.489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,405.684,405.865,(Voice Overlap)
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,405.865,408.132,Now there would be no tax at all.
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,408.132,409.079,There would be no tax at all.
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,409.079,424.028,"Whereas if you'll allocate the $5 of state bond interest to the policyholders and then draw $3 from the General Motors' interest to make up to $8, then there'd be $2 for General Motors' interest that would be taxed."
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,424.028,424.857,Right.
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,424.857,429.768,"Now, what I'm not quite sure off, the government's position is that neither of those solutions applied."
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,429.768,430.952,That's correct.
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,430.952,435.636,The government's position is that the allocation should be applied.
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,435.636,443.48,$4 from the General Motors' interest and $4 from the municipal bond reduction.
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,443.48,445.803,So that then the tax is on $1?
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,445.803,447.9,So the tax would be on $1 --
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,447.9,448.082,One dollar.
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,448.082,451.018,-- because the company has $1 that's left.
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,457.269,459.018,That's right.
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,459.018,474.546,Our position would be that the way you stated it first where the statute requires all the bond interest to be used up first for the policyholders' reserve as in the 1921 Act.
1964.489,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,506.197,509.465,And that's the way the insurance company invest.
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,509.465,511.991,"Yes, yes."
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,660.498,671.488,"Before you do Mr. Solicitor General, you mentioned a moment ago about tax -- taxability through the company or its stockholders, the -- stock companies or mutual companies are treated --"
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,671.488,671.955,No.
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,671.955,673.844,"-- exactly alike here, I think."
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,673.844,676.601,"If -- for all purposes, they are the same in this."
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,676.601,678.313,And we're talking only about income as (Voice Overlap) --
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,678.313,679.189,When I said that --
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,679.189,681.053,"-- on the insurance companies, said company."
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,681.053,682.059,"Right, right."
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,685.581,689.522,"Well, that's -- but most of them are -- don't have stockholders anymore, if you know, there's many of them."
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,689.522,690.007,Right.
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,695.142,696.581,Right.
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,696.581,704.518,The statute is set forth beginning at page 87 of our brief.
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1196.41,1205.317,"Are you talking about the -- changing into those percentages of tax-free income, income after the reserved addition --"
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1205.317,1205.421,Yes.
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1205.421,1206.536,-- or after?
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1206.536,1208.134,Yes.
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1208.134,1208.28,(Voice Overlap)
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1208.28,1208.901,"Oh, no!"
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1209.89,1210.013,Total?
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1210.013,1211.056,-- about putting total.
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1211.056,1211.567,Total?
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1211.567,1212.519,"Total, excuse me."
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1215.382,1215.612,After.
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1215.612,1216.537,-- the deduction.
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1216.537,1217.813,But you're talking about total per se.
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1217.813,1224.081,I'm talking about total just as shown -- as we show the 10% here by the cross (Inaudilbe).
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1235.051,1235.566,Taxable?
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1235.566,1242.253,"Taxable, it's -- the tax base is reduced proportionately."
1964.489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1268.607,1272.704,Isn't this sort of the analysis from Mr. Justice Stone in Gehner?
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1272.704,1275.94,I think this is very similar to the analysis of Mr. Justice Stone in Gehner.
1964.489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1275.94,1277.948,It didn't quite prevail.
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1277.948,1284.407,"Which didn't prevail, but that was not a case dealing with net -- a net income tax."
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1308.455,1319.849,"If the whole income -- this is probably a very stupid question, but if the whole income came from non-taxable sources, state, county and municipal bonds, there would be no question, no problem at all."
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1319.849,1320.497,There'd be no problem.
1964.489,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1320.497,1321.313,"No taxation, no tax."
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1321.313,1321.725,No.
1964.489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.956,1404.67,"What's your answer though, Mr. Solicitor General, to the National Life I suppose that if you have $40,000 income from taxable sources, and then you get -- then you get the $20,000 worth of tax-free income, you increase your tax."
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1404.67,1404.987,The tax is --
1964.489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1404.987,1407.266,(Voice Overlap)
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1412.25,1429.307,"Well, that in the first place, there are a number of cases where that happens and it does not violate the immunity or the National Life case Your Honor wishes may discuss it now, seems to me to be a quite different problem in this respect."
1964.489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.928,1470.666,(Voice Overlap)
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1470.666,1471.564,"Now, I would say --"
1964.489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.564,1474.492,"Its -- really a difference in kind, not the --"
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1474.492,1474.79,"Well, --"
1964.489,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1474.79,1475.5,-- not in this degree?
1964.489,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1475.5,1481.063,Let me point out that the -- two differences.
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,3456.358,3459.957,May it please the Court.
1964.489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3697.284,3705.421,"Mr. Darrell, I gather that you think is the “but for” --"
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,3705.421,3707.099,That's what he means for the “but for”.
1964.489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3707.099,3707.621,Yes.
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,3707.93,3714.064,I cannot read that case and the other cases as coming out the way of the learned Solicitor General suggested.
1964.489,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3714.064,3716.492,This was a “but for” test that the Court applied in --
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,3716.492,3716.788,Yes.
1964.489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3716.788,3717.56,-- National Life.
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,3717.56,3718.279,Yes.
1964.489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3718.279,3719.58,And in Gehner?
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,3719.58,3722.386,In Gehner.
1964.489,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3724.025,3738.676,(Inaudible)
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,3738.676,3754.614,"That is correct but in the National Life, the Court decided the Packard Motor Power Company, a Michigan Supreme Court case which involved just such an apportionment and inside of that case was approval."
1964.489,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3766.412,3769.752,(Inaudible)
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,3769.752,3770.596,I think I do.
1964.489,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3770.596,3771.078,(Inaudible)
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,3771.078,3771.757,I think so.
1964.489,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3771.757,3772.94,(Inaudible)
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,3772.94,3774.773,That's the way you -- the fact said.
1964.489,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3774.773,3777.04,(Inaudible)
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,3777.04,3778.39,That is correct.
1964.489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4093.987,4108.399,"Mr. Darrell, is that -- could you see any difference between this proviso that was put on in its present form and a proviso which would have said if this results in unconstitutionally taxing interest an adjustment shall be made."
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,4108.399,4110.624,I think it's an entirely different thing.
1964.489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4117.263,4117.857,I know but the way you put it --
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,4117.857,4118.55,-- (Voice Overlap) --
1964.489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4118.55,4125.024,"The way you put it, you said the proviso means that if this results in taxing -- tax-exempt interest."
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,4125.024,4130.993,"Yes, the proviso does say that no -- that it could result in imposing a tax on tax-exempt interest, the interest that the --"
1964.489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4130.993,4132.68,What does tax-exempt interest mean?
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,4132.68,4134.078,I mean state and municipal bond interest.
1964.489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4134.078,4137.134,I know but tax-exempt by what?
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,4137.134,4137.441,Well --
1964.489,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4137.441,4139.154,Constitutionally?
1964.489,1,37062,norris_darrell,,4139.154,4147.122,"Well, I would say that -- I would say that the Congress meant that they did not want a tax tax-exempt interest."
1964.489,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5251.342,5252.511,Mr. Goldberg.
1964.489,2,20889,daniel_b_goldberg,,5252.511,5254.909,May it please the Court.
1964.489,3,15704,archibald_cox,,7045.343,7054.31,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to direct myself simply to two specific points."
1964.489,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7278.563,7283.211,"Mr. Solicitor General, the question that was last asked to Mr. Goldberg."
1964.489,3,15704,archibald_cox,,7298.641,7312.677,"Well I would say that if there is no tax on income within the meaning of 103, there was really no argument left as to whether this tax went beyond the con -- the assumed constitutional immunity."
1964.489,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7312.677,7315.1,"I know, but if there isn't, that's the question."
1964.489,3,15704,archibald_cox,,7317.155,7318.337,(Voice Overlap)
1964.489,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7318.337,7321.842,-- for the purpose of the statute whether it is for the purposes of the constitution?
1964.489,3,15704,archibald_cox,,7321.842,7337.88,I think you would have to decide whether this is a tax on state bond interest for the purposes of the basic constitutional doctrine that a tax may not be imposed on state bond interest.
