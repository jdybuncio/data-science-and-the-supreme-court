1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.039,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-560, First Options of Chicago v. Manuel Kaplan."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,55.468,57.937,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.312,182.084,What do you have here... what is the closest thing to a formal stipulation to have the arbitrator decide that you have here?
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,182.084,193.725,"--We have a motion that they filed with an accompanying memorandum of law saying, addressing the issue of jurisdiction, and asking the arbitrators to determine whether or not they had jurisdiction."
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,196.327,204.449,"Where did it say that moreover, we will be content with whatever determination the arbitrator makes?"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,219.609,222.311,We don't say that whatever the arbitrators say goes.
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,228.064,236.254,--Not an arbitrator's determination that the parties have agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration.
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,238.354,241.022,The determination of whether they've agreed to submit it to arbitration?
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,241.022,241.406,Yes.
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,241.406,246.11,I think that that is obviously entitled to... that should be reviewed by the Court.
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,266.006,271.475,"But that's a different thing than whether the parties agreed to arbitrate at all, isn't it?"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,271.475,273.158,"Yes, it is."
1994.94-560,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.693,281.247,What was the law in the Third Circuit at the time of this arbitration?
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,300.475,304.962,"--The law in the Third Circuit was very confused before this case, and continues to be confused."
1994.94-560,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,342.737,343.254,Mr.--
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,352.86,353.36,Sure.
1994.94-560,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,359.631,361.199,What would your position be?
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,361.199,364.335,--My position would be that that would not be sufficient.
1994.94-560,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.989,381.112,So you would force anybody who didn't want to lose the right of judicial review to litigate that issue first.
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,381.112,384.397,I would force them to litigate the issue in one forum or another.
1994.94-560,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,388.016,395.186,"Well, you would force them to litigate it in district court if they ever wanted district court review at all."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,395.186,412.647,"--If they wanted district court review on a de novo basis, yes, I would say they would have to go to district court at the outset, but as the slew of cases that this Court sees and that we all see going to arbitration demonstrates, parties submit very difficult and complex issues to arbitration all the time."
1994.94-560,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,412.647,416.785,That just seems to kind of defeat the whole purpose of arbitration.
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,425.705,426.538,I don't think that's correct at all.
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,445.851,446.668,It reminds me--
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,446.668,447.201,--right to court.
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.201,462.211,"--of the old-fashioned rule, which we've left behind a long time ago in all jurisdictions as far as I know, that you could not challenge the jurisdiction of a court, that if you appeared to argue that the court had no jurisdiction, you automatically submit yourself to the court's jurisdiction."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,474.419,484.977,"Well, to begin with, we're not arguing at all that the parties waive or forego their right to determination of arbitrability when they present that issue to the arbitrator."
1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,484.977,490.047,"No, but they forego that determination on a de novo standard of review."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,491.347,496.801,"They give up the right to have a judicial determination de novo, but in return, they achieve--"
1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,496.801,497.601,And to that extent--
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,497.601,498.319,--the benefits of arbitration.
1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,498.319,505.807,"--the analogue seems to me, just as Justice Scalia said, it's like the analogue of the person who files a special appearance and then argues jurisdiction."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,513.429,518.448,There are a lot of differences between court jurisdiction and arbitral jurisdiction.
1994.94-560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,523.784,527.755,"But you say consent of the parties, and this is what puzzles me about your case."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,537.111,537.594,--That's correct.
1994.94-560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,537.594,558.423,"--from who submitted to arbitration, and here we have that who submitted to arbitration, and on that question, like a personal jurisdiction question, what authority is there that who is treated just like what, and that if you put it before the arbitrator, then you get, in essence, what the old special appearance was."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,561.975,569.046,"There are many situations in which arbitrability, arbitration is not set by a particular preexisting contract but by the agreement of the parties."
1994.94-560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,595.464,597.982,Are you saying there's no difference between a who and a what question?
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,597.982,604.286,"--Yes, as far as whether the parties have the authority or the right to submit that to arbitration if they want to."
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,604.286,616.86,But I thought you... I thought in response to a question I asked you earlier you agreed that the parties always had a right to de novo review of the question of whether they had agreed to arbitrate at all.
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,616.86,618.979,Whether they had agreed to arbitrate at all?
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,627.485,642.077,"And you say the only way to avoid submission is you don't simply say to the arbitrators, we didn't agree to submit this, or we didn't even agree to arbitrate, you must go into district court and get a... file an unnamed action of some sort?"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,642.077,648.481,"If you're not satisfied with having the arbitrators determine arbitrability, the alternative is to go into court."
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,648.481,662.741,"But you talk about arbitrability as... when you say arbitrability, do you mean the agreement to arbitrate, or do you mean whether a particular part of the dispute is subject to the agreement to arbitrate?"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,662.741,663.458,Both.
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,665.793,682.488,"Well, but I think you would clarify things for several of us up here if you could break it down and look at it as first, did a party agree to arbitrate at all, and second, what did the party agree to arbitrate, as Justice Ginsburg suggested in her question."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,682.488,688.492,"--I think that we can make those issues quite separate, but I believe the result is the same under both situations."
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,707.52,715.393,"Sure, but it's a question of what is the reasonable implication of the mere fact that the party appears to argue the point."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,756.037,757.253,I disagree with that.
1994.94-560,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,782.002,791.81,"Are you saying if they had not done that, they had just said to the arbitrator, we don't think you have this authority, but we won't argue it because we don't want to waive it, would they then have been entitled to de novo review?"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,791.81,795.578,"That's the George Day decision, and I agree with respondent's point on that."
1994.94-560,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.706,814.456,I'm not sure I have your answer.
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,820.979,829.566,"My... that again, you know, it's not this case, but my view is that would be a waiver of the argument, and I think there's a big difference between waiver and deference in this case."
1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,829.566,838.005,"Well, what's the difference also, then, between that situation and the situation which I thought your brief was referring to in which there is simply a straight refusal to arbitrate?"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,847.444,847.794,Absolutely.
1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,855.531,856.383,So you haven't changed--
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,856.383,856.967,--before them.
1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,856.967,859.168,"--A moment ago, I thought you might be changing your position on that--"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,859.168,859.718,No.
1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,859.718,870.642,"--because I thought you said that if they did not want to suffer the effects of implicit agreement by submission, they would have to, they the objecting party would have to go into court, and you're not saying that--"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,870.642,871.009,"No, I'm not."
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,884.784,885.167,--This is--
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,885.167,886.152,I think that should be a waiver.
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,886.152,888.521,"--Well, that's what I wonder, maybe."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,903.113,903.647,Mm-hmm.
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,903.647,909.517,"And the question is, is this part of the thing subject to arbitration, and Smith says it is, and Jones says it isn't."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,909.517,910.534,Right.
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,910.534,913.736,"Now, that fight, they're free to submit to arbitration, aren't they?"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,913.736,914.403,That's right.
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,914.403,916.938,"So the whole question is, have they agreed to do it?"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,916.938,917.455,Right.
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,917.455,918.123,All right.
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,962.133,991.921,"The reason we need a special rule in this situation is because we have a Federal Arbitration Act and a well announced Federal policy regarding arbitration that encourages arbitration and enforces agreements to arbitrate and gives strong deference to arbitral decisions, and the question, I think, should be is, not why should this contract question be treated any differently than any other contract question, but why should this contract question decided by an arbitrator be treated differently than any other contract question--"
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,991.921,992.654,"Oh, the answer to that question--"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,992.654,993.254,--by an arbitrator?
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,993.254,1004.312,"--of course is, in my mind is, it shouldn't be, but the issue in this case is whether or not they did agree to submit that question to arbitration, and obviously the parties could make it clear."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1020.705,1021.121,Right.
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1021.121,1023.79,"And then we have the ambiguous middle case, which is this one."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1025.825,1032.479,"Well, if what you're saying is, is basically that the courts should decide this issue with the same kinds of standards that they apply--"
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1032.479,1033.029,Yes.
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1033.029,1034.931,--to other deferen... other arbitration decisions--
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1034.931,1035.33,No.
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1035.33,1036.366,--on contract matters.
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1036.366,1040.917,"--contract decisions, namely, you're trying to decide what the parties agreed to."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1040.917,1063.617,"Well, there also is a question in this case, for example, as to whether Mr. Kaplan had agreed to pay over certain money, and as to whether First Options had agreed, or First Options had increased Mr. Kaplan's losses and therefore was responsible for some of those debts, and those questions were in large part contractual questions governed by the four-part workout agreement."
1994.94-560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1102.075,1108.979,I thought you agreed that the starting point is there must be a clear and unmistakable submission of the issue.
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1127.191,1146.354,"--By a clear and unmistakable submission... I think we should go back to what we mean by that language in AT&T Technologies, and again, that was a case where the issue came up in the first instance in the courts, and the court was speculating as to, well, what would the rule be if one party is saying, but they agreed to submit this to arbitration, so you should submit it to arbitration?"
1994.94-560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1167.451,1186.212,"Are you saying that the clear and unmistakable standard doesn't apply, or that when they go to the arbitrator and say, we don't think we belong before you but we're ready to let you decide it, that that's a clear and unmistakable submission that the arbitrators' decision will get only deferential review?"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1186.212,1186.831,--Exactly.
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1193.568,1196.937,"Oh, well, that's... look, that's exactly the point that's bothering me."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1232.627,1233.227,Right.
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1233.227,1239.448,"The issue is whether they agreed to submit the house issue to arbitration, and then you just look at it like any other agreement."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1239.448,1239.814,Right--
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1239.814,1250.738,"Now, there is this language, though, about clear and unmistakable, but I don't see where in the Arbitration Act that policy would come from and, indeed, you might think it was the opposite, if anything, but I don't see why it isn't neutral."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1250.738,1253.357,--That comes from the AT&T Technologies case--
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1253.357,1253.757,Yes.
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1253.757,1264.046,"--and it's completely different from this situation, and I think you're exactly right, the question of whether the parties have agreed to arbitration is a different question from whether the case is arbitrable--"
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1264.046,1264.529,But--
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1264.529,1268.283,--and I think the submission in this case is the key indication that they've agreed to submit.
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1268.283,1269.233,"--Well, why is that?"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1305.773,1306.242,I--
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.242,1308.492,"This fellow comes to the arbitrator and he says, I'm about to arbitrate this case."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1315.264,1315.648,--I think--
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.648,1317.966,"That's just not fair, it really isn't."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1317.966,1322.168,"--I suggest that when the gentleman showed up with the bulldozer, you had a few fewer options than Mr. Kaplan had."
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.168,1322.818,Well--
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1322.818,1325.47,Mr. Kaplan had the right to refuse to go ahead with arbitration.
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.194,1342.997,"--But he certainly would have spoken to the bulldozer first, then he'd run off to court, and so also here."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1348.151,1352.87,"He could have gone and said, I object to arbitrability and I'm going to... I'm not going to show up."
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1354.305,1355.655,Isn't there--
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1355.655,1356.857,--and I'm going to require you to go to court.
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1356.857,1368.149,"--Isn't there a line of authority... it may be minority authority somewhere... that says if you don't show up before the arbitrator, you can nonetheless be held liable for the arbitrator's decision?"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1368.149,1371.015,"There is, and that's often in the rules that parties have agreed to."
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1383.491,1397.918,"Well, that seems to me it's all the more important then that there be some clear... a finding that there's been a clear agreement to arbitrate in the first place, if that can happen to you if you do agree to arbitrate."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1397.918,1401.786,But the issue in this case is not so much whether there's an agreement to arbitrate.
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1406.005,1415.194,"But I thought it was contested by the respondents that the respondent individually ever agreed to arbitrate, that they're... in those four documents."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1415.194,1420.348,"Well, first of all, I think it's important to point out in this case there are four different ways in which arbitrability could have been found."
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1430.305,1432.189,What is the waiver argument?
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1432.189,1436.543,The waiver argument is that they initially filed objections to arbitrability.
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1443.447,1446.165,And what had gone on in the intervening 2 years?
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1446.165,1447.132,Not a lot.
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1447.132,1449.117,"Not anything, isn't that right?"
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1449.117,1453.921,"Well, I assume the parties spent time during those 2 years preparing their case and working on their witnesses."
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1455.038,1457.79,The arbitrator wasn't doing anything.
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1457.79,1466.478,"The arbitrator, the arbitration panel was not doing anything during that time, but that waiver, if it took place, took place in front of the arbitration panel."
1994.94-560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1471.899,1472.416,That's a much different argument.
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1484.924,1487.059,"--No, that's not correct."
1994.94-560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1502.435,1519.53,"The essence of your argument, I take it, is that everything must be made a Federal case by the person who says, I never agreed to arbitrate, because you can't... if you put it to the arbitrator and the arbitrator agrees, that's the end of the matter, and the litigation becomes unnecessary."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1527.117,1550.549,"We give those parties the alternative to either refuse to arbitrate, which can be a viable option in some cases, or to go to Federal court themselves, or to submit the arbitrability issue along with everything else to the arbitrators, and in this case that's what the parties did, and the question in this case is not whether there's an agreement to arbitrate, but whether, when the parties decided to go ahead and submit that issue--"
1994.94-560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1550.549,1552.184,Do I gather that your answer to my question is yes--
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1552.184,1552.568,--Yes.
1994.94-560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1552.568,1573.498,"--that if you want to protect your right to a Federal forum, you must go to Federal court, you cannot hope that the arbitrator will say, right, you never agreed to arbitrate, which would leave out a certain number of these cases, but every time a person says, I didn't agree to arbitrate, it must be brought up in Federal court, otherwise you lose that."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1573.498,1574.648,Two points about that.

1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1607.153,1610.54,"Well, my time is up, and I'd like to reserve some time for rebuttal."
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.063,1620.096,Very well--
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,1620.096,1620.396,Thank you.
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1620.396,1621.146,--Mr. Holzhauer.

1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1663.088,1673.713,"Mr. Roberts, when you use the term, arbitrability, you mean the agreement of the parties to, the consent of the parties to have a dispute arbitrated?"
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1673.713,1683.152,"--That's arbitrability, and the question in this case is, did the Kaplans agree to arbitrate that question, the question of arbitrability?"
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.238,1698.494,"Then how would you describe a question of whether a particular subject is subject to the arbitration agreement, which the parties concededly agreed to?"
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1698.494,1702.565,"Well, in other words, there is an arbitration contract, and there's a dispute."
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1704.798,1706.117,"Yes, that's what confuses me."
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1710.402,1714.104,The term is used simultaneously in both instances.
1994.94-560,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1741.19,1756.283,Do you think our law is or should be that there is a difference when the question is whether or not the person is subject to the arbitration as opposed to the case where the question is whether the subject is--
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1756.283,1758.1,I think--
1994.94-560,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1758.1,1759.585,--is within the arbitration?
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1759.585,1764.453,--I think in both instances the appropriate standard of review is de novo.
1994.94-560,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1766.738,1772.975,Do you think in each case there has to be a clear and unmistakable reference to the arbitrator?
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1772.975,1775.161,"Yes, I do, and particularly--"
1994.94-560,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1775.161,1778.279,So you think there's no difference in the two instances?
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1778.279,1790.271,"--I think as a practical matter in applying the standard there may be a difference when you have a conceded agreement to arbitrate, and the parties said yes, there is an arbitration agreement between us, but we don't think this issue is within it."
1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1804.946,1810.25,"Well then, you are making a difference between a personal jurisdiction question and a subject matter jurisdiction question."
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1810.25,1814.619,"Well, I think a subject matter jurisdiction question is also a question of arbitrability."
1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1817.254,1821.808,"Yes, but I thought your answer to Justice Kennedy was that that might be subject to different treatment."
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1821.808,1830.748,"Well, I think as a practical matter, it is more likely that a court will determine that an issue is within the scope of an arbitration clause if the parties agree that there is one."
1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1830.748,1835.818,"You mean, the legal standard is the same, but in effect they're usually going to apply it differently to a subject matter question?"
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1835.818,1851.328,"I guess what I'm saying is that the likelihood of deferring to an arbitrator's decision when the issue is, is there an agreement to arbitrate, is far... it's far less likely that you would defer to an arbitrator's decision then."
1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1851.328,1853.261,"Yes, but isn't it because there's a different standard?"
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1853.261,1854.63,"No, I don't think the standard's different."
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1858.414,1893.005,"We tend to regard the subject matter cases as being cases in which... it's whether this closely related issue is within the arbitration, but... and that's why I think you're getting the response you do, but one can conceive of a subject matter case, for example, in which I've agreed to have my relations with my broker determined by stock exchange arbitration, and the stock exchange arbitrator wants to decide a tort action between me and somebody who's hit me with his car."
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1902.61,1905.128,And the question here is not even that question.
1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1912.382,1919.972,"Okay, but just to go back to your answer to Justice Kennedy, the reason you answered him as you did, then, is that you in effect were assuming most subject matter questions are close."
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1919.972,1920.705,Yes.
1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1920.705,1922.107,That's all you meant by that.

1994.94-560,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1948.241,1955.811,"--Well, so that there can be some questions of... what we'll call personal jurisdiction that are subject to a less deferential rule."
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1959.447,1964.667,"--Your Honor, I guess my point is that the distinction between who and what is not the important distinction."
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1975.809,1978.611,"Well, are you talking judicial psychology, or law?"

1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2030.126,2035.697,What happened at this prehearing conference where they assertedly withdrew their objection?
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2037.299,2046.071,"It's difficult to say, because as the court of appeals noted, the fact of the withdrawal and its scope are not even docketed or noted in the arbitration record."
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2054.844,2066.068,"So the issue is whether that means we withdrew it from consideration at the conference, or whether it means, we withdrew it from consideration at the conference, right?"

1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.4,2068.934,That's a nice question.
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2068.934,2069.469,--of the stipulation.
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2069.469,2070.503,"Who wrote that, I wonder?"
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2070.503,2074.222,"Well, it was a joint stipulation, so we preserved each argument."
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2088.648,2090.184,It could have come out the other way.

I mean, the law's so complicated, I hate to proliferate standards unnecessarily, so when you're dealing with that first question, the first one, namely, is there or is there not an agreement here to submit this issue, call it X, because it happens to be called, whether or not there's an arbitra... did they or did they not agree to submit this issue, the issue of whether or not there's arbitrability, did they agree to submit this one itself to arbitration?"

1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2541.676,2545.128,Why don't you fall back to this as just kind of a secondary position.
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2601.897,2616.057,"Well, I suppose it's a workable distinction, although I think it may have been just backed to where we were a while ago, in suggesting when you have a conceded agreement to arbitrate between parties, the questions are going to be closer than when the basic dispute is over whether there's an agreement at all."
1994.94-560,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2616.057,2635.102,"So simply by varying the standard, we'd get to the same point that we would get to on your analysis if we didn't vary the standard, because the one question is not going to be close, and the other question is going to be close, but Justice Kennedy said the subject... the personal jurisdiction questions can be close when you get into agency and so on."
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2635.102,2637.654,"Well, again there are questions, though, about the scope of a conceded agreement."
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2698.294,2716.006,"I gather in some circuits, or under some regimes of law, and perhaps State court, a party can simply not show up at the arbitration if that party claims he never agreed to arbitrate, and will not be defaulted, or prevented from later getting review."
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2716.006,2719.808,"Well, that depends on what the rules of the arbitration forum provide."
1994.94-560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2758.183,2764.586,"Practically, the Kaplans must show up, because MKI unquestionably has submitted to arbitration--"
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2764.586,2765.186,Yes.
1994.94-560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2765.186,2778.596,"--and not as individuals, but as... and on the closeness of the MKI, so that they were interchangeable?"
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2778.596,2781.615,That was argued by the petitioners.
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2814.336,2821.507,"Did the district court hear live testimony in connection with its decision on this respect, or did they just review the documents?"
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2821.507,2822.007,No.
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2864.102,2866.252,So that makes the second question the same as the first.
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2881.398,2882.181,"Oh, absolutely."
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2887.384,2891.003,"Then they clearly and unmistak... in all the situations you say, look, the Kaplans are drawn into this."
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2907.779,2913.25,"--It is not... particularly in AT&T, the Court said the usual way you do that is by stipulation."
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2913.25,2913.633,Yes.
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2937.484,2940.317,"Well, but the petitioner today refused to acknowledge--"
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2940.317,2940.836,Yes.
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2940.836,2942.536,--that simply saying they weren't giving up their right--
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2942.536,2942.952,Yes.
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2942.952,2944.054,--had the effect of preserving their right--
1994.94-560,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2944.054,2944.471,I may be wrong.
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2944.471,2945.954,--and I think that's true.
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3032.029,3044.854,"Well, you say 10(a)(4) does not apply to the arbitrators exceeding their jurisdiction in the context where the parties have submitted jurisdiction to the arbitrator?"
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3044.854,3051.173,If the parties have clearly and unmistakably agreed that the arbitrator is to decide arbitrability--
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3051.173,3051.54,Yes.
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3051.54,3053.692,--then his decision on arbitrability is not--
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3053.692,3054.342,Is not reviewed de--
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3054.342,3055.977,"--is not in excess of his powers, no."
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3055.977,3056.844,"--Well, wait."
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3065.683,3066.033,No.
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3068.802,3069.169,Okay.
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3069.169,3071.987,--because the parties have clearly and unmistakably agreed to commit it--
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3071.987,3072.404,So then--
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3072.404,3073.356,--to the arbitrators.
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3073.356,3077.991,--how can you argue that the Federal Arbitration Act requires de novo review of all jurisdictional matters?
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3077.991,3088.116,"Not all jurisdictional matters, just the allegations that the arbitrators exceeded their powers, and if there is an agreement to commit that to the arbitrators' decision, it's not in excess of its powers."
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.765,3090.216,I see.
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3090.216,3091.4,--contomplates a distinction between--
1994.94-560,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3091.4,3091.834,I see.
1994.94-560,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3091.834,3095.286,--a wrong decision and a decision in excess of their powers.
1994.94-560,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3140.731,3141.981,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3144.6,3145.719,Thank you.
1994.94-560,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3246.834,3254.171,"The issue is in fact that if they... to preserve that, they must get into a Federal court."
1994.94-560,0,30891,james_d_holzhauer,,3262.76,3263.177,--Right.
