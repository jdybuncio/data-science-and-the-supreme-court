1983.82-738,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.106,We will hear arguments first this morning in Migra against Warren City School District Board.
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,14.601,41.058,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this civil rights action brought under Sections 1983 and 85, the Sixth Circuit held that res judicata principles barred the petitioner from presenting her constitutional claims in the District Court because she failed to raise them in a prior state court proceeding."
1983.82-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,209.945,215.299,That would be a doctrine of state law that you are--
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,215.299,216.644,"Yes, Your Honor, the Supreme Court."
1983.82-738,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,447.863,462.092,"--Mr. Vintilla, I guess there is no question but that your client could have raised these claims in the state court proceeding, could have filed the 1983 and 1985 claims there?"
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,462.092,475.915,"Oh, no question about it, under concurrent jurisdiction, and Congress has granted to the states concurrent jurisdiction to entertain a civil rights, and the civil rights suitor, plaintiff obviously had a choice."
1983.82-738,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.99,492.376,"And you would agree that if under Ohio law your client would thereafter be precluded because she had not brought them, that that would be binding on the district court, the federal district court?"
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,493.455,518.474,"--Well, I take the position, we take the position that the Congressional intent in granting plaintiffs... a civil rights plaintiff the choice to go to federal court or the state court, we believe that that grant by Congress is unconditional."
1983.82-738,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,532.501,539.871,Despite the clear requirement that federal courts give full faith and credit to state court judgments?
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,539.871,582.839,"Well, I believe that if... although in our case here, we will argue that Ohio res judicata would not preclude, but I would say that... I would say that if there were a state law to that effect, which I would construe as making it mandatory, taking away this free choice of which court to go to, and making it mandatory, I would say that that law or that policy would clearly contravene this Congrsessional intent of allowing you, a civil rights plaintiff, to choose without explanation."
1983.82-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,582.839,585.823,How do you reconcile that with our decision in Allen against McCurry?
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,585.823,592.538,"Well, Allen versus McCurry dealt only with collateral estoppel."
1983.82-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,620.2,633.116,"Well, Allen against McCurry and, I think, Herring against Proceze last year, too, involved... the original state adjudication was a criminal one, wasn't it, where certainly the appearance of the defendant couldn't be called voluntary."
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,633.116,656.747,"Well, it is not voluntary, except in Herring, I think, I think there was a strong motivation for Herring... or to say in Herring, if you follow that, adopt that rule, there was a strong motivation to say in Herring, here, I am faced with a criminal conviction that is going to go on my record, and I have a constitutional defense."
1983.82-738,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,720.578,724.345,Did Justice Marshall at any time say you could go to both courts?
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,724.345,725.297,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1983.82-738,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,725.297,734.2,Did Justice Marshall say at any time that the statute gives you the right to go to both courts on the same point?
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,734.2,734.886,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-738,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,734.886,736.091,I didn't think so.
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,737.433,754.192,"Your Honor dealt with the collateral estoppel statute of Virginia, but as a further argument, I would... I would... I would, as an answer, like to adopt the statement of Justice Harlan in Monroe versus Pape, where he said,"
1983.82-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,812.482,822.788,"Well, now, to the extent that you're... I think you said at the beginning of your argument you were making two points: one, that the Ohio law of res judicata would not bar relitigation of your client's claim--"
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,822.788,823.178,Yes.
1983.82-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,823.178,827.974,"--and two, that even if it did, the federal statute would prevent it from having that effect."
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,843.046,844.454,Of course.
1983.82-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,916.564,928.06,"Well, did the district court... did the district court decide that further litigation in the Ohio courts would have been barred?"
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,928.06,934.15,"--Well, the district court took a very simplistic... and the court of appeals--"
1983.82-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,934.15,948.566,"Well, suppose instead of filing this 1983 suit in the federal court, the plaintiff had gone back to the state court and filed a 1983 suit, a separate 1983 suit."
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,955.968,957.563,--The district court didn't go that far.
1983.82-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.327,961.623,"It didn't even address what Ohio law would do, did it?"
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,961.623,962.044,--No.
1983.82-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,968.685,970.104,And the court of appeals just affirmed by order?
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,970.104,971.511,One order... one-page order.
1983.82-738,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,972.837,996.874,"Mr. Vintilla, how do you explain the comment in Justice... or, rather, Judge Manos's opinion at C-29 of the petition that the plaintiff could have brought her First Amendment claim in state court, and she is therefore barred from asserting it here, citing Coogan against Cincinnati, which was a Fourth... rather, a Sixth Circuit case that came out of Ohio?"
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,996.874,1022.832,"Well, as I read Judge Manos's opinion, Judge Manos... and he cited another Sixth Circuit opinion... he just was... took the position that since state courts can entertain constitutional, full constitutional issues, that there is no reason why he should litigate them there, and since they can, you are barred."
1983.82-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1105.002,1121.12,"Let's assume the district court had addressed state law expressly, and said that any subsequent litigation about a claim you could have raised but you didn't, any subsequent litigation in the state court would have been barred by state law."
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,1150.42,1153.357,I wouldn't carry that that far.
1983.82-738,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1162.4,1178.037,"No, the federal court just says, we couldn't care less what the state courts would do, we are going to... we are going to give full faith and... we are going to apply res judicata independently to this case."
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,1178.037,1193.888,"--Well, unless... I take the... the statements this Court has made about Congressional intent to assign to a federal court a paramount rule in protecting, or that the federal court is a primary protector."
1983.82-738,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1260.078,1262.624,Will you point to the record for what you are now talking about?
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,1262.624,1263.482,--Please?
1983.82-738,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1263.482,1268.544,Would you point to the record for what you are now talking about?
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,1268.544,1275.072,"Well, I am construing his... I am construing the state court's--"
1983.82-738,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1275.072,1280.071,Is there anything in the record about the judge wouldn't be elected or something?
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,1280.071,1284.287,--I construed that from the fact that he could have.
1983.82-738,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1284.287,1286.693,"Well, where is that in the record?"
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,1286.693,1294.519,From the fact that he separated and reserved and didn't indicate any reason why he didn't try both cases.
1983.82-738,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1294.519,1295.814,That is your conclusion.
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,1295.814,1297.891,"That is my conclusion, and also--"
1983.82-738,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1297.891,1301.358,"Well, are you sure we are interested in your conclusions?"
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,1301.358,1302.466,"--Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1983.82-738,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1302.466,1303.562,Or are we interested in the record?
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,1303.562,1305.621,It is not in the record except--
1983.82-738,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1305.621,1307.465,"I, for one, am interested in the record."
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,1307.465,1308.292,--Please?
1983.82-738,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1308.292,1314.149,"I, for one, am interested in the record, what the record shows."
1983.82-738,0,33354,john_r_vintilla,,1314.149,1325.442,"The record shows that the state court judge reserved and continued the second count, which reasonable minds would say he should have heard all at once."
1983.82-738,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1588.288,1593.755,Very well.
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,1596.987,1634.501,"Mr. Chief Justice, and Justices of the United States Supreme Court, the issue before this Court is whether or not a state court petitioner who claims that she has had her contract rights violated and files a law suit in state court to get her job back, and also alleges conspiracy among the board members to deprive her of her job, that once having tried that lawsuit, can then embark upon a second lawsuit in federal court alleging essentially the same facts, the came causes of action, but tacking onto it a First Amendment or 1983 claim."
1983.82-738,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1725.059,1726.604,Is this all in the record?
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,1726.604,1727.7,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1751.814,1754.609,She was reinstated and got back pay?
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,1754.609,1766.043,"She was reinstated, and with back pay, and from that, Your Honor, we appealed to the appellate court and to the Supreme Court of Ohio, and the procedural difficulty that the board encountered was basically held to be too bad."
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1772.213,1772.743,"Well, just for that year."
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,1773.196,1773.929,Just for that one year.
1983.82-738,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1827.109,1833.828,"Mr. Messenger, now, her conspiracy claim was ultimately dismissed without prejudice."
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,1833.828,1834.468,That's correct.
1983.82-738,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1834.468,1836.421,What was the effect of that?
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,1841.277,1842.809,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1889.416,1893.866,You mean those claims arising out of the same operative set of facts?
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,1893.866,1900.786,"Yes, Your Honor, same transaction, the same causative effect, in this instance, the non-renewal of a contract of employment."
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1929.086,1936.506,Are you making an argument about what federal res judicata principles should consist of?
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,1942.063,1952.139,"I believe, Your Honor, that you have to look at Ohio law, the federal courts must look at Ohio law to determine whether if the case were in the state court--"
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.139,1954.748,What if the Ohio law wouldn't bar it at all?
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,1958.917,1961.697,"--I am sorry, Your Honor?"
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1962.933,1976.551,"Well, assume Ohio law, under Ohio law this plaintiff would not be barred from relitigating in... and from filing a 1983 suit in the state court after this first judgment."
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,1976.551,1976.972,Yes.
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.972,1979.035,Assume that it was not barred by Ohio law.
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,1983.515,1986.311,I think they should follow the Ohio law and allow the suit in.
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1986.311,1988.155,"You mean, either way, whether it is barred or not."
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,1988.155,1990.14,I think they have to look at the state law.
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1994.184,2002.307,"Well, where did... tell me, where did the district court consider Ohio law and the effect of 1738?"
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2007.337,2017.925,"--The... On Page 23 of the petition, where the lower court begins the discussion on res judicata and why it acts as a bar."
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2023.515,2023.952,Yes.
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2023.952,2038.385,"--And it basically comes to the conclusion that... and cites Allen versus McCurry also of this court that 1983 actions are subject to the defense of res judicata, and that under the Coogan versus Cincinnati Bar Association, that if--"
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2038.385,2041.571,"Yes, but where is it... does it ever cite 1738?"
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2049.943,2053.815,--I believe that's what the whole opinion is about.
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.815,2056.674,"Well, it never says so."
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2056.674,2058.565,You mean specifically using--
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2058.565,2068.388,"I figure you can just as well interpret it as an independent res judicata policy announced by the federal court, and what's wrong with that?"
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2068.388,2070.481,--They have federal--
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.481,2078.979,1738 doesn't on its face prevent the federal court from applying a stricter rule of res judicata than the state courts would.
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2078.979,2081.9,"--Well, I would think, Your Honor, that the federal courts would--"
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2081.9,2084.431,"And I would, I suppose, I would think you would take that position."
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2084.431,2093.131,"--I would think, Your Honor, that the federal courts would look at the substantive law of the state courts in determining whether or not the res judicata applies."
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.131,2093.661,"Well, this one didn't."
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2115.291,2115.9,Of res judicata?
1983.82-738,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2117.26,2124.037,Isn't that inherent in the authority of the federal court with respect to its own jurisdiction?
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2124.037,2152.714,"--I think I would have to argue that that is so, that it is, but it seems that the cases appear to state that the federal court will look to what the state law does on a particular matter such as res judicata and then use that to fashion its remedy, but I would certainly think, like in the field of labor law, that the federal courts could fashion their own body of law and their own system of whether or not res judicata in fact would apply, but I believe this would only amplify our position, that if the state court would have--"
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.714,2154.917,But it couldn't give any less effect than the state law.
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2154.917,2155.401,--Right.
1983.82-738,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2157.666,2161.586,But is that what the Court did in Allen against McCurry?
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2161.586,2181.264,"My understanding of Allen and McCurry, Your Honor, was that this Court stated that res judicata principles apply in 1983 actions, that prior to that time the argument was that only issue preclusion or collateral estoppel applied, but the claim preclusion or res judicata might not apply."
1983.82-738,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2181.264,2185.715,But did it apply a federal rule of res judicata or a Virginia rule?
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2185.715,2188.308,"I can't answer that, Your Honor."
1983.82-738,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2239.163,2239.865,Isn't that oversimplifying it?
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2268.024,2268.71,"--No, we haven't."
1983.82-738,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2270.788,2281.941,"You think the statute applies, and you win on Ohio law, but Justice White, it seems to me, is correct in saying the lower court didn't really decide the Ohio law question, though, or do you take issue with that?"
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2281.941,2292.641,"--I believe that the lower court, and again, Your Honor, I don't mean to postulate for the Court, but I believe that the district court looked at what the law of Ohio was, the substantive law of Ohio--"
1983.82-738,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2292.641,2294.404,But they don't cite a single Ohio case.
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2294.404,2295.091,--I realize that.
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.788,2319.879,"Well, if we had... I would think that if state law is critical to this case, and the district court didn't decide it, nor did the court of appeals, that we would have to remand."
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2344.445,2358.488,"Well, that is certainly an argument, Your Honor, but to expand on that, and as Chief Justice Burger said, why couldn't the federal law... federal courts have their own doctrine of res judicata that may be even more strict than the state?"
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2358.488,2359.752,"I am suggesting that is what the district court thought, and did."
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2359.752,2368.28,"But certainly if it were barred under applying state law, they would even be more barred than under federal law, so that--"
1983.82-738,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2368.28,2371.513,"You would have to... Under 1738, you would have to hold it barred then."
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2371.513,2372.328,--Right.
1983.82-738,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2372.328,2384.339,"Your friend's central thesis of his argument, as I got it, was that he was appealing to federal law, not state law, when he got into the federal courts."
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2390.602,2394.739,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, for a number of reasons."
1983.82-738,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2399.864,2401.346,"Yes, but you have been in the local courts."
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2412.888,2418.947,"--I don't believe that's entirely so, Your Honor."
1983.82-738,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2441.987,2442.735,Of course they could.
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2442.735,2460.462,"And that judge there could have decided that case, that issue, but for some reason they neglected to do that, and then have filed another claim in federal court alleging essentially the same thing, emanating from the same facts, the non-renewal of a contract, but this time alleging 1983 rights."
1983.82-738,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2508.851,2511.631,"That is what the district judge said, isn't it?"
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2511.631,2513.799,"I think essentially that's what he said, Your Honor."
1983.82-738,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2533.901,2536.385,That is ordinarily a question of the statute of limitations.
1983.82-738,1,32012,james_l_messenger,,2542.743,2543.507,"--That is true, Your Honor."
1983.82-738,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2598.75,2599.951,Very well.
1983.82-738,2,33354,john_r_vintilla,,2601.702,2619.709,"May it please the Court, first, I think we must straighten the record out, and I... with all due respect to counsel, there is nothing in the record as far as a determination by the trial court that the basis for which the board did not renew because they did away with the job or any other reason, that was a very easy way out for them."
1983.82-738,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2624.58,2625.739,That is not before us any more.
1983.82-738,2,33354,john_r_vintilla,,2627.626,2628.347,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-738,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2629.424,2630.485,This is a simple contract matter.
1983.82-738,2,33354,john_r_vintilla,,2630.485,2634.014,"--Yes, and we are not seeking to relitigate the contract."
1983.82-738,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2649.869,2652.181,"They arise... They all arise out of the same set of facts, do they not?"
1983.82-738,2,33354,john_r_vintilla,,2652.181,2654.069,"--Yes, they were... it is analogous."
1983.82-738,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2679.326,2680.964,"Thank you, gentlemen."
