1993.92-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.845,We'll hear argument next in No. 92-7247.
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,58.2,61.302,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-7247,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,90.954,104.492,"Would you... would you preface your remarks by telling us where the petitioner is now located and under what circumstances, and also telling us precisely what relief it is that you are presently seeking?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,104.492,105.464,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-7247,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,117.892,123.026,And what relief is it precisely that is being sought here?
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,123.026,124.668,She is seeking two things.
1993.92-7247,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.58,130.124,From the individual respondents?
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,130.124,130.713,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-7247,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,131.242,134.885,None of whom were involved in her placement at Terre Haute?
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,134.885,141.169,"--Your Honor, we would argue that they... that their actions did cause that placement, and I will... I will get to that."
1993.92-7247,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.169,141.55,All right.
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,141.55,148.826,She is also seeking an injunction to prevent her return to a penitentiary.
1993.92-7247,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,151.069,156.515,An injunction to prevent her from being moved to a different facility?
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,156.515,160.425,"Not to a different facility, to... to another penitentiary such as Terre Haute."
1993.92-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,160.425,161.136,Does the Government--
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,164.028,164.439,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,164.439,170.152,"Well, where... where would the Government be free to move her if she gets her injunction?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,170.152,186.445,"She... where she is is not inconsistent with... with the injunctive relief she seeks, because it's... this would, again, become relevant on remand should the Government seek to... again, to transfer her to a penitentiary."
1993.92-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,186.445,191.831,"Well, she was sentenced to a term that would ordinarily end her up in a penitentiary, was she not?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,191.831,205.568,"Your Honor, after sentencing she was... she was eligible for confinement either in a penitentiary or in a Federal correctional institution, within that... the whole range of Bureau of Prisons facilities."
1993.92-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.568,213.533,And so her... would... her injunction would request that she be confined only in an FCI and not in a penitentiary?
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,213.533,213.973,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,213.973,216.615,What's the difference between those two?
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,216.615,228.624,There are... they have a different security level system in general in that penitentiaries are the... the... traditionally the higher security facilities.
1993.92-7247,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,238.771,254.652,"To the extent that we're dealing with the injunction, the prisoner doesn't suffer from the Government's view of the standard, I suppose, because the hearing is going to be sufficient to prove knowledge even at the Government's higher... slightly higher requirement."
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,263.618,265.379,I'm not certain that's true.
1993.92-7247,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,284.232,290.346,Is the incidence of rape higher at maximum... you mentioned Marion.
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,298.834,302.304,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe that there can be any generalization."
1993.92-7247,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,313.974,328.623,"In terms of the injunctive relief that you're seeking, though, I don't comprehend why Farmer is more at risk in a maximum security facility than at a medium security facility."
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,328.623,339.96,The allegation in this case is that the primary risk came from the fact that violent individuals were allowed to have access to her in the general population at Terre Haute.
1993.92-7247,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,355.211,367.478,"And yet she did... did want to be in the general population, because when she was at Lewisburg didn't she object to being in administrative detention?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,367.478,369.719,I would submit that she wanted a safe placement.
1993.92-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,391.535,402.651,"Well, isn't it a part of your case, just to follow this line of questioning, that the maximum security prisons are the most dangerous because they have the most dangerous people, or is that not your case?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,402.651,403.552,Is it not the argument.
1993.92-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,436.715,445.129,"So then the Government doesn't make an error if it selects a... a maximum security prison, necessarily."
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,445.129,446.571,Not necessarily.
1993.92-7247,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,448.251,454.206,"And it doesn't make an error if it puts the person in the general population, necessarily."
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,454.206,455.327,--Whether... not necessarily.
1993.92-7247,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,507.511,517.389,"How about a young man with a slight build, youthful 18, 19-year-old, slender male."
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,517.389,528.965,--There... one could easily imagine a number of facilities in which a person as described by Your Honor would be at obvious and unreasonable risk in general population.
1993.92-7247,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,544.106,557.656,"But at least as far as the transferring officials are concerned, they didn't know, did they, what the placement would be inside Terre Haute, whether it was going to be to administrative segregation or general population?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,557.656,559.088,"--Well, they knew this much."
1993.92-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,603.928,606.969,"But we didn't... we didn't take the case, though, on that point."
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,617.728,622.09,"It wasn't an issue of time, but perhaps it illustrates the Seventh Circuit's standard."
1993.92-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,640.373,647.677,"Well, do you... do you agree that you... that you have to show that the prison officials were deliberately indifferent?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,647.677,648.499,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-7247,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,655.852,658.464,"Would you help me a little bit, Ms. Alexander?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,667.303,674.649,"--Well, I think the change is from the Seventh Circuit standard and how much of the Seventh Circuit standard the Government would prefer to defend in this Court."
1993.92-7247,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,697.954,716.497,"In other words, the Government has... on the Government's theory, the official has got to draw the conclusion which you say should be inferred by any reasonable person from the obviousness of the risk, whereas under your standard you don't have to prove that the conclusion was actually drawn, you simply have to prove knowledge of the facts that made it obvious."
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,716.497,717.128,--That's right.
1993.92-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,769.542,772.605,"Well, doesn't your standard come pretty close to being just negligence?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,772.605,773.924,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,779.367,783.31,"Yes, but you really water it down, it seems to me, in your application."
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,797.57,801.343,"Your Honor, it's not simply obvious risk."
1993.92-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,819.728,825.665,"But we're... we're talking about a very narrow aspect of liability, or state of mind basically."
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,846.779,859.918,"Well, when you have a prison official who the essence of that job is to maintain security and order, and that... that includes... the essence of the job includes paying attention to risk factors."
1993.92-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,874.408,874.829,Not necessarily.
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,876.509,877.771,I don't think that's grossly--
1993.92-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,877.771,885.996,"It seems to me that we do... we have used the phrase ""deliberate indifference"" rather consistently, and it seems to me what you're describing is not deliberate indifference."
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,892.089,892.88,--I agree--
1993.92-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.88,896.393,Isn't there a subjective element to deliberate indifference?
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,896.393,896.784,--Yes.
1993.92-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,961.969,964.493,"Canton was not an Eighth Amendment case, though, was it?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,964.493,965.134,That is correct.
1993.92-7247,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1044.729,1045.921,Can I come back to this case?
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1052.926,1054.978,"--The warden at Terre Haute, Your Honor."
1993.92-7247,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1073.098,1090.651,"Now, in the prior litigation when this prisoner wanted to be taken out of solitary and put in the general population, the Bureau of Prisons took the position that the prisoner was too high risk to do that?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1090.651,1091.532,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-7247,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1106.114,1115.58,"And does that position and knowledge, is that attributable now to the warden at Terre Haute, in your view?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1115.58,1121.464,I would say that that means that there was actual knowledge on the part of this respondents.
1993.92-7247,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1135.358,1137.138,Why wasn't it available?
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1137.138,1144.694,"--Because the petitioner approached, who was proceeding without counsel, didn't put that information in."
1993.92-7247,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1144.694,1145.713,I see.
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1145.713,1149.157,"Why the respondent didn't point that out to the court is, of course, another issue."
1993.92-7247,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1149.577,1152.709,"Ms. Alexander, just a trivial question."
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1155.52,1156.441,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-7247,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1156.441,1156.902,Why?
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1156.902,1164.436,"Because several of the respondents are from Oxford, the transferring institution, which is in the Western District of Wisconsin."
1993.92-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1168.87,1180.758,"Ms. Alexander, we took the case for this subjective/objective issue and not for whether, assuming that the subjective approach is correct, the granting of the motion for summary judgment was proper."
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1216.545,1220.507,--I would agree that on a variety of levels the trial court committed error.
1993.92-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.507,1220.858,Fine.
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1220.858,1222.67,But that error was invited by the Seventh Circuit standard--
1993.92-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1222.67,1229.483,"But, I mean, we may not be arguing about a whole lot here, that it really may not make a whole lot of difference whether you say it's a subjective standard or an objective standard."
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1236.479,1247.554,"--I would agree that it is very possible that in this case this standard wouldn't make a difference, because any fact finder would infer from the circumstantial evidence evidence of actual knowledge."
1993.92-7247,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.187,1265.559,"Call it a subjective standard once removed, how about that, all right?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1266.03,1266.831,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-7247,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1268.722,1280.289,"Well, Ms. Alexander, if knowledge of the defendants is an element, do you accept the model penal code definition of knowledge?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1289.996,1297.743,"--Your Honor, again, under our standard the actual knowledge simply isn't what the... the trier of facts should focus on."
1993.92-7247,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1300.043,1312.152,"Well, I know that's your argument, but there certainly is a risk here that that isn't what the court's going to adopt, and so I wanted to explore with you whether you accept the model penal code definition?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1312.152,1329.382,"Your Honor, with... without having given it a great deal of thought, for which I apologize, as I hear it it seems to me that that... were the Court to adopt what I think would be the wrong standard, that indeed may well be what it would adopt."
1993.92-7247,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1408.281,1425.471,"Suppose... suppose this... Farmer had said at Terre Haute, as Farmer did at Lewisburg, I want to be in the general population, and then this horrible event occurred, would she still have a 1983 case?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1425.471,1427.422,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-7247,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1488.905,1493.768,"But this was... this was... it's a Bivens case, isn't it?"
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1493.768,1494.287,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-7247,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1494.287,1497.7,And this was about the sixth or seventh institution.
1993.92-7247,0,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1497.7,1499.001,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-7247,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1504.634,1505.995,"Very well, Ms. Alexander."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1508.118,1514.195,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1547.176,1549.158,"You'll have to help me, Mr.... Mr. Bender."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1554.22,1559.986,"--I don't think that does at all, but the Court had asked that and there's no way that Ms. Alexander would know that."
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1700.569,1719.852,"Mr. Bender, do you... do you think that this... this issue that we've been focusing on today, whether it's a subjective test or a subjective test once removed, pertains only to monetary relief, and that... and that as far as injunctive relief is concerned, the... as far as that goes, the prison is certainly put on notice when a complaint is filed, right?"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1719.852,1720.733,"Yes, that's what I was going to say."
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1725.418,1725.628,Yeah.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1725.628,1732.593,"But it doesn't really come up, because if you're suing for injunctive relief you will put the... you will put the prison officials on notice by the allegations in your complaint."
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.593,1739.018,"Yeah, but you... you could say that the complaint should be judged on the basis of the state of facts at the time it was filed, and you could always come in and say at the time it was filed we had no knowledge."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1739.018,1739.849,"Well, even if you said that--"
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1739.849,1740.951,"They'd file an amended complaint, right?"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1740.951,1743.881,--You could... you can put them on notice by sending them a letter saying that the following--
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1743.881,1744.272,Before you file.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1744.272,1745.253,--Before you file.
1993.92-7247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1778.727,1781.248,"I thought one of them was the warden of Terre Haute, no?"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1781.248,1789.604,"One of them was the warden of Terre Haute at one time, but at the time the action was brought he was not... he was no longer the warden at Terre Haute."
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1812.843,1822.96,"Do... are any of the officials who are... who are named in the complaint and against who injunctive relief is sought, do any of them currently have the power to provide the injunctive relief?"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1822.96,1824.661,I think the Director--
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.661,1825.613,"He's in a different institution now, right?"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1825.613,1827.366,--I think the Director of the Bureau of Prisons does.
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.366,1827.807,The director.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1827.807,1831.31,I think that would be the only person among those people who would currently have the power--
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1831.31,1839.357,And you say... and your one argument against injunctive relief at this point is that there's no threat of what... what is sought to be enjoined?
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1839.357,1840.897,"--That's the main argument, yes."
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1840.897,1841.427,"Well, what's--"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1841.427,1842.198,There is another argument.
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1842.198,1842.478,--What's the other one?
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1842.478,1866.675,"Which is that there is not... there is no showing on this record that there... even in a penitentiary, that there would be the very serious threat of injury which would justify an injunction against the transfer to any penitentiary, but I don't think the Court, or the lower court if you remand the case on that, would have to reach that issue, because there is no plan whatever and no consideration of putting him in one of the very few penitentiary institutions."
1993.92-7247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1901.563,1902.945,The alleged horrible event.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,1902.945,1903.855,--The alleged horrible event.
1993.92-7247,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2000.065,2007.181,"Now, Mr. Bender, on that point do you accept the model penal code definition of knowledge?"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2007.181,2010.223,The one you had mentioned to Ms. Alexander?
1993.92-7247,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2010.223,2010.413,Yes.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2010.413,2011.114,Would you read it again?
1993.92-7247,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2011.114,2017.028,"Yes, if I can put my hands on it, because I thought it was of some interest."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2033.389,2035.75,"Yes, we accept that."
1993.92-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2038.702,2041.036,"But do you think that's what the Seventh Circuit's view of the word ""knowledge"" is?"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2041.036,2041.784,I'm not sure.
1993.92-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2041.784,2045.387,"It is rather clear it's not when they say ""actual knowledge"", isn't it?"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2045.387,2064.641,"Well, I think what the model penal code definition is referring to is what's often called the ostrich situation, the head-in-the-sand situation, that if there's a... if there is a high probability and you stop yourself from making a conclusion, you turn away from it, that that can also be dealt with as actual knowledge."
1993.92-7247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2067.867,2073.001,"Well, then I'm not sure you do then agree with the... with the model penal code."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2097.014,2097.556,--Well--
1993.92-7247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2097.556,2098.317,Actual--
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2098.317,2102.548,"--Well, that's what... that's where I think we can get confused between the first issue and the second."
1993.92-7247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2129.288,2135.44,--But is it your position that the finder of fact must infer that they actually knew of the risk?
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2135.44,2138.272,"Yes, that they knew of the danger, right."
1993.92-7247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2138.272,2140.963,That you could infer it from knowledge of other... other facts.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2140.963,2141.153,Right.
1993.92-7247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2156.003,2159.435,Then I suggest you don't really agree with the model penal code.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2159.435,2174.526,"--I was reading that... that part of the high probability to refer to a situation where if you know of a high... if you know... I think the problem is that risks are probabilities and we're talking here about risks, and therefore if you know of the high probability of a risk, you know enough about the risk."
1993.92-7247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2174.526,2179.04,"But you can analyze, I think, the thing best in terms of what instruction do you give the jury."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2186.134,2186.354,Right.
1993.92-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2187.255,2201.684,"But suppose there is a risk that's known, that inmates of a certain kind are assaulted at Terre Haute, and the prison official knows there's a high probability that this person is in Terre Haute, what result?"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2201.684,2203.967,--They don't know he is in Terre Haute?
1993.92-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2203.967,2204.158,No.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2204.158,2206.739,They just know there's a probability that he is in Terre Haute.
1993.92-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2211.573,2212.714,"No liability, in your view."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2212.714,2217.198,"If... if liability would turn on their knowledge that he's in Terre Haute, yes."
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.198,2219.099,Then you really don't agree with the... with the--
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2219.099,2221.24,"On that part of it, I--"
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.24,2222.432,--Because that's not a probability.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2242.696,2246.179,--I think if... it's sort of a risk on a risk.
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2260.361,2261.032,He's aware of the risk.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2261.032,2261.843,He's aware of the risk.
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2261.843,2265.506,"If there is a probability that he's in that population, he's aware of the risk."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2265.506,2266.287,I think that's right.
1993.92-7247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2273.092,2276.514,"In other words, the probability is a... is, in effect, an inference."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2296.667,2297.008,Yes.
1993.92-7247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2297.008,2297.448,Yeah.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2297.448,2298.87,"Yes, I think so."
1993.92-7247,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2304.116,2306.609,"If you're a bad logician, you may have a defense."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2306.609,2310.313,--You may have a defense to a... to an Eighth Amendment claim.
1993.92-7247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2335.425,2343.16,"You do... you do suggest twice in your brief that a remand might be appropriate, remand might be appropriate."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2361.455,2367.89,"--First of all, one problem is the Seventh Circuit never wrote an opinion in this case, so we're talking about other Seventh Circuit opinions."
1993.92-7247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2367.89,2368.06,Yes.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2368.06,2377.888,"I think you should tell the Seventh Circuit that they got it right, that there has... it's actual knowledge of the risk rather than somebody... a reasonable person should have known of the risk, that they got right."
1993.92-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2402.897,2403.298,"Mr. Bender, can--"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2413.304,2420.409,"It's... I think it's fine to do that and I think you should do that, but it's the aura of criminality that I don't... that I don't think is acceptable."
1993.92-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2420.409,2426.072,"Well, except that the state of mind I have described is not usually a test in the civil law at all."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2426.072,2430.275,And I think you should make clear what the state of mind is that you're talking about.
1993.92-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2431.176,2432.718,"So it's not civil, but it's not criminal either."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2432.718,2433.398,--It's civil.
1993.92-7247,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2451.161,2451.942,"Well, I'm not sure anyone has suggested that."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2451.942,2461.699,"I should say, in that connection, that the Government's position in this case is a position that is... is forged from a variety of interests that we have."
1993.92-7247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2494.373,2496.246,What is the second part of your charge?
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2498.49,2499.282,--Of the risk.
1993.92-7247,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2499.282,2501.442,"But once you have actual knowledge of the risk, then what?"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2501.442,2517.954,"Then you have to be deliberately indifferent to the risk, which means that there has to be something that you could do readily to avoid the risk, and you have to have made a decision not to do that even though it was something that could easily have been done."
1993.92-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2547.508,2552.684,"Mr. Bender, we've talked in... trying to phrase in general terms without being concrete about the particular allegations."
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2570.114,2573.637,"That is a knowledge of a risk, but another--"
1993.92-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2573.637,2576.148,Does that take care of the first... the first half of your two--
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2576.148,2581.982,"--No, because the risk has to be a very serious risk, a very severe risk of very serious harm."
1993.92-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2590.189,2592.663,--You don't think that's a special risk that's described there?
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2592.663,2597.054,Just the fact that somebody is effeminate or young.
1993.92-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2597.054,2603.439,And is specifically identified as being particularly subject to a great deal of sexual pressure?
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2603.439,2608.681,I guess it depends on what you mean by a great deal of sexual pressure.
1993.92-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.681,2612.094,"Well, in which way do you construe those allegations, favorable to the plaintiff or the defendant?"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2612.094,2612.685,Right.
1993.92-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2669.492,2674.788,"Well isn't it fairly generally known that the danger is not really small, just throughout the prison system?"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2678.321,2681.764,"--No, I don't think that's... I don't think that's true, at least with the Federal prison system."
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2727.925,2729.558,What do you mean by 1 percent?
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2733.741,2735.283,Were assaulted.
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.283,2736.142,Were assaulted.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2736.142,2736.412,Yeah.
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2736.412,2736.993,1 percent--
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2736.993,2737.434,Any kind.
1993.92-7247,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2737.434,2738.455,--In that year.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2738.455,2741.647,An assault of any kind within the Federal system during--
1993.92-7247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2741.647,2743.308,It's not just sexual assaults.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2743.308,2744.069,"--No, no, not at all."
1993.92-7247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2744.069,2744.53,Any kind of assault.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2744.53,2745.852,Assaults of any kind.
1993.92-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2752.027,2754.147,Let me... that's a... that's really quite a surprising statistic.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2757.421,2758.833,--I think the ones that have been reported.
1993.92-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.833,2759.534,"Yeah, because--"
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2759.534,2759.944,And I think--
1993.92-7247,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2759.944,2762.766,--Presumably there are occasionally these incidents that don't surface.
1993.92-7247,1,37685,paul_bender,,2762.766,2763.046,--Right.
1993.92-7247,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2908.384,2909.834,"Thank you, Mr. Bender."
1993.92-7247,2,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,2913.126,2914.379,"Thank you, Your Honor."
