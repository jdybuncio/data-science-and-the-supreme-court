2009.08-6925,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.237,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-6925, Johnson v. United States."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,7.07,9.706,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-6925,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,59.103,63.256,And that's -- you say that's Federal law.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,76.831,79.016,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,86.872,87.756,"No, no, no."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,122.879,125.247,"--Then -- no, Your Honor, I'm sorry."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,165.338,177.346,"But what -- what -- before we can even get into this, I think we have to decide if those words ""striking or touching"" describe one crime or two."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,233.349,234.968,"--Your Honor, two reasons."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,239.103,240.705,"It does, too, in Chambers."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,255.382,256.048,--Yes.
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,256.048,259.184,"Here, why do you think they are two separate things?"
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,259.184,277.811,"Your Honor, because Hearns, the Florida State Supreme Court decision, described them as three separate offenses and spelled out that this statute could be violated and it said by: First, touching someone intentionally and against their will; second, by striking; or third, by causing bodily harm."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,277.811,278.328,Okay.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,312.634,320.907,"Your Honor, you would apply first the plain language of the statute, and ""to touch"" means the slightest contact, as the courts have held."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,337.786,340.738,"This -- this statute is a misdemeanor statute, isn't it?"
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,340.738,342.704,"For a first offense, yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.704,343.304,Yeah.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,349.759,350.809,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.809,356.68,So it's understandable that the slightest touch could -- could constitute a misdemeanor.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,356.68,371.59,"Your Honor, the problem with saying that just because it's a felony, therefore it can't be considered is that the statute first describes the prohibited conduct and says that the conduct is in the first subparagraph, the penalty is in the second."
2009.08-6925,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,380.046,385.767,"Well, ACCA uses the words ""physical force"", and any touching involves some physical force."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,395.888,407.344,"Your Honor, it is a qualitative line that sentencing judges would have to make, like all of the other difficult decisions that they're called on to make in the sentencing guidelines in these 3553 factors."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,418.985,431.812,"Well, there -- most -- this statute actually, we looked into it and it seems to be used, particularly the touching part, also to cover unwelcome physical, sexual advances."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,460.831,474.555,"Your Honor, the government has cited a footnote of 6,000 convictions, and there is no way to know of those convictions whether they were charged as to touch, to strike, or to cause bodily harm."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.555,477.356,"But we don't have to know what's more normal anyway, do we?"
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,477.356,478.023,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.023,491.016,"If -- if any conviction is possible under the element of the crime to touch, when there is simply slight physical force, your argument still stands, right?"
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,491.016,491.7,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,491.7,494.218,I would say that's certainly wrong under our cases.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,513.264,518.767,"Yes, Your Honor, as to looking to both the enumerated offenses and those that fall in the otherwise."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,537.581,565.814,"I know, but an element -- you mean we should interpret ""element"" in the first part of this in a radically different way than we have interrupted equivalent words in the second part, and we should say that burglary -- in other words, assault or -- or -- in other words, unless in every case of prosecution there is going to be force actually applied or something like that, that it doesn't fall within one?"
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,573.368,582.107,"--Your Honor, the reason why is that Congress was directing in the first prong those crimes that were directed against persons and would be defined by their elements."
2009.08-6925,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,600.837,620.049,"If there were a State statute that made it a battery to engage in offensive and unwelcome sexual touching, your argument would be that that would not fall within the first prong of ACCA, because there is not a -- it's not likely to cause a physical injury?"
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,620.049,620.932,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,620.932,621.501,Is that right?
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,621.501,622.134,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,623.234,631.022,If there was a statute that said -- in the old days I'm told people used to throw the contents of chamber pots out the window.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,643.08,647.299,"--Yes, Your Honor, I would say that that does not qualify under the first prong."
2009.08-6925,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,647.299,649.318,Even -- those are classic batteries--
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,649.318,650.551,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,650.551,657.757,--and the language of the first prong of ACCA really tracks the language of the common law crime of battery?
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,657.757,664.494,"Your Honor, it does because it talks about in Florida the element is the slightest contact."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,675.635,676.968,So -- so what about an assault?
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,685.407,686.49,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,686.49,687.023,Okay.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,688.525,692.911,"Your Honor, again, it depends on each particular statute and its elements."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,692.911,693.411,"No, no."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,706.153,706.72,"Well, Your Honor--"
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.72,708.053,"Well, of course it's right."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,710.438,711.588,--Correct.
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.588,712.907,You can just threaten somebody.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,712.907,713.64,Yes.
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,713.64,714.824,That's not a crime of violence.
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,716.742,719.728,Assault is not a crime of violence; it's not a use of force.
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,719.728,720.544,Certainly not.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,720.544,721.996,"Two responses to that, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,741.744,743.26,What about attempted murder?
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,743.26,748.563,"--Your Honor, yes, if it has as an element the use of force."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,749.03,749.913,But it didn't--
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,749.913,763.407,"--Yes, but under the ACCA, which is one of the phrases that the government elides out of its analysis, it's not simply the actual use of force, but an attempted or threatened use of force."
2009.08-6925,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,763.407,764.507,Can I ask you something?
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,807.452,812.154,"Your Honor, some of these questions will be difficult lines for the court -- a sentencing court to draw."
2009.08-6925,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,822.61,824.712,"Well, but violence has a broader meaning."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,843.089,858.766,"--Your Honor, the Court wouldn't have to, and part of where we drew this from is the Court's language in Begay that indicated that crimes within clause (1) of ACCA are those crimes which are also likely to present a serious risk of potential injury to others."
2009.08-6925,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,858.766,863.587,"Many will, but don't -- serious use of force doesn't necessarily always."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,863.587,873.025,"Yes, Your Honor, and that's why the qualitative line falls somewhere higher than mere contact, which would simply be the standard for Florida battery conviction."
2009.08-6925,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,873.025,875.541,Suppose we knew -- knew what happened.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,931.462,933.064,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.705,979.193,"Isn't there a separate -- a separate battery crime, aggravated battery, in -- in Florida, which--"
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,979.193,979.711,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,982.83,985.532,"--Well, this isn't -- this isn't a felony battery statute."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,991.686,992.269,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,992.269,997.506,"But, besides the misdemeanor battery statute, there are two felony battery statutes in Florida, right?"
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,997.506,998.089,There are.
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,998.872,999.958,And how -- how are they defined?
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,999.958,1017.384,"--Your Honor, they add the mens rea of whether or not the battery was intended to cause great bodily harm, permanent disfigurement, or permanent disability; and the other says simply that you committed a battery and did cause -- the higher standards."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.609,1027.542,Misdemeanor does?
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1027.542,1028.042,Yes.
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1032.596,1033.146,Right.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1033.146,1041.083,"And the misdemeanor is to cause bodily harm, which Florida law defines as low as causing a bruise or mark like that."
2009.08-6925,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1057.211,1070.685,What -- what about the government's argument that your interpretation would dramatically limit the reach of this provision of ACCA because of the number of States that define battery in the same way Florida does?
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1070.685,1083.509,"Your Honor, I think that the government exaggerates the concerns of that because there are statute that both require an admission of the use of force or have that as an alternative that could be prosecuted in the appropriate case."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1083.509,1084.028,"--Well, but--"
2009.08-6925,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1084.028,1108.227,"Yeah, but it's -- it's usually easier just to charge the lowest common denominator, the battery that doesn't necessarily require violent force, and the point -- this was the argument that was accepted in -- in Hayes, that the interpretation, say, advanced by the dissent in that case, would mean that there be a vast number of States that weren't covered."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1111.096,1113.112,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1136.544,1147.566,You -- you would have to have other States which only have a battery statute that is defined as broadly as this misdemeanor battery statute in Florida.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1163.277,1164.377,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1164.377,1173.05,"Are there any States that have only this simple battery statute, which is -- which is met by a simple touching?"
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1173.05,1178.937,"According to LaFave, only Florida and I believe one other State has such a broad definition--"
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1178.937,1179.404,No.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1180.687,1181.489,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1181.489,1197.666,"Are there any States in which the only prosecution for battery that can be brought is under a statute as broad as this one, which is -- is covered by even a touching?"
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1197.666,1198.483,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1198.483,1205.288,Don't all of the other States that have a touching statute also have higher degree of battery statutes?
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1205.288,1212.775,"Yes, Your Honor, according to LaFave, all States have aggravated battery statutes that include either the use of a deadly weapon or--"
2009.08-6925,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1212.775,1223.233,"But I thought the evidence was pretty clear that Congress was adopting the common law definition of battery here, which doesn't require that higher degree of force or violence."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1223.233,1231.939,"--Your Honor, in the legislative history, the only time that they talked about battery -- in one House report it references battery and assault, simply by those descriptions."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1241.127,1242.978,Do they use battery in the statute here?
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1245.746,1246.262,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1248.531,1276.884,"--Well, what worries me more than -- than your application to battery is the methodology, because, if it's true that in Section 1, unlike Section 2, a single instance of where you could commit the crime without using force is sufficient to take it out of the statute, then, just looking through this, generally, you would take out assault, probably have to take out kidnapping."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1294.679,1296.662,"Your Honor, when they--"
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1296.662,1300.083,"So that's very worrying, and why I don't think it's the right methodology."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1300.083,1304.201,"--Well, Your Honor, they did use the word ""element"", and an element is a constituent--"
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1304.201,1312.557,"Yes, but an element could be an element that is a -- the word is ""element"", the use or threatened use of physical force."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1344.778,1346.912,"--Your Honor, I would have two responses to that."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1367.058,1372.343,Rape can be convicted without -- rape can be conducted without force.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1372.343,1373.362,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1373.362,1373.695,All right.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1375.062,1378.08,"Your Honor, it depends on the element of the offense."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1378.08,1381.366,"Well, the element of rape is not force; it's lack of consent."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1381.366,1381.966,Excuse me.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1398.06,1400.262,"And, certainly, if the government believes--"
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1400.262,1404.047,And many of the other crimes that Justice Breyer has been talking about.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1404.047,1405.097,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1406.166,1406.849,You do?
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1438.887,1440.32,"--Yes, Your Honor, and--"
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1440.32,1442.172,"Well, you can't say yes to both of us."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1442.172,1457.516,"--Well -- I agree with Your Honor that the legislative history certainly indicates that 1 and 2 had different purposes, but this Court didn't find Begay and Chambers on the easy test, to say simply that DUI is not a property crime, therefore it doesn't qualify."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1463.753,1475.644,"I dare say that the next time somebody comes to argue before this Court that a crime is not included within Section 2 because it's not a property crime, I don't think that person is going to get one vote."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1475.644,1478.179,They wouldn't have to say that.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1488.035,1489.635,"--It is burglary, arson, extortion, and--"
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1489.635,1492.253,"Yeah, burglary, arson, extortion -- all right."
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1495.355,1496.355,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1496.355,1497.557,And I get--
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1497.557,1511.364,"But if the government failed to prove that a predicate qualified under the first prong, it could offer argument in evidence to the sentencing judge to show that it met the Begay test and was, in fact a serious risk of injury, that -- purposeful violence, et cetera."
2009.08-6925,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1516.252,1518.404,Would you just clarify an answer that you gave.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1537.016,1543.92,"There are other States, Your Honor, that have the common law definition, but they also have alternative versions."
2009.08-6925,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1558.345,1562.88,I thought you said they all had such -- such aggravated statutes in your answer to me.
2009.08-6925,0,34204,lisa_call,,1564.932,1572.419,"Well, many have alternative versions that require admission of use of force, not simply, say, touching or striking like Florida."
2009.08-6925,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1576.39,1577.157,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1586.495,1592.482,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-6925,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1612.527,1616.514,"Well, then why didn't they say -- why didn't they just say battery, if that's what they meant?"
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1622.917,1641.312,"--I think it's certainly true, Mr. Chief Justice, that Congress could have defined the category of predicates for the ACCA in that way by listing certain offenses, which would then require the courts to determine what the generic elements of those offenses were, as this Court did with respect to burglary in Taylor."
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1659.674,1672.517,"You -- you -- you would have us believe that by ""violent felony"" in this -- in this statute, Congress meant the threat -- the threat?"
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1689.609,1693.228,It creates a mandatory minimum of 15 years.
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1693.228,1694.513,Fifteen years for (snap).
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1696.08,1698.049,"Justice Scalia, I think that there are a few responses to that question."
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1721.33,1724.365,But that's all he's necessarily been convicted of.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1738.673,1743.742,"And again, two responses: The first is as a practical matter that is not a crime."
2009.08-6925,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1753.198,1759.768,But there have been rude touchings where there is no danger of physical injuries to the person.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1775.861,1776.979,That's correct.
2009.08-6925,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1810.951,1818.14,"How about pick pocketing, would pick pocketing be a violent crime if it involves a touching necessarily?"
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1818.14,1821.092,--Pick pocketing actually doesn't involve a touching necessarily.
2009.08-6925,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1822.242,1828.079,"I guess a very good pick pocket could get -- could get just the wallet and not touch the person, I'm not sure."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1828.079,1839.304,"--Well, pick pocketing, normally as it is criminalized in most states, does not, in fact, require as an element that the prosecution prove that the -- the defendant touched the victim."
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.304,1841.02,"No, but you don't prosecute them for pick pocketing."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1846.891,1851.362,"Well, the clumsy pick pocket would, in fact, be in most jurisdictions a robber."
2009.08-6925,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1868.489,1869.656,Counsel -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1871.791,1889.153,"--But I think that the essential thrust of the argument so far has been that if it's possible to commit battery under the common law under the laws of 27 states, including Florida, under Federal law in the way that individual instances doesn't seem to present a serious risk of injury, then it can't possibly be a violent felony."
2009.08-6925,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1896.407,1900.508,"--Counsel, you see that you don't have the inquiry."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1959.833,1968.689,"--Justice Sotomayor, I think that you are exactly right, that the inquiry that is set out in subsection 1 is simply, does this crime have as an element the use of physical force?"
2009.08-6925,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1979.377,1988.566,"Mainly because -- now we are getting to Judge Easterbrook's argument about the dime -- you know if I touch myself, I have now used force."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,1988.566,1989.1,Right.
2009.08-6925,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2009.33,2009.996,All right.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2051.073,2055.192,"Well, Justice Breyer, I think that's precisely the problem with the Petitioner's submission."
2009.08-6925,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2092.65,2095.416,Not for recidivism.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2098.435,2098.887,--It--
2009.08-6925,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2098.887,2118.448,"But are you saying that suppose to Florida split this statute, and some states do, so one crime is a rude touching crime, and the other is the use of physical -- aggressive physical force that endangers the physical safety of another."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2147.618,2149.153,"--That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-6925,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2154.806,2155.972,But only as a felony.
2009.08-6925,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2155.972,2170.566,"And what Congress was trying to get at the worse of the worst in ACCA, the Armed Career, whatever -- that they meant to get after people who go around poking other people in a rude manner?"
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2170.566,2186.426,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think, first of all, it would be a mistake to think that Congress defines the range of ACCA predicate with particular consideration to the ways that hypothetical defendants might -- might commit even quintessentially violent crimes in particular cases."
2009.08-6925,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2259.457,2264.444,"It might have, but battery by touching does seem a separate category."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2325.482,2333.588,"--Well, I think the response is, first, we think that the proper approach is one that pays respect to the words that Congress used to define the crime."
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.073,2409.838,"You know, I guess it comes down to whether we think that in -- in B1, Congress was using technical language or Congress was using simply ordinary language, because you are quite right that the definition of -- of battery covers even the slightest touching."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2471.494,2494.325,"I think it probably is not the way that we ordinarily talk in day-to-day conversation, but it certainly is the way that the law has talked about it for centuries, and I think there is a reason that Congress had in mind the technical definition of battery rather than ordinary parlance, if for no other reason because it tracked so closely the general definition, that technical definition of 1."
2009.08-6925,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2495.61,2499.062,"May I ask -- may I ask this, following up on Justice Scalia's point?"
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2522.094,2525.546,"--I am not sure of the answer to that, Justice Stevens."
2009.08-6925,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2585.584,2596.392,But there are no provisions that would include domestic violence and the gun possession provision.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2596.392,2612.402,"--There are -- the range of predicate offenses that can be used for the Section 922(g)(9) domestic gun violence prohibition, ordinarily, as this Court recognized in Hayes, encompasses the general assault and battery statutes of the United States."
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2659.031,2659.883,Where is the provision?
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2662.299,2662.918,It is.
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2665.118,2665.969,I am looking for it.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2669.154,2673.19,The--
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.19,2676.142,I hate people talking about statutes that I don't have in front of me.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2676.142,2679.01,--It's on page 3(a) of the statutory appendix.
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.01,2679.776,3(a).
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2679.776,2686.08,"It contains Section 921(a)(33)(a), which provides the definition of ""misdemeanor crime of domestic violence""."
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2686.08,2687.996,I thought you said 922.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2689.198,2689.848,That's correct.
2009.08-6925,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2696.602,2703.006,"It's really a question for Petitioner's counsel, and I didn't have time to ask as your white light goes on."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2716.615,2717.682,That's correct.
2009.08-6925,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2717.682,2723.067,Is there an argument that you anticipate objecting to that remand?
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2727.204,2733.275,I think it's within the Court's discretion to decide how to dispose properly of the case.
2009.08-6925,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2763.21,2764.244,How -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2774.366,2775.166,--Certainly.
2009.08-6925,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2799.465,2810.356,"Hear what they said, what the Eleventh Circuit said, it said that if battery under Florida law fits within the description of (1), then it is a violent crime for ACCA purposes."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2819.729,2823.847,"--I think it's difficult to read those four words in that manner, Justice Breyer."
2009.08-6925,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2823.847,2824.449,Why?
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2824.449,2827.9,If for no reason because the court of appeals didn't so much as acknowledge the existence--
2009.08-6925,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2827.9,2828.7,Was it argued?
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2828.7,2829.936,--It was argued.
2009.08-6925,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2832.436,2844.177,"It is pretty hard to see it given Begay, how this is like arson or, you know, the other three there, burglary, arson--"
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2844.177,2845.279,Explosives.
2009.08-6925,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2845.279,2846.229,--explosives.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2846.229,2847.814,--Well--
2009.08-6925,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2847.814,2848.548,"So, I mean, I don't know."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2855.618,2869.061,"--Well, I think it's -- again, it's difficult to read that piece of loose language in the Court's opinion as a direct holding, particularly considering that the court of appeals didn't so much as cite the language or even the code provision that relates to the argument."
2009.08-6925,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2887.623,2893.177,"Yeah, but I -- I thought -- you know, it's -- it's like the other four listed out."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2893.177,2898.497,"Well, it is like them in that it poses risks that are similar in--"
2009.08-6925,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2898.497,2911.221,"But then we are rereading these three other examples out because then ""other"" covers any crime that poses a risk of violence, or whatever the words are there -- I forget the words."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2912.756,2923.046,"--No, I think it would still be consistent with this Court's analysis of subsection (2) in Begay in that battery by touching, if you consider it to be a separate crime, which again I think is a highly contested--"
2009.08-6925,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2923.046,2927.148,And you think drunk driving doesn't present a serious potential risk of physical injury?
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2927.148,2933.67,"--No, but what this Court said in Begay was that it doesn't present risks that are similar in degree and kind to the risks that are presented by the enumerated offenses."
2009.08-6925,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2943.176,2945.828,"Wait, I don't follow that at all."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2957.033,2965.289,"--Well, I think -- first of all, to clear up a misconception, simply because the statutory text covers the slightest touching doesn't mean that it covers only the slightest touching."
2009.08-6925,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2970.443,2976.18,"Yeah, but your argument is to try -- is asserting that the slightest physical touching is covered by the statute."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,2976.18,2976.763,--Right.
2009.08-6925,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2986.903,2990.187,The district court thought that the two were related.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3006.364,3009.482,I'm not entirely sure why that would be true.
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3016.422,3020.79,"But (2) -- (2) looks to the conduct, it doesn't look to the element of the crime."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3025.278,3034.549,"Well, you have to look at the contact that the person was convicted of with respect to the elements of the crime, that is the nature of the category--"
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3034.549,3035.266,"No, no, no."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3061.867,3064.819,"--With respect, Justice Scalia, I think that is incorrect."
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3070.889,3071.989,Just at the elements.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3071.989,3074.608,--Just at the elements of the offense of which the defendant was convicted.
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3074.608,3077.643,Can I ask you about -- about 922?
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3129.095,3142.903,"Well, Justice Scalia, I would certainly be inclined to agree with you but it's particularly clear given the text and context of the purposes of section 922(g)(9) that battery ought to be covered by that definition, misdemeanor crime of domestic violence."
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3171.005,3184.663,I dare say that Congress in my view probably didn't even contemplate that something which is a misdemeanor could become a violent felony if you did it the second time.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3184.663,3186.015,Well--
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3186.015,3191.919,"Have we ever approved that, by the way, kicking it up to the felony category simply because of recidivism?"
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3191.919,3207.095,"--Well, the Court in United States v. Rodriguez in analyzing the coordinate provision of the ACCA that covers serious drug offenses said that the felony aspect of that definition is satisfied by a recidivist enhancement."
2009.08-6925,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3263.765,3267.65,"Well, every indication except for the fact that they didn't use the word battery."
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3267.65,3270.686,Aside from the fact that they didn't use the word battery.
2009.08-6925,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3294.403,3297.771,States do it all the time when they have different degrees of battery.
2009.08-6925,1,34700,leondra_r_kruger,,3300.807,3308.794,"--Well, as the Chief Justice has noted, States don't have quite the same compulsion to sort different factual offenses into different boxes."
2009.08-6925,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3392.817,3394.6,"Thank you, Counsel."
2009.08-6925,2,34204,lisa_call,,3399.803,3400.636,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2009.08-6925,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3400.636,3424.352,"I -- I don't want to waste too much of your time on the remand, but I can't really fault the government for waiving a right to raise a claim under Clause 2, which is your second reason for not -- not remanding, and it -- it does seem, to, me that the Eleventh Circuit -- one permissible reading was that they were just looking at 1, so that we would have to remand."
2009.08-6925,2,34204,lisa_call,,3424.352,3429.256,"Justice Kennedy, I would have to disagree with that because it was fully briefed, fully argued--"
2009.08-6925,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3429.256,3430.106,I understand that.
2009.08-6925,2,34204,lisa_call,,3430.106,3436.679,--And I take the -- the provision that when they indicated that the test was exclusively under the first prong.
