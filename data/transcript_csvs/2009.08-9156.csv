2009.08-9156,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.17,"We will hear argument next in Case 08-9156, Wood v. Allen."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,9.022,12.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-9156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,53.699,67.458,"Of course, if they had introduced that evidence on behalf of the defendant, there would have come in the report they had gotten from -- who was it, Dr. Kirkland?"
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,68.225,69.408,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-9156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,69.408,82.551,"Which said that, although he -- he indeed was in the lower range of mental agility, this did not affect his ability to discern right from wrong."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,82.551,83.385,Well--
2009.08-9156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,83.385,87.789,He was not -- the Kirkland report was not a favorable report for the defendant.
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,87.789,100.43,"--Well, the Kirkland report was not -- first of all, was only about his mental competency and whether he had a mental disease or defect that prevented him from knowing right from wrong."
2009.08-9156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.212,127.247,"Well, but it didn't just say borderline intellectual function."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,134.418,135.52,--Each of the statements--
2009.08-9156,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,135.52,140.055,"You know, if it had not added that I would have said, oh, yeah, let's -- let's pursue this further."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,147.91,158.885,"--Justice Scalia, everything in the Kirkland report that talked about his ability was his ability to go to trial, that he was competent and that he knew the difference between right and wrong."
2009.08-9156,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,175.978,180.215,Why is this question properly before us in this case?
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,215.905,228.545,"Justice Alito, our primary argument is a (d)(2) argument, and that is that there was no strategic decision here, that in fact it was a failure to investigate in violation of this Court."
2009.08-9156,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,228.545,230.814,Was (d)(2) raised in your habeas petition?
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,230.814,231.631,Yes.
2009.08-9156,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,231.631,237.551,"Could you give me a citation for that, where in the habeas petition you made a (d)(2) claim as opposed to a (d)(1) claim?"
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,237.551,248.193,"Well, our habeas -- I -- I can get a cite for that, but our habeas petition was all about failing to do an investigation in the State court's findings that there had been a reasonable investigation."
2009.08-9156,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,265.738,271.974,"That factual determination that you say is unreasonable under (d)(2), that went to deficient performance?"
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,271.974,274.093,"That went to deficient performance, of course."
2009.08-9156,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,274.093,277.628,Did the -- did the State court make a ruling on prejudice under Strickland?
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,277.628,279.745,The State court did make a ruling on prejudice.
2009.08-9156,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,303.178,313.468,Do you agree that we have to find that it was an unreasonable determination both with respect to performance and with respect to prejudice to get you through the (d)(2) hurdle?
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,313.468,323.99,"Yes, of course, and I think we can do that, and for the same reason, Mr. Chief Justice, that it was not reasonable in the first place for counsel to decide to stop their investigation."
2009.08-9156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,330.661,334.798,Could I take you back to Justice Alito's question?
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,350.491,351.074,Correct.
2009.08-9156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,351.074,352.009,All right.
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,390.801,391.568,Of course.
2009.08-9156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,391.568,395.42,But isn't that what Justice Alito asked you?
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,411.048,411.665,That's correct.
2009.08-9156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,411.665,412.265,All right.
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,434.228,437.247,"Your Honor, that is our alternative argument."
2009.08-9156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,439.782,442.084,"It might be your alternative argument, but it's not the question presented."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,442.084,446.036,"No, I'm saying the fact question is our primary argument."
2009.08-9156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,460.296,461.346,When did that come up?
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,542.081,545.033,"Justice Ginsburg, that is what the State argues."
2009.08-9156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,558.309,559.175,Where is that?
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,559.959,566.148,"Page 56a and page 57a of the petition appendix, which is the Eleventh Circuit decision."
2009.08-9156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,603.821,630.472,"I'm sorry that I don't have that appendix with me now, but as I recall the Eleventh Circuit was not making any independent determination of its own, but it was reporting what the senior lawyer -- his view of it."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,634.792,643.498,"--With all due respect, Justice Ginsburg, if you look at the Eleventh Circuit decision at this critical point, there is no reference to Mr. Dozier, who is the senior lawyer."
2009.08-9156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,678.921,682.789,"You don't have the cite for 542 F. 3d, that part of the opinion?"
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,689.31,691.645,"I'm sorry, I don't have the F. 2d cite."
2009.08-9156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,691.645,694.697,Could you clarify one -- could you clarify one thing for me?
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,723.2,731.87,"Well, I think your question is -- is right on point, because what Mr. Dozier was thinking about when he said it didn't merit further inquiry was the guilt phase."
2009.08-9156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.87,732.306,Right.
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,732.306,733.222,That's what he was focused on.
2009.08-9156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,759.373,789.143,"That, what you said so far, leaves out one thing; that is, I thought that Dozier had said: We need, we have to get this Kirkland report, and it's of interest to us for three purposes, the two that were relevant to the guilt phase and the one, mitigation, that was relevant to the penalty phase."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,816.31,828.701,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, the -- what Mr. Dozier said at that time was in response to a leading question: Did you have the penalty phase in mind?"
2009.08-9156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,863.171,891.506,"Now this case, for me at least, is terribly confusing, because I thought, reading the cert position, that the Court granted cert to deal with a legal question that has confused the lower courts, that is, what is the relationship between (d)(2) and (e)(1) of AEDPA?"
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,891.506,892.073,Right.
2009.08-9156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,892.073,897.26,Now I read your brief and I hear what you're saying so far.
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,948.177,962.702,"And that is very central to this case, and the reason it's central is because the Eleventh Circuit got it wrong when they focused on individual fact-findings, many of which were immaterial to the claim, instead of looking at the entire State court record, and so we--"
2009.08-9156,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,962.702,964.138,But that's an entirely different question.
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1002.594,1018.37,"--Right, and, if you look at Eleventh Circuit's opinion, the majority opinion in this case, what they did is, rather than look at the entire record for reasonableness to see if the Petitioner had shown that it was not reasonable, what they did was they looked at individual fact-findings."
2009.08-9156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1025.393,1039.284,"But let's just talk about the -- the finding of -- by the district court that there was no strategic reason and the -- and the disagreement with that in the Federal circuit, and let's talk about it just under (d)(1) -- just under (d)(1)."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1039.284,1039.719,Okay.
2009.08-9156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1039.719,1046.122,Would you say that the test is whether or not the -- that finding was clearly erroneous?
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1046.122,1047.506,No.
2009.08-9156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1047.506,1048.741,Is that -- is that another way?
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1048.741,1049.524,No.
2009.08-9156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1051.993,1056.895,"Why -- why is ""unreasonable application"" different from ""clearly erroneous""?"
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1056.895,1060.882,"--I think it's -- I think something could be incorrect, but it wouldn't be unreasonable."
2009.08-9156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1068.42,1070.405,"Well, I'm -- I'm talking about (d)(1)."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1070.405,1072.024,Okay.
2009.08-9156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1072.857,1075.559,"I -- I beg your -- (d)( 2), unreasonable determination of facts."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1075.559,1076.126,--Right.
2009.08-9156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1076.126,1076.842,Yes.
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1076.842,1077.392,Right.
2009.08-9156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1087.199,1092.068,"So you -- you think there can be findings that are clearly erroneous, but not an unreasonable determination of facts?"
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1092.068,1101.174,"--I think that this Court, certainly, in the context of (d)(1) has said, in Miller-El, that there is a difference between something being erroneous and something being unreasonable."
2009.08-9156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1101.174,1101.976,I'm talking about (d)(2).
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1101.976,1104.745,"I think it would -- I think it would apply there, too."
2009.08-9156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1105.178,1114.684,"Because the problem, as Justice Ginsburg indicated, is that the courts of appeals are looking for guidance as -- as to when we can go into -- into these findings and set them aside."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1114.684,1115.267,--Right.
2009.08-9156,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1116.303,1122.29,"And it really is very difficult for me to wear a ""clearly erroneous"" hat or an ""unreasonable determination of fact""."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1124.773,1139.43,"I -- I think the key difference is this, Justice Kennedy, and that is that when you have a (e)(1), you're not looking at the entire factual record."
2009.08-9156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1160.196,1163.148,"Do I have it right, in your opinion, so far?"
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1196.719,1197.419,Correct.
2009.08-9156,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1197.419,1199.171,"Now, (e) is a different situation."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1261.744,1263.077,I think that's right.
2009.08-9156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1270.581,1276.968,--And that's -- that's what the Ninth Circuit position developed by Judge Kozinski.
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1276.968,1277.635,--That--
2009.08-9156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1277.635,1295.631,"The only problem with that, it would shrink the province of (e)(1) very considerably, because overwhelmingly Federal habeas petitioners do not get evidentiary hearings in Federal court."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1316.962,1326.501,"--But, Justice Ginsburg, (d)(2) requires just as much deference, we believe, because of the -- the need to show that it's objectively unreasonable, so--"
2009.08-9156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1326.501,1330.286,I'm -- I'm not talking about (d)(2) now.
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1336.006,1336.656,--Right.
2009.08-9156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1336.656,1345.629,And one very well-presented position is the Ninth Circuit's in Judge Kozinski's opinion.
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1369.228,1369.68,There's--
2009.08-9156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1369.68,1373.132,There are not -- not many cases.
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1373.132,1374.565,"--There's less -- there's less work to do, of course."
2009.08-9156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1385.289,1397.164,"What you're saying is (d)(2) is a vigorous standard, but, yes, your description, unlike the opposing description of the relationship between these two--"
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1397.164,1397.53,--Right.
2009.08-9156,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1397.53,1405.37,"--does leave for (e)(1) this maybe 10 percent of the cases, not more."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1405.37,1406.153,And--
2009.08-9156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1406.153,1414.542,"Can I go back to -- just to -- so that we're on the same page in my own mind, what constitutes the State record?"
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1454.267,1471.378,"--The other evidence -- if it -- if it's intrinsic to the State court record, then it would be looked at under (d)(2), and the Petitioner would have to show that, looking at all of that evidence, the determination of fact was objectively unreasonable only if the evidence is outside of that."
2009.08-9156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1477.049,1485.888,"Does that seem -- does that seem reasonable, meaning the State court is making a decision based on what's before it."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1520.061,1520.878,Yes.
2009.08-9156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1525.613,1528.149,--So you're changing your earlier answer to me?
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1536.988,1539.356,--No.
2009.08-9156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1549.747,1557.918,"I'm not sure I understand that, meaning often a trial court is presented with evidence that determines something."
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1568.709,1570.328,"Right, but--"
2009.08-9156,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1570.328,1573.113,And you're using the evidence on the other question.
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1573.113,1576.982,"--And if it's within the State court record, it is looked at under (d)(2)."
2009.08-9156,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.433,1580.699,Could I ask a question?
2009.08-9156,0,34002,kerry_scanlon,,1600.53,1604.465,"Well, those are both unreasonable determinations of fact."
2009.08-9156,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1621.926,1623.295,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1633.484,1636.353,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-9156,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1660.468,1660.968,I -- I didn't--
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1660.968,1661.587,--I--
2009.08-9156,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1661.587,1666.289,--I just want -- I just described the Ninth Circuit decision.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1668.091,1668.624,--I apologize.
2009.08-9156,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1718.357,1731.732,"Well, isn't it -- isn't it the case that under (d)(1) or (d)(2) that's a threshold determination, and once you get over that (e)(1) would have work to do in determining whether there was a violation of the Constitution or laws in the first place?"
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1731.732,1734.534,"--Yes, (e)(1) is always going to have an application."
2009.08-9156,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1770.892,1776.444,That's under -- you've given yourself an easier case because you're going -- you're getting over the threshold under (d)(1).
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1776.444,1777.129,Correct.
2009.08-9156,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1777.129,1780.498,The problem is (d)(2) refers to determination of facts--
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1780.498,1780.948,Yes.
2009.08-9156,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1780.948,1781.731,--and asks whether it's unreasonable.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1794.84,1796.824,And that is the difficulty.
2009.08-9156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1813.719,1815.088,"Well, what's an example?"
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1815.088,1816.138,Let's take this case--
2009.08-9156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1816.138,1818.206,I can't think of any -- give me an example--
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1818.206,1819.106,--Yes.
2009.08-9156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1819.106,1824.526,"--where you're trying to proceed under (d)(2), and (e)(1) is somehow relevant."
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1825.609,1827.478,"Let's take -- let's take this case, for example."
2009.08-9156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1836.917,1837.451,Uh-huh.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1837.451,1843.155,The second fact is that all three counsel talk to each other for 4 days about the Kirkland report.
2009.08-9156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1843.155,1843.855,Uh-huh.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1843.855,1857.581,"The third fact is Carey Dozier, lead counsel, made the decision not to seek another evaluation; and the fourth fact is is that Carey Dozier, lead counsel, decided not to present the Kirkland report or similar evidence to the jury."
2009.08-9156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1860.867,1861.683,No.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1875.392,1875.809,The reason--
2009.08-9156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1875.809,1877.078,"And if it isn't, you win."
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1877.078,1880.53,--The reason that you go under (e)(1) is because Congress has said that you have to.
2009.08-9156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.53,1881.396,It didn't say that.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1911.382,1917.619,"Again, the problem is, is because we're looking at an (e)(1)-(d)(2) situation, but that's not the only situation."
2009.08-9156,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1917.619,1923.607,"Well, let me give you an example involving exactly those two provisions and facts very similar to the facts here."
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1975.992,1976.542,Right.
2009.08-9156,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1976.542,1994.536,"And then after they're reviewed under the plain language of (e)(1), you turn to the question under (d)(2), which is whether the decision about whether there was a strategic decision was based on -- based on an unreasonable determination of facts."
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1994.536,1995.321,Correct.
2009.08-9156,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1995.988,1996.638,So there's no conflict.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,1996.638,1997.205,--No.
2009.08-9156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2001.492,2002.309,"I see that, I see that."
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2002.309,2002.925,--The fourth--
2009.08-9156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2002.925,2004.444,That's a possible way to look at it.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2004.444,2005.061,--Yes.
2009.08-9156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2005.061,2026.007,"And the problem I see with that -- now I see why it's controverted, but the problem with these standards of review, it just -- it mixes people up, and it sounds as if you're bringing in a hammer after you've brought in a saw, and the hammer looks a little tougher than the saw, and -- but why get into all this business?"
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2026.007,2034.88,"Because I would come back with the saying that this is almost like having, because (d)(2) is so limited in what we do, you have a toe ache but you're asking us to cut the leg completely off."
2009.08-9156,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2037.815,2039.032,I don't understand that.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2053.408,2054.042,--Correct.
2009.08-9156,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2054.042,2070.469,"If you're right about that then you win, and there's no reason in the world to go on to (e)(1), that this case in your view should be totally governed by (d)(2), that is, the determinations of fact were reasonable."
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2071.503,2073.821,That is not the position we took.
2009.08-9156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.164,2097.12,"Well, we have one here, and my real objection, I guess -- and it's interesting, I now see the conflict, with Justice Alito's clear explanation of it."
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2108.76,2109.444,I agree.
2009.08-9156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2109.444,2113.296,Is there any reason we need to interpret it that way?
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2128.658,2141.549,"If the Court would come back and say that (e)(1) applies when the petition is filed and that if you're outside the (d)(2) claim -- (e)(1) is not tethered to the introduction of extrinsic evidence, it simply applies."
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2178.555,2189.029,"Counsel, you don't really want us to say that, because unreasonable, as we've defined it in (d)(1), means it could be wrong, but still not unreasonable."
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2189.029,2189.68,Correct.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2189.68,2201.837,"So if we say that proof of a -- by clear and convincing evidence that a decision by the State court was incorrect, you can't equate -- you don't really want us equating that with (d)(2), do you?"
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2201.837,2202.456,No.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2206.691,2209.274,That's why he -- that's why he starting--
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2209.274,2210.143,--right.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2210.143,2222.534,"--from, I think what he's saying is, what your adversary responded to Justice Ginsburg, unreasonable really is much broader than clear and convincing--"
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2222.534,2223.034,Correct.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2223.034,2224.569,--evidence on correctness.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2233.055,2233.757,Yes.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2233.757,2237.542,"I mean, one could quarrel with that proposition, but that's the state of the law."
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2244.196,2244.779,I agree.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2251.916,2254.552,"But work it out in theory, okay?"
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2254.552,2255.42,--Work it out in theory.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2255.42,2256.254,Work it out in theory.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2259.104,2259.539,I did.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2259.539,2263.408,"--one factual matter, was a strategic decision made?"
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2263.408,2263.958,Right.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2263.958,2271.014,There are a bunch of subsidiary facts that -- that were made.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2271.014,2271.564,Right.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2271.564,2284.321,"If you're applying (d)(2), the Court would look at all the subsidiary facts and decide not whether they were correct or not, but whether they were unreasonably incorrect, okay?"
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2301.247,2302.116,Correct.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2302.116,2312.805,"Either we agree it does or it doesn't, but -- I -- I -- I don't understand why you need (e)(1) because you never need to get to the correctness of the finding."
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2312.805,2319.393,"If I could finish the hypothetical earlier, I think I can show how (e)(1) and (d)(2) can both have effect in the same case."
2009.08-9156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.282,2357.267,Let me just interrupt because I am trying to follow this here.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2390.672,2391.94,--That would be (d)(1).
2009.08-9156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2392.374,2393.39,That's exactly right.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2393.39,2393.99,--Correct.
2009.08-9156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2393.99,2412.27,"Would that violate (d)(1) if even -- even if every one of the subsidiary facts was correctly filed and the conclusion drawn by the court was also correct, that it was a reasonable strategic decision at the guilt phase but unreasonable at the penalty phase?"
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2414.42,2426.661,The answer would than under 2254 (d)(1) you could overcome the habeas bar for penalty phase because you have shown an unreasonable application of Strickland to the facts that we have shown to be correct.
2009.08-9156,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2433.351,2437.969,It also has to involve what the strategic decision was?
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2437.969,2438.569,--Yes.
2009.08-9156,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2495.424,2499.209,"Somebody said it was put in his mouth, the question was on cross-examination."
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2499.209,2500.995,"--Well, point two was not put in his mouth."
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2662.379,2665.148,Can I stop you just for a factual clarification?
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2665.148,2665.933,Yeah.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2665.933,2674.254,Did the defendant's prior history with his other girlfriend come into the penalty stage of the trial?
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2674.254,2675.956,"No, at the trial it did not."
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2676.939,2682.11,"So this was a wise strategic decision, perhaps, with respect to the penalty phase?"
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2682.11,2683.01,--Absolutely.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2683.01,2685.812,"It did come in at the trial -- at the sentencing phase, correct?"
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2685.812,2689.013,Are you talking about in front of the judge?
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2689.013,2689.965,In front of the jury.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2689.965,2695.083,"No, the jury never found out about it, because Trotter and Dozier fought to keep it out."
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2699.571,2701.523,We're not arguing about the penalty phase.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2735.577,2736.194,--Right.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2744.6,2745.116,The sentencing--
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2745.116,2746.135,Jury.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2747.652,2748.435,--jury.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2749.254,2749.82,--Correct.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2749.82,2766.381,"So that's really -- I think that was Justice Stevens' question, which was, what was the strategic basis of a decision not to pursue mental health information when everything you wanted to keep out of the penalty phase would be coming at the sentencing phase anyway?"
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2766.381,2769.833,Let me see if I'm understanding the question correctly.
2009.08-9156,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2791.497,2792.331,That's the question.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2792.331,2792.866,All right.
2009.08-9156,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2894.314,2897.366,That -- that brings us to the point of beginning.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2948.115,2948.799,--I agree.
2009.08-9156,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2949.282,2955.305,And -- and -- but maybe there is -- is some more general theory that you can give me.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2955.305,2955.888,--There is.
2009.08-9156,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2955.888,2957.955,Res judicata doesn't work.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2957.955,2958.523,Right.
2009.08-9156,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2958.523,2962.959,Although I think Congress might have had something like that in mind.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,2962.959,2968.379,"If I may, let me give you the way we see (e)(1) working on a broader scope."
2009.08-9156,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3060.372,3065.526,Can I -- can I suggest -- it doesn't seem to me there's any -- any contradiction between the two.
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,3162.623,3164.823,"I think that, in two minutes, you've said it better than I did--"
2009.08-9156,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3164.823,3176.513,"If that's so, why would we not soon have what I call the habeas corpus jurisprudence of what is a subsidiary and what is a major fact and what is a finding?"
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,3198.863,3200.315,--I -- I would disagree.
2009.08-9156,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3208.569,3209.921,"Well, I don't think they've been handling it."
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,3239.106,3240.64,--I agree.
2009.08-9156,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3305.798,3307.667,"Thank you, General."
2009.08-9156,1,19551,corey_l_maze,,3307.667,3308.367,Thank you.
2009.08-9156,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3308.367,3314.904,"Mr. Scanlon, you have three minutes remaining, but I'll give you more, since I would like to start with a question."
2009.08-9156,2,34002,kerry_scanlon,,3356.647,3368.122,"Well, it was brought -- with all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, under (d)(2), as well, because the central focus was the factual allegation, the factual findings made by the State court."
2009.08-9156,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3370.739,3375.709,Is the language -- but then I -- you knew to quote the language of (d)(1).
2009.08-9156,2,34002,kerry_scanlon,,3388.866,3394.42,--But there were -- there was language about unreasonable application -- unreasonable determination of the fact.
2009.08-9156,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3398.089,3408.013,"Well, yes, I find it hard for you to -- to understand how you can say it was focused on when you quote (d)(1) twelve times and never quote (d)(2)."
2009.08-9156,2,34002,kerry_scanlon,,3410.48,3412.732,"Well, I think the focus was on both."
2009.08-9156,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3507.01,3508.212,"No, no, no."
2009.08-9156,2,34002,kerry_scanlon,,3514.282,3515.182,"Right, and what the Court--"
2009.08-9156,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3515.182,3520.27,"It focuses on the decision, whether the decision could have been reached--"
2009.08-9156,2,34002,kerry_scanlon,,3520.27,3520.87,--Right.
2009.08-9156,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3520.87,3524.638,--without the use of any facts that had been found to be false.
2009.08-9156,2,34002,kerry_scanlon,,3524.638,3534.094,"Right, but in every (d)(2) case this Court has considered from the lower courts, what they focus on is whether it's an unreasonable determination, as opposed to focusing on the word ""decision""."
