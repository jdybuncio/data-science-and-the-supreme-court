1973.73-206,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,40.828,"We?ll hear arguments next in 73-206, Parker against Levy."
1973.73-206,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,43.113,45.883,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.73-206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,886.414,903.582,"How about just on the speech side Mr. Solicitor General, how much would the military lose if 134 was construed or held or redrafted with the proviso provided this will never apply the speech?"
1973.73-206,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,903.582,907.26,Justice White I think in that case the military would immediately have to draft.
1973.73-206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.26,912.136,I understand that but how much would you lose?
1973.73-206,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,912.136,914.222,"A great deal, a great deal."
1973.73-206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,923.029,935.042,"You would have to then draft, do the best you could in drafting some kind of detailed, or a little bit more descriptive statute as to what speech was proscribe?"
1973.73-206,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,935.042,945.108,"Well I, I frankly, I have tried to think a little bit about what kind of an article one would draft and I frankly think it?s impossible."
1973.73-206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,948.756,951.568,"And of course you don?t have to go that far here, do you?"
1973.73-206,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,951.568,953.593,I beg your pardon?
1973.73-206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.593,960.523,You don?t have to -- Why do you have to meet this issue the way that you are talking about?
1973.73-206,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,972.662,973.961,I am tying now to meet the --
1973.73-206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,973.961,976.504,Or do you feel you have to meet an overbreadth argument?
1973.73-206,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,976.504,977.607,I have to meet an overbreadth argument.
1973.73-206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.607,979.659,"But you?ve already met it, you said."
1973.73-206,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,979.659,991.565,"[Laughter Attempt] Perhaps, I am out of a desire to point out that there are a variety of reasons why, how it can be met."
1973.73-206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,998.743,1010.372,"Well you must conceive though Mr. Solicitor General, I think the things you did in the average case that there would be a lot of conduct that would be charged under 134 that would be held not to be covered by it."
1973.73-206,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1010.372,1012.705,"Yes, I don?t think that?s very common."
1973.73-206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.705,1016.881,"Well, you?ve suggested some of those charges weren?t sustained."
1973.73-206,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1016.881,1019.789,"Some of them, I think about seven of the total were not sustained."
1973.73-206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1019.789,1024.555,But they?re nevertheless there are some that you could never imagine to be coming by 134.
1973.73-206,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1024.555,1025.729,In that list?
1973.73-206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.729,1029.71,"Well, there would be a lot of conduct that you would say is a [Voice Overlap]."
1973.73-206,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1029.71,1032.131,"Oh that I would say is not covered by 134, quite --"
1973.73-206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.131,1034.015,More than anybody would suspect was coming from?
1973.73-206,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1034.015,1036.628,"That is quite correct, that is quite correct."
1973.73-206,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.328,1047.459,No.
1973.73-206,0,38778,robert_h_bork,,1047.459,1052.432,It clearly also is not a catch all.
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1857.209,1863.669,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.73-206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1966.363,1973.234,The place you get convictions under Article 90 confirmed are reversed as in the Court of Military Appeals.
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,1993.546,1996.141,It?s a question of affirming or reversing the Court of Appeals of course.
1973.73-206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1996.141,1996.834,Right.
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2000.434,2001.132,Surely.
1973.73-206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2001.132,2012.05,And a good deal of what?s in your brief I suggest is just not open to a Federal District Court or Federal Court of Appeals under the system of Military Justice as it?s been developed in this country.
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2012.05,2027.105,"Well, I suggest that it not only is but it necessarily has to be Let me give you an example, under the order charge at court-martial, Dr. Levy contended that the reason he could not obey the order and there?s no evidence contrary to this, absolutely none."
1973.73-206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2074.263,2075.465,Those aren?t three cases.
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2079.386,2080.087,That?s right.
1973.73-206,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2080.087,2081.609,(Voice overlap) Not and the abortion cases.
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2081.609,2094.132,"The abortion cases, with respect to the question of medical ethics because it appears to me from those cases that no one can be ordered for instance, even though abortions are now legal in the constitution."
1973.73-206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.575,2203.261,"Mr. Morgan, as a matter of curiosity, what was his dermatological training that he had and secondly, that he was to give these aide people?"
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2203.261,2210.394,"The dermatological training that he had was that he had completed medical school, completed his residency under the ?Berry Plan? and he then came into the service."
1973.73-206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2210.394,2211.591,Period. That?s all he had?
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2211.591,2215.082,He took his boards I think approximately a year after he got into the service.
1973.73-206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2215.082,2216.049,Is the board certified?
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2217.047,2222.719,"Yes, he board certified just prior to the time or around the time of the order on the --"
1973.73-206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.719,2225.965,Did he ever practice dermatology?
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2225.965,2226.38,Privately?
1973.73-206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.068,2240.663,"And what was his supposed training of these, in dermatology, these aide people, was it to cure people or the opposite as I think you have just inferred."
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2240.663,2248.893,"Well, what I am saying is his purpose was to train people, to treat people and what was he to train them to treat?"
1973.73-206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2311.567,2322.933,"Well, I am just examining his ethical posture which you told me about the dermatologist being in effect, syphilologist, this of course is routine, always has been."
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2322.933,2323.41,"Yes, but --"
1973.73-206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2323.41,2338.324,But I am trying to find out what he found so unethical about treating natives or enlisted people or officers to protect themselves against venereal disease or to effect cures of once they have them.
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2338.324,2339.727,"Right, let me go to that."
1973.73-206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2430.224,2437.986,"Would he have regarded it as unethical, a violation of his Hippocratic Oath to treat one of these men who had some disease?"
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2437.986,2442.658,"No, nor did he consider a violation of ethics for him to train them in first day."
1973.73-206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2451.299,2454.691,He just didn?t like what they were going to do with the training after they have got it?
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2454.691,2462.945,"Well, I think both, he knew that if they got the training, that they did not work on their medical supervision, there was some statement made about it sporadically trained and that sort of thing."
1973.73-206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2523.076,2527.959,What specific part of the Hippocratic Oath is it that you rely on?
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2527.959,2535.489,Hippocratic Oath?
1973.73-206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2541.661,2542.714,55?
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2542.714,2544.104,"I think so, Your Honor."
1973.73-206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2544.104,2546.51,I didn?t mark it when --
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2546.51,2550.493,Let me see here.
1973.73-206,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2600.037,2608.776,"Are you saying then that paramedical people are, in there increasing use these days is contrary to the Hippocratic Oath?"
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2608.776,2609.423,No.
1973.73-206,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2626.898,2630.299,And how do you get from this to the constitution?
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2630.299,2631.617,How do I get from this to the constitution?
1973.73-206,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2646.049,2649.57,The defense that the constitution requires to be allowed.
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2649.57,2652.223,"Oh, the First Amendment."
1973.73-206,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2652.223,2661.811,The First Amendment requires that he would be permitted to present his objection to this use of paramedics before the court-martial?
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2661.811,2667.404,That he would be allowed to present his ethical concern and reason for declining the order.
1973.73-206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2814.01,2818.648,As I follow his application of the Hippocratic Rule.
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2837.415,2848.203,"Not really, it?s that is only a part of it and of course that?s a medical question, as far as, whether it? better or worse like if you gave everybody a penicillin shot , would the world be better off or not and some doctors would argue either way."
1973.73-206,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2927.938,2936.017,"Well, the question really comes down to whether that is a judgment that the subordinate officers in the military are free to make, isn?t that what this case comes to?"
1973.73-206,1,19515,charles_morgan_jr,,2936.017,2940.991,As to whether doctors or subordinate officers in the military are free.
