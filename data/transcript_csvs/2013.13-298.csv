2013.13-298,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.604,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 13-298, Alice Corporation versus CLS Bank International."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,8.604,10.956,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-298,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,36.089,39.975,"And just repeat, it is common ground between the parties that--"
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,39.975,50.949,"That -- that our -- our patents speak directly to the language of Section 101, that is, they are a process, and they are machines, and they are -- and they are improvements to the process and the machines."
2013.13-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,63.59,73.462,"Mr. Phillips, on the abstract idea, you know that the Bilski case held that hedging qualified as an abstract idea."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,80.285,94.712,"If our -- if our patent merely claimed intermediated settlements, although I have to say I don't really know exactly what that means because I don't think that's the same kind of economics -- basic economics concept that a hedge risk treatment is."
2013.13-298,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,149.213,149.629,"--Well, let me put it this way."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,166.423,168.958,"I don't disagree with it, Justice--"
2013.13-298,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,168.958,174.594,"So the fact that the computer is involved, it -- it seems to me, is necessary to make it work."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,183.8,187.838,--I prefer not to use that word for obvious reasons.
2013.13-298,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,190.404,192.973,Or -- or a method or a process.
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,192.973,193.575,--Right.
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,199.227,200.16,Why is that less abstract?
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,200.16,201.11,--I'm sorry?
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,201.11,202.262,Why is that less abstract?
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,241.22,242.254,It is--
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,242.254,252.528,"How is that less abstract than King Tut, if we had the same thing with a grain elevator, if we had the same thing with a reservoir of water, if we had the same thing with my checkbook?"
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,253.095,258.114,"--I do see the point, Justice Breyer, and it seems to me that it goes to the question of the methodology you're going to employ."
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,258.114,260.716,"Methodology is just that you said, stop."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,260.716,261.65,"Well, we could--"
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,261.65,274.458,So what we have different here is the computer stops rather than the abacus man stopping or my mother stopping or the guy that the grain elevator has that says stop.
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,287.283,288.301,--No.
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,293.772,294.255,Of course it's a caricature.
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,299.842,300.909,But--
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,300.909,306.079,And what you do is you take the idea of solvency and you say apply it.
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,320.606,320.972,--Right.
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,320.972,322.572,--because you will tell me why--
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,322.572,322.956,Right.
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,322.956,323.808,--this is enough.
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,323.808,324.491,Right.
2013.13-298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,354.16,354.46,I'm sorry.
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,382.662,388.483,"Well, it does it through -- it creates the shadow accounts because of the concerns for security."
2013.13-298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.764,413.616,Why isn't it -- why isn't doing it through a computer not enough?
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,426.089,427.291,Justice Scalia--
2013.13-298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,427.291,429.727,Why -- why is a computer any different in that respect?
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,429.727,431.793,--At one level I agree with you completely.
2013.13-298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,450.307,454.276,"Well, I'm not saying use a computer is -- is much of a novelty."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,471.387,473.02,"To be sure, Justice Scalia."
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,473.02,478.991,And this is exactly the question I really would like to you to focus on for me.
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,500.155,500.574,Right.
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,500.574,507.327,"--Then we implement it by having somebody with a pencil and a piece of paper and this is all that they add, you see."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,543.6,552.622,"And -- and look, there's no -- I'll be the first one to -- to confess that trying to use language to describe these things is not all that easy."
2013.13-298,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,589.563,594.715,"But my -- my initial question, and I think I can work this into King Tut, is--"
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,609.042,616.898,"You cannot, absolutely cannot do that with this system, because it is so complex and so many interrelated parts."
2013.13-298,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,616.898,630.638,"Suppose I thought -- and, again, it's just a thought because I don't have the expertise -- that any computer group of people sitting around a coffee shop in Silicon Valley could do this over a weekend."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,631.54,633.207,You mean wrote the code?
2013.13-298,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,633.207,634.223,"Yes, right."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,634.223,637.092,"Well, that's absolutely -- I'm certain that's true."
2013.13-298,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,637.092,638.992,"Well, then -- then--"
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,638.992,640.127,But that's true of almost all software.
2013.13-298,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,640.127,643.663,--Then why is the computer program necessary to make the patent valid?
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,643.663,650.083,"Well, it's -- it's necessary to make the invention effective."
2013.13-298,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,680.269,681.454,"But that's just an idea, hey, let's use a computer."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,681.454,686.925,"But it's not just -- I mean, obviously, part of it is use the computer, Justice Kennedy."
2013.13-298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,689.71,692.762,Is your software copyrighted?
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,692.762,695.197,"--No, I don't believe so."
2013.13-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,695.197,700.182,"There is no special software that comes with this -- that's part of this patent, is it -- is there?"
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,700.182,700.665,No.
2013.13-298,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,722.679,726.047,"Mr. Phillips, could you -- could you disaggregate your argument for me?"
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,753.548,753.814,Yes.
2013.13-298,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,754.131,755.047,Which part of what--
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,755.047,756.764,--I'm saying both actually.
2013.13-298,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,773.026,775.326,--So putting the computer stuff aside completely--
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,775.326,775.726,--Right.
2013.13-298,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,775.726,779.679,--you're saying that you've invented something or you--
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,779.679,780.695,Yes.
2013.13-298,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,780.695,788.635,--There is something that you've patented that has -- that is not just simple use a third party to do a settlement.
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,788.635,788.951,Right.
2013.13-298,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,788.951,792.253,"And what is that, putting the computer aside?"
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,792.253,799.007,"It is -- well -- and again, it's difficult to do that because you absolutely need the computer in order to implement this."
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,834.847,839.651,"Can you in fact -- now, this is -- look, there are 42 briefs in this case."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,887.765,888.234,"Yeah, of course."
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,888.234,896.838,"And if you go the other way and say never, then what you do is you rule out real inventions with computers."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,896.838,897.522,Right.
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,897.522,906.195,"And so in those 42 briefs, there are a number of suggestions as to how to go between Scylla and Charybdis."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,925.857,933.446,"Well, Justice Breyer, I guess I would suggest to you that you might want to deal with the problem you know as opposed to the problems you don't know at this stage."
2013.13-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,978.209,984.478,"Mr. Phillips, let me just stop you there, because four Justices of this Court did not read that legislative history the way you do."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,988.682,991.099,--But this is post-Bilski.
2013.13-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,991.099,997.12,Justice Stevens went carefully through that and he said: Congress was reacting to a decision.
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1005.559,1012.479,"Well, I mean, it still seems to me that the -- the natural inference is Congress did not change 101."
2013.13-298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.319,1021.601,"And four is not five anyway, right?"
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1021.601,1022.884,--That's true.
2013.13-298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.884,1023.703,Four is not five.
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1023.703,1026.305,"And you've exhausted my math skills, Your Honor."
2013.13-298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.305,1034.826,"By the way, we -- we have said that you can't take an abstract idea and then say use a computer to implement it."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1044.184,1044.7,Exactly.
2013.13-298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1044.7,1046.067,--which is basically what you're doing.
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1046.067,1047.25,And that's the argument we're doing and--
2013.13-298,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1047.25,1047.817,And that's a little different.
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1047.817,1049.102,--that's the line we're asking the Court to draw here.
2013.13-298,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1049.102,1050.819,"Well, how are you saying the how?"
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1062.093,1069.096,"I would urge the Court to look at Joint Appendix 159, 285-286, where it goes through the flow charts."
2013.13-298,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1162.292,1169.712,"If we say that there's no software patentability and agree with the Attorney General, do you lose in this case?"
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1169.712,1182.706,"Well, it would be very hard for me to see how that -- how -- how I can get around that particular problem, because the computer is the essence of it, so -- and a portion of it is clearly the software."
2013.13-298,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1191.627,1204.985,"Is there any common ground between you and the government -- maybe a better question to ask the government -- a common ground between you and the government on something in the software area that's patentable, other than making the computer itself work?"
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1208.004,1210.623,That's the way I interpret the government's -- the government's brief.
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1210.623,1244.946,"It was like -- there's a Bloomberg brief out here that was on this, that said, no, you can -- you can patent computer software when it's an improvement in the computer, when it's an improvement in software, when it's an improvement in a technology that is developed out of computers like robotics, when it is an improvement in a machine or technology, but you cannot improve it where it is simply an improvement in an activity that is engaged in primarily through mental processes."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1259.856,1263.074,I read the Solicitor General's brief as broader than the Bloomberg brief in -- in terms of the approach.
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1278.683,1282.571,"But I'm asking you -- I'm asking you, what about this one that I just mentioned?"
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1284.621,1284.937,Right.
2013.13-298,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1284.937,1288.541,--and four of them you could patent and the fifth one you can't.
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1288.541,1289.041,Right.
2013.13-298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1326.5,1328.066,"Well, you're doing a very good job of proving--"
2013.13-298,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1328.066,1339.241,"In Bilski, Justice Breyer did try to say that there wasn't that -- a whole lot of distance between the four who thought business methods were not patentable."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1367.375,1368.677,"Well, he said there's an overlap."
2013.13-298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1422.493,1428.314,--Which of the -- which of the opinions below captures your position most accurately?
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1428.314,1433.368,I would guess it would be Judge Moore's opinion below that would capture ours most correctly.
2013.13-298,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1433.368,1445.942,"And if we were to think your method claim is ineligible, do you agree that your systems and -- your medium and system claims fail as well?"
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1447.543,1447.843,No.
2013.13-298,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1477.897,1482.199,"Can I give you a hypothetical, Mr. Phillips, and you tell me how it's different or the same."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1506.149,1515.255,"I don't know if it's the same, but I would -- I would argue that it could very well be a patentable subject matter because -- but it depends on how the claims play out."
2013.13-298,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1515.255,1516.005,"No, but exactly."
2013.13-298,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1534.249,1539.537,I could certainly -- I think I could write a claim -- a set of claims that I believe would satisfy 101.
2013.13-298,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.295,1552.745,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1559.884,1563.253,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1663.451,1671.805,"Can I ask you at some point, not necessarily this second, to say in my -- this is just -- you know, you have an opinion for a court."
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1739.115,1763.9,"Your Honor, as -- Justice Breyer, as to abstract ideas, the PTO has filled in that shell by listing economic concepts, legal concepts, financial concepts, teaching concepts, dating and interpersonal relationships and generally how business should be conducted as examples of those things that are likely abstract, which, of course, all follow directly from Bilski and the discussion this Court had in Bilski."
2013.13-298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1792.017,1794.519,What do you think is a technological solution?
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1794.519,1795.286,--Your Honor--
2013.13-298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1795.286,1803.875,"How could they, if at all, written their patents to -- to make -- to make their software eligible?"
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1808.009,1810.111,"--Justice Sotomayor, they have no software, first."
2013.13-298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1857.209,1857.792,"Well, that's a little more complicated."
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1886.559,1894.398,"--Mr. Chief Justice, Figure 16 has nothing to do with the invention asserted against my client in this case."
2013.13-298,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1977.569,1990.046,"Would you give me -- again, you already did it once -- an example of a business process patent -- of a business process idea and invention that is patentable."
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,1990.046,1992.346,"Your Honor, there are many examples."
2013.13-298,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2025.552,2030.454,"Well, I -- I -- in my language, I've called that mechanical rather than process."
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2032.639,2033.123,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.13-298,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2039.06,2041.844,But that's how to make a -- that's how to make a machine work better.
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2041.844,2043.18,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.13-298,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2043.18,2054.402,"I'm asking you: Is there any business process, any business activity that is susceptible to a patent, a pure patent, innovations that deserve patents?"
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2054.402,2061.475,"Your Honor, again, a technological solution to a business problem could well be, whether it's a method or a process, is equivalent."
2013.13-298,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2063.658,2064.61,Can you give me an example.
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2064.61,2067.896,--I thought the data compression example was a good one.
2013.13-298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2089.075,2094.713,How about e-mail and just word processing programs?
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2094.713,2104.769,"Your Honor, a program -- let me try it this way to both of your questions."
2013.13-298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2131.152,2134.69,So you're saying no to e-mail and word processing.
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2134.69,2135.89,"--Your Honor, I think at a point--"
2013.13-298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2135.89,2142.36,They certainly have functionality and -- and improvement of functionality for the user.
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2142.36,2148.598,"--At a point in time in the past, I think both of those would have been technological advances that were patentable."
2013.13-298,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2148.598,2149.533,How?
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2149.533,2154.685,Today -- because they would have provided a technological solution to a then unmet problem.
2013.13-298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2263.223,2268.71,"What if -- what if you can do it without a computer, but it's going to take, you know, 20 people a hundred years?"
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2272.595,2273.312,Two answers.
2013.13-298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2273.312,2277.049,--but it's impractical without looking to do it on the computer?
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2277.049,2285.238,"Mr. Chief Justice, first, these claims literally read, as Alice reads them, on a single transaction between two parties, so it's not 20 people for a hundred years."
2013.13-298,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2310.57,2329.867,"Yeah, but the trouble with that particular test is, as I think partly the Chief Justice said, how long, et cetera, and then add to that, though you could do it without a computer, what happens at the end of the line is the automobile engine goes off or it begins to sputter or it turns left."
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2365.44,2388.32,"--Justice Breyer, your point is the reason that it is equally fallacious to suggest, on the one hand, as Alice and IBM does, that simply reciting a computer is a magic key that gets you through 101 and you never have to any other inquiry, and what some of folks, the amici on the other side, say, which is that computers or software are never eligible."
2013.13-298,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2414.204,2426.428,"Mr. Perry, before we get back to these matters, you said to Justice Scalia if a patent sufficiently describes how a computer will implement an idea then it's patentable."
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2440.855,2443.39,"--If I can answer in two steps, Justice Kagan."
2013.13-298,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2502.928,2505.714,You're not suggesting that specific code is necessary?
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2505.714,2506.214,"No, Your Honor."
2013.13-298,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2606.963,2617.553,"The Federal Circuit in this case split in many ways, and it had our decisions to deal with."
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2633.813,2641.919,"--Your Honor, I think there's a significant element to the Federal Circuit that disagrees with Mayo and has been resistant in applying it."
2013.13-298,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2694.637,2708.045,"Should we be concerned, Mr. Perry, that there are old patents that in fact could meet the test that you set forth but won't because they were written in a different time and so used much more general language?"
2013.13-298,1,36483,mark_a_perry,,2708.045,2718.769,"--Your Honor, the applicant or the patent holder would have the opportunity to institute a reexamination proceeding or some sort of administration process to address that issue."
2013.13-298,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2765.834,2766.284,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2779.659,2781.693,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.13-298,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2824.172,2837.596,How do you answer the argument that your view would extinguish business-method patents and make all software ineligible for patent protection?
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2837.596,2843.667,"Yeah, with -- let me address software patents first because that, I think, is obviously a significant question."
2013.13-298,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2866.182,2870.903,Why do we need to reach this in that -- reach software patents at all in this case?
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2870.903,2871.919,--Well--
2013.13-298,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2871.919,2876.807,What's the necessity for us to announce a general rule with respect to software?
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2878.94,2879.942,"--Well, I--"
2013.13-298,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2879.942,2880.759,There's a systems.
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2880.759,2889.215,"--Well, I -- I think -- well, they -- they -- there's a process being and -- and one can think of software patents as process patents."
2013.13-298,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2906.576,2912.163,Do you think we have to reach the patentability of software to answer this case?
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2912.163,2915.948,"Well, I think you can -- I think the answer to that question is no, not necessarily."
2013.13-298,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2958.959,2959.294,Well--
2013.13-298,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2959.294,2975.987,"Could -- could -- could you go on with that because you were just getting to the point where I think you say a computer improvement that, in fact, leads to an improvement in harvesting cotton is an improvement through a computer of technology, so it qualifies."
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2995.15,2997.752,--I don't think there's a yes or no answer to that question.
2013.13-298,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2997.752,2998.252,What is your view?
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3002.138,3004.923,If there is a genuine innovation in the functioning of the computer--
2013.13-298,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3004.923,3005.89,Yes.
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3005.89,3007.792,--such that business processes--
2013.13-298,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3007.792,3008.108,We've got that.
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3045.067,3045.45,"--Yeah, that--"
2013.13-298,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3045.45,3047.367,"If I'm not right, what is the distinction?"
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3047.367,3048.869,--That is generally the line we're drawing.
2013.13-298,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3049.335,3050.552,And how is that justified?
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3050.552,3051.337,--I do want--
2013.13-298,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3051.337,3062.376,"That -- that is Judge Dyk in -- in Bilski in the Federal circuit, 4 people sort of picked it up maybe, 5 didn't pick it up."
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3064.378,3064.878,--Sure.
2013.13-298,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3155.138,3168.964,"Is there an example that you can give us of a -- what we can call a business process that is patentable, a process that doesn't involve improving the workings of a computer?"
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3168.964,3172.333,I -- I think it's going to be difficult for me to do that.
2013.13-298,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3227.0,3232.054,"General, I -- you mentioned a while ago the need for greater clarity and certainty in this area."
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3244.962,3268.477,"I take -- I take the point, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think the key is that they are all directed to answering the question of whether the innovation that is claimed and is an innovation in either, A, the improvement of a computer's functioning or, B, the use of computer technology to improve the functioning of another technological process, and a case like Diehr would be in the latter category."
2013.13-298,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3332.254,3341.026,I have a question about how do you identify an abstract concept.
2013.13-298,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3358.137,3370.212,"We would define abstract -- an abstract concept as a claim that is not directed to a concrete innovation in technology, science, or the industrial arts."
2013.13-298,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3378.299,3379.051,"Thank you, General."
2013.13-298,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3381.337,3386.404,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.13-298,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3422.829,3434.654,"Your adversary says that his -- the appendix to his brief are the only patents at issue, that the flow charts are not at issue in this case."
2013.13-298,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3434.654,3436.704,"There's no basis for that statement, Your Honor."
2013.13-298,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3450.414,3453.199,If we were to say that there are no business patents--
2013.13-298,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3453.199,3453.649,Yes.
2013.13-298,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3453.649,3456.767,--would your patent survive at all?
2013.13-298,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3456.767,3458.184,"No, I don't -- I don't believe so."
2013.13-298,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3467.49,3469.092,"Yes, he wants to say no business patents."
2013.13-298,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3469.092,3471.444,No business -- just another way of saying no business methods.
2013.13-298,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3593.74,3594.34,"Thank you, counsel."
