2005.04-1376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.876,We'll hear argument first this morning in Fernandez Vargas versus Gonzales.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,7.251,20.832,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,63.71,74.262,"Wouldn't it be the same result if Congress decided, for example, to take away one of the available methods of seeking discretionary review, just saying,"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,76.237,88.797,"Congress might change the specific types of review that are available, and then this Court would have to... but would either have to... would have to engage in a Landgraf analysis of whether--"
2005.04-1376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,88.797,88.847,But that would be--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,88.847,88.967,--that would be--
2005.04-1376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,88.967,89.788,"--a pretty easy case, wouldn't it?"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,105.04,106.565,"--The... yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,123.082,123.682,But why should that--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,123.682,124.266,"--and, therefore--"
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.266,127.084,--why should that make a difference as to whether it's retroactive or not?
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,197.341,197.334,--Two--
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,197.334,199.068,--seems to me that's what's going on here.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,199.068,201.083,"--Two responses, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,207.976,208.447,That wasn't my point.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,208.647,208.827,The--
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,208.827,213.79,"--was, you look to the... to the activity which is governed by the new law."
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,244.717,256.913,"--Justice Scalia, the portions of the reinstatement provision, besides for the provision barring other forms of relief, I would agree, are simply procedural provisions."
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.607,281.887,That doesn't affect--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,281.887,284.045,--the fact that you--
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,284.045,285.316,--doesn't affect his reentry at all.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,291.978,312.62,"--Under Your Honor's analysis, a statute that said that if the attorney general finds that an alien has reentered in the past, the alien may be sentenced to 15 years in prison, would also merely be procedural and governing the sentencing rather than the underlying act of reentry."
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.546,321.525,That would apply new penalties to the reentry.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,333.629,343.377,"--But the act of removing the right to seek adjustment of status, suspension of deportation, voluntary departure, that is a new penalty."
2005.04-1376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,411.61,425.232,Has any... a number of courts have considered this question... have any of them accepted your first... your argument that the statute is clear that it is nonretroactive?
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,425.232,430.185,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, both the Sixth and the Ninth Circuits have accepted that argument."
2005.04-1376,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,454.699,458.649,I'd... I'll have to look at those decisions.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,470.555,484.718,"Both... they didn't use the term ""clearly"", because, of course, as we explained in our brief, there's an asymmetry in retroactivity analysis, and using the ordinary tools of statutory construction, one can demonstrate a prospective intent on the part of Congress."
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,493.454,493.634,"Yes, but--"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,493.634,493.795,--decided that.
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,493.795,514.357,"--I think that's because they were using the version of stage one that you are using, which includes, in the consideration of whether Congress has been clear, an inquiry into whether the... whether the law is retroactive or not, which, as I understand it, should be left to stage two, exclusively."
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,514.357,514.938,I--
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.938,518.729,Your analysis in your brief mingles the two.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,543.393,552.771,"--In both the St. Cyr's case and the Lindh case, this Court did invoke the presumption against retroactivity in its stage one analysis."
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,641.195,649.97,"Yes, but as the Government points out, that ""either before or after"" applied to when you had been deported--"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,649.97,650.741,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,650.741,651.535,--not to when you reentered.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,662.374,672.617,"Actually, Justice Scalia, under our stage one argument, we are now arguing that, in fact, the Government is right, that the 1952 Act was tied to the date of deportation."
2005.04-1376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,690.329,691.052,"Well, that's an--"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,691.052,691.373,And--
2005.04-1376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,691.373,696.108,"--that may be a reasonable inference, but I think it's a real stretch to say that it ""clearly establishes""."
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,713.902,719.277,"--They also specifically delineated, in some context, Mr. Chief Justice, that it would be retroactive."
2005.04-1376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,782.683,783.054,"I'm sorry, I... you lost--"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,783.054,783.376,--The--
2005.04-1376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,783.376,783.726,--me there.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,783.726,784.57,--I'm sorry.
2005.04-1376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,784.57,785.371,Can you--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,785.371,786.735,That's on--
2005.04-1376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,786.735,787.319,--I'm looking at page--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,787.319,787.899,--page--
2005.04-1376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,787.899,788.35,--I'm--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,788.35,791.059,"--It's quoted on page 27, note 15, of our opening brief."
2005.04-1376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,820.322,820.565,--I don't how--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,820.565,820.795,--decided--
2005.04-1376,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,820.795,828.507,"--I don't see how that undermines their point that when Congress wants to specify that something ""shall apply prospectively only"", as they quote,"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,837.461,840.96,"--No, Justice... Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,877.357,879.514,I wish we could get some new vocabulary.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,905.514,905.734,--Was it triggered?
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,905.734,911.09,"--I would consider that still prospective, but just note my--"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,911.09,911.33,I--
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.33,912.404,--that I don't--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,912.404,912.845,"--I think, actually--"
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,912.845,918.472,"--go along with you when you force this terminology on me, whether Congress intended it to be retroactive."
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,930.125,936.252,"--Justice Scalia, I agree... I agree that that's for purposes... that terminology is better for stage one."
2005.04-1376,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,940.705,949.712,"Aren't there several possible explanations for why Congress would leave the ""before or after"" language out of the... out of the new provision?"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,969.421,974.155,"I don't think either of those possibilities is plausible, Justice Alito."
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1038.748,1048.205,Why would... I find it difficult to understand why Congress wouldn't have wanted this to apply to illegal entrants who had come in before IIRIRA.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1109.912,1120.375,"Justice Scalia, clearly Congress was attempting to change... or to increase the disincentives to reentry."
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1126.352,1126.782,Not only the--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1126.782,1126.993,"So, the question isn't--"
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1126.993,1127.235,--disincentives.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1127.235,1127.425,--whether--
2005.04-1376,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.425,1134.716,"They were trying to get out of the country people who were here illegally, two time losers who were here illegally for the second time."
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1134.716,1142.367,"--The question, however, though, is not whether they were trying to change that consequence."
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1169.296,1169.777,But is that--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1169.777,1170.338,--of the time of that conduct.
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1170.338,1171.211,--so here?
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1208.322,1212.394,"I presume, Justice Breyer, you mean at the time that Congress enacted IIRIRA?"
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1212.394,1214.158,I mean when this particular--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1214.158,1214.389,Was--
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1214.389,1215.483,--provision was passed--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1215.483,1215.883,--That--
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1215.883,1219.161,"--a week later, he goes to a lawyer, and the lawyer says,"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1257.876,1266.542,"--No, Justice Breyer, it does not, because had he left in 1996, upon enactment of IIRIRA, he would have been inadmissible for 5 years--"
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1266.542,1267.143,Well--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1267.143,1268.538,--as a result of having left.
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1272.69,1279.953,"--Being... if you get married... if you're outside the country and you marry an American, you're married to an American and you can't come in for 5 years?"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1279.953,1282.331,--As a result of his initial... having reentered--
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1282.331,1283.675,As a result of--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1283.675,1284.927,--within 5 years--
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1284.927,1285.508,--the initial deporting order.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1285.508,1294.455,"--As a result of his reentry five... within 5 years of the date of his 1981 deportation, he would be ineligible for readmission for 5 years, had he left the country."
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1294.455,1302.55,"So, his choice is this Act or... in which case, you never can get back, if you're caught... or go to Mexico, wait 5 years."
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1302.55,1303.935,"Or 10 to 20 years, if--"
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1303.935,1304.466,Ten to 20 years?
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1304.466,1307.252,"--Ten to 20 years if you're caught, under this Act, is my understanding."
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1309.297,1310.238,"No, no."
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1312.556,1313.75,--Yes.
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1313.75,1314.871,--in 10 to 20 years--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1314.871,1317.571,"No, we... if he stays in the United States, he's... and is--"
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1317.571,1317.992,--Is caught.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1317.992,1327.711,"--entitled to apply for these forms of relief from deportation, then he will... then he can become an American citizen, or become a lawful permanent resident, as a result of the forms--"
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1327.711,1328.732,If you lose this--
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1328.732,1329.756,--of relief that existed--
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1329.756,1338.441,"--case... if you lose this case, then his choice would be, stay here, get caught, and you never can come back, or 10 to 20 years?"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1338.441,1338.992,--Ten to 20 years.
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1338.992,1339.424,I see.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1339.424,1340.335,Ten to 20.
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1340.335,1343.141,"Or go to Mexico, and you can come back in 5 years."
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1343.141,1343.662,Yes.
2005.04-1376,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1343.662,1344.002,Okay.
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1344.002,1353.73,"But, of course, at the time... pre IIRIRA, the choice was, stay in the country and seek... and seek American citizenship through these other routes."
2005.04-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1361.021,1362.016,"Well, in this--"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1362.016,1362.547,--because--
2005.04-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1362.547,1368.193,"--in this case, he was married after the effective date of the new statute."
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1368.193,1369.347,"--Yes, Justice Kennedy."
2005.04-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1369.347,1376.93,"Did Judge McConnell, in the Tenth Circuit, suggest... because he discussed this... suggest that the result might have been different if the marriage had been before?"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1376.93,1379.257,"Yes, he did suggest that."
2005.04-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1379.978,1383.287,Why would that be consistent with his... with his analysis?
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1383.287,1393.418,--Justice... Judge McConnell and several other courts have focused on the types of relief that an alien was eligible for as of the effective date of IIRIRA.
2005.04-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1455.855,1456.175,"Well, but--"
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1456.175,1457.49,--there would be no question that it was a real marriage.
2005.04-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1457.49,1472.234,"--it does point out that your argument is a difficult one, because this expectation that you argue for is that, number one, he has an expectation that he'd be able to adjust his status even after Congress has changed the law respecting reinstatement."
2005.04-1376,0,20907,david__m_gossett,,1472.234,1475.232,I don't think that's--
2005.04-1376,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1475.232,1475.813,This is--
