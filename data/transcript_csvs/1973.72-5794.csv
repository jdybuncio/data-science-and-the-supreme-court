1973.72-5794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.796,"We'll hear arguments next in 72-5794, Davis against Alaska."
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,31.804,35.489,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-5794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,179.895,183.432,Was that his only collision with the law?
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,183.432,199.55,"To our knowledge, we never actually were provided with the record at that time, but the respondent has admitted in essence what I have just related to the Court in their particular brief, we don't believe that's at issue."
1973.72-5794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,366.327,383.613,"Before you leave that police station situation, I noticed on page 34 that you were referring to earlier, there was a general question in the course of the trial."
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,421.024,422.975,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.72-5794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,422.975,427.323,Did you pursue that by way of any impeachment at a later point?
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,427.323,428.34,In the trial?
1973.72-5794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,428.34,428.809,Yes.
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,428.809,430.267,"No, I did not."
1973.72-5794,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,772.423,779.149,"Of course Joshua Davis had a juvenile record with that, would you allow that to go with it?"
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,779.149,780.433,His juvenile record?
1973.72-5794,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,780.433,785.051,"I said suppose that he did have one, would you allow that to go with it?"
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,785.051,787.013,Absolutely not.
1973.72-5794,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,799.88,801.557,The difference is what?
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,801.557,802.617,The different is what?
1973.72-5794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.852,836.972,"You said -- did you say, you wanted to use the record to impeach his credibility?"
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,836.972,839.744,"Green's credibility, yes, and to show that he --"
1973.72-5794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,839.744,861.215,"What did the Alaska Supreme Court mean when it said that Davis' claim is not to be interested in impeaching the juvenile, but rather desire to show bias, prejudice or motive and that the witness was under pressure to shift suspicion from himself to another, is that a current reflection of what you wanted to --?"
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,861.215,862.771,Yes it is.
1973.72-5794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,867.333,873.974,He just was interested in introducing the record to show that he had a criminal record and he might not be reliable or truthful?
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,873.974,887.206,"No, we weren't using it under the state rule of evidence which provides that impeachment of character may come about by showing a specific bad action and we weren't attempting to do that."
1973.72-5794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,887.206,890.832,That kind of impeachment goes to sort of a general attack on credibility?
1973.72-5794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,890.832,892.01,On character.
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,892.01,895.829,The distinction that I would make is that would be an attack on the witness's character.
1973.72-5794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,901.64,910.614,"But just for the limited purpose of showing bias, prejudice or motive in the sense that he had some special reason for cooperating with the police?"
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,910.614,911.462,Yes.
1973.72-5794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,911.462,913.091,Because he was on probation?
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,913.091,914.173,Yes.
1973.72-5794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,942.179,950.077,But if any of you had a more limited reason for wanting to enter -- to use the record then you might have had?
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,950.077,953.019,"No, I don't think I understand your question, Justice White."
1973.72-5794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,953.019,960.737,"Well, the appellant -- he claims not to be interested in impeaching the juvenile."
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,969.04,988.772,I have tried to cover that somewhat in my reply brief that when the term impeachment and the term attack on credibility have been used somewhat interchangeably and I tried to distinguish them at least for purposes of my argument in the cases that I have cited in support of our position also make that distinction.
1973.72-5794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,988.772,1009.562,"The reason I was interested in this is the Alaska, the state Supreme Court seem to say that with respect to this limited reason for wanting to use the juvenile record that that reason was amply satisfied by this scope of cross-examination which was allowed."
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1009.562,1019.143,I don't think that the Alaska Supreme Court was limiting themselves to strictly impeachment in the terms of the particular civil rule.
1973.72-5794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1031.876,1036.131,How do you separate those two?
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1056.696,1060.006,I agree with that completely Mr. Chief Justice.
1973.72-5794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1100.127,1103.505,"Well, maybe that you weren't quite pushing for that in the state --"
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1103.505,1108.788,"I wasn't pushing for that and we aren't pushing for that now because it's not necessary in this case, but I think it should be."
1973.72-5794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1108.788,1116.863,Because it would be that you could use a prior criminal record for impeachment for a purpose that is wholly aside showing bias.
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1116.863,1120.047,"Yes, that simply this person is a bad person."
1973.72-5794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.047,1122.759,"Yeah, and he may not be truthful?"
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1122.759,1123.901,Yes.
1973.72-5794,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1123.901,1124.685,Excuse me?
1973.72-5794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1124.685,1139.193,And it might be that a jurisdiction such as Alaska might wholly abolish the rule that permits impeachment simply by showing a prior conviction and I take it your argument doesn't go to any such general abolishment?
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1139.193,1151.124,"No, it does not and of course there is a perceptible trend in that direction, but we were not limiting, we were not offering it solely for that purpose and actually that was the secondary purpose."
1973.72-5794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1160.467,1168.525,You might have had the situation for showing that if he were simply charged as a juvenile and not even finally adjudicated?
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1168.525,1169.59,That's correct.
1973.72-5794,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1189.371,1199.671,"As I read the opinion of Chief Justice Boney and that part appearing on 59A of the appendix, he was simply describing your argument."
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1235.458,1235.962,That's correct.
1973.72-5794,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1235.962,1238.377,Because of the special circumstances in your case --
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1238.377,1238.924,That's correct.
1973.72-5794,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1238.924,1259.077,"-- of this particular witness having been found delinquent by reason of larceny and of this stolen safe having been found next to his trunk and therefore that he was under some particular reason to testify against your client, that that wasn't just a case of general impeachment, that's what I understand, is that my --"
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1259.077,1259.572,That's correct.
1973.72-5794,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1259.572,1260.93,One has read it?
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1260.93,1262.328,"No, I think that's absolutely correct Justice Stewart."
1973.72-5794,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1262.328,1275.689,"And the court went on to think that if that was your purpose, at least their view of the evidence was and at the cross-examination that you had ample opportunity to satisfy that purpose, within the cross-examination that you were allowed?"
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1275.689,1275.956,That's correct.
1973.72-5794,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1275.956,1276.497,That's what they say?
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1276.497,1288.395,"That's what they found, but, of course, the questions that were permitted were only self-serving general questions such as did you feel you are under pressure Mr. Green, do you feel you might be a suspect?"
1973.72-5794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1291.476,1304.159,"Nothing in the trial court's ruling prevented you from going into the fact that the safe was found on his property and that he had some relationship with the owner of the truck, and you were perfectly free to follow up that as you chose?"
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1304.159,1308.304,"Yes, but that's the extent of it."
1973.72-5794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1339.413,1355.362,Couldn't you under Alaska practice had moved to have his no answer to your question whether he had ever been questioned by a police officer stricken since the trial judge sustained an objection to the question?
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1355.362,1356.6,It was not my objection.
1973.72-5794,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1373.519,1378.816,"Mr. Wagstaff, can I ask you (Inaudible)"
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1378.816,1381.15,"Well, I didn't know was of course."
1973.72-5794,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1381.15,1382.488,You wouldn't bound by it?
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1382.488,1383.514,You know I would be bound by --
1973.72-5794,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1383.514,1386.697,(Inaudible)
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1386.697,1390.675,"Yes, the order, protective order --"
1973.72-5794,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1390.675,1401.409,"It was outstanding and yet you asked that question that you got the answer no, but you were stuck with it, because of you asking the question?"
1973.72-5794,0,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,1401.409,1406.161,That's correct.
1973.72-5794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1406.161,1407.667,Mr. Merriner.
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,1407.667,1412.117,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-5794,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1468.264,1470.241,Is that a harmless error?
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,1470.241,1473.985,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-5794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1538.661,1547.622,"Mr. Merriner, we now know, do we not, that on page 34 he did answer one question falsely?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,1547.76,1550.554,I would dispute that Your Honor and --
1973.72-5794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1550.554,1552.676,You mean that it was a false answer?
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,1552.676,1553.739,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-5794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1553.739,1554.066,What do you think it was?
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,1554.066,1575.818,"Mr. Chief Justice I pointed out in footnote 3 on my brief, it's on page 13 that this response was not untruthful because this inquiry referred to being questioned as a prospective witness and not as a prospective accused."
1973.72-5794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1589.421,1609.183,"Well, isn't that then if that extraordinary, very extraordinary suggestion that you make were possibly true that they didn't question him, isn't that something that might appropriately been the scope of further examination?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,1609.183,1610.231,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.72-5794,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1694.434,1705.375,"In the face of your -- that Rule 23, you suggest that in the circumstances that you oscillate that you might have got the criminal record in?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,1705.375,1706.934,Yes.
1973.72-5794,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1706.934,1711.416,"Well, that would certainly be contrary to the prohibition of the Rule 23, wouldn't it?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,1711.416,1732.549,"Oh, yes, but of course, a rule cannot stand if it's unconstitutional for its application, to be -- for it to be applied and there is another rule in the Alaska Criminal Rules, Rule 57 which says that in the interest of justice, we can't dispense with any of the foregoing rules."
1973.72-5794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1902.916,1915.726,"Well, you then treat the right to confront not mainly the right to cross-examine generally, but the right to cross-examine about any subject that the defense counsel chooses?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,1915.726,1928.194,"If by not being allowed to go into this area, the jury is rather greatly misled about the reliability of his testimony, that testimony is crucial, yes."
1973.72-5794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1928.194,1944.51,"Well, what if the state recognizes a husband-wife marital communication privilege and that privilege is claimed by a witness on the stand as being cross-examined by defense counsel, do you think that the state court has to abolish that in the interest of confrontation?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,1944.51,1954.223,"Well, I know in Washington v. Texas, this Court stressed the fact that they were no way indicating that these privileges were being questioned."
1973.72-5794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1981.472,1983.424,"Well, have any of our cases ever gone there far?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,1983.424,1984.765,"No, Mr. Justice--"
1973.72-5794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1984.765,1986.775,"Well, you are arguing for the state, aren't you?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,1986.775,1997.163,"Yes, but I am arguing here that the focus should be -- the test should on the cruciality of the testimony to just how misled were the jurors."
1973.72-5794,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2016.258,2022.348,"Of course, the prosecution always has the privilege in not raising the rule?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2022.348,2029.371,"Yes, assuming the court does not on its own do so."
1973.72-5794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2051.699,2065.045,"Well, of course, have there been the usual scope of cross-examination, we might have a record that would disclose some reasons that we can now only speculate about?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2065.045,2092.795,"Yes, but in light of how impeaching these facts were generally, which I have submit are not that impeaching and in light of the extensive corroboration of this man's testimony, it seems apparent that any further cross-examination into this area would not have raised any hidden doubts in the jurors' minds, doubts that are not present in this record."
1973.72-5794,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2100.879,2103.207,How in the world can you say that?
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2120.973,2136.421,"Let me go into just how corroborative this testimony was and I think that when you realize just how corroborated it was, then you will see that by asking these further questions, that testimony would not have been changed."
1973.72-5794,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2136.421,2147.122,"Well, I have great difficulty in being able to take a very careful pair of calipers in find out what goes through a juror's mind."
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2151.999,2161.495,"In these confrontation cases, that's the question that has to be asked, just what would the jurors have thought."
1973.72-5794,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2170.349,2176.677,Do I know what the average juror In Anchorage Alaska would think?
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2184.538,2188.524,It's even colder than this up then.[Laughter]
1973.72-5794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2392.162,2398.94,"Well, then are you, are you really not so getting pretty close if not on a harmless error argument here?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2398.94,2402.041,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.72-5794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2752.589,2763.598,"Mr. Merriner, you began this, your statement by saying up juvenile records have to be revealed in a case that would not be of greater benefit to the defense than in this particular case."
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2800.871,2801.441,I would like to argue --
1973.72-5794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2801.441,2822.323,"-- put to test of this constitutional area or are you on the other hand saying that there ought to be a per se rule that if a state has expressed a public policy as your State of Alaska has, that juvenile records not be revealed that that be the end of it, that they never be revealed on cross-examination?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2836.09,2847.174,"I would argue for a per se rule if I felt that I analytically could, but take the situation where a juvenile is told by his judge."
1973.72-5794,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2879.355,2882.795,But your Supreme Court did limit this?
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2882.795,2883.02,Excuse me?
1973.72-5794,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2883.02,2887.398,Supreme Court did not limit the per se rule?
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2887.398,2892.912,"Well, I read the opinion as hedging on the matter, yes, I think, it did and --"
1973.72-5794,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2892.912,2897.252,"Well, because the rule that's before us doesn't permit what you say, does it?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2897.252,2898.87,"No, but --"
1973.72-5794,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2898.87,2901.466,And that's the only thing here before us?
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2901.466,2919.507,"Well, we do have the other rule that I mentioned about how the interest of justice can call the rule not to be applied, but the Alaska Supreme Court, when it discussed this issue, a rather brief discussion, but --"
1973.72-5794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2919.507,2925.432,"On page 60A, that's at bottom of page, they seem to be hedging a little bit saying that in this particular case, no --"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2925.432,2925.826,Yes --
1973.72-5794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2925.826,2926.704,-- great damage was done.
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2926.704,2938.627,"And in footnote 40 on 59A, they start out with a case where they say it stands for this juvenile record not admissible to impeach absence special circumstances."
1973.72-5794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2938.627,2941.814,"Well, that is citing if would the California case How?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2941.814,2944.121,"Yes, but in citing a case --"
1973.72-5794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2944.121,2968.017,"Well, you and to come back to my question, what's your argument is to us in this case, as I understand it then from your answer and you tell me if I'm wrong that you concede that there maybe cases where a denial of the right of the defense counsel to ask a prosecutor witness about his juvenile record would be a deprivation of the defendant's constitutional rights?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2968.017,2969.173,"Yes, but I would think they would be --"
1973.72-5794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2969.173,2970.512,Am I right about that or not?
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2970.512,2977.325,"Yes, but I think these cases would be very rare and they will not be a great breach in the juvenile secrecy structure as such --"
1973.72-5794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2977.325,2979.243,These cases would be rare and this is not one of them?
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,2979.243,2997.755,"Yes, the case, for example, where the judge tells them you get on the stand or you will be sentenced more than you would be ordinarily or a case like where there has been perjury, that has come out on the stand and you've got to bring up the juvenile record to show it, in cases like that."
1973.72-5794,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2997.755,3000.449,Have you --
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,3000.449,3001.707,"I think that's all I have, there is --"
1973.72-5794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3001.707,3020.681,"When the trial judge heard his answer that he had never been questioned, if not, should that not have suggested to the trial judge that here was an area in which the witness was not being completely candid with the jury?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,3020.681,3024.795,"It should have suggested that to Mr. Wagstaff, whether it turned out like that."
1973.72-5794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3024.795,3043.128,"Do you think Mr. Wagstaff then should have asked for opportunity out of the presence of the jury to pursue the cross-examination, in some way, that would lay a foundation for an exception to the Alaska rule on confrontation?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,3043.128,3055.72,"Yes, he should have at least done that, and I think the judge had a duty to do it on his own and as I argue in that footnote, this was really not an untruthful reply."
1973.72-5794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3059.897,3062.35,"Well, at the very least it was a very ambiguous answer, wasn’t it?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,3062.35,3064.218,"Yes, it was ambiguous."
1973.72-5794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3064.218,3069.473,And you say it was the duty of defense counsel to pursue that?
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,3069.473,3093.201,"Yes, I don’t see why this Court should focus upon that one questions and say, look here was all this perjury when it has not even been raised in the brief, has not been raised until argument now and the lower court has had no chance at all to rule upon that particular error, if that was error at that one point."
1973.72-5794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3093.201,3130.686,"Mr. Merriner, does Alaska practice provide an opportunity to counsel who finds himself in the position of Mr. Wagstaff did following the combined answer of Mr. Green and the objection by the prosecutor and the sustaining of the objection to the question to at least allow the party that asked the question and got what is basically an answer to a question that has been ruled to be impermissible and get that answer stricken, so that he isn’t both bound by the answer and still precluded by the court's ruling from following it up?"
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,3130.686,3131.661,"As fas as I know, yes."
1973.72-5794,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3143.11,3148.704,"You say that he was unresponsive, he said, have you ever been questioned, he said, no."
1973.72-5794,1,19660,charles_m_merriner,,3148.704,3149.814,"Well, okay. [Laughter]"
1973.72-5794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3154.39,3156.993,"Very well, Mr. Merriner, Do you have anything further Mr. Wagstaff?"
1973.72-5794,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3156.993,3159.417,"Yes Your Honor, thank you."
1973.72-5794,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3204.633,3249.09,"Was there anything that prevent you from asking the court to give you a hearing out of the presence of the jury to pursue your question on page 34 which at least was very ambiguous, you'd agree and then also to develop what were the detailed conversations between the police and this witness, Green, between the time they first contacted him and the day of the trial to see if, for example, there was any suggestion that if he didn’t cooperate, they would refer this to his probation officer or other comparable, anything to prevent you from doing that?"
1973.72-5794,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3249.09,3263.219,"I would say what prevented me from doing that was the court's indication of the rule on protective order that you essentially felt that his juvenile record was invalid, that’s how I will answer that question, I do answer it."
1973.72-5794,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3263.219,3271.371,"Well, it preserved the confidentiality of that by taking this kind of thing in chambers, but on the record?"
1973.72-5794,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3271.371,3286.736,"That, perhaps, could have been done and again, the reason why I would not, is because of the protective order was interpreted and the force of it and the rapid objection and the sustaining of it."
1973.72-5794,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3398.578,3399.182,Extension of --.
1973.72-5794,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3399.182,3400.036,Or the --
1973.72-5794,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3400.036,3402.644,"Of the rental agreement, yes."
1973.72-5794,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3479.568,3504.972,"Mr. Wagstaff, are you contending for a rule that would prevent defense counsel to cross-examine a juvenile prosecuting witness as to his previous record in all cases, even though the state had a policy such as your State of Alaska has, keeping such records confidential or are you simply telling us that in this particular case, it was important to protect all the rights of your client?"
1973.72-5794,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3504.972,3509.339,"I am saying both, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1973.72-5794,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3547.815,3559.511,"To the Supreme Court of Alaska, you argued that your case was different, you said as I understand that, as the general rule is you can’t bring it up but this case is special circumstance."
1973.72-5794,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3559.511,3560.035,"Yes, I argued--"
1973.72-5794,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3560.035,3572.138,"Now you bring that argument to us, are you arguing that the general rule seems to be conceded in the states is simply constitutionally wrong?"
1973.72-5794,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3572.138,3603.567,"I argued both, Mr. Justice Stewart, to the Supreme Court I am arguing now that it should be allowed to be brought out in all circumstances when someone is testifying against the accused in a criminal proceeding unless it can be shown that there is some really wild fact situation that where it would be terribly abusive, but absent that, that it should be brought out and let the jury determine whether this person in his own mind would have some, hold the benefit of his position with the prosecution, the government is offering him as a witness."
1973.72-5794,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3612.781,3622.09,"In fact, your objections are that if we set at this particular question, I got it from the brief, I haven’t gone beyond them, that only Michigan has adopted --"
1973.72-5794,2,40775,robert_h_wagstaff,,3622.09,3625.097,"The per se rule, yes Michigan has adopted it."
1973.72-5794,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3651.067,3651.86,Thank you gentlemen.
