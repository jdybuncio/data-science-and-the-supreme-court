2009.08-1224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.606,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-1224, United States v. Comstock."
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,8.025,21.097,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Article I of the Constitution permits Congress to enact section 4248, which is the limited Federal civil commitment statute at issue in this case."
2009.08-1224,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,120.273,126.243,"Well, is part of the statutory scheme that you can be committed to Federal custody for, say, a year and then the State takes it over?"
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,126.243,129.865,"That is correct, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-1224,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,146.78,151.495,Why would a State want to incur that extra expense if--
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,151.495,151.916,Well--
2009.08-1224,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,151.916,153.648,--if the Federal Government is going to do it for them?
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,153.648,166.817,"--What Congress found was that States often were not willing to incur that extra expense, even if the Federal Government was not going to do that for them, and what this legislation was, was a response to that reality."
2009.08-1224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,167.55,170.327,What was the experience under 4246?
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,199.097,202.065,"--I think it is unusual, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,238.282,241.262,But the likelihood is that the person will stay in Federal custody?
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,241.262,250.995,"--I think that that's fair, that the likelihood is that the person will stay in Federal custody until such time as a court finds that the reasons for that custody have lapsed."
2009.08-1224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,269.035,283.982,What -- what -- what power conferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitution permits the Federal Government to assure that sexual predators are not at large?
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,283.982,295.212,"I think the power, Justice Scalia, is the power to run a responsible criminal justice system, to run a criminal justice system that does not itself endanger the public."
2009.08-1224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,295.212,301.475,So you would say that the Federal Government has no such power independent of the criminal conviction?
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,315.095,317.934,Without the person having entered the criminal justice system in any way.
2009.08-1224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,317.934,318.156,Right.
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,328.697,342.224,"That has been the government's case throughout this litigation, that it has always depended on the fact of Federal custody, on the fact that this person has entered the criminal justice system, has been -- four of the five of these people--"
2009.08-1224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,342.224,342.552,Yes.
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,342.552,345.176,--have been convicted and have served prison terms.
2009.08-1224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,360.419,368.542,"Well, why doesn't the Federal Government's authority to have custody because of the criminal justice system end when the criminal justice system is exhausted?"
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,370.039,380.958,"Because the Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure that release of the people it has in its custody is done responsibly, is done in such a way--"
2009.08-1224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.958,381.847,But you said no.
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,397.231,405.385,--I think that the power to run a responsible criminal justice system extends to the way in which the Federal Government releases these prisoners.
2009.08-1224,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,405.681,412.366,Could the Federal Government order a commitment of anyone who's been in Federal custody over the last 10 years?
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,412.366,417.224,"--Justice Kennedy, I think that that would be a much harder case."
2009.08-1224,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,422.22,422.438,"No, no, no."
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,428.591,429.761,--Okay.
2009.08-1224,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,458.139,459.98,So that must be because there is a lack of Federal power.
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,459.98,468.71,"Yes, I think that that's correct, that at that point the State police power over a person has been fully reestablished."
2009.08-1224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.71,475.881,"But it's fully reestablished once he walks out of Federal prison, at least if he walks out of Federal prison into a State."
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,475.881,477.909,"I think that that's not right, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,493.09,507.57,"Well, but they don't fall through the cracks if the Federal Government notifies the State into which this prisoner is to be released: We are going to release a prisoner; we think he's sexually dangerous; you should take some action to be sure that he doesn't harm society."
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,512.303,516.221,I think Congress could reasonably find that that is insufficient.
2009.08-1224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,537.526,552.253,"Under your theory -- under the theory that you are proposing, then, any dangerous person, whether it's because of mental illness or any other reason, could be held indefinitely--"
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,552.253,552.849,No--
2009.08-1224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,552.849,570.874,"--under a civil commitment statute, because what you're saying is that the Federal Government, merely because of their -- their time in control of the individual, has an unlimited constitutional power to then civilly commit this dangerous person."
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,570.874,574.855,"--I think what would prevent that, Justice Sotomayor, is the Due Process Clause."
2009.08-1224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,580.432,589.552,"Well, what -- what constrains the government under the Due Process Clause from invoking a dangerousness merely because someone has a long history."
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,606.34,614.272,"Well, I think that the history of this Court's cases would suggest that if this were a person without mental illness that the civil commitment statutes--"
2009.08-1224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,614.272,617.347,--But that's where I'm trying to understand--
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,617.347,618.365,"--Yes, that the civil--"
2009.08-1224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,618.365,623.989,--the connection between the nature of the mental illness and the constitutional power that you are claiming.
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,628.828,651.176,"--Well, if you go back to a case like Kansas v. Hendricks, which is of course where this Court thought about civil commitment statutes with relation to sexually dangerous offenders, I think the Court made clear that it was important in that case that there be not only sexual dangerousness, but also mental illness, in order to invoke the civil commitment statutes."
2009.08-1224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,651.176,664.641,"Are you saying that as far as those limitations, the question that Justice Sotomayor was asking, the limitations on the Federal Government would be the same as they are on the States?"
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,670.873,673.45,"You said it better than I did, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.635,707.976,"General Kagan, you are relying on the Necessary and Proper Clause, right?"
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,753.191,762.031,"--The Court has always said, Justice Scalia, that the Necessary and Proper Clause, the question is, is it necessary and proper to the beneficial exercise of Federal powers?"
2009.08-1224,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,781.677,783.162,Isn't it the case that--
2009.08-1224,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,783.162,784.285,But the brief -- excuse me.
2009.08-1224,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,784.285,821.144,"--Well, I was going to ask, is it the case that the unwillingness of States to step into this area in these instances is a consequence, at least in part and perhaps in large part, of the Federal incarceration, that as a result of the Federal incarceration, the person is no longer viewed by the State as -- as having domicile within the State, the State of prior domicile has no way of knowing whether that person would return to a domicile in the prior State?"
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,826.532,841.027,"Just to make sure that I understand the question, that the reason for the enactment in part has to do with the fact that the Federal Government has assumed custodial responsibility and has disrupted the relationship between the State and the citizen, I think that that's exactly right, Justice Alito."
2009.08-1224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,862.298,863.718,"So, is the prisoner--"
2009.08-1224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,863.718,864.393,"So, if there were--"
2009.08-1224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,864.393,884.681,"--Is it -- is it a prisoner who has served his time in, say, a Federal penitentiary in Ohio but is a domiciliary of Arizona, what happens when the prisoner is released, say, after 10 years?"
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,888.569,895.924,The default position is that the prisoner is released to the place where the prisoner was convicted.
2009.08-1224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,986.794,987.231,"--But, General--"
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,987.231,988.104,--component to it.
2009.08-1224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,988.104,999.647,"--I understood you in your response to Justice Alito to say, if I remember, that it was not just the fact of Federal custody, but the fact that there are no States or there may well often be no States willing."
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1010.02,1018.155,"I think when we are dealing with the Necessary and Proper Clause, we are asking ourselves whether Congress reasonably acted in a given situation--"
2009.08-1224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1018.155,1019.812,"I guess it wouldn't be necessary, is what you are saying?"
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1019.812,1040.1,"--Well, if -- if -- that's exactly right, that if the facts before Congress were such that there were no difficulty with this transition period and that nobody ever fell between the cracks, an entirely different question would be presented, and then there would be some kind of argument that at that point, in those circumstances State police power would be the appropriate default position."
2009.08-1224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1040.506,1078.132,"General Kagan, I -- I find it difficult to believe that if the Federal Bureau of Prisons wrote the governor of the State into which this person is to be released, and they try to release him in the State where he -- he will in the future reside, and said, we are about to release this person in 60 days or whatever, in our view there are serious mental problems, and we think the State ought to consider commitment proceedings, I find it difficult to believe that an elected governor or an elected attorney general would ignore that letter."
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1078.132,1086.236,"--I do believe, Justice Scalia, that Congress reasonably could have found that there were difficulties in making this transition."
2009.08-1224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1103.651,1107.633,The governor is going to say that at the next election: It would have cost too much to put this guy up.
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1107.633,1109.649,"--Well, I think people -- people make judgments--"
2009.08-1224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1109.649,1110.117,"You know, it costs $65,000."
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1110.117,1111.727,--People make judgments all the time.
2009.08-1224,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1120.708,1122.317,Was it -- was that a consideration?
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1130.297,1140.825,"--That is exactly right, Justice Ginsburg, and maybe that's the -- the best answer to Justice Scalia, is history, and it's history on two separate occasions, which this Court has noted."
2009.08-1224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1202.004,1205.175,I must say I'm -- I'm not terribly impressed with -- with the argument--
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1205.175,1206.922,"I can tell, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1206.922,1207.987,--the States won't do it.
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1214.309,1214.589,"No, I--"
2009.08-1224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1214.589,1217.057,"The States won't do it; therefore, we have to do it."
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1221.214,1222.774,"--I don't think so, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1224,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1289.826,1296.323,"Well, when I was thinking about your hypothetical, I thought, well, that's a pretty easy commerce power argument."
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1324.672,1341.725,"--Well, as you say, Justice Kennedy, the government has never argued the Commerce Clause here in the sense that it has never argued that these activities have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, and it hasn't done so because of the Morrison -- the Morrison precedent."
2009.08-1224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1410.356,1420.117,"But that's -- but that's an easier case, because at least you have an interstate connection to the offensive conviction and the ground for future commitment."
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1437.984,1446.278,--The -- the essential tie to a congressional power is the tie of these people to the Federal criminal justice system because they are in Federal custody.
2009.08-1224,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1446.278,1447.495,It's that special relationship.
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1447.495,1448.728,That's -- that's right.
2009.08-1224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1463.756,1467.956,But isn't it true that this statute applies even if a person has not been a sexual offender in the past?
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1467.956,1470.969,"--It -- it does, Justice Stevens."
2009.08-1224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1473.484,1474.295,So that argument doesn't take care of that--
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1474.295,1480.855,"--Just to put some numbers on the table, there have been 103 people who have been certified under these laws."
2009.08-1224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.868,1501.25,"--No, but my point is the law applies to a person who is convicted of armed robbery or bank robbery, and just before the end of his term in prison the authorities decide he is in fact a potential sexual offender."
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1502.393,1503.174,"--Yes, yes, that's right."
2009.08-1224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1510.824,1511.421,Right.
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1511.421,1515.59,All of those people have had prior sexual convictions in their history.
2009.08-1224,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1515.59,1521.025,"But that's not -- that's not a necessary element of the -- of the statute -- under the statute, is it?"
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1521.025,1530.769,"What is necessary is two things: First, that the person in fact have engaged in sexually violent behavior or child molestation."
2009.08-1224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1557.618,1559.306,What about release from the Army?
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1571.582,1577.268,"Mr. Chief -- excuse me, Justice Scalia -- I didn't mean to promote you quite so quickly."
2009.08-1224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1577.939,1580.185,Thanks for thinking it was a promotion.
2009.08-1224,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1582.233,1584.435,And I'm sure you didn't.
2009.08-1224,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1588.76,1598.103,"Justice Scalia, I -- I do think that the military has special responsibilities with respect to those people in it."
2009.08-1224,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1633.355,1634.181,"Thank you, General."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,1640.74,1641.552,"It is, Your Honor."
2009.08-1224,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1641.552,1642.254,--Mr. DuBois.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,1642.254,1656.139,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I really think the government gives the game away a bit in its opening statement when it characterized this law as a law that was necessary to prevent the problem of releasing sexually dangerous individuals."
2009.08-1224,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1683.362,1692.764,"Do you -- Mr. DuBois, do you take that same position with respect to not guilty by reason of insanity?"
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,1714.882,1715.818,"--No, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-1224,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1761.859,1769.872,And so what's the power that the Federal Government is exercising when it commits someone who has been found not guilty by reason of insanity?
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,1769.872,1779.668,"--They are vindicating their interest in the specific criminal law which brought the individual into custody, which presumably in most cases -- in all cases, I guess -- is supported by an enumerated power."
2009.08-1224,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1788.96,1794.287,"Mr. DuBois, what is your answer to the hypothetical that General Kagan posited?"
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,1815.808,1822.618,"Well, Your Honor, I think a single individual with a single communicable disease, a defendant with tuberculosis--"
2009.08-1224,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1822.618,1822.93,Right.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,1822.93,1827.694,"--or something of that nature, I don't think would -- would call for that type of -- of Federal Government--"
2009.08-1224,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1827.694,1828.35,It may not call for it.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,1829.582,1830.1,--I would say--
2009.08-1224,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1830.1,1837.783,"--not to release him, because there -- there's strong evidence that, as soon as he gets into the society, the disease will -- will pass to others?"
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,1837.783,1844.673,"--Well, Your Honor, I would say that, in the same way that mental health is a uniquely State function, so too is public health."
2009.08-1224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.529,1856.309,We -- we have a Federal agency that's -- that deals with communicable diseases.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,1870.99,1883.906,"--I was about to say, Your Honor, you know, that's the -- that's the other I think significant difference that Justice Kennedy pointed out, that there is a clear hook to interstate commerce when we are talking about communicable diseases, and that hook is simply not present."
2009.08-1224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1883.906,1884.67,"Well, why -- why not?"
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,1932.681,1935.995,"No, Justice Breyer, I don't think the Federal Government has that power."
2009.08-1224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1935.995,1938.413,It doesn't have the power to set up hospitals?
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,1938.413,1946.037,It doesn't have the power to detain individuals as a result of their mental illness based on the fear that they are going to go out and commit a crime.
2009.08-1224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1946.037,1960.671,"In other words, if the doctors were to say, there are a thousand people here suffering from mental illness, your own daughter or mine or someone has a -- is threatening suicide or threatening murder?"
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,1978.867,1985.536,"Well, I think -- I think that would not be a very large extension, if it's an extension at all, of the holding in Morrison, that the Federal Government could not do that."
2009.08-1224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.536,1986.396,Try the Tenth Amendment.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,1986.396,1987.846,"Or the Tenth Amendment, Your Honor."
2009.08-1224,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1988.456,1999.405,"But do you -- do you think that the Congress has the power to remedy problems that are caused by the operation of the Federal prison system, caused by incarceration?"
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,1999.405,2004.202,"--That would certainly not be the case here, Your Honor."
2009.08-1224,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2018.711,2036.107,"What about the general proposition that if -- if the incarceration causes a problem, then the Federal Government has the power, ancillary to the power to operate the -- the criminal justice system, to remedy the problems that it has caused by the incarceration?"
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2036.107,2038.229,"--Well, Your Honor, I think they have a power, but it's not an unlimited power."
2009.08-1224,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2040.416,2040.993,I didn't hear.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2042.214,2044.024,"--They have a power, but it's not an unlimited power."
2009.08-1224,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2062.375,2062.675,--Because the government--
2009.08-1224,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2062.675,2065.062,Why as a matter of constitutional law does it end at that point?
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2065.062,2068.625,"Because at that point, the government has no live Federal interest."
2009.08-1224,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2077.477,2087.054,"--Well, suppose, in Justice Alito's hypothetical, he caught the communicable disease in the prison as a result of poor prison conditions."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2087.054,2096.082,"Well, and I'm sure stuff like that does happen, Justice Kennedy, and, again, the government does, while the person is in the custody of Bureau of Prisons, is entitled to--"
2009.08-1224,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2096.082,2096.519,"No, no."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2102.392,2105.53,--Because he has -- he has caught some disease--
2009.08-1224,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2105.53,2105.811,Yes.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2105.811,2106.544,--while in the system?
2009.08-1224,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2123.132,2131.505,"Well, what if the person is simply injured in prison as a result of, let's say, an attack by another prisoner, and now the sentence expires."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2144.951,2152.793,"Your Honor, I think the Federal Government would have no power to do that."
2009.08-1224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.374,2199.633,"Well, once you're down that road -- I was rather surprised, but not too surprised, that, I think perhaps with prompting, I heard you say, I think, that the Tenth Amendment would prohibit the Federal Government from setting up a system of mental care, which you'd better tell the people across the street, if that's your view."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2203.677,2206.941,--That the Federal Government cannot set up a system of--
2009.08-1224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2206.941,2211.972,Of national mental care for mentally ill people.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2211.972,2214.907,"--Well, again, that would have to--"
2009.08-1224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2214.907,2219.751,Because you either think that the Constitution prohibits that or you think it permits it.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2219.751,2224.435,"--Well, I think it would have to relate to an enumerated power, and it would have to be--"
2009.08-1224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2224.435,2226.185,"Yes, probably the Commerce Clause power."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2226.185,2227.261,--in furtherance of an enumerated power.
2009.08-1224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2227.261,2228.014,So it's fine--
2009.08-1224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2228.014,2228.887,"No, no."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2270.775,2271.743,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2009.08-1224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2271.743,2286.268,"And it seems to me that statute, combined with a letter to the elected governor, who probably wants to be re-elected, or the elected attorney general, will make it pretty certain that the State will take over the responsibility for the individual."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2286.268,2291.092,"Well, that's absolutely correct, Your Honor, and that -- and that option, which we -- we definitely believe is the best option--"
2009.08-1224,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2291.092,2295.027,"But, of course, that goes to -- that goes to the question of the wisdom of the statute."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2305.728,2307.151,"--Well, I don't know--"
2009.08-1224,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.151,2310.352,"I think that's why Congress acted, because they think there are such cases."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2310.352,2324.69,"--Well, I don't know that you can make that assumption, and to the extent that the -- the fear is that the State will decline responsibility, I do not think that Federal power can expand or contract based on a State's willingness or unwillingness to accept a responsibility--"
2009.08-1224,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.69,2336.701,But we are asked to decide a question on the assumption that there are States and there are governors who will not react to the problem of particular prisoners who are released in Arizona or some place when they originally came from Michigan or whatever it is.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2342.367,2347.912,"--Well, Your Honor -- Your Honor, I think that may be right, but there -- but there are -- the question is: What's a constitutional response to that problem?"
2009.08-1224,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2352.147,2367.499,"Absolutely, and that's why it seems to me that the constitutional answer is the same in this statute as in the case of somebody who incurs a very communicable disease and the government wants to prevent him from infecting the community."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2369.904,2382.384,"--Well, I think the different constitutional question is -- again, I do not believe the Federal government has a general quarantine power that doesn't -- that would allow it to hold prisoners past their release date."
2009.08-1224,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2397.939,2398.251,I understand.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2414.792,2422.057,"--And it seems to me that the government's argument essentially collapses into the notion, well, if it's a good idea, it must be necessary and proper to do it."
2009.08-1224,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2425.083,2427.551,It's more than the question of good idea.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2434.629,2435.659,"--Well, there--"
2009.08-1224,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2435.659,2438.766,"--The government has some responsibility, doesn't it?"
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2438.766,2443.983,"--Absolutely, the government -- the government has a responsibility, but they have certain constitutional limits that also must be respected."
2009.08-1224,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2445.028,2468.66,"Yes, but you say, if the State is unwilling to take the person, and apparently, that is the problem that precipitated 4246 and, now, 4248, and that -- you -- the Federal government is just helpless short of passing a spending measure and saying, State, if you do this, we'll give you the money."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2468.66,2469.678,--Right.
2009.08-1224,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2509.489,2510.799,"Well, he's not going to be cavalier."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2515.299,2516.734,--And he's going to--
2009.08-1224,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2516.734,2519.155,"And you want the Federal Government to have to be in the position of saying, well, we have to."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2519.155,2521.043,--Exactly.
2009.08-1224,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2528.869,2531.556,"Well, it may be the Federal Government's hard political position."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2537.663,2542.802,"--And so, in that sense, it's no decision at all because the Constitution requires that they be released."
2009.08-1224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2542.802,2558.935,"--The -- go back once more because I am obviously getting nowhere with this, but I thought that, if you set up a set of hospitals, as I think the government could do, there will be a few people, sometimes, who have to be restrained in those hospitals for themselves or others' benefit."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2574.338,2574.869,"Well, I--"
2009.08-1224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2574.869,2588.267,"You set up a prison where, in fact, occasionally, people have to be restrained for health reasons, et cetera, and just as in the other cases, sometimes that can last past the normal release date, so can it in prison."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2596.514,2599.684,"--Well, we'll just start -- I think, a couple of responses."
2009.08-1224,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2619.392,2620.453,"No, I'm not, actually."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2668.854,2684.784,"--Well, it -- it is complex, Justice Breyer, and it's also, I think, historically-the Federal Government has not historically thought to have been able to have the sort of general parens patriae power that -- that the States do enjoy to take care of the health and well-being of its citizens."
2009.08-1224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.248,2692.918,Don't -- don't States have involuntary commitment procedures?
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2692.918,2694.419,"Every State does, Your Honor."
2009.08-1224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2694.419,2716.003,"Now, couldn't the Federal Government fund a Federal -- would you find a constitutional problem in the Federal Government funding an office which brings involuntary commitment proceedings in a State where a prisoner is released when the Federal Government believes--"
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2716.003,2716.58,There would have--
2009.08-1224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2716.58,2717.77,--the prisoner is unsafe?
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2717.77,2719.361,"--There would be absolutely no problem with that, Your Honor."
2009.08-1224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.485,2732.357,"And I presume the State couldn't -- if the -- if the Court says commitment is proper, the State would have to accept the commitment, no?"
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2732.357,2733.418,"Yes, absolutely, Your Honor."
2009.08-1224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2733.418,2735.34,So why don't they do that?
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2735.34,2736.604,They should do that.
2009.08-1224,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2741.946,2745.849,I guess we can all think of a lot of different statutes Congress might have enacted.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2748.755,2750.471,"--And, Your Honor, I think that's absolutely right."
2009.08-1224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2750.471,2757.876,"Yes, but most of the argument for why this is constitutional is simply it's necessary, and therefore it's constitutional."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2759.783,2761.64,"Well, I think that's right, Your Honor."
2009.08-1224,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2776.712,2778.943,"Yes, that's one of the things that you mention in your brief."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2809.245,2815.025,"Well, the first thing they can do is act as a liaison between the individual and the State."
2009.08-1224,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2829.172,2830.719,"Well, what would the modification be?"
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2830.719,2842.84,"--Those modifications could include things like mandating mental health treatment during the term of supervised release, certain limitations on travel, certain limitations on activities with computers."
2009.08-1224,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2845.323,2858.598,"But that doesn't take care of the fact that the prisoner would be released before there was a cure found for the alleged mental illness, meaning supervised release generally has a term limit."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2858.598,2859.257,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1224,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2868.003,2901.427,"Could -- what would happen if Congress said, as part of a sentence, a judge could incorporate a civil commitment finding and say: You are going to serve X amount in jail and Y amount, and then we are going to civilly commit you indefinitely, because as of today, I am finding you a sexual predator subject to a mental illness."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2905.282,2914.45,"Well, that would not be constitutional, Justice Sotomayor, because of the indefinite nature of the commitment."
2009.08-1224,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2920.432,2927.447,"Well, I -- let's assume it incorporates all the protections of -- of this statute with respect to periodic review."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2927.447,2938.284,"--So if we have an indeterminatetype sentence where you -- you get a sentence of 10 years and you are periodically reviewed to see if you are safe to be released, of course that's constitutional."
2009.08-1224,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2938.284,2941.423,So it's constitutional because it's part of the sentence?
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2941.423,2942.546,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2009.08-1224,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2942.546,2943.077,All right.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2943.654,2944.356,It's a part of the sentence.
2009.08-1224,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2946.263,2961.552,"--Well, so that would be true whether or not you were convicted of a sex crime or a tax crime or any other crime, so long as the judge was making a finding that this was necessary to protect the public?"
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2961.552,2962.098,Sure.
2009.08-1224,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2981.966,2982.891,All right--
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2982.891,2983.671,That's why in this case it's--
2009.08-1224,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2983.671,2997.729,"--But what you're saying is, then, that the nexus is -- the nexus with the need for the criminal justice system or the proper and necessary power to address this problem ends at the point of sentencing, is what you're saying?"
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,2997.729,2998.182,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1224,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3020.623,3033.024,"Well, it says that it exists as a result of its control over this individual, its special relationship, and the fact that at the end of the sentence, it has an obligation to the public."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,3033.024,3046.131,"And -- and that really is, I think, historically, sort of an anomalous argument in the sense that civil commitment has never been thought to be part of the criminal justice system."
2009.08-1224,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3066.123,3070.884,What about someone who is incompetent to stand trial?
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,3076.555,3077.678,I believe that is correct.
2009.08-1224,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3080.836,3094.235,Does it matter that the person who has been found incompetent to stand trial has now been in custody for three times longer than the maximum sentence?
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,3094.235,3100.811,"I do not think that that is constitutionally significant, because -- well, there's a couple of reasons."
2009.08-1224,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3125.598,3137.406,"Even though it may be purely imaginary; that is, that this particular person, all of the experts agree, will never be competent to stand trial."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,3137.406,3159.192,"And I think that was the -- the logic or the trade-off in Greenwood, which was that we were not going to require courts to make finely grained determinations about whether or not this person or that person might regain competency, and just decide to have a simpler test that commitment is appropriate as long as the Federal Government's interest has not been exhausted or vindicated."
2009.08-1224,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3159.192,3182.138,Could you explain why the constitutional power that provides the basis for a Federal criminal conviction is exhausted at the end of the -- either the maximum term of imprisonment that Congress chooses to establish when it enacts the statute or at the end of the particular term that is given to this prisoner?
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,3204.829,3223.371,"Well, I think the reason, Your Honor, is that at the time of conviction and sentence, the interest in -- the official regulation of interstate commerce, say, has been vindicated by this person's conviction for doing an activity which Congress has judged to be interfering with interstate commerce."
2009.08-1224,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3223.823,3225.898,"Well, only to the extent that that's what the statute says."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,3248.765,3258.042,"--Well, Your Honor, I think Congress does have almost unlimited authority to set statutory maximums for different crimes based on their estimation of the severity of the crime."
2009.08-1224,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3281.951,3292.32,"Well, there is -- there is in the sense that the relation between the prisoner and his or her State is disrupted for, say, 15 years, and then this person is just a derelict."
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,3292.32,3297.102,"--Well, I really think that that argument the government raises is a bit of a red herring."
2009.08-1224,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3310.078,3311.407,Where do they send them?
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,3312.858,3323.325,"--The -- the default is -- as the government indicated, is the court of conviction, the place of conviction, which is probably about 90 percent of the time their home State, anyway."
2009.08-1224,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3330.508,3332.337,I want to follow up on Justice Alito's question.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,3353.921,3358.81,"--And every -- and then, following that examination, they could be then detained indefinitely?"
2009.08-1224,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3358.81,3359.184,Right.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,3360.697,3367.947,"I do not think that that would be constitutional, Your Honor, because it still would have to be part of the punishment for the crime."
2009.08-1224,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3369.772,3376.409,One of the elements of the punishment is that you are subjected to this examination that otherwise you wouldn't have to take.
2009.08-1224,1,25198,g_alan_dubois,,3383.049,3389.406,--We do not know that this statute cannot be written constitutionally.
2009.08-1224,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3428.15,3429.008,"Thank you, Mr. DuBois."
2009.08-1224,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3526.048,3433.555,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-1224,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3527.689,3528.532,"Thank you, General."
