1972.27_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,27.611,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 27 original, the State of Ohio against the State of Kentucky."
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,30.533,36.711,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.27_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,216.358,220.822,That was somewhere between the 1792 line and the present line on the north shore?
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,220.822,223.233,I am not sure Your Honor exactly what.
1972.27_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,229.111,238.348,The issue originally in this lawsuit was whether or not the low water mark on the north shore was that of 1792 or that of today.
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,238.348,240.186,That’s right; that's right.
1972.27_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,240.186,246.01,"And I suppose therefore, I would guess, I will assume that a settlement would fix the line somewhere in between those two?"
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,246.01,263.523,"Well, I have not gotten into that part of it yet at all, and I can’t say; I’m guessing that it was closer to what Ohio wanted than what Kentucky felt Ohio should get."
1972.27_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.052,704.222,"Well, did the Special Master independently hold that wholly aside from the prior adjudications or Ohio’s reaction to them that Ohio was stopped because of a long silence over a -- with respect to the boundary?"
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,704.222,708.752,"Yes sir, he had some language to that effect in his -- in his reports."
1972.27_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,708.752,711.135,Filing thesis in this Court to support it?
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,711.135,714.894,"No, he didn’t cite any cases to my --"
1972.27_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,714.894,717.732,"Well, Michigan against Wisconsin is pretty close too, wasn’t it?"
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,717.732,719.611,"Well, yes."
1972.27_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,723.34,735.768,"Well, now if he -- assume he was right in that view, but quite wrong in saying that you amend to complaint the state of cause of action."
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,747.763,752.235,I think it should.
1972.27_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,754.801,762.235,"If you knew as a matter of law that the -- that Ohio would lose, had to lose because it stopped."
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,762.235,764.422,"Well, how do we know that?"
1972.27_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.422,765.805,"Well, because I just assumed it."
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,778.061,780.386,If we were -- I would agree with that.
1972.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,784.141,800.093,"Well, didn’t the Master at Page 15 expressly say and on the basis of Kentucky’s open and continuous assertion and exercise of dominion to that point without formal objection by Ohio for more than 150 years?"
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,800.093,805.822,I don’t know where he got that except from the brief that was filed by Kentucky.
1972.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,841.644,848.128,"I gather from what you said, the proceedings from -- before Judge Foreman were limited simply to an oral argument?"
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,848.128,849.522,That’s right; that's right.
1972.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,849.522,850.235,No facts --
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,850.235,850.473,No facts.
1972.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,850.473,851.896,-- related or taken or anything else?
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,851.896,852.366,No facts.
1972.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,852.366,853.834,Just on the face of the amended complaint.
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,853.834,855.756,That’s rightl; that's right.
1972.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,855.756,861.413,Where does the fact of the 150 years acquiescence in the dominion of Kentucky?
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,862.759,866.532,It comes from one of the Kentucky’s briefs.
1972.27_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,866.532,873.395,"It’s based, however on, isn’t it on Ohio Supreme Court decisions at least in part of which --"
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,873.395,874.447,Well he --
1972.27_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,874.447,876.756,Of which the Special Master could take judicial notice of?
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,876.756,879.656,"He can take judicial notice, that’s right; that’s right."
1972.27_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,882.752,883.501,"Yes, I understand that."
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,883.501,889.76,They were not talking about the middle of the river at all or anything of that sort.
1972.27_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.205,906.265,Is it your position Mr. Howard that the issue of acquiescence over a period of 150 is basically a factual one that you would --
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,906.265,906.695,Yes.
1972.27_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,906.695,909.345,-- want to call witnesses on and have a factual determination --
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,909.345,909.887,That’s right.
1972.27_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,909.887,911.577,-- of rather than just a legal one?
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,911.577,912.808,That’s right.
1972.27_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,935.466,946.167,But if the Master is right in saying that this Court’s decision and Handly’s Lessee although not res judicata as to Ohio.
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,955.749,964.172,"Well it would, but of course the Court had the same thing in the submerged lands cases."
1972.27_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.777,1010.898,The holding of Handly's would have to be overruled?
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,1010.898,1012.549,"Yes, it would."
1972.27_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1017.92,1020.659,The rationale?
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,1020.659,1024.734,Well --
1972.27_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.734,1028.469,The reason it would give a judgment to the winner of that case would have to be --
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,1028.469,1044.784,"No sir, because the reason that land was above the high water or the low water mark anyway, and there was no reason for the Court saying anything about the middle of the river."
1972.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1057.398,1065.807,"Apparently, at the very least, we have to disapprove or reject that the tell us the statement at page 5 from Handly, wouldn’t it?"
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,1065.807,1066.904,"Yes, sir; yes sir."
1972.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1066.904,1070.252,But when as in this case ones there is a recent proprietor to --
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,1070.252,1071.064,"Yes, sir."
1972.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1071.064,1072.886,"That would have to be rejected, disapproved --"
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,1072.886,1073.714,That’s right.
1972.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1073.714,1079.252,And that is the reason they gave the court between their judgments.
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,1081.89,1087.572,"Yes, that’s the reason they gave, yes."
1972.27_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1164.252,1166.501,"It’s always a good time to stop, counsel."
1972.27_orig,0,31058,joseph_m_howard,,1167.966,1214.23,"Oh, right. [Laughter]"
1972.27_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1214.23,1216.843,Mr. Famularo.
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1216.843,1220.694,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1536.571,1541.233,"Now, correct me now Mr. Famularo if I’m confused."
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1545.691,1548.606,This is true Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1548.606,1561.246,Hasn’t the Court historically been rather generous in allowing amendments particularly in actions between the states?
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1561.246,1564.713,"Certainly, the courts have been lenient in this regard, Your Honor."
1972.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1598.572,1611.157,Do you have anything to suggest about the scope of the factual matter that would have to be dealt with if an amendment should be allowed?
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1611.157,1620.513,"Without going outside the record, Your Honor, I think it suffice it to say that it would be a totally and completely burdensome task."
1972.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1651.828,1666.904,"Really, what the Special Master did here was tantamount to allowing a motion to amend the complaint and dismissing the amended complaint for failure to state of claim for relief, wasn’t it, because it was legally barred?"
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1666.904,1679.91,"Yes, this is correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist, basically what the Special Master did was that reasoning more to the theory of acquiescence than to our initial theory here of the immateriality of any alleged defect in Virginia."
1972.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1679.91,1683.008,"But, it was sort of a demurrer approach, was it not?"
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1683.008,1684.196,"Yes, it was Your Honor."
1972.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1684.196,1689.817,And then he acted on that theory.
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1689.817,1697.281,"Right, he stated the theory of acquiescence to give validity to this argument and to set forth the rational."
1972.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1698.006,1711.208,"Well, I suppose the -- it’s a little hard to conceptualize in a normal lawsuit, let's say, bring a file a complaint and alleging a promise without consideration to give me a thousand dollars."
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1728.94,1729.414,"This is true, Your Honor."
1972.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1729.414,1731.884,Assuming all the facts to be true.
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1735.183,1735.914,This is true Mr. Justice.
1972.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1735.914,1738.388,And here assuming all the facts to be true.
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1754.013,1755.858,That is basically our contention.
1972.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1755.858,1766.51,"But it still, I suppose that the complaint as a release to the technical, logical, symmetrical matter should have been allowed to be filed, shouldn’t it?"
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1785.389,1787.085,"Yes Mr. Justice, subject to the demurrer."
1972.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1787.085,1788.242,Subject to a demurrer or a motion to dismiss.
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1788.242,1789.534,Subject to the motion to dismiss.
1972.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1789.534,1789.999,Right.
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1789.999,1791.642,"However, it must be --"
1972.27_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1791.642,1806.977,"You said a while ago that according to your case was that as the matter of law, even accepted the allegation as true that the dedication by Virginia been accepted by the United States as a matter of law ended the matter."
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1806.977,1809.713,This is true.
1972.27_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.873,1816.237,"That is what the Special Master held, that was it."
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1816.237,1817.867,He did not reject this theory.
1972.27_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1817.867,1820.83,"Well, he did it on all of the (Inaudible)?"
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1820.83,1821.329,"No, it’s not."
1972.27_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.571,1839.547,"Well, perhaps it’s that -- perhaps in the holding of the ground that we just discussed just this moment, shouldn’t you complaint that that have been allowed to be filed, to be amended?"
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1839.547,1859.496,"Since this was an original proceeding Mr. Justice White, I think the technical rules actually are not followed and this Court looks to them for guidance, if indeed this were the typical lawsuit between the average parties then in all likelihood exactly what you’re saying would be correct."
1972.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1876.785,1896.044,"There was a case, I just have remembered argued about my second to third day here in the Court back 1958, it's reported in 358 U.S. Page 64, California against Washington, and that was an argument on a motion to file a bill of complaint."
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1932.248,1933.855,I think that is -- that's a sound --
1972.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1933.855,1936.596,That’s 358 U.S. Page 64.
1972.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1936.596,1946.25,"Mr. Famularo, what is this counterclaim that you mentioned earlier that you would have -- I gather Kentucky you said will have to file if the amended complaint?"
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1946.25,1956.14,"Yes, it would be a counterclaim basically for expenditures over all of the years Mr. Justice Brennan in excess of the middle of the river to the far side."
1972.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1957.197,1963.614,"You’d have to make that kind of record in the event that Ohio should prevail and its claim to the middle of the river, is that it?"
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1963.614,1965.463,That’s right.
1972.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1984.891,1993.144,"Well, you would file the counterclaim I gather, but would you have to try it until the issue of the location of the boundary line is settled?"
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1993.144,1994.378,Would we have to try the counterclaim?
1972.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1994.378,1997.345,"Counterclaim, yes."
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,1997.345,2005.605,"No, in all likelihood we would not because of the expenditures would be for the area line north of the river and to the northern shore."
1972.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2005.605,2043.614,"Mr. Famularo, to take Justice Stewart’s hypothetical a moment ago, in a common law of Court where you file a complaint that doesn’t state a claim for a relief as an amendment, but the Court simply denies relief to file it, then and you appeal, and on appeal, the court were to say, well he should have been given leave to file his complaint, but we see that it doesn’t state any state of claim that we would grant relief even conceding the facts, would the Appellate Court do you think reverse and say, even though it would have done in no good, you should have been allowed to file a complaint of whether to affirm on other grounds?"
1972.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2043.614,2052.654,It seems to me that that to reverse and say that they should have been allowed to file would be going around the circle of the matter.
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2077.656,2079.152,Well certainly --
1972.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2079.152,2087.971,"Obviously, it’s an economical and an efficient proceeding, but litigation isn’t always efficient."
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2087.971,2109.75,"Certainly, the right of the Trial Court to grant an amendment Mr. Chief Justice would be infringed upon how that right is not absolute and there are various motions to be filed for leave of court in which the grounds are spelled out, and certainly this Court is aware."
1972.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2132.786,2155.33,"But the very holding of the reviewing court in this common law hypothetical case, the very theory of the Appellate Court’s action might put the parties, the party on notice as to how he might appropriately amend his complaint."
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2155.33,2159.085,This is true.
1972.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2177.521,2186.038,"I suppose that one basic difference is that we, unlike an appellate court in a state common law system, have plenary power."
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2187.646,2188.52,That’s true.
1972.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2195.094,2211.04,"Well often though that cuts when the controversies between two states as the Chief Justice suggested earlier, to give considerable attitude to the States to have their claims determined when the controversy with the sister state."
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2211.04,2221.848,"This is true Mr. Justice Brennan, but we submit that in a close examination of the facts before this Court as little as they may be at this point."
1972.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2230.615,2239.129,Would you say the same thing if you were defending of the recommendation of the Special Master on the basis of the acquiescence in which he relied?
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2239.129,2242.027,I am going to get into that right now and we will say the same thing.

1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2265.784,2266.868,"Exactly, those two things."

1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2380.969,2394.6,"Well, this would be true but on the river, it would be extremely difficult to ascertain where the boundary of Ohio stops or where the boundary of, let’s say, Illinois or Indiana starts."
1972.27_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.155,2416.403,Isn’t that true in Mississippi between Illinois and Missouri?
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2418.388,2425.144,"It would be, but such does not make the result anymore correct."

1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2507.208,2522.99,We submit that Ohio based upon its long delay and more importantly based upon the continuous dominion by the Commonwealth of Kentucky should not be allowed at this point to change its total theory.
1972.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2522.99,2533.36,"Well, this was all done, all this acquiescence and all this delay and all this judicial admission was done under the compulsion of Ohio’s understanding of the existing law in this Court."
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2543.668,2547.461,"Well, we submit that such should not be done, Your Honor based upon --"
1972.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2547.461,2550.483,Without a solid historic foundation.
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2550.483,2562.197,We submit that such should not be done based upon our first argument that even if they have this attempt that it will fail as a matter of law as the Special Master held to state a cause of action.

1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2567.04,2567.666,That’s right.
1972.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2567.666,2568.719,-- in accepting the decision.
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2568.719,2573.327,And in no way has that reasoning been detracted from by any decision.
1972.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2573.346,2584.396,"Well, I know but in Handly’s that was the interpretation given or the effect given the session plus the congressional legislation."
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2584.396,2586.297,And specifically determined about --
1972.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2586.297,2589.574,"I suppose even that could be reconsidered, couldn't it?"
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2589.574,2590.84,The intentions of Congress and --
1972.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2590.84,2593.178,Couldn't it?
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2593.178,2604.821,"I suppose it could be, but again we fall back upon our first argument that that such would be to inject in this proceeding at this time an immaterial point."
1972.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2604.821,2616.016,"Incidentally, what’s left of this controversy between Ohio and Kentucky if we accept the Special Master’s recommendation?"
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2616.016,2626.234,"If the Special Master’s recommendation was accepted, Mr. Justice Brennan, it would leave the litigation in the State of the original complaint being filed and our answer being filed."

1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2632.22,2634.553,Or whether it’s the present low water mark.
1972.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2636.866,2637.778,Yes.
1972.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2637.778,2652.927,"What’s the -- may I ask, what is the practical significance outside of criminal and some other jurisdiction, and has gas been discovered up around portions and so on?"
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2652.927,2666.693,"Outside of the record, Your Honor, my understanding of it is that, there has been some minerals found in and around the Henderson area which is across of Evansville, Indiana."
1972.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2666.693,2670.464,"That’s Indiana, I mean east of the Great Miami River."

1972.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2696.334,2697.749,"No, that’s the original lawsuit."
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2697.749,2701.864,That’s right.
1972.27_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2737.638,2744.613,I thought we heard in the other side that they wanted to challenge that factually.
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2744.613,2746.285,They do; they do Mr. Justice White.
1972.27_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2746.285,2749.897,"Well, then you can’t say undisputed, can you?"
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2749.897,2753.51,"What’s undisputed, we submit, is a matter of law."
1972.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2774.886,2776.857,Well supposing we can judicially notice it.
1972.27_orig,1,30295,john_m_famularo,,2792.64,2803.478,"Well, certainly we submit that it is more than enough evidence to establish that any attempt of Ohio to now say that the boundary is in the middle, is improper at this time."
1972.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2866.932,2868.615,Thank you Mr. Famularo.
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,2871.261,2871.655,"Yes, sir."
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2979.419,2986.593,"Well, I guess those contracts were written after the amended complaint and this case was offered, weren't they?"
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,2986.593,2991.432,"I think some of them were written prior to that time Your Honor, I am not sure of that."
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2993.296,3001.741,"Could you -- as I understood your -- what you told us about the history of litigation -- this original complaint was filed when, back in 1965?"
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3001.741,3003.088,1966.
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3003.088,3003.644,66 --
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3003.644,3005.113,Yes.
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3005.113,3033.024,"Then by reason of a change of administration or other reasons, people in your office looked at it and there was nobody familiar with it and you began to study of it and then and only then back four or five years after the original complaint was filed that this theory was discovered or evolved or of whatever that, there was a basis of the amended complaint and that that was the first time I --"
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3033.024,3039.677,May I say that the prior administration was familiar with this argument.
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3039.677,3040.471,With the argument?
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3040.471,3041.228,That’s right.
1972.27_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3101.722,3109.55,What kinds of proofs would you have in mind to offering in support of the middle of the river line?
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3109.55,3124.254,"Well, we have lined up all the documentary evidence, which shows to me conclusively that Virginia had no title on the north and the west side of the river."
1972.27_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3193.577,3201.733,"Well, what about the acts of the Congress in recognizing this and accepting it?"
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3201.733,3202.98,Which --
1972.27_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3202.98,3211.65,As I understood the Kentucky’s position there had been acts of the Congress in connection with the session by Virginia to the United States.
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3211.65,3220.535,"Your Honor, those acts simply mentioned the Ohio River is a boundary."
1972.27_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3228.59,3238.375,Are you -- who owns the -- you have gone to the extent of saying that Ohio belongs to some other declaration.
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3238.375,3241.129,No; no.
1972.27_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3241.569,3248.477,"You are saying that, you argue that Congress accepted the session?"
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3248.477,3251.704,Well let’s go back at the time of the revolution.
1972.27_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3291.896,3301.874,"Well, isn’t it that United States act was  though -- it was as if it acquired the land from the State?"
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3301.874,3307.395,The Continental Congress controlled the Northwest Territory right from the start.
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3332.904,3334.843,"That was the Treaty of Greenbelt, wasn’t it?"
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3334.843,3336.754,"That was the last one, the latest one."
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3339.261,3344.683,"The Northwest Territory, I’d always understood, was the land lying north of the Ohio River?"
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3344.683,3352.047,"That’s true, but there was also a Southeast Territory, which was the land lying south and east to the river, Tennessee and Kentucky."
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3352.047,3352.634,Right.
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3352.634,3360.724,"And if you look through the early acts of Congress, that’s all they referred to, the land north and west to the river and the land south and east of it."
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3360.724,3361.198,And it’s your claim there was the --
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3361.198,3365.156,"There was never, never any attempt to draw a line in the river."
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3365.156,3367.497,A session by Virginia in 1784 was a --
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3367.497,3368.736,They didn’t have anything to see.
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3368.736,3371.562,-- was a kind of a quick claim deed but it wasn’t --
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3371.562,3373.109,"That’s right, they gave up their claim."
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3373.109,3375.232,"Whatever it may have, then and you say they didn’t have anything to see."
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3375.232,3377.514,"They didn't have -- they had no title, that’s right."
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3377.514,3378.408,I understand your argument.
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3378.408,3379.763,That's right.
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3379.763,3382.087,And that John Marshall was wrong in thinking that they --
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3382.087,3383.813,"Yes, sir; yes sir."
1972.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3383.813,3385.302,Right. [Laughter]
1972.27_orig,2,31058,joseph_m_howard,,3385.302,3385.693,Thank you.
1972.27_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3385.693,3387.522,Thank you Mr. Attorney General.
