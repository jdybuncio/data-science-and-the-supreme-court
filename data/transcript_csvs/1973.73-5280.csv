1973.73-5280,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,26.948,"We will hear arguments next in 73-5280, Fuller against Oregon."
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,29.455,32.787,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1973.73-5280,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,195.273,201.584,Does the record have any empirical data to that effect Mr. Kuhn?
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,201.584,203.136,Our record has none at all.
1973.73-5280,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,216.087,221.22,But was this speculation on the part of the California Court then in the Allen case?
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,221.22,222.168,This was in the Allen case.
1973.73-5280,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,223.452,225.468,Was it speculation on the part have occurred?
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,225.468,232.555,"It was and it was based upon that, that it would be a chilling effect."
1973.73-5280,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,242.955,252.419,"Well except that, I gather under our cases, a criminal trial could not proceed without counsel to represent the case, coult it?"
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,252.419,254.482,"A counsel can be waived Your Honor, yes."
1973.73-5280,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,262.01,270.166,"What if the man says on arraignment, I got $50,000.00 in the bank, but I will be downed if I will use it to hire a lawyer with?"
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,275.459,277.112,"No, I do not Your Honor."
1973.73-5280,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,347.571,355.696,"Mr. Kuhn, if suppose you did not have your Oregon statute, could a Court on its own impose this is a condition of probation?"
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,355.696,365.758,"I believe that without the statute under the decisions of Oregon, I believe it could as an inherent power of the sentencing court."
1973.73-5280,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,365.758,375.561,"So, is it your position then that a court must in every case prior to trial advice counsel that this is a possibility as to what it might do?"
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,375.561,376.297,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-5280,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,378.323,380.2,At least without the statute now?
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,380.2,380.909,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1973.73-5280,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,380.909,383.118,Even without the presence of your statute?
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,383.118,404.329,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe that as long as the petitioner or defendant is subject to the criminal statutes of repayment as a condition of probation that in order to fully ensure an understanding as to his right to counsel, that at the time the court must inform him of this possible liability."
1973.73-5280,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,404.329,405.382,Let me start all over again.
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,423.38,424.071,Oh! I am sorry.
1973.73-5280,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,438.137,448.808,"Then my next question was, then must the court in every criminal case so advice the defendant?"
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,448.808,451.132,"Yes, my answer is the same."
1973.73-5280,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,461.309,465.988,"And if he does not, then the condition may not be imposed?"
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,465.988,469.729,"That is our position, yes."
1973.73-5280,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,482.675,486.121,Did you say how often when this condition is imposed?
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,486.121,491.812,"It's -- this is -- perhaps, this is the first case I have heard about in Oregon, You Honor, this one here."
1973.73-5280,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,498.124,499.283,In every case or --
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,499.283,500.08,Not in every case.
1973.73-5280,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,501.128,504.998,Whether the criteria was determined whether this should be imposed?
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,504.998,508.828,That I am not clear on it.
1973.73-5280,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,523.222,525.626,And does the practice differ among judges too?
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,525.626,526.081,"Yes, it does Your Honor."
1973.73-5280,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,526.081,527.467,Some do and some wont?
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,527.467,531.046,That's correct and within the same county.
1973.73-5280,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,531.046,544.082,"Mr. Kuhn, what are the elements of court cost that may be imposed on a convicted defendant under the Oregon statute, in addition to counsel?"
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,544.082,577.971,"In addition to counsel, I believe that the statute is worded to the effect that costs cannot include, those costs that are inherent in affording the defendant, his right to jury trial such as subpoenas, jury fees, fees and cost of the district attorney are not included."
1973.73-5280,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,580.289,584.088,Not very substantial then I take it from what you describe.
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,584.088,587.449,"It could be the possible cost Your Honor, if --"
1973.73-5280,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,587.449,587.998,Now what --
1973.73-5280,0,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,587.998,594.498,"-- the experts, investigators, are hired such as here, as Judge Fort pointed out in his dissenting opinion."
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1528.804,1532.628,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.73-5280,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1589.203,1590.858,It was a Federal Judge?
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1590.858,1596.375,"No, it's a District Judge in the County in Northern Oregon."
1973.73-5280,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1600.141,1601.228,But he also had the statute?
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1601.228,1603.619,He also had the statute which he didn't even know about it.
1973.73-5280,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1669.797,1672.169,This happens when at the initial appearance?
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1672.169,1676.521,"At the initial -- The initial appearance, that's right."
1973.73-5280,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1684.775,1688.53,How soon after the arrest does this usually take place in Oregon?
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1688.53,1691.733,"Well, a decision on it's release has to be made within 36 hours."
1973.73-5280,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1716.034,1720.655,"Well is the arraignment -- the arraignment is not the same as initial appearance, is it?"
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1720.655,1723.88,Not always; not always; no.
1973.73-5280,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1738.124,1740.156,That's information you don't have indictment or something?
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1740.156,1748.11,We have indictments but normally speaking the individual who's been arrested is appearing before an inferior magistrate at that time and the Grand Jury has no time to proceed yet.
1973.73-5280,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1753.895,1754.308,And then he is bound over?
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1754.308,1756.339,"And then he is bound over, that's right."
1973.73-5280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1816.537,1818.412,How did they fix the amount?
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1821.761,1826.037,$375.00 as investigator's fees.
1973.73-5280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1852.903,1860.372,"Well, in those other cases where the conditions have been imposed, is there any criterion by which they fix the amount?"
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1860.372,1861.126,"Yes, sir there is."
1973.73-5280,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1876.202,1880.911,"Does it depend, for example, on whether there's a guilty plea or whether there is a trial or how long the trial is?"
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1880.911,1881.287,That's right.
1973.73-5280,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1891.128,1910.126,"Mr. Gillette, in your addendum, I noticed that for Multnomah County, which I assume is by far the most populous county in the State, the answer is, yes they do utilize the system but there's nobody making payment and there has been nothing collected in 1973, is there anything peculiar about Multnomah?"
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1910.126,1912.769,The peculiarity of Multnomah County is they wouldn't talk to me.
1973.73-5280,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1916.854,1919.661,"Well that's the big metropolitan part of the States, isn't it?"
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1919.661,1920.994,"That's right, that's Portland."
1973.73-5280,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1920.994,1929.045,"And so they probably have more important things to do, more important things to do than trying to enforce the statute."
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1929.045,1931.263,"My experience has been that, that at least is their judgment."
1973.73-5280,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1933.12,1939.599,"Well you're not making the zero under the number of individuals personally making payment, and it only means that you do not know the answer."
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1939.599,1941.0,That's right; that's right.
1973.73-5280,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1943.223,1946.915,And at least one other place you do have a zero which I take it is a positive answer.
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1946.915,1947.348,That's right.
1973.73-5280,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1949.628,1954.807,"Did you say that $9,000.00 some dollars was the total amount collected in the whole State in one year?"
1973.73-5280,1,24850,gillette,,1954.807,1967.558,"No, $9220 was the total amount collected in Clackamas County, which is a bedroom county adjacent to Multnomah County based upon I think 30 or 40 individuals paying."
1973.73-5280,2,31364,j_marvin_kuhn,,2428.458,2429.534,"Nothing further, Your Honor."
1973.73-5280,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2429.534,2430.164,Thank you gentlemen.
