1986.85-1722,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.891,"We will now hear argument No. 85-1722, Edward O'Lone versus the Estate of Ahmad Uthman Shabazz and another respondent."
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,15.259,18.294,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1986.85-1722,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,107.451,119.675,"Ms. Hodian, was the Third Circuit's new test in this case applicable just to free exercise of religion claims on behalf of the prisoners, or was it across the board; do you know?"
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,119.675,123.377,"Of course, only a free exercise claim was raised here."
1986.85-1722,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.894,251.127,"Excuse me, Ms. Hodian."
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,259.0,260.45,"No, Your Honor, I'm not saying--"
1986.85-1722,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,260.45,263.2,"I thought that's what you just said, that they don't have to show affirmatively."
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,263.2,273.424,--That the activity would definitely jeopardize... the regulated activity would definitely jeopardize the security of the institution.
1986.85-1722,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,281.878,282.696,All right.
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,282.696,292.552,We submit that this same analysis that was applied by this Court in the controlling cases should apply to free exercise claims as well.
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,306.561,312.382,May I ask at that point: Do you think all free exercise claims should be analyzed in precisely the same way?
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,318.536,325.857,The standard should still be a reasonable relationship test to legitimate penalogical objectives.
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,337.164,343.734,"Well, let's specifically say that here you have a religious ceremony that is claimed to be an important part of the religion of the inmate."
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,357.828,372.588,"Your Honor, there may be some differences permitted within the reasonable relationship test, but it is very difficult for prison administrators to evaluate the claims of prisoners, in terms of how important it is to their religious beliefs."
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,403.357,416.081,"What if the parameters are that the work schedule is everybody has to work outside the main facility from 9:00 to 5:00 every day, and that we can show that it's much easier to control the population if we do it that way."
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,427.488,435.011,"--Well, as long as it is not considered an exaggerated response and the prisoners do have the opportunity--"
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,435.011,438.196,It's cheaper; they need less guards; and they can keep count of people much easier.
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,454.29,471.251,"--If the showing the prison officials have made... and if the Court is able to determine that those security measures are reasonably related to... if the measures are reasonably related to security, then it probably would pass constitutional muster."
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,488.543,494.846,But it seems to me these things probably boil down to how many guards you need on duty at particular times and places.
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,517.426,519.878,It may not be an answer in every case.
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,526.632,527.734,"Well, say ten guards."
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,531.77,533.221,--I'm not so sure--
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,533.221,535.104,"It seems to me it's always a matter of economics, isn't it?"
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,535.104,538.423,"--I'm not so sure it's always a matter of economics, Your Honor."
1986.85-1722,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,584.737,587.522,"Ms. Hodian, New Jersey still has a legislature, doesn't it?"
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,587.522,588.539,Yes.
1986.85-1722,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.539,595.378,"They're not likely to allow the prisons to operate seven days a week without any church services for any of the inmates, are they?"
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,595.378,596.545,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1722,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,598.164,605.151,"Prison administrators generally like the prisoners to go to church services, I would think, unless your religion is satanism."
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,610.269,611.388,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1722,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,639.204,645.108,Could I ask: How does your practice compare with that in a federal prison?
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,654.147,664.336,"Your Honor, the Solicitor General did append the Federal Bureau of Prisons' regulations regarding religious accommodation."
1986.85-1722,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,697.807,701.861,"Well, I think there's greater accommodation on the federal side than there is in New Jersey."
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,701.861,705.897,--I'm not so sure I agree.
1986.85-1722,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.599,711.365,"Well, this isn't a New Jersey-wide rule, is it?"
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,719.371,720.704,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
1986.85-1722,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,720.704,722.071,So this isn't a New Jersey-wide rule.
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,723.489,729.977,"No, it was a policy that the Leesburg officials instituted to meet the problems that were facing them on a regular basis."
1986.85-1722,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,740.2,742.7,"Well, is there any limit to your position?"
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,749.39,750.856,"No, Your--"
1986.85-1722,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,750.856,752.592,That's the rule of 75 years ago.
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,752.592,753.625,"--No, Your Honor."
1986.85-1722,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,777.291,779.374,Ms. Hodian--
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,784.61,785.96,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1722,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,788.662,789.812,What do you think of it?
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,789.812,792.597,"Well, we have problems with that decision."
1986.85-1722,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,842.197,860.324,"Ms. Hodian, in determining the reasonableness of the rule under your standard, do you think there's room for courts to examine and consider the existence of obvious and less burdensome alternatives?"
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,860.324,864.812,"To a certain extent, Your Honor, that can be part of the analysis."
1986.85-1722,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,870.216,879.655,"You would have to do that, wouldn't you, if you agree that the prison official has to show it's not an exaggerated response?"
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,879.655,880.622,Exactly.
1986.85-1722,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,880.622,889.76,"Wouldn't the prison official have to show that there isn't... I mean, if there's something much less drastic that could be done, he'd have to show there wasn't such a thing."
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,889.76,890.962,"Yes, that's correct."
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.962,900.835,"But does the warden have to show that the security concerns are genuine, or does he just have to assert them, in your view?"
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,900.835,906.639,The warden can't make conclusionary statements about security.
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,910.341,911.307,That they're genuine.
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,917.245,935.824,"I think under St. Claire, still the security goals... the security objectives have to be real, but they do not have to be very immediate; and they don't have to show a past problem, a past history of security concerns, or that these particular inmates have a proclivity to unruly conduct."
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,935.824,944.764,"But Judge Adams said that under St. Claire, the state was under no burden to establish that such security concerns were genuine and were based on more than speculation."
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,950.084,955.905,I'm not sure that I would agree with Judge Adams' interpretation of St. Claire.
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,991.495,993.578,Whenever he is arguably correct?
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,993.578,994.363,Yes.
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,994.363,998.399,"That means he can make a good argument for his position, whether the facts support it or not, I suppose."
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,998.399,1004.303,"Well, I think the facts would have to support his opinion."
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1004.303,1008.604,I must confess: I have some difficulty knowing exactly what we're supposed to decide in this case.
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,1026.749,1041.142,"Well, Your Honor, the Third Circuit's new standard does not permit the amount of deference to opinions of prison officials that this Court says should be granted to their opinions."
1986.85-1722,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1050.498,1053.533,"Well, Jones and Pell are the controlling cases in this Court, aren't they?"
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,1059.152,1060.437,"Yes, Your Honor; that's correct."
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1192.02,1198.173,Isn't it true that if the facts as you describe them are correct... and I'm sure that they are... that you would prevail on remand under Judge Adams' standard?
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,1198.173,1202.727,"We're really not sure if we would prevail, Your Honor."
1986.85-1722,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.727,1206.929,"It seems to me you would, given what you've just described."
1986.85-1722,0,34607,laurie_m_hodian,,1206.929,1217.503,"Despite these findings of fact, Judge Adams seemed to indicate that the prison officials would have to show more than they had already shown."
1986.85-1722,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1217.503,1220.772,"Thank you, Ms. Hodian."
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1222.657,1232.68,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1722,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1250.908,1253.208,xxx reasonably related?
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1253.208,1253.926,--That's correct.
1986.85-1722,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1253.926,1258.228,What do you consider in determining that?
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1259.747,1260.73,Well--
1986.85-1722,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1260.73,1267.401,"Is the existence of an obvious, less burdensome alternative something you obviously would be considering?"
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1267.401,1267.784,--Yes.
1986.85-1722,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1267.784,1268.353,And what else?
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1268.353,1269.186,--It certainly is.
1986.85-1722,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1269.186,1270.653,The alternatives?
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1270.653,1277.375,"The alternatives, whether the response was an exaggerated one."
1986.85-1722,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.94,1445.933,"May I ask: If you agree that the response is exaggerated, it can't be... I'm not sure the difference between the least restrictive response and the most exaggerated... I'm having trouble stating it."
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1452.92,1456.705,"No, I think there has to be more than that."
1986.85-1722,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1456.705,1458.072,What does it mean to say it's an exaggerated response?
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1458.072,1466.811,"Well, this Court has said in Bell and in Block versus Rutherford that the fact that there is a better way of doing things does not suffice."
1986.85-1722,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1469.263,1471.179,Of course those are not free exercise cases.
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1472.548,1476.667,"No, but I think that the analysis has to be the same."
1986.85-1722,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1490.092,1490.842,Yes.
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1490.842,1497.33,"So I think that the analysis should be the same, at lease within the First Amendment."
1986.85-1722,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.865,1512.173,"But you don't have this exaggerated problem in those other areas, do you, the problem of saying that the response was exaggerated because you basically just asked whether the regulation is reasonable."
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1513.689,1514.189,--No.
1986.85-1722,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1557.347,1564.936,"Well, Mr. Clegg, isn't there some danger of just picking up phrases from out of various opinions and treating them as if they were constitutional doctrine?"
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1576.16,1576.777,Yes.
1986.85-1722,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1577.527,1583.48,--but as simply a logical inquiry as to whether something is reasonably related to a penalogical concern.
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1583.48,1593.705,"That's correct, and that's why I say that the way we see the test as working is that the prison officials first show that it is reasonably related to a legitimate penalogical interest."
1986.85-1722,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1593.705,1603.328,"Then do we really need a handbook to say, first, the prison officials say this; then the prisoners go... I mean, as if it's Stage 1, 2, 3, 4?"
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1603.328,1603.661,No.
1986.85-1722,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1603.661,1612.85,"Again, if the test is reasonably related to a legitimate penalogical concern, presumably, judges and lawyers can figure out how a case like that should proceed."
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1612.85,1613.417,That's correct.
1986.85-1722,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1626.591,1627.507,Let me ask--
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1627.507,1627.757,--That is something--
1986.85-1722,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1627.757,1647.153,"--what if the prisoner comes in and shows what he claims to be an equally, but less burdensome, alternative to serve the penalogical interest, and the prison official says,"
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1671.451,1678.588,--The inquiry is whether or not that rule is reasonable.
1986.85-1722,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.373,1765.312,"Of course, since you're urging the same test under not just the religion clause but all other clauses, that argument sort of goes down the tubes."
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1765.312,1766.562,"Well, it doesn't go down the tubes."
1986.85-1722,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1766.562,1768.114,Except in the religion case.
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1768.114,1773.834,It should give you some reassurance in the religion context.
1986.85-1722,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1775.801,1781.088,"Well, are you proposing a sort of reasonableness test with teeth for the prisoner?"
1986.85-1722,1,38947,roger_clegg,,1787.059,1787.576,"--Yes, yes."
1986.85-1722,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1820.899,1822.499,"Thank you, Mr. Clegg."
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,1825.101,1829.053,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1986.85-1722,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1875.634,1879.586,"Mr. Katz, you say that religious services have been allowed in prisons for 200 years."
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,1923.347,1928.815,"Your Honor, this service has unique religious content to it."
1986.85-1722,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1928.815,1929.667,I understand.
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,1949.379,1958.502,"Your Honor, it may put more demands on the system, but this religious service is, at that time, is central to the Muslim faith."
1986.85-1722,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1983.052,1983.619,I understand.
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,1995.693,1999.312,"Your Honor, with all due respect, this service was accommodated by the state."
1986.85-1722,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.941,2178.928,"Wasn't one of the objections the alternate work detail, some people would prefer the alternate work, and the prisons had had trouble--"
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2178.928,2184.415,"Your Honor, the alternate work was not an effort to avoid work; the alternate work was cutting wood."
1986.85-1722,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.453,2208.428,"--Wasn't one of the objections that the institution found it penalogically unsound to have gangs or teams of one group, whether they were all fundamentalist Christians or all Moslems or all blacks or all whites or anything else?"
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2210.846,2219.401,"--Your Honor, there is no evidence in this record, frankly, that their concern was related to this alternate work detail."
1986.85-1722,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2230.442,2240.815,We can't accept what seems like a reasonable judgment by penal officials until they try it and on the specific detail there is a riot or somebody killed?
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2240.815,2241.917,"--Not at all, Your Honor."
1986.85-1722,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2323.052,2332.075,"Well, then, Mr. Katz, why should it make a difference that those cases didn't involve free exercise claims if they involved some other claim under the First Amendment?"
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2332.075,2335.509,"--I think we need... I think that's just the beginning of the analysis, Your Honor."
1986.85-1722,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2335.509,2338.913,"Well, why does it... I asked you, why does it make a difference."
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2339.53,2347.686,"It makes a difference, Your Honor, if the difference is a time, place and manner regulation, which those cases involved, in a free exercise claim."
1986.85-1722,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2352.388,2357.208,"Well, has it applied different standards to free speech claims as opposed to free exercise claims?"
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2357.208,2364.612,"Has this... under... it has, to free speech claims that were time, place and manner regulations, certainly."
1986.85-1722,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2456.954,2462.458,"You say it's not a time, place and manner regulation, but again, that may be largely a matter of description."
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2471.581,2474.266,"--With all due respect, Your Honor, that's not what they said."
1986.85-1722,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2494.478,2497.948,"Well, it said, we're not going to bring a gang in from outside for a midday service."
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2497.948,2511.671,"--With all due respect, Your Honor, it said we are not going to permit the alternate work detail to continue, and we are not going to permit minimum security inmates to come back on their own to attend the service, where that service has posed no problems; and--"
1986.85-1722,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2511.671,2514.707,"Well, why isn't that a time, place and manner regulation?"
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2514.707,2540.441,"--Because it seems to me, Your Honor, and I can't believe that this Court has ever recognized... not that it couldn't do it here... but I don't think that this Court has ever recognized the notion of a time, place and manner regulation in a free exercise context, where you're talking about a particular service that has unique religious content, and that religious content is predicated upon holding the service at a particular time during the day."
1986.85-1722,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2564.973,2566.175,It's not saying that initially.
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2583.637,2585.42,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1986.85-1722,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2717.854,2721.056,"We're not called upon to decide those facts, are we?"
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2721.056,2721.722,"--No, no."
1986.85-1722,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.356,2726.224,We're just called upon to decide what test shall be applied to those facts.
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2739.28,2740.299,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1986.85-1722,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2772.084,2776.186,xxx the least restrictive alternative?
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2776.186,2781.423,I do not read the opinion as requiring a least restrictive alternative.
1986.85-1722,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2792.931,2809.875,"Well, the opinion appeared to say that the prison officials had to establish that no reasonable method to accommodate the respondents' religious exercise could be achieved without security problems, in effect."
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2809.875,2816.796,"--It said... and you need to emphasize the word ""reasonable"", and it was talking about a reasonable method."
1986.85-1722,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2878.833,2890.874,Who... how do you understand the Third Circuit would... how would it apply this reasonable methods of accommodation test in terms of the burden of proof?
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2902.182,2907.253,"As I read the opinion, Your Honor, it seems to me that the Third Circuit put that burden on the state."
1986.85-1722,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.253,2913.49,"The state must show there is no other reasonable way, or must a prisoner demonstrate that there is a reasonable way?"
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2913.49,2918.524,It seems to me that the state... it seems to me that the state faces--
1986.85-1722,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2918.524,2919.976,"Disproving a negative is pretty hard, isn't it?"
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2919.976,2922.476,"--Well, it seems to me that the state faced with the alternative--"
1986.85-1722,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2922.476,2922.792,Proving a negative.
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2922.792,2927.214,--I understand what... what you're referring to.
1986.85-1722,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2987.753,2990.12,Substantial evidence is less than a preponderance of the evidence.
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,2990.12,3002.845,"--Substantial evidence, I believe, as the Third Circuit stated in Cole, which was a subsequent decision, is a greater burden than the preponderance of the evidence."
1986.85-1722,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3193.57,3217.186,"I think your opponent's point is that to the extent that the benefits that have to be given upon the assertion of a religious claims are increased, the incentive to assert false religious claims will be increased."
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,3245.285,3251.189,It's certainly true that to the extent you recognize fundamental constitutional guarantees--
1986.85-1722,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3251.189,3253.939,"Well, put it that way if you like, but it's true."
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,3253.939,3256.372,"--No, it... it certainly... it certainly is true."
1986.85-1722,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3444.859,3448.227,So you don't think the overcrowding should be a factor at all?
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,3448.227,3456.15,"I think that the overcrowding should be a... a factor, and indeed, I don't think the Third Circuit's test precludes--"
1986.85-1722,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3456.15,3462.404,It says that the factor such as the endemic crowding in a state's prisons may be considered--
1986.85-1722,2,31234,james_katz,,3462.404,3470.577,--May be considered in weighing whether there is a possibility to accommodate both the security interest and the commands of conscience.
1986.85-1722,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3510.754,3514.137,"Thank you, Mr. Katz."
