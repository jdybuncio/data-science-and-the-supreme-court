1976.76-5306,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.836,"We will hear arguments next in 76-5306, Dobbert v. Florida."
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,44.178,47.905,"Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the court."
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,481.531,486.968,"He would have been punishable under that previous Florida Statute though by death, would he not have?"
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,486.968,488.664,Not after your decision in Furman.
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,488.664,495.549,"But according to the terms of the Florida Law, he would have been, would he not?"
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,495.549,499.304,"According to the terms, would he been punished by death, we do not know whether he would be punished by death."
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,499.304,501.773,I said punishable not punished.
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,501.773,506.546,Would he be even subjected to death penalty if he had been tried at that time?
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,506.546,516.982,Did Florida Law apart from my decision in Furman authorize punishment by death for the offense of which he was found guilty?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,516.982,533.684,"I submit no at the time that he was tried because your decision in Furman, by your decision in Furman, you left only life imprisonment for those people who have committed offense prior to that time."
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,533.684,543.047,"My question Mr. Frost was apart from my decision in Furman, if you simply read the statute that Florida had on the books at that time?"
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,543.047,552.384,"Well, if we did not have the 1972 statute to compare with it, yes that would be the answer, but if you eliminate Furman, then you have to go on and compare the two statutes."
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,567.931,582.527,"Your claim then is not he could not have been punishable by death previous to the enactment of the New Florida Statute, but that there was enough difference in the factors to be considered?"
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,582.527,584.782,"Well, it is two-fold Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,603.762,605.163,And what is your second?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,605.163,620.765,"And the second part is regardless of Furman, if you take Furman away and assume that you never decided Furman then you have to compare the two statutes and the second point is that, at the time of his trial, it is two-fold."
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.613,697.429,"Under the old law, was the judge bound by the jury’s verdict in either event or if the jury did not recommend mercy, could the judge nonetheless impose something less than that?"
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,697.429,700.899,"No, if the jury did not recommend mercy, he got the death."
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,701.933,703.318,Yes.
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,703.318,734.985,"And the second point, in addition to the right to have that binding recommendation from the jury, he also had the right under the old statute that if he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment that he would be eligible for parole as decide upon by the Parole Board and Parole Commission at any time after he served six months in the State of Florida, he would be eligible, when and if he was paroled after that time except to the Board."
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,777.57,778.951,But did that not happen and his case?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,778.951,786.695,"That did not happen, but as I read your decision of this Court in Lindsey v. Washington, that is not the test."
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,801.231,812.062,But would you not think that that Lindsey v. Washington was limited to cases where the death penalty was actually imposed and laid down procedural guarantees where that happened?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,812.062,837.974,"Well, that was not even a death penalty case Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but it was a 15-year penalty provision where it was subsequently changed that the judge had to give them a minimum sentence of 15 years and in the first case, it was any term of years up to 15 and in the trial, in the reverse they tried him under the new statute and the judge gave him 15 years which was the same that he had gotten under the original statute."
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.798,866.141,"But he did different parole rights in his particular case, did he not, in Lindsay?"
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,866.141,870.817,"Well, a different parole rights."
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,876.013,888.761,You are making an argument here that something which could not possibly have affected your client in view of the sentence of death is something which he is nonetheless free to challenge on an ex post facto basis?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,888.761,899.298,"I think so, if the statute is standing there and would deprive him of the potential substantive right that could work to his detriment and we must look at the standard."
1976.76-5306,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,973.77,975.748,We will resume there at one o’clock.
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,975.748,983.151,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.76-5306,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,983.151,986.282,You may resume counsel.
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,986.282,989.683,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1976.76-5306,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1152.158,1152.543,Which court?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1152.543,1156.252,"The trial court, Mr. Justice."
1976.76-5306,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1156.252,1157.578,What happened on review?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1157.578,1166.319,"And the Supreme Court of Florida also, but they did not listen to our argument on that point, they did not mention this so, apparently they did not follow it because they said nothing about it."
1976.76-5306,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1166.319,1170.085,Should not that court decide that issue in the first instance?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1170.085,1171.317,I wish they would.
1976.76-5306,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1171.317,1176.222,Should they not even now be required to decide that issue?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1176.222,1179.409,If you would remand the case back to them?
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1548.82,1552.506,"But they are going to hear that at the trial anyway, are they not?"
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1552.506,1554.031,"Yes sir, they heard it at the trial."
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1598.301,1609.37,"Mr. Frost before you sit down, what do you think is the purpose of the ex post facto provision?"
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1609.37,1629.509,"Well, as Justice Chase announced in Calder v. Bull, we say this is one of the category three that a person should not be subjected to an increased penalty at the time he has tried over what he could have received at the time of the alleged defense."
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1650.722,1658.807,"Well, first of all it does not apply I take it to judicial decisions as distinguished in the legislative acts?"
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1658.807,1661.044,"Well, I would concede that, no sir."
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1661.044,1663.198,Do you know of any case where they have ever...
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1663.198,1666.644,"Well, I think the Bouie case was one where it applied in judicial decisions."
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1666.644,1667.426,Which case?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1667.426,1671.53,The Bouie.
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1671.53,1686.088,You do not feel that Profitt in effect there is a hold in here or that the Florida procedure before was much more rigorous than now which would eliminate your ex post facto argument?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1686.088,1690.226,"Would you repeat that, I am not sure I quite understand that Mr. Justice Blackmun?"
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1690.226,1691.489,"Well, you know the Profitt case?"
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1691.489,1692.677,Yes Sir.
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1692.677,1699.909,And you think that your client is better or worse off now that Profitt has been decided?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1699.909,1705.62,"Well, I think that is really immaterial when we are considering ex post facto application of the law."
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1728.101,1735.324,"Do you take the position at any procedural change results in the ex post facto consideration, any?"
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1735.324,1738.097,"Any procedural change, no sir, I do not take that position."
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1738.097,1739.032,Where do you draw the line?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1739.032,1745.202,"Whatever you call it, whether it be called procedural or not, this is certainly a procedure."
1976.76-5306,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.867,1790.314,What would you say if they had increased the penalty from a minimum of 10 years to a minimum of 50 years?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1796.624,1803.95,"Yes sir, I would say that that would be a substantive right that he had been deprived off if they increase the penalty and has the penalty annex to the crime."
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1805.998,1818.373,"I see your comment gets back again to Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s early question whether at the time this crime was committed under Florida law, he was not subject to death."
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1818.373,1820.042,"Well, the answer to that question."
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1820.042,1823.247,The only answer you can give is well the Proffitt case came along.
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1823.247,1828.098,"No, Furman came along, Furman is the law."
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1833.65,1836.587,But it was not the law at the time of the crime.
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1836.587,1846.493,"But under the law at the time of the crime, he would have gotten life imprisonment because it tended to recommendation of a mercy from the jury would have been binding on the trial court."
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1846.493,1848.91,"Well, is it not a bit of speculation as to what the jury would have done?"
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1848.91,1858.637,"I do not think it is speculation Mr. Blackmun, they heard all this atrocious, heinous facts that came out in this trial for five days and they heard every one of these facts."
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1858.637,1860.443,But under a different statute?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1860.443,1860.921,Sir?
1976.76-5306,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1860.921,1861.964,Under a different statute?
1976.76-5306,0,34435,louis_o_frost-_jr,,1861.964,1869.987,They heard everyone of these facts and they still recommended mercy.
1976.76-5306,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1872.516,1878.795,Mr. Musgrove.
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,1878.795,1881.809,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1976.76-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2129.557,2154.386,"Mr. Musgrove before you leave that point, is it your submission that if the trial had taken place promptly after the offense and before the decision in Furman, and if then there had been an appeal to this Court and this court have vacated the death sentence in those circumstances that Florida could constitutionally have re-imposed the death sentence pursuant to one of that statute?"
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2154.386,2167.114,"I would take the position, -- yes sir that Florida could have than so, however as a practical matter Florida did not do so to all those people who were on death row at that time, Florida vacated the death sentences and imposed life imprisonment instead."
1976.76-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2167.114,2176.58,And Florida did that as a matter of its policy decision rather than feeling was under any constitutional compulsion to do so?
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2176.58,2181.881,"Mr. Justice Stevens, I cannot tell you what was in the minds of the Justices of the Florida Supreme Court."
1976.76-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2227.054,2240.347,"But if your view with the law is correct, I take it wherever there was a death sentence set aside if the state had elected to adapt a new statute and then have another penalty hearing and ending up in a death sentence, it could have done that?"
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2240.347,2253.019,"That is our position, yes sir and in fact that is precise with the wisdom with Rudolf Allenton Lee and Rudolf Allenton Lee not only received the death sentence, but his death sentence was affirmed."
1976.76-5306,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2253.019,2262.822,"So that those that this Court vacated the death sentence, they would be vacated, but the other guy that was convicted under the same circumstances."
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2265.603,2267.818,"That is our position, if it is not involved in this case."
1976.76-5306,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2267.818,2269.988,You got anything to back that up?
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2269.988,2271.919,The Florida Supreme Court thought it could do so and root off...
1976.76-5306,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2271.919,2275.625,"Oh, if anything other than Florida Supreme Court?"
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2275.625,2276.66,No sir.
1976.76-5306,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2588.57,2592.822,Is this your only answer to that point?
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2598.594,2600.117,"That is part of the answer, yes sir."
1976.76-5306,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2600.117,2601.143,What is the other part?
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2601.143,2611.421,"Well, first of all we think he is merely speculating, he cannot say what sort of a verdict a jury would have returned under the old procedure."
1976.76-5306,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2612.926,2615.137,"That is quite the test, is it?"
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2615.137,2616.932,"Well, Your Honor."
1976.76-5306,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2616.932,2619.379,Under Lindsey?
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2619.379,2623.81,I do not understand Lindsey to have any application to a case such as this Your Honor.
1976.76-5306,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2641.095,2646.165,"Well, I know but under the old statute here, if the jury recommended mercy, the judge had no alternative?"
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2646.165,2647.304,That is true Your Honor.
1976.76-5306,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2647.304,2648.646,He had to accept it.
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2648.646,2649.384,That is true.
1976.76-5306,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2649.384,2653.16,"And here the same recommendation, he does not have to accept?"
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2653.16,2657.942,"And under the old system Your Honor, if the jury recommended death, the judge also had no..."
1976.76-5306,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2657.942,2662.723,I understand that but again is that your only answer?
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2662.723,2673.925,"No, my answer still is that what he just doing is engaging in Monday morning quarter backing and saying this is what would have happened under the old procedure and I suggest again that is speculation on his part."
1976.76-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2706.588,2713.841,"Mr. Musgrove, under the old law, was there an absolute right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida?"
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2713.841,2721.622,"There was sir, but there was no appellate review and the Florida Supreme Court had no alternative to simply reduce the sentence."
1976.76-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2757.142,2759.347,"Mr. Musgrove, may I ask you questions."
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2771.165,2771.455,Yes sir.
1976.76-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2771.455,2778.517,"Do I correctly understand that in those 40, 14 of those were cases in which the jury had recommended mercy?"
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2778.517,2779.307,Yes sir.
1976.76-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2779.307,2785.239,And in all 14 of those then the trial judge substituted the verdict of death for the jury’s recommendation of mercy.
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2785.239,2785.942,Yes sir.
1976.76-5306,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2785.942,2802.707,"I see and the second question I had is, although we do not know what have happened under a different stature scheme before, at least it is true as it not that under the prior procedure, the jury might have returned a verdict of mercy and if it had, that would have been the matter on the sentence?"
1976.76-5306,1,19566,charles_w_musgrove,,2802.707,2804.951,"Yes sir, that is true."
