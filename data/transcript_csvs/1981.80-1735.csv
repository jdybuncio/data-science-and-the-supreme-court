1981.80-1735,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,70.504,We will hear arguments next in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and others against Howard S. Abramson.
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,72.279,75.897,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1981.80-1735,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,185.5,190.784,"Mr. Geller, would you briefly define what a name check is?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,190.784,192.32,Yes.
1981.80-1735,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,192.32,193.986,"I think I know, but I'd like to have you tell me."
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,193.986,214.936,"A number of agencies in the federal government, including the White House, when they need certain information for perfectly lawful purposes about a particular individual, they will ask the Federal Bureau of Investigation to check its files and run what is called a name check on that individual and notify the agency of anything pertinent that they may have found."
1981.80-1735,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,233.147,236.349,"But I ask again, what is it?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,236.349,244.336,It is a memorandum summarizing information in the FBI's files in the individual's case.
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,250.073,257.446,"You mean the FBI would respond only, with respect to the individual, only with respect to what it found in its own files?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,257.446,257.946,--That's right.
1981.80-1735,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,263.517,268.987,Do they not check their files generally to see whether there are any arrest records of the person?
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,271.689,272.223,--Yes.
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,274.641,275.375,If they had it.
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,275.375,277.008,They would not go about--
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,277.008,279.677,But they do not send out a nationwide--
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,279.677,280.177,"--No, no, no."
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,280.177,280.827,--Question--
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,280.827,281.593,"No, they do not."
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,296.703,305.625,"--Well, if someone has an arrest record out in Tipperary or some other place, would that be in the FBI's files or not?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,305.625,309.577,I think that they are computerized to the extent that that could be determined.
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,313.695,322.551,"I know, but the FBI doesn't have in its files every arrest that's been made since time began."
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,322.551,323.018,--No.
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,329.555,337.559,"But do you think as of today when there's a name check, if someone's been arrested for anything in the last five years it will be in the FBI computer?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,337.559,341.529,"Well, I hesitate to give an answer with certainty to that question, Justice White."
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,342.063,342.596,"Well, that's all right."
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,343.863,344.363,--I do not know.
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,350.331,350.748,"Well, what does that mean?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,352.117,358.104,"Well, I'm not sure that the FBI these days is arranged with--"
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,358.104,358.604,All right.
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,363.406,364.008,--That's right.
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,364.008,365.758,Do you mean what's on their own computer?
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,365.758,367.043,I believe that's right.
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,367.043,367.643,All right.
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,373.363,375.815,I would have to say that I don't know the answer to that question.
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,379.184,384.838,"Well, would it have on the computer anybody's conviction for anything in the last five years?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,384.838,392.175,"I would doubt that, but I don't know the answer to that question, once again, as to the internal organization of the FBI."
1981.80-1735,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,393.444,398.229,"Mr. Geller, could I ask you a question about your terminology?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,398.229,398.696,--Yes.
1981.80-1735,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,398.696,406.933,Do you use the term documents or records or files as words of art for purposes of the FOIA?
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,406.933,407.45,No.
1981.80-1735,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,502.144,504.929,"Incidentally, you mention privacy."
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,511.333,522.391,"At the time that the initial request came in, I think that the FBI in responding to that FOIA request listed Exemption 6 as well as Exemption 7(C)."
1981.80-1735,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,522.391,523.724,And why has it been abandoned?
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,523.724,537.401,"Well, I think it was probably abandoned because the people who were putting together the District Court papers in this case assumed that these were clearly law enforcement records and that the pertinent exemption was Exemption 7."
1981.80-1735,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,572.99,585.548,"Mr. Geller, I gather from your response to some earlier question that if the White House sent over and said give us a name check on Kenneth Geller, you can't tell us what process the FBI would go through in response to that name check."
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,585.548,589.868,"I think what they would do is they would go to their files, and they would check to see what--"
1981.80-1735,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,589.868,591.835,"Well, now, their files, their files."
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,591.835,594.337,"--Well, they keep, as I understand it, two sets of files."
1981.80-1735,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,596.272,605.478,"Well, I take it that, if I may interrupt, that there's a full field investigation on you so that they wouldn't have to resort just to the name check."
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,605.478,615.584,"Well, the result of the full field investigation, as I understand it, would be in the file on me or on the eleven individuals whose names were requested in this case."
1981.80-1735,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,624.173,625.124,Of what?
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,625.124,626.059,Of the Joint Appendix.
1981.80-1735,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,701.673,706.66,"Incidentally, how many of those attachments are involved here, Mr. Geller?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,709.611,710.294,There were--
1981.80-1735,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,710.294,711.544,Forgive me.
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,722.336,724.419,"--Well, the Court of Appeals... we don't dispute that."
1981.80-1735,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,735.31,736.927,"Now, how many of these eleven individuals are the--"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,736.927,741.381,I think there were attachments as to about four of these individuals.
1981.80-1735,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,766.715,776.054,"--I gather in light of what the Court of Appeals said, at least as to those four, the Court might believe Exemption 7 applies."
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,777.721,779.106,--Only to the attachments.
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,790.312,799.417,"Well, what would the Court of Appeals say if the name check, the main body of the name check that was sent back purported to summarize one of the attachments?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,799.417,804.737,"--I think that the Court of Appeals clearly said, I think that's the holding in this case, that those summaries--"
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,804.737,808.339,"It would still say that the attachment might be exempt, but the summary would not."
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,808.339,809.641,"--Not the summary, not the summary."
1981.80-1735,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,950.734,958.637,Does the record show the dates when the information was compiled as to each of the persons in question?
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,961.422,969.278,"Well, as to the attachments, the name check summaries were all prepared in October 1969 in response to the Ehrlichman request."
1981.80-1735,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,981.003,988.49,"Well, taking Mr. Galbraith, Professor Galbraith as one example, did he hold any public office on which they would have made a name check?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,988.49,995.345,I believe that Mr. Galbraith was appointed as Ambassador to India by President Kennedy.
1981.80-1735,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,995.345,1001.063,And this might have... is that date related to his appointment as Ambassador?
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1001.063,1001.229,Yes.
1981.80-1735,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1013.287,1017.823,"Mr. Geller, can I ask you a question about how far your position takes us?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1047.924,1065.302,"Well, the situation is very unlikely to arise this way, but if the agency that receives the FOIA request looks at the document that it has been asked for and can show that that information originally came into the Government's hands--"
1981.80-1735,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1065.302,1072.289,"Well, say the request goes to the Internal Revenue Sevice in my hypothesis, and they trace it back and say this all came from law enforcement sources."
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1077.693,1077.776,--Yes.
1981.80-1735,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.815,1090.683,I understand.
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1090.683,1096.571,And it's also important to remember that simply tracing this information back to law enforcement files does not make it exempt.
1981.80-1735,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.873,1101.189,No.
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1101.589,1102.106,--The agency would still--
1981.80-1735,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.106,1103.522,But the privacy part of the test is met in this case.
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1103.522,1103.822,--That's right.
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1126.151,1143.78,"Well, Mr. Geller, you wouldn't suggest, would you, that if in this chain that Justice Stevens describes this information is included in a document that is normally made public, you wouldn't say that that may be excised from a document that would normally be made public."
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1143.78,1146.232,"Well, if the agency voluntarily makes the document public."
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1146.232,1154.255,"Well, it may say we're going to make it public, but we can excise this particular piece."
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1154.255,1155.988,I would think it could do so.
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1158.123,1159.44,"What do you do with, what is it, Sears, the Sears case?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1160.409,1164.277,"--Well, the Sears case dealt with Exemption 5, and I'm not sure that--"
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.277,1164.761,All right.
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1165.477,1173.981,--We don't believe that the factors that underlie Exemption 5 are the identical sort of considerations that underlie other exemptions.
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.627,1210.553,"But if an agency includes this kind of information, normally would include this kind of information in a document that is normally available, if it actually relies on this piece of information for coming to a conclusion, the explanation of which is normally made public--"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1210.553,1216.373,"Well, you know, in Sears the Court faced a situation somewhat like this, and while it said that--"
1981.80-1735,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1216.373,1216.956,--I know.
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1216.956,1227.181,"--Exemption 5 would no longer be applicable, documents that are entitled to Exemption 7 protection would not lose that protection if they were incorporated in a final document."
1981.80-1735,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1227.714,1229.248,"Mr. Geller, can I back up a minute?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1235.518,1238.537,"--Some of these attachments are raw files, yes."
1981.80-1735,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1435.408,1443.597,What if I go to the FBI and ask them to release anything they have in their files about me?
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1451.251,1461.642,"Not if it simply pertains to you, although if you ask for your own records, that's a complication that's not involved here, the Privacy Act would apply as well as the Freedom of Information Act."
1981.80-1735,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1609.872,1621.463,"Could the agency have relied also on Exemption 5, had it chosen to do so, as an interagency piece of information?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1621.463,1622.53,"Well, I don't think it could."
1981.80-1735,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1636.389,1643.626,"Mr. Geller, the director has some proposals pending, doesn't he?"
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1643.626,1648.428,There is a Justice Department proposal pending to amend several sections of the FOIA.
1981.80-1735,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1648.428,1650.046,Would these be exempt under those proposals?
1981.80-1735,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1650.046,1663.354,"I think that under the proposal the Justice Department has made to change, Exemption 7(D)s would now be exempt because the proposal, as I understand it, changes the language of Exemption 7 to read"
1981.80-1735,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1682.334,1689.421,Ms. Nelson.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1689.421,1692.457,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1981.80-1735,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1742.187,1745.389,"Why do you say ""even""?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1745.389,1754.93,"Well, I have to take a personal note and say as a recent mother, Benjamin Spock is somehow put on a different level."
1981.80-1735,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1771.356,1778.86,I'm not sure I get if there's any significance to the fact that there were four United States Senators who agreed with these people.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1782.663,1798.006,"No, but I think it does sort of lend towards the way that these people were not exactly doing something subversive to be investigated for, that they were using their right of freedom of speech."
1981.80-1735,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1798.006,1811.231,"Well, that might be relevant in a tangential way if we were asked to pass on the propriety of Mr. Ehrlichman's request, but that's not what we're dealing with, is it?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1811.231,1811.847,No.
1981.80-1735,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1813.183,1814.549,His conduct is not in issue here.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1814.549,1815.551,--I'm sorry.
1981.80-1735,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1815.551,1818.92,"His conduct, Erhlichman's conduct is not in issue."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1818.92,1831.478,"Oh, I think that Ehrlichman's conduct is very much at issue here in the fact that these FBI files, these summaries were prepared from the FBI files for a purpose that was clearly not law enforcement."
1981.80-1735,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1831.478,1834.263,"Well, I say his conduct is not in issue."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1854.426,1855.726,I don't know.
1981.80-1735,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1866.651,1880.459,"But is it not a fact that the information... there was information already in the possession and in the records of the FBI, just as there is, for example, on Mr. Geller and probably on all of us sitting on this bench?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1880.459,1881.343,--That is true.
1981.80-1735,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1881.343,1883.76,And he was requesting that information.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1883.76,1891.83,He was requesting that the FBI prepare summaries of information on these eleven individuals.
1981.80-1735,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1899.686,1904.507,But are we concerned in construing this statute and the exemptions with what Mr. Ehrlichman had in mind?
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1904.507,1917.898,"I think, as both the District Court and the Court of Appeals have held here, that it's very clear that these files were compiled for a partisan political reason and not for a law enforcement purpose."
1981.80-1735,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1920.85,1927.253,"The summaries were compiled, the summaries were compiled for political purposes is what they found."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1927.253,1927.819,--That's correct.
1981.80-1735,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1950.066,1961.641,"Well, I thought as to some of these attachments didn't the Court of Appeals suggest they might qualify, because they indeed had been put together for law enforcement purposes?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1961.641,1971.781,I think the Court of Appeals stated that... it remanded to the District Court to review and determine what was the purpose that those underlying documents were compiled.
1981.80-1735,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1971.781,1980.471,"Yes, but the Court of Appeals did say if it were found that those had been, the attachments had been prepared for law enforcement purposes, then they would qualify."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1980.471,1981.221,That's correct.
1981.80-1735,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1981.221,1982.654,"And you don't dispute that, do you?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1982.654,1989.91,"Well, the Court of Appeals was, I believe, using a very narrow use of the term ""compile""."
1981.80-1735,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1989.91,1992.612,"Well, do you disagree with that phase of the Court of Appeals holding?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,1992.612,2013.275,"Well, we contend that when the FBI rounded up new information and piled together this new information and submitted it for a purpose other than law enforcement purposes that that entire file, the entire record, could not be exempt from disclosure under Exemption 7."
1981.80-1735,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2019.512,2020.729,"Well, I'm still not clear, Ms. Nelson."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2026.083,2040.693,"Well, we certainly agree that... we certainly would not dispute if the Court would affirm the Court of Appeals decision here."
1981.80-1735,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2058.721,2059.287,"Well, if--"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2059.287,2060.089,I'm sorry.
1981.80-1735,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2060.089,2060.939,--Go ahead and finish.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2061.539,2062.023,I'm sorry.
1981.80-1735,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2086.823,2090.608,"Well, what I'm referring to, Ms. Nelson, I'm quoting now from the Court of Appeals opinion,"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2114.324,2122.83,"Well, as I said, we would prefer a wider reading of the use of the word ""compile"", but we would certainly not dispute that that is the holding that--"
1981.80-1735,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.83,2123.88,"Well, you can't argue."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2127.466,2130.567,"--Well, the reason that we did not cross appeal--"
1981.80-1735,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.567,2142.291,"Well, it may be, but nevertheless, that's the ruling below, isn't it, that if these attachments turn out to have been compiled for law enforcement, they're exempt."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2145.529,2161.955,"--Well, there is some question, I think, as to the exact language that the Court of Appeals used here, and it can be read to say that it really did not in fact rule on the issue of attachments and left that as an open statement and giving some direction to it."
1981.80-1735,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2188.32,2190.289,"You don't compile records or documents, is that it?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2190.289,2191.222,I'm sorry.
1981.80-1735,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2191.222,2193.491,You don't compile records or documents?
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2195.343,2201.33,"Well, we would say that you compile information, that you create a new document."
1981.80-1735,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2201.33,2206.984,Do I get an impression correctly that if the statute had used the words
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2217.672,2221.041,"If they had used ""secure the information""?"
1981.80-1735,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2221.041,2229.278,"""Initially secured"" so that it was plain that when it was had it was not contemperaneous with the request."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2229.278,2234.48,I'm sorry.
1981.80-1735,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2280.644,2282.413,"But that doesn't help us much here, though, does it?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2292.268,2293.034,--I understand that.
1981.80-1735,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2293.034,2296.636,And you really don't know what happened in the FBI.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2296.636,2299.152,In this case.
1981.80-1735,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2299.152,2301.671,You said they went to the files and did this and did that.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2303.206,2304.123,That's correct.
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2304.123,2312.062,"Ms. Nelson, with respect to what Justice Brennan read to you, the word ""original"" appeared a couple of times in what the Court of Appeals said."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2316.264,2323.084,"Again, I would like to stay with the Court of Appeals--"
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.084,2323.536,Not what you'd like.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2323.536,2324.503,--Decision.
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.503,2326.921,Supposing you... let's ask it this way.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2339.213,2341.331,I would say not exempt.
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2342.548,2344.783,Only original records in your reading of the statute.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2344.783,2353.306,--I would say it because the Congress when it was adopting the amendments to Exemption 6 was doing so in the wake of Watergate.
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2388.229,2389.962,If the original were protected is the hypothesis.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2389.962,2401.536,"--The original... there is no question even here that the original documents, the raw investigatory files from which this information was obtained, are still protected under whatever exemption--"
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2401.536,2401.953,I understand.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2405.857,2408.809,--As to the document that was created.
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2408.809,2409.509,As to the photostats.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2409.509,2410.092,Yes.
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2410.092,2410.409,Yes.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2427.085,2427.468,No.
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2441.476,2442.176,"You understand it, but you disagree with it."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2442.176,2442.743,--Yes.
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2442.743,2443.926,We can all understand that.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2453.332,2456.884,Because Exemption 7... there are nine exemptions.
1981.80-1735,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2458.836,2461.371,Let's stick to Exemption 7.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2461.371,2467.358,"--Seven goes to documents created for a specific purpose, and whether or not that purpose--"
1981.80-1735,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2467.358,2473.345,"And you say only the originals are created, and a photostat of an original is not a creation, is that it?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2473.345,2476.964,--I think that's the argument of the Court of Appeals.
1981.80-1735,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2479.13,2479.83,What's your argument?
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2479.83,2487.403,"Well, at this moment I haven't cross complained, you know, cross filed on their opinion and I'm willing to stand behind their opinion."
1981.80-1735,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.543,2506.578,"But, Ms. Nelson, that isn't what Exemption 7... it doesn't say created."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2514.934,2516.001,--That is correct.
1981.80-1735,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.403,2521.688,"And you thought that ""compiled"" normally applies to information rather than documents."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2521.688,2522.807,"--No, Your Honor."
1981.80-1735,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.807,2524.223,"Well, that's what you said."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2524.223,2524.99,I'm sorry.
1981.80-1735,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2547.903,2558.592,Even though... so you would be compiling a record... I guess you have to compile a record before it's within Exemption 7.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2558.592,2559.209,That's correct.
1981.80-1735,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2559.209,2574.887,And so you think you're not compiling a record if you make a photostat of an original and attach it.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2574.887,2577.423,"That's the Court of Appeals decision, and we are willing to--"
1981.80-1735,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2577.423,2578.123,"And that's yours, too, isn't it?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2578.123,2578.739,--Stand behind that.
1981.80-1735,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2578.739,2579.606,All right.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2579.606,2583.641,But in this case we're not dealing with the photostatic copies.
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2644.695,2652.868,"Perhaps this isn't relevant, but I know that the Government makes something of it."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2658.439,2659.722,No.
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2704.468,2708.42,"In other words, Respondent was more or less acting on behalf of one of these eleven individuals?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2708.42,2709.97,--I can't say on behalf.
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2709.97,2716.275,"Because as I understand what the Government tells us, these eleven individuals, each could have gotten the documents pertaining to himself without any question."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2716.275,2717.658,That is correct.
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2725.012,2732.201,But the Respondent's interest is getting at the material that's in the nature of private information pertaining to these people.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2732.201,2744.509,"The Respondent's interest is to find out what kind of information that was being used by the White House, and to determine in this case whether it was part of the information that was used in this whispering campaign."
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2747.628,2749.978,Yes.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2772.826,2777.647,"Well, they cannot be shielded from disclosure under Exemption 7."
1981.80-1735,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2778.497,2779.663,I am talking about Section 7.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2779.663,2786.086,"--Yes, but we cannot lose sight of the fact that they may... some of the information may in fact be protected under Exemption 6."
1981.80-1735,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2786.086,2802.429,"Well, forgetting other exemptions, so far as Exemption 7 is concerned am I correct that your argument basically is even exact copies have to be disclosed if the copies are wanted for some purpose other than the original purpose which was law enforcement purposes?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2802.429,2818.605,"As I mentioned before, that is our petition, but we are more than willing to just rely on the Court of Appeals decision which does not go quite that far as to disclosure, and would only go to when they've created a new document--"
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2818.605,2831.329,"Yes, but I think you can argue in the District Court that a xerox is creating a new document, and that the attachment isn't protected unless it's the original, which you said earlier."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2831.329,2844.689,"--I think what I said... if we go back now to the District Court and you affirm the Court of Appeals decision, I think at that point we will probably not raise the argument of whether or not they are or are not xeroxed."
1981.80-1735,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2882.981,2887.766,"Ms. Nelson, you've used the word ""create"" a number of times."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2898.491,2899.324,That's correct.
1981.80-1735,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2917.535,2924.208,"And you rely on the Court of Appeals decision for the definition of ""compiled"" as opposed to ""create""?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2924.208,2924.824,That's right.
1981.80-1735,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2937.782,2956.262,"Well, I would think you would be better off with the broadest possible definition or rather perhaps with the narrowest possible definition of the word ""compiled"" since it's an exemption."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2958.881,2973.641,"Well, we believe that it's the terms that would encourage the greatest amount of disclosure of information, and that the words should... we should seek those definitions that would encourage the greatest disclosure."
1981.80-1735,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2973.641,2987.048,"Well, I just meant from the point of view of one seeking disclosure; you know, whether or not the argument is accepted, the argument would be phrased in terms of the narrowest possible definition of the exemption."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,2987.048,2988.483,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-1735,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3029.191,3036.397,"Well, your client doesn't need to go to the FOIA to get that information."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,3037.931,3040.999,"Well, this is what was part of the document."
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3210.258,3215.477,"May I ask another question about the word, the statutory word ""records""?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,3223.982,3230.921,"Well, as my brother mentioned earlier, the word ""record"" is nowhere defined in the Freedom of Information Act."
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3230.921,3234.29,"Well, under your interpretation we don't count photostats."
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,3250.15,3250.95,It's very difficult.
1981.80-1735,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3271.879,3272.415,A new record.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,3289.877,3294.679,"Well, I think in an earlier case that was argued here--"
1981.80-1735,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3294.679,3302.284,Unless you could send it over to somebody else's computer by pushing the Send button.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,3302.284,3309.604,"--Do that, or computer information is also transmitted by just exchanging the discs that the information is on."
1981.80-1735,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3309.604,3312.806,I don't think you or I know what is on the computer at the FBI.
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,3315.675,3316.558,I know I don't.
1981.80-1735,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3374.213,3379.784,"You don't suggest that an invasion of personal privacy has nothing to do with Exemption 7, do you?"
1981.80-1735,1,41825,sharon_t_nelson,,3379.784,3389.24,"Oh, there's no question that the sub-part of Exemption 7 does talk in terms of invasion of privacy."
