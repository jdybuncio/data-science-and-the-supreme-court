1963.101,0,37354,orrick,,511.86,530.931,"We -- we would -- we would like in -- in admission of adjudication, Mr. Justice, and on the issue of relief, I think that District Court, where there's any factual issue, cannot fashion a proper decree without taking evidence."
1963.101,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,530.931,535.658,(Inaudible)
1963.101,0,37354,orrick,,535.658,552.128,"Well, there's a factual issue on the scope of the relief, Mr. Justice, yes, sir, because the scope of the relief very often and particularly in antitrust litigation, it must go beyond the -- the facts that are pleaded in the complaint."
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1556.819,1560.767,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.101,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1711.907,1717.511,"You think this, what was entered here was a consent decree?"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1717.511,1727.501,"Justice Stewart, the Brunswick-Balke case which preceded this, which I'm sure the Court is familiar, deleted the word ""consent""."
1963.101,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1750.663,1752.534,Now what's -- what's Rule 83 say (Voice Overlap)?
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1752.534,1761.199,That says that the District Court can make rules if they -- as long as they're not inconsistent with the other rules and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
1963.101,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1773.239,1788.173,"Mr. Dunlap, (Inaudible) --"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1788.173,1789.675,"No, I think here they are."

1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1795.984,1802.714,"Well, it also provides, Justice Goldberg, it applies to judgments entered before evidence is taken."
1963.101,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1808.628,1820.916,(Inaudible)
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1820.916,1836.381,"Judge Goldberg, 5 (a) provides in relevant part that a final judgment or decree to the effect that the defendant of -- of -- has violated the antitrust law shall be prima facie evidence."
1963.101,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.179,1860.486,(Inaudible) and the trial court concede the violation of the antitrust laws or not?
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1860.486,1874.935,"Yes, sir, our motion and the judge also, in his order, says that I am entering this decree as if the defendants had pleaded pro confesso to the allegations of the complaint."
1963.101,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1894.199,1910.176,But you think there's some area between consent judgment and a -- and an adjudication which the Court may impose upon the Government and yet not -- not the prima facie evidence in civil -- in private actions?
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1910.176,1911.685,"I think so, Your -- Your Honor."
1963.101,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.091,1922.862,"And that was somehow never appealed, wasn't it?"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1922.862,1931.052,"No, sir, I -- I think that they may have found -- thought they found a -- a better target in our case."

1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1934.552,1935.06,"Yes, sir."
1963.101,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1935.06,1937.252,Would you have been bound by it?
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1937.252,1938.123,"Would we have been bound, we would have gone --"
1963.101,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1938.123,1939.075,(Voice Overlap)
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1939.075,1940.507,We would have had to go to trial.
1963.101,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1949.093,1954.28,Why -- why wouldn't the Government have the same right to go to trial that you do?
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1954.28,1961.988,"Well, Your Honor, I think it goes back to whether the action by the Government, if the Court contest whether that action is arbitrary."
1963.101,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1964.132,1975.585,"Well, if the Court -- if a Court wasn't arbitrary in deciding in favor of the Government, why would you be entitled to a -- to trial by the same reasoning?"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1975.585,1982.997,"Your Honor, I feel that -- in other words, if we -- if I get your question correctly, we were arbitrary in refusing to enter the --"
1963.101,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1982.997,1983.178,No --
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1983.178,1983.675,-- consent decree with the Government.
1963.101,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1983.675,1987.788,"No, I say, if in this proceeding, as it in the posture it was before --"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1987.788,1988.17,Yes.
1963.101,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1988.17,1989.31,-- the District Court --
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,1989.31,1989.611,"Yes, sir."
1963.101,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1989.611,2004.074,"-- but the District Court had decided against you and had -- had offered to sign the -- had signed the decree of the Government, would you be here now saying they didn't -- he didn't have a right to do that?"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2004.074,2007.571,"No, sir, I think it -- we would've insisted on our right to go trial, and that's what --"
1963.101,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2007.571,2007.872,Yes.
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2020.941,2023.315,"Oh, I -- I think that's when the Government is arbitrary."
1963.101,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2023.806,2024.919,Beg you pardon?
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2024.919,2045.85,"(Inaudible) -- if the Court decides that the Government is arbitrary in insisting on this provision and they proffer no evidence showing a triable issue, then actually, the summary judgment procedure that we have covered in our brief says that -- and the cases say that if there is no triable issue, then the Court can enter a judgment."
1963.101,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.755,2049.882,That's an adjudication.
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2049.882,2050.618,Sir?
1963.101,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.618,2059.594,"Adjudication (Inaudible) in circumstances, I mean, you weren't -- you weren't ready to come in here and say judge, you enter an adjudication against us on the fact."
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2072.766,2074.911,We were not willing to have the adjudication of guilt.
1963.101,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.353,2075.84,That's right.
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2075.84,2080.505,-- considered -- all the facts conceded for the purpose of relief.
1963.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2080.505,2089.722,"Well, is this -- is this then -- was treated in your view, this is like a non-vote plea in a criminal case?"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2089.722,2091.146,I'm not familiar with that plea.
1963.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2091.472,2091.84,"Well, that's --"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2091.84,2093.514,-- much criminal law but I think it's something like --
1963.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2093.514,2109.309,"Well, perhaps you don't have it in Florida, but I thought -- I think generally -- no, they did in my state and they could do in the federal system, one comes in and he doesn't plea guilty to the offense charged but he pleads non-vote, which is only to say, he would contest the --"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2109.309,2109.862,Unless be nolo contendere.
1963.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2109.862,2111.08,-- the charge.
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2111.08,2111.452,We -- we would go --
1963.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2111.452,2112.761,"Well, I -- I'd call it nolo contendere --"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2112.761,2113.778,"Yes, sir."
1963.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2113.778,2114.333,-- whatever it is.
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2117.462,2132.612,"I think that if you'd want to capsule it, Your Honor, you have a nolo plea contendere in the criminal law and we are saying, when the Government is arbitrary, there can be a similar plea in -- on a plea and adjudication in a civil case."
1963.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2133.596,2133.8,"Yes, but ordinarily --"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2133.8,2134.868,I think you'd come up --
1963.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2134.868,2143.392,"Ordinarily, a nolo contendere, maybe I'm wrong about this, I thought that it wasn't for the judge to decide whether that should be accepted."
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2146.95,2158.707,It has a voice but the -- the recent case of Commonwealth Edison versus Allis-Chalmers which is on certiorari to this Court from the Seventh Circuit and the -- they make the very point.
1963.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2177.411,2182.707,"Well what you're telling me is that if these were a criminal antitrust prosecution, the judge could --"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2182.707,2182.92,Yes.
1963.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2182.92,2184.684,-- notwithstanding Government opposition --
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2184.684,2185.07,That is correct.
1963.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2185.07,2186.018,-- accept it.
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2186.018,2186.506,That's correct.
1963.101,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2186.506,2191.594,"And you're suggesting the same rule by analogy at least those do apply in a civil charge, is that --"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2191.594,2193.44,"I say that's correct, Your Honor."
1963.101,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2193.44,2197.588,It can't be tantamount of a guilty plea?
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2197.588,2200.456,It would -- not -- not under the special provisions of 5 (a).
1963.101,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2210.09,2211.53,(Voice Overlap) treble damage suit.
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2211.53,2213.667,"Yes, sir, in a treble damage situation."
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2213.667,2228.242,(Inaudible) to have the judgment rendered against you available for use under 5 (a)?
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2228.242,2230.257,"Your Honor, here, that's one of the things --"
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2230.257,2230.43,Arbitrary --
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2230.43,2231.328,"-- but here, there was --"
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2231.328,2233.969,Is – is not that the basic objection you have?
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2233.969,2235.605,"Well, that's one of the basic objection."
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2242.768,2244.57,"Yes, I understand that."
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2265.706,2265.728,That's correct.
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2265.728,2266.864,"That's in fact what it is, is it?"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2266.864,2267.924,Yes.
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2267.924,2281.188,"And it depends on -- and you say it's arbitrary for the Government to take position that in the interest of the general enforcement of antitrust laws, it has a right to have an adjudication so that 5 (a) will be available to other people."
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2281.188,2285.098,"In -- in this particular case, Your Honor, now, it may not be in other cases."
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2285.108,2287.4,Why -- why would there be any difference in this one and others?
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2287.4,2292.561,"Well, the -- the point is that -- that was raised in the Brunswick-Balke case which we --"
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2292.561,2294.393,I'm not talking about -- I'm talking about this one.
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2294.393,2295.845,"Well, I'm -- I'm trying to relate that --"
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2295.845,2296.376,Yes.
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2296.376,2297.195,-- and then come into it.
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2309.038,2312.592,"But what that -- what difference does that make, if they have a right to do it?"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2312.592,2313.339,"None, Your Honor."
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2323.485,2325.142,Waive it?
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2325.142,2325.155,"Yes, Your Honor."
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2325.155,2335.324,"But what -- now what -- what the Government is insisting on, as I understand it, I had a little difficulty in trying to reaching it but I think is the issue and what's behind it."
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2343.235,2343.424,That's one of the things.
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2343.424,2344.974,You don't want them to have it.
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2344.974,2346.138,"That's one of things, Your Honor."
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2346.138,2359.012,"And the Government -- it's arbitrary in your view for the Government to take the position that it wants a judgment, wants to go far enough to get a judgment that will adjudicate guilt."
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2366.417,2385.89,"We say under the congressional purposes and the -- the adjudicated cases of Twin Ports Oil versus Pure Oil and the Commonwealth Edison case which is the last year of the Seventh Circuit, that that would thwart the intent of Congress in encouraging private litigants to come in and say, ""Alright, we'll agree to our consent judgment."""
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2403.025,2405.785,It seems to me like it had precisely the opposite effects.
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2430.67,2435.116,"Your -- your -- the point is Justice Black, there are two purposes of Congress."
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2435.116,2436.254,"Well, that's one of them, isn't it?"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2436.254,2437.33,That's one.
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2446.546,2448.267,"Well then, why do you object to it?"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2448.267,2453.83,"Well, we object to it, Your Honor, because number one, it wasn't proposed down below, the point was --"
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2453.83,2455.377,"Now, would it hurt your company?"
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2455.377,2455.987,Sir?
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2455.987,2458.372,Would it hurt your company?
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2458.372,2459.591,"Possibly, it can."
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2459.591,2459.601,Why?
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2459.601,2475.266,"But we are waiving -- we are waiving our right under 5 (a), if it's a true consent situation and we come in, we are waiving whatever privilege there is of the -- that Congress gave us in 5 (a) to come in and do that."
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2475.953,2478.999,"Yes, but you are -- you are saying about a consent judgment, the Government doesn't want it."
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2497.104,2503.23,"I -- an adjudication -- entered this -- this adjudication we claim falls within the provisions of 5 (a), yes, Your Honor."
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2503.23,2504.549,Under the provision of 5 (a)?
1963.101,1,20776,davisson_f_dunlap,,2504.549,2504.957,Yes sir.
1963.101,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2504.957,2514.995,You claim the right to go in there and get a judgment entered against you in such a way that 5 (a) will not be applicable and the Government says it doesn't think you have that right.

1963.101,2,37354,orrick,,3617.155,3646.884,And antitrust law enforcement would come to a grinding litigated halt because it's the very importance to the defendants of being able to enter into a consent decree and avoid these treble damage suits that enables the Government to carryout a decree -- sensible program of law enforcement.
