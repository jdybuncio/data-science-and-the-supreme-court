1969.728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,34.406,"Number 728, Dickey against Florida will be the next case heard."
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,38.63,41.338,May it please the Court.
1969.728,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,498.163,502.605,I thought there's a statute limitations I suppose for robbery in Florida.
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,502.605,503.409,Pardon me Mr. Justice.
1969.728,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,503.409,506.996,"I suppose there's a statute limitations for robbery in Florida, is that right?"
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,506.996,511.386,"Yes sir, but the statute of limitations said and told in this case, that is --"
1969.728,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,511.386,513.368,It's told when he's out of the state.
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,517.916,533.22,"The statute of limitations in Florida is told when the warrant is placed in the sheriff's hands, and that stops whether he's in the state or out of state."
1969.728,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,533.22,534.107,It's told?
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,534.107,535.668,It's told.
1969.728,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,535.668,538.585,"Told, as I understand that word means it's suspended, --"
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,538.585,539.024,Yes.
1969.728,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,539.024,539.824,It stops running?
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,539.824,541.041,Yes sir.
1969.728,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,541.041,543.619,"And now you say it's told when the warrant as placed in the sheriff's hand, I don't understand really."
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,543.619,552.862,"Yes sir, the case that we have cited in the brief which is Rosengarten versus State."
1969.728,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.862,566.706,"But when does it begin to run in Florida, at the time of the indictment ordinarily, forget this case, just -- let's talk about an ordinary robbery case in Florida when the man presumably remains in Florida."
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,567.924,569.044,My understanding of it --
1969.728,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,569.044,570.456,What is the statute of limitations?
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,570.724,571.12,Two years.
1969.728,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,572.62,574.893,And when does it begin to run?
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,574.893,580.627,It begins to run as soon as the offense is committed.
1969.728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,580.627,587.03,So under your statute as you described the sheriff has got the power to told.
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,589.908,590.503,Yes sir.
1969.728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,593.326,597.431,Even if the defendant is within the jurisdiction.
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,597.431,618.002,"Even if the defendant is within the jurisdiction because the defendant then has the availability of Florida statutes, 91501 and 91502 which gives him the right to demand trial and push the case alone."
1969.728,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,618.002,625.493,"So in the ordinary case, within two years after the offense is committed, the warrant has to be placed in the sheriff's hands?"
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,625.493,626.532,Yes sir.
1969.728,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,635.966,636.817,His absence from the --
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,636.817,637.357,Yes sir.
1969.728,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,637.357,641.564,Right.
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,641.564,647.395,Now --
1969.728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,647.395,651.26,You say that party could have had him any time they wanted to?
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,651.26,651.744,Yes sir.
1969.728,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,663.753,668.525,Is that a regular extradition process if he is a person in custody?
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,668.525,668.873,No sir.
1969.728,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,707.025,712.532,Isn't it true that they bring him back to the nearest federal penitentiary?
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,718.521,721.656,"Yes, sir, that is correct."
1969.728,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,721.656,723.331,And that could have been done --
1969.728,0,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,723.331,735.672,"That could've been done here even without the decision in Dickey versus The Circuit Court of Gadsden County, yes Your Honor."
1969.728,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1356.632,1358.83,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.728,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1358.83,1363.567,"Would you help me write at the outsets if you could, just some sort you got the fact picture before us."
1969.728,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1378.226,1378.302,No â€“-
1969.728,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1378.302,1380.592,Were they frustrated?
1969.728,1,25353,george_r_georgieff,,1380.592,1380.851,No.
1969.728,2,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,3018.741,3020.673,Yes sir.
1969.728,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3039.965,3041.42,And then he will begin to serve --
1969.728,2,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,3041.42,3042.822,The Florida sentence.
1969.728,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3042.822,3046.223,Nine more years minimum?
1969.728,2,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,3046.223,3051.581,Good time but his sentence is 10 because the order read consecutively beyond existing sentence.
1969.728,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3097.767,3105.536,"Do you think before that, this judge even if he complied with Florida statutory provisions would have said, well, later it will apply to you because you're a prisoner outside."
1969.728,2,29233,john_d_buchanan_jr,,3105.536,3106.242,Yes sir.
