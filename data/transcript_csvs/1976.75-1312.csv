1976.75-1312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.143,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Williams Company against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Number 1312."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,14.827,17.285,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,111.233,119.432,"Mr. Schrager, am correct in my impression that the note actually was paid within 10 or 11 months later?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,119.432,120.239,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,120.239,123.547,Was there a -- perhaps you will cover it as you go along.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,131.197,141.713,"I think the note was paid within approximately, as you say it, 10 or 11 months and at that time, there were several reasons."
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,163.145,171.864,"I take it that on the Commissioner's computations anyway, the deduction was allowed for the year in which payment was made."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,171.864,172.644,That is correct.
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,172.644,177.895,So that we come down really to which year that you end up getting your deduction.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,177.895,194.212,"Right, and set forth in our factual situation, you will note that the first year is the largest denial of the deduction and it becomes correspondingly less because he allowed the deduction for the cash that was paid the following year."
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,194.212,200.751,"And did they in fact invest in what, treasury bills or something?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,204.878,220.327,"Well, the corporation paid interests to the profit-sharing plan and they felt that in the years in question, this would be as good return as they would get by investing elsewhere."
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,321.603,323.322,Was this an interest-bearing note did you say?
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,323.322,325.117,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,327.166,328.639,What -- what rate?
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,328.639,342.958,"Different rates that corresponded to the rates that were being charged by banks in our local community, and the rates would differ from the larger money senders."
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,542.964,551.801,But isn't this -- the natural state of affairs in the overlapping of a cash basis in a -- an accrual basis taxpayer?
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,551.801,551.922,It is --
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,551.922,556.525,"It -- it isn't peculiar to this pension plan kind of thing, is it?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,556.525,573.787,"It was, Justice Blackmun, until such time that Section 267 was established at which time they stated that certain related taxpayers if you accrued it, it must be paid within two and a half months after the end of the year."
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,655.434,658.574,"The profit-sharing plan is not a taxpayer though, is it?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,658.574,662.503,"It is not a taxpayer because of the grace of Congress, however --"
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,662.503,671.112,"So, there's -- the reason that you explained was behind the enactment of 267 is was -- it does not exist here."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,671.112,695.456,"We feel it is, Your Honor, because it's quite conceivable that I, as a owner of a corporation, could have accrued the liability to the employees' profit-sharing plan, but if I never paid it, but took the deduction when the employees went to retire, there maybe nothing in there but just an accrual on the books of the corporation."
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,770.704,774.416,"Well, it could be another tangible property too, doesn't it?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,774.416,779.98,Their wording was cash or cash value.
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,967.558,973.993,"There's some dispute in the briefs, I gather, as to what the Uniform Commercial Code provides in this area."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,973.993,974.734,Yes.
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,978.245,985.153,I guess the Illinois version of the Code provides that a note is equivalent to a check.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,986.84,988.43,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,988.43,997.765,"But in other States and in the proposed Uniform Commercial Code, it is not, is that correct?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,997.765,1010.183,"Well, I think -- I think that we're dealing here -- first of all, we think that the Uniform Commercial Code argument is -- is very miniscule."
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1013.655,1017.831,"Well, I just wondered if you agreed as to what the state of the law was."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1017.831,1042.74,"We maintained that if -- if we're going to get into the Uniform Commercial Code, then the Illinois Code should be the one that's applicable and they defined both checks and negotiable notes as negotiable instruments, and that they both suspend the underlying debt pro tanto until the time of payment."
1976.75-1312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1191.411,1199.668,"Do -- do you think, Mr. Schrager, on your comment on the use of the word paid, did only four lines parts."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1216.515,1221.096,"I -- I think you're dealing -- one is paying it in the plan, the other paying a bonus to --"
1976.75-1312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1221.096,1222.146,Paying compensation.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1222.146,1223.634,Paying compensation.
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1240.205,1246.531,"Well, if that's the case, what differences are made whether or not you're accrual or cash basis taxpayer?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1246.531,1265.491,"As the tax -- the tax -- the cash basis taxpayer, if you are the payor, you are not allowed a deduction under the Code until you pay in cash."
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1265.491,1272.71,"The check, a check is the same and -- and you told us that a -- a check and a note are the same."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1272.71,1283.737,"We have not dealt with -- and there have been no cases decided, Your Honor, wherein a cash basis taxpayer --"
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1283.737,1284.284,Has delivered the note --
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1284.284,1290.936,-- has delivered the note and taken a claim deduction in this area of cases.
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1290.936,1299.17,"But as I understand your argument, the same argument -- basic same argument could be made in the -- in the case of a cash basis taxpayer."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1299.17,1301.327,"Well, maybe it could."
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1303.702,1310.184,"Because on the other hand you -- you do not claim that a mere accrual is sufficient, do you?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1310.184,1311.843,A mere accrual of what?
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1311.843,1315.828,On the books of -- of your client.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1315.828,1319.907,A mere accrual of the profit-sharing contribution?
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1319.907,1320.05,Yes.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1320.05,1320.803,That is correct.
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1321.241,1322.155,You don't claim that.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1322.155,1322.774,"No, we feel --"
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1322.774,1326.444,"And normally, that would be sufficient for an accrual basis taxpayer."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1326.444,1328.806,"Under Section 162 deduction, yes, it would."
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1328.806,1329.873,The normal rule?
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1329.873,1330.491,Right.
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1330.491,1334.19,But you -- you concede that you must at least have transferred a note.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1334.19,1335.013,"We concede, yes."
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1335.013,1337.105,And why should that be if you are an accrual basis taxpayer?
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1337.105,1345.389,"Well, we can get into the -- we feel that the word “paid” means delivery of something."
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1345.389,1348.652,"So, let's go back to my original question."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1356.717,1362.322,"The courts in Eckert v. Price have held, of course, that was the only -- the bad debt deduction --"
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1362.322,1362.588,Yes.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1362.588,1365.306,"-- but they have held in that case, no."
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1387.721,1392.372,I did not say the argument would prevail but -- but your argument didn't prevail in the Court of Appeals either --
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1392.372,1392.812,In three Courts of Appeals --
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1392.812,1393.687,-- in accrual basis.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1393.687,1395.234,"-- it did, Your Honor."
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1407.492,1419.463,"Well, certainly, there is a difference, but the basic difference has always been an accrual basis taxpayer can accrue a liability or accrue -- or on the other side of ledger income on his books and that's sufficient --"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1419.463,1419.836,Correct.
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1419.836,1421.107,-- with or without payment.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1421.107,1422.685,Correct.
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1422.685,1428.382,"But here, you can see that an accrual of the liability to the fund would not be sufficient to give you a deduction as I understand --"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1428.382,1428.551,That -- yes.
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1428.551,1431.851,-- as I understand your argument that there must be a note.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1443.377,1458.573,"Yeah, there is -- there has been some discussion about in the regulations talking about the word or was in the congressional report prior to the time that the final draft of the section came out talking about the word “actually paid”."
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1474.235,1480.003,"But your basic argument is that actually paid as I understand it, anything to the word “paid”."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1480.003,1480.291,Right.
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1480.291,1484.652,"It's like a sign where it says no smoking or positively no smoking, it means the same thing."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1484.652,1485.28,That's correct.
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1491.167,1493.817,"Mr. Schrager, can I ask you a factual question?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1504.692,1507.526,"Your Honor, that was a misinterpretation."
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1524.397,1534.304,"There is no -- nothing in the record to tell us whether or not the fair market value of the notes at the time of their delivery to the trust equaled the amount of the obligation, is it?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1534.304,1536.536,No.
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1542.299,1543.778,I'm not concerned about the error in the brief.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1546.011,1546.29,Right.
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1546.29,1556.875,The record -- there really is no support in the record for what I'm assuming to be much should be your ultimate contention that you -- you paid by property having value at least equal to the obligation.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1556.875,1580.004,"Equal to the obligation and it was in one of the -- and this has been decided in -- I believe, it was one of -- either the Sachs or the Slaymaker case and in the several cases that followed as they were remanded for a hearing on the value of the notes in those cases so and that is one of the points that has been covered."
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1605.006,1617.56,"No, but that I suppose to be opposed to the notion that you could avoid the whole problem by giving them the cash and then letting him come back and buy a note from you, which would have been payment and then a reinvestment of the -- of the paid funds."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1617.56,1617.624,Yes.
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1617.624,1619.171,Would you say that's too much trouble?
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1619.171,1633.163,"Well, yes, we feel that -- that they're making it tougher and tougher on the small companies to do this and I think after they -- they want to get into philosophy but after they enacted ERISA which was suppose to solve all the problems."
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1642.572,1647.939,"Well, is it -- is it in the stipulation that the value of the security is in excess to the value of the note?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1647.939,1650.746,"I believe that -- yes, that is and it's also contained --"
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1650.746,1652.465,And -- and plus interest.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1652.465,1653.761,"Yes, it's all -- they paid --"
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1653.761,1657.623,"Well then, what is the value of the note when it's backed up by security like that?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1657.623,1661.949,"We believe that it's worth the base amount of the claim deduction, Your Honor."
1976.75-1312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1661.949,1666.386,"Mr. Schrager, what would you get for in your local community?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1666.386,1668.927,"Oh, 100% on the value of this company's --"
1976.75-1312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1668.927,1670.436,"Right, that day or --"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1670.436,1670.935,Yes.
1976.75-1312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1670.935,1671.051,-- several days later?
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1671.051,1672.969,"Well, what -- what's the security behind it."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1672.969,1673.792,Yes.
1976.75-1312,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1674.148,1674.758,(Voice Overlap)
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1674.758,1681.83,-- even with the balance sheet -- you know that's not in -- I don't want to get off on the things that aren't in the record but even on the balance sheet of this company or (Voice Overlap).
1976.75-1312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1681.83,1684.125,"But counsel, the note wasn't payable on demand, was it?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1684.125,1685.028,"Yes, it was."
1976.75-1312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1685.028,1685.773,"Oh, I misunderstood."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1687.759,1693.328,"It was paid at a future date, Justice Stevens, but it was a demand note."
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1693.328,1695.228,The demand interest-bearing note --
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1695.228,1695.309,Secure --
1976.75-1312,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1695.309,1696.601,-- the flowing rate of interest.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1696.601,1697.466,Yes.
1976.75-1312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1697.466,1706.646,"But the trustees -- the -- the holders of the note who could make the demand, make the decision to demand where --"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1706.646,1713.339,Three officers of the company plus a bank.There was an independent trustee.

1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1714.8,1715.86,"Only one, yes."
1976.75-1312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1715.86,1723.329,"If -- if it came down to that, the three trustees could have both the fourth trustee, could they not on the trust and the demand?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1723.329,1724.744,"Theoretically, yes, they could."
1976.75-1312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1724.744,1726.402,"Well, theoretically or --"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1726.402,1729.417,"Right, it's factual, they could."
1976.75-1312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1729.417,1731.998,Three holders cannot vote one.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1731.998,1740.432,Yes.
1976.75-1312,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.872,1837.632,"Mr. Schrager, before you sit down, could I follow up in one of my earlier questions."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1840.893,1841.631,Yes.
1976.75-1312,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1841.631,1843.492,And why would they pay them?
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1855.575,1860.419,"The company had the cash and paid at -- in at that time, Your Honor, I --"
1976.75-1312,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1860.419,1862.455,"Who would have the cash at the time it delivered the notes, didn't it?"
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1862.455,1863.125,"Yes, I don't know exactly --"
1976.75-1312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1863.125,1864.698,(Inaudible)
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1864.698,1865.889,Pardon?
1976.75-1312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1865.889,1868.301,Maybe the cost of the money went down.
1976.75-1312,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.301,1870.647,Right at that time.
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1870.647,1872.306,That was in 1967.
1976.75-1312,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1874.946,1875.901,Your record doesn't show that anywhere.
1976.75-1312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1875.901,1877.892,"Anyway, the company had elected to pay."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1877.892,1879.326,Yes.
1976.75-1312,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1879.326,1883.673,"Mr. Schrager, let me just follow up on my misapprehension of the facts before."
1976.75-1312,0,36698,marvin_l_schrager,,1892.634,1901.073,"Yes, there -- I believe one of the cases, I think it was the Wasatch case had time notes, Your Honor, and the same line of reasoning followed in the decision."
1976.75-1312,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1910.119,1914.486,"Very well, Mr. Schrager."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,1917.404,1920.794,"Mr. Chief justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2028.9,2036.375,"Where is the most convenient place to find the statute in these cases, in your brief?"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2036.375,2037.899,"In the -- in the appendix to our brief, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2037.899,2039.727,"Appendix to your brief, thank you."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2039.727,2044.897,On page 33 of our brief.
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2122.549,2136.857,How do you square that with the well-settled and certainly well understood proposition that the drawing of a check for a deductible purpose is a deduction at the moment the check is delivered or mailed?
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2136.857,2138.04,"Well, I think that --"
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2138.04,2142.173,"One is a side draft and the others are note, each depends upon the --"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2142.173,2143.787,"Yes, basically Eckert and Price --"
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2143.787,2146.319,"There could be bad checks, just -- there could be bad notes."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2146.319,2148.402,"That's true, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2171.345,2171.544,Well --
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2171.544,2172.169,"It has long been, I know it is."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2172.169,2176.027,"Well, yeah, I know the purpose and that -- that is to beg the question."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2176.027,2176.184,Well --
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2176.184,2177.465,"It's a side draft, that's what it is."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2177.465,2180.527,"That's my -- that's my first step, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2185.661,2188.773,"To withdraw any to a bank, to pay to the order of the endorsement of the --"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2188.773,2189.148,That's right.
1976.75-1312,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2204.596,2212.918,"Mr. Jones, I thought the truth of the matter was the check is that the bank is ordered to pay the money if there's anything in that -- in that account."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2212.918,2222.624,"Well, that's true, Mr. Justice Marshall, and if there's no bank -- if there's no money in the bank account and the check bounces, then of course, the check does not constitute payment."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2243.358,2245.399,"They always have, I know."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2249.076,2249.649,"Well, it's really --"
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2249.649,2254.982,"Well, one can order to a (Inaudible) and -- and a notice much more personal and -- and direct."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2254.982,2255.525,"That's correct, Mr. Justice."
1976.75-1312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2268.212,2269.84,"Well, the notes are promised to pay in the future."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2274.125,2274.346,"That's correct, Mr. Cheif Justice."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2274.346,2277.616,That you have a demand note if you promised to pay right now.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2277.616,2281.545,A promise that the maker will pay not a direction to the bank to pay.
1976.75-1312,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2293.608,2299.897,On which side of the line where 30-day draft on a bank fall?
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2299.897,2303.245,"Well, I would think that -- I'm going to make sure I understand you."
1976.75-1312,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2307.934,2309.016,"No, the expiration of 30 days --"
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2309.016,2309.983,-- anytime after the expiration.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2309.983,2314.017,I would think that that would only be payment at the time of the expiration of the 30-day period.
1976.75-1312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2314.017,2321.267,"So, if it came after the taxable year, it would be out and it'd be on the same category as this note in your view?"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2321.267,2327.196,"Well, you're asking me about a hypothetical, but I really haven't very much thought to it, but I think that's the answer that I would give."
1976.75-1312,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2327.196,2330.708,If it were a payment to a pension fund.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2330.708,2335.259,That's true or if it were payment by a cash basis taxpayer.
1976.75-1312,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2335.259,2336.505,Yes.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2336.505,2346.241,"And really, I was -- at this point advancing the proposition that the delivery of a note is not payment by a cash basis taxpayer under any circumstances, whether it's the pension, trust or --"
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2346.241,2346.889,Right.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2346.889,2348.593,-- to any other creditor.
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2348.593,2350.151,And that's the Eckert case?
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2350.151,2353.905,"Eckert and Price, Helvering against Price."
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.33,2391.506,"Of course, the statute doesn't say that this -- that -- payors will be treated as cash basis taxpayers."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2391.506,2392.585,"That's correct, Mr. Justice White."
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.585,2392.694,"Well, I gather -- I gather --"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2392.694,2393.627,What I said at the outset.
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2393.627,2395.395,-- that's anticipating the rest of your argument.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2395.395,2395.683,That's right.
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.987,2401.436,Right.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2401.436,2412.437,"Well, as Mr. Justice Blackmun recently observed on behalf of the Court in the National Alfalfa case and I quote, “While a taxpayer is free to organize his affairs as he chooses."
1976.75-1312,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2460.269,2464.683,"But one of the questions, guarantors on the note they make any debt?"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2464.683,2475.084,I think that the fact that the net worth of the guarantors exceeded the face value of the note that provided adequate security.
1976.75-1312,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2489.586,2493.111,What -- what is the security for this note?
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2493.111,2495.263,There were three forms of security.
1976.75-1312,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2497.302,2497.441,The guarantor.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2497.441,2500.868,-- stock in the bank or stock in the company.
1976.75-1312,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2500.868,2501.929,Right.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2501.929,2508.203,One was the interest of the certain of the officers and their share in the pension trust.
1976.75-1312,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2524.795,2552.511,"Let's assume that the stock of this company was listed, so that you had the market value read it as attainable and that instead of getting a promissory note, the taxpayer had discharged its indebtedness as if you need to by delivering the appropriate number of shares of its own stock from it's treasury, (Inaudible)"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2556.385,2559.37,"Well, I think it would be payment, Mr. Justice Powell."
1976.75-1312,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2560.898,2562.485,You say you think it would or would not?
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2562.485,2570.484,I think it would constitute payment if it were shares of a publicly traded corporation.
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.888,2576.973,"The statute of the regulation specifically refer property, don't they somewhere?"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2576.973,2580.39,"Well, actual payment of property, I think that's right."
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2600.853,2601.696,"Well, let's -- let's --"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2601.696,2602.415,But if -- if it actually --
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2602.415,2606.853,Let's say the stock -- let's say the stock was in AT&T.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2606.853,2625.41,"Well, as long as -- as long as the pension trustee has to look to the assets of the company, if the company goes bankrupt, the stock is not going to be very helpful because it is subordinate even to the unsecured liability of a creditor."
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.597,2639.485,"Well, Mr. Jones I didn't -- you mean your argument in -- in the Court here really does depend on what the value of the note is?"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2655.691,2656.691,"Yes, that's right."
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2662.534,2665.826,"So, it wouldn't make much difference what the security was."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2665.826,2672.425,But the difference is that the actual issue into the stock does decrease the holdings of the --
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.425,2673.751,"Oh, no, I wasn't talking about the issue into the stock."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2673.751,2675.489,I'm sorry.
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2677.437,2682.752,"But even if either of the stock was secured by -- two to one by government bonds, you would (Voice Overlap)."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2682.752,2685.22,Even if the notes -- even if the note was --
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.22,2686.157,"I mean the note, yeah."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2686.157,2686.707,That's correct.
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2690.703,2695.528,"And even though you stipulated it, you can go to the bank and get 100% on the note."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2695.528,2698.743,"That's correct, especially in circumstances such as we have here."
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.743,2701.616,"Because the affiliate has paid, the company still has the use of the money --"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2701.616,2701.807,That's correct.
1976.75-1312,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2701.807,2703.575,-- so as the asset in it.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2703.575,2707.444,"It hasn't given up anything, (Inaudible) other than a promise to give up something in the future."
1976.75-1312,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2707.444,2722.479,"But instead of -- instead transferring AT&T stock, an asset of the corporation, and security for the note to the pension plan, the stock itself were paid over in the amount of the obligation of the pension plan."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2724.007,2724.768,I think that would be paid Mr. Justice Brennan.
1976.75-1312,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2724.768,2731.024,"So, this whole thing turns on the fact that it say, “No, that is the primary --"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2731.024,2731.679,That's correct.
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2737.043,2745.727,"But doesn't the -- I can't find it, but doesn't the statute or the regulation specifically refer to money or property?"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2750.697,2752.51,I think the regulation does.
1976.75-1312,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2752.51,2754.094,"You may have given cash, are you?"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2754.094,2756.956,"Now, cash or it's equivalent property."
1976.75-1312,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2764.13,2769.255,"Well, it couldn't have been paid in the note of someone else?"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2769.255,2773.36,"Yes, that's true, if it were someone else's note that would constitute payment."
1976.75-1312,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2780.66,2791.871,"But here, we have, with that note, collateral that could have been seized via the notes, presumably on an attempt of the note."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2791.871,2792.654,"That's correct, although that --"
1976.75-1312,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2792.654,2793.759,That exceeded -- that exceed the face value of the note.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2793.759,2796.729,That -- that collateral would have not come out of the taxpayer.
1976.75-1312,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2802.671,2804.87,And the taxpayer would owe the people --
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2804.87,2817.374,"Well, we're hypothesizing a situation which the taxpayer is bankrupt, I suppose, so otherwise the -- the requirement for collateral probably -- I mean the collateral would probably never have to be reached."
1976.75-1312,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2817.374,2829.455,"Mr. Jones, do you rely it all on these -- on the facts that the principle beneficiaries and the trustees of the trust were the same -- basically the same people as the obligor the note?"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2829.455,2839.985,"Yes, we do think that's important Mr. Justice Stevens, and I think if I can develop our affirmative arguments under Section 404, the relevance to that will become clearer."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2891.69,2893.573,And what -- considerations of what?
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2893.573,2895.977,Administrability.
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2976.609,2981.304,There's a -- there's a 1974 law that takes care of those concerns in there.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2981.304,2984.72,"That's true as to the future, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2992.896,2994.29,"In other words, Congress --"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2994.29,2994.717,-- prior cases.
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2994.717,2998.563,-- wanted to deal with and meet those concerns and directly did so --
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2998.563,2998.619,"Well, it is --"
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2998.619,2998.773,-- as it did so --
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,2998.773,2999.556,-- it is now done so --
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2999.556,3000.593,-- in the -- in the Internal Revenue Code.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3000.593,3002.439,It is now dow so more fully.
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3006.353,3007.578,"Oh, I see."
1976.75-1312,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3007.578,3014.181,"Mr. Jones, is there any of the Court of Appeals opinion in the pipeline now that favors the Government on this issue?"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3014.181,3027.18,"To my knowledge, this case has not been decided in a Court of Appeals since the Williams' case, but there are a lot of cases pending, either in the Tax Court or an administrative stage."
1976.75-1312,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3030.83,3034.939,"So, the tax court is kind of hopeless for taxpayers issue."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3034.939,3039.19,"Yes, but nevertheless this taxpayer and many others have continued to go there."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3109.85,3116.97,"But surely your argument today doesn't -- isn't limited to cases in which it may depend upon the identity of the trustees, does it?"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3116.97,3129.845,"No, that's -- that's correct Mr. Justice Stewart, but as a practical matter, it's frequently true that the trust which after all is established by the corporation will have trustees that are also officers in the corporation."
1976.75-1312,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3132.111,3135.74,Your position would be precisely the same that these were complete strangers.
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3135.74,3136.759,Yes.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3136.759,3146.127,"As to Section 404, that's true, Mr. Justice Blackmun, and we think that the term “payment” would have to have the same meaning in all the situations in which it was applied under Section 404."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3146.127,3158.968,What if the company had deliberated instead of a note one of its corporate bonds?
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3158.968,3160.245,"That's a difficult question, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3160.245,3161.582,I know it is.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3161.582,3165.421,And I'm not sure that I can speak for the Commissioner.
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3184.532,3190.465,"Well, there's -- there's a bond that's publicly traded."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3190.465,3212.008,"Well, to avoid problems of administrability, Mr. Justice Stewart, I think that a Commissioner would probably seek to avoid a case by case determination of whether a particular bond was more like a note or more like a share of stock."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3212.855,3215.892,"Well, we know it's more like a note in indebtedness, it's not equity."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3215.892,3219.825,"Well, I mean more like a note for purposes of this provision."
1976.75-1312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3234.229,3245.078,"On that same analysis, in light of some of your prior responses, the bond of a third-party could constitute to the transfer of property."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3245.078,3252.908,"Oh, there's no question about that, Mr. Chief Justice, when a taxpayer holds the bond of a third party, that's property in his hands --"
1976.75-1312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3252.908,3253.092,That's the time --
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3253.092,3257.725,"-- when he gives it over to the trust, he's actually giving a property."
1976.75-1312,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3276.633,3288.088,"Well, you keep arguing about the investment, the fund holding the money, what about the equivalent of the check for a year without cash."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3289.017,3292.332,Well --
1976.75-1312,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3292.332,3292.635,Would that will be all right?
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3292.635,3300.944,"Again, Mr. Justice Marshall, the only reason a check is treated as equivalent as cash are practical reasons, theoretically."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3323.434,3334.807,"What the -- does the new law, the 1974 law, make it illegal and not makes it illegal for two, purport to make payment by the note of the employer?"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3342.689,3345.06,"To my knowledge, it does not."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3364.393,3365.569,It's the borrowing of money --
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3365.569,3366.124,That's right.
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3366.124,3367.371,-- by the -- by the employer.
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3367.371,3369.454,"As far as I know, nothing prohibit the transfer his real estate."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3369.454,3372.581,"So that would cover the corporate bond, wouldn't it or would it?"
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3372.581,3376.435,"Oh, I think it would."
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3376.435,3378.296,It would be the purchaser of --
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3378.296,3378.689,"Well, it has a purpose -- the purpose is to --"
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3378.689,3381.461,"-- of a bond would be the lender -- a lender to the company, I guess."
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3381.461,3391.968,The purpose of the statute is to protect the financial viability of the trust and that purpose is best served by making its investments independent of the employer.
1976.75-1312,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3395.492,3395.848,(Inaudible)
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3395.848,3398.115,"-- will nevertheless, that's right."
1976.75-1312,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3528.549,3532.487,Do you think the symmetry isn't there because the plan is exempt?
1976.75-1312,1,33866,keith_a_jones,,3532.487,3534.665,"That's true, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1976.75-1312,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3650.725,3653.621,"Thank you gentlemen, the case is submitted."
