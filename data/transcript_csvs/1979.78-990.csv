1979.78-990,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,65.705,The hearing next is the United States v. Clifford Bailey.
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,70.085,73.045,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.78-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,343.069,347.808,Burned by guards as well as by inmates?
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,347.808,355.825,There was testimony from several inmates that there had been certain things burned by guards.
1979.78-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,359.695,369.316,"I take it the Government concedes that some of these conditions were ""intolerable""?"
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,369.316,370.714,"No, we don't."
1979.78-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,370.714,373.277,What do you concede?
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,373.277,384.122,"Well, for purposes of the case in this this Court, the Respondents' evidence has to be read in the light most favorably to them."
1979.78-990,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.029,412.496,"Well, the jury convicted these defendants, didn't they?"
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,412.496,429.022,"That is right, but the -- but after the judge had instructed them at the close of the trial, the judge concluded that there was not evidence in the record from which the jury could find that they had satisfied the return requirement of duress defense they had not surrendered to custody."
1979.78-990,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,435.683,449.175,"Well, then how can we be sure just what the jail conditions were, since presumably the jury was entitled to disbelieve the testimony of witnesses heard?"
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,449.175,452.547,"Well, surely, yes, that is right."
1979.78-990,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1141.356,1150.153,"It is not only a threat from those inside the prison, from people inside the prison -- fellow inmates or custodians -- that might in some circumstances justify escape, is it?"
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1159.829,1160.854,That is right.
1979.78-990,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1173.83,1175.065,"Not duress, but rather necessity."
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1175.065,1177.023,Necessity.
1979.78-990,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1190.099,1215.578,"Suppose we have a situation right now, a 20th century situation and the evidence was somewhat resembling what is going on in Iran today and the prisoners said they observed that every morning they were taking ten prisoners out into the court yard and executing them, just broadside."
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1237.999,1239.624,"Yes, I would."
1979.78-990,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1266.901,1275.841,"In this prison, in this institution is any limitation on the right of the inmates to write to their congressman?"
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1275.841,1282.079,"No, as I understand it mail is freely permitted to be sent out."
1979.78-990,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1287.437,1289.437,Or to a local newspaper?
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1289.437,1296.631,"Local newspapers or to an attorney, church, citizen groups, and that type of thing."
1979.78-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1330.327,1332.558,The real question is whether there is a requirement.
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1332.558,1334.491,That is right that is right.
1979.78-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1334.491,1338.8,So you are assuming there is one?
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1338.8,1342.054,"Well, I am explaining --"
1979.78-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1342.054,1343.692,You are giving an argument.
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1343.692,1347.869,"Yes, that is right."
1979.78-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1487.837,1502.175,"Mr. Kneedler, it seems to me that in both of your theories, and I may have it entirely right in my mind, but in both of those theories you in effect are saying that there is a sort of a second offense."
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1533.653,1534.748,That is right yes.
1979.78-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1534.748,1542.24,"Now, you don't quite -- is that your theory, that it is a separate crime and if so, is your indictment good?"
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1542.24,1547.755,We are not suggesting at all that it is a separate crime.
1979.78-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1574.041,1585.696,But in neither submission you are not contending that the fact that he doesn't go back is probative on the issue of whether he really was under duress at the time?
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1585.696,1586.016,No.
1979.78-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1586.016,1586.999,You don't argue that?
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1586.999,1588.123,No.
1979.78-990,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.802,1591.671,That theory would have to go to a jury?
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1591.671,1591.956,Right.
1979.78-990,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1606.349,1608.08,It just means that the defense isn't good?
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1608.08,1608.654,That is right.
1979.78-990,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1622.472,1627.942,Does it require that you prove a fair opportunity to return?
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1627.942,1628.657,"That is right yes, sir."
1979.78-990,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.6,1633.117,Yes.
1979.78-990,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1633.117,1647.617,I would like to reserve the balance of my time.
1979.78-990,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1647.617,1648.971,Mr. Kohn.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1648.971,1651.848,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1694.364,1703.043,"There are some things you can fail to do and lose a defense, like present it in a timely manner, like an alibi."
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1703.043,1713.103,"There are certain procedural requirements that are sometimes attached to defenses, such as notifying the prosecution that you intend to advance an alibi defense."
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.289,1733.418,"What about a claim of release in a civil action, which is an affirmative defense and you show the judge what you propose to do for his release and he says as a matter of law that is not a release."
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1736.584,1742.117,Perhaps in a civil context there wouldn't be any problem but in criminal context it certainly would.
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1742.117,1747.599,You say that any evidence that a defendant wants to offer comes in in a criminal case?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1747.599,1755.563,"On the affirmative sense I would say as long as the defendant offers some evidence of duress or coercion, then that would come in and go to the jury."
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1755.563,1768.071,"Well, if the judge says, ""I want to share in share in chamber what you propose to offer in the way of duress,"" and says, ""This isn't even some evidence, so I am not going to let you offer it""?"
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1768.071,1776.432,"There would be a minimum of threshold, Your Honor, certainly if the defendant offered zero evidence the affirmative defense would not be permitted to go to the jury."
1979.78-990,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.295,1824.475,"You don't say that the duress defense is constitutionally required, do you?"
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1824.475,1832.064,"Well, certainly it impinges on the fact-finding function of the jury, Your Honor."
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.279,1841.297,"Well, say some State doesn't have it."
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1855.812,1860.066,"Well, that raises another issue in this case, Your Honor, which goes to the --"
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.066,1869.157,"Do you think that is different in this case, really, if a judge says, ""Well, we have a defense of duress but only here are the elements, one, two, three."
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1873.183,1878.438,"Well, that would answer problems I believe under Spence v. Montana, Your Honor."
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1908.188,1922.041,Suppose the defense offered was the defendant said he heard a voice commanding him to leave the prison and to go and carry out some mission.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1935.695,1939.72,Certainly not in terms that we are discussing in this case.
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1947.231,1952.836,You posed some hypotheticals in other State holdings.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1961.011,1965.617,There may be other questions regarding intent.
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1982.747,1985.621,Or if he argues by invitation of the guards?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,1985.621,1986.231,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2006.423,2013.741,But in one of those cases he came back within a few hours and in the other one he came back within 24 hours.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2013.741,2016.102,I don't think that a distinction can be made on that ground.
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2016.969,2018.754,What if he is gone for six months?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2018.754,2022.185,"Well, that certainly would raise a question of fact for the jury."
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2022.185,2024.404,"Fact for the jury, or the judge?"
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2024.404,2026.475,"No, I think that that would still raise --"
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2026.475,2028.312,"Two years, then?"
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2028.312,2038.252,"Well, at some point perhaps you could say there was no longer a reasonable, temporal relationship between the duress that caused him to leave and his staying out."
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2171.796,2183.391,"Well, just because we have rules against hearsay doesn't mean that those events think the jury is stupid or incompetent, it is just a matter of rules isn't it?"
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2183.391,2198.672,"I think that the base of the Government's case is the feeling that the juries will be duped by prisoners who raise these defenses, that prisoners will get together and conspire to create stories and that somehow the jury will not be able to sort these out."
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2231.429,2235.028,But they are acquitted for the 20 or 30 or 60 days that they are out?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2235.028,2237.559,I wouldn't think so.
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.559,2246.021,The Congress has specified that escape is separately punishable felony.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2256.082,2257.242,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-990,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2280.408,2288.688,What is the status of law in the Federal courts on duress as a defense to escape?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2288.688,2293.49,"I think it is generally permitted in both State and Federal courts, and the only --"
1979.78-990,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2293.49,2295.734,Standard defense in any criminal charge?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2295.734,2297.522,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-990,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2297.522,2301.157,"Well, it hasn't been duress, historically."
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2304.0,2306.626,"Well, the evidence always came in in some manner."
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.568,2309.679,"Well, was it or not was it a --"
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2309.679,2319.337,"Historically, it was recognized by Hale and by Cluck originally, at least theoretically but apparently it was not applied for many years by the courts."
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2319.337,2321.637,In an escape case?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2321.637,2322.141,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2322.141,2323.967,Although it was other --
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2323.967,2325.297,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.297,2332.345,And when did it come into fashion in the Federal courts?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2332.345,2343.617,"Well, I think that after the Luther and the Harmon and the Unger cases were decided in the State courts and the Lovercamp case, it started to be accepted by the Federal courts."
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2343.617,2346.421,Without any congressional indictments or anything?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2347.885,2346.421,That is correct.
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.285,2352.709,And this Court has never passed on it?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2352.709,2354.344,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-990,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2441.709,2445.041,"There are two issues in this case, aren't there?"
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2456.719,2457.579,That is correct.
1979.78-990,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2457.579,2460.537,Quite apart from that question of duress.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2473.772,2475.599,"Yes, they are two separate questions, Your Honor."
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2521.786,2524.756,"Well, is this the theory, that the Court of Appeals majority preceded that?"
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2524.756,2540.291,"Well, I believe the Court of Appeals discussed the issues of voluntarinesss and intent and in Judge Wilkey's dissent on pages 66-A through 73-A of the Petitioner's petition for writ of certiorari, Judge Wilkey discussed that."
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2601.998,2605.493,Do you assign that as error in the Court of Appeals?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2605.493,2618.965,"I don't believe that is assigned as error, but certainly the issues of what evidence was to go to the jury was before the Court of Appeals."
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2635.746,2638.56,What are the difficult constitutional questions?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2638.56,2656.745,"The difficult constitutional questions are -- well, first of all the Court would have to interpret 751 to determine whether it just stated a single offense, which is the act of parting or as the Government suggests, it goes further and creates a continuing offense."
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2660.965,2663.152,I don't see any constitutional problem.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2663.152,2674.642,"And if the Court agrees that the statute does create a continuing offense, then the Court will have to resolve what I think is a difficult constitutional question of what does that mean for this case."
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.751,2711.85,"The majority below didn't rest its holding on constitutional grounds, did it?"
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2711.85,2713.082,"I believe it did, Your Honor."
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2748.832,2760.841,"Did you have in mind that page of the record where the Court of Appeals, the jury talks about the constitutional issue?"
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2774.846,2780.798,That is page 25-A of the petition for certiorari.
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.798,2784.51,And it goes over to 26-A.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2784.51,2786.655,If I may read it --
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2786.655,2790.944,"Well, where does it say anything about the Constitution?"
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2790.944,2798.957,"Let me -- it is on probably 6-A, Your Honor, in the first line."
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2798.957,2799.849,Yes.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2799.849,2801.722,The Court of Appeals said.
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2849.078,2862.65,"At least I have the impression that you conceded that a person might be at large so long that it would be a legal question, not a fact question, that is the judge may decide not to submit it to a jury."
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2862.65,2866.558,"That is only with respect to the affirmative defense, Your Honor, I believe."
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.76,2914.577,"The Court of Appeals did not hold that the evidence was sufficient on the issue of duress, did it?"
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2914.577,2915.81,"I don't believe it had to, Your Honor."
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2915.81,2924.368,They didn't because of that theory but if we should agree with you our disposition would be to send it back to the Court of Appeals to decide whether or not there is a prima facie case of duress isn't that right?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2924.368,2930.362,"Well, I think if this Court -- well, let me think about that."
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2944.613,2954.21,"I don't know whether it would be right or wrong, but if the Court of Appeals -- and we agreed with them -- determined that there was not enough evidence of duress that requires ten days before he left, and things like that."
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2954.21,2955.669,No.
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2957.685,2958.724,That is my point.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2958.724,2967.01,"Well, the only reason why the trial judge did not let this evidence in in the first place was because the defendants had failed to return."
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2969.76,2972.439,That is the only reason he didn't give the instructions?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2972.439,2973.174,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2974.495,2984.837,The instruction would not have been required unless there was prima facie evidence of duress and the Court of Appeals hasn't decided whether or not there was.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,2984.837,2986.726,"Well, I suppose that is true."
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3009.445,3014.181,What if this court decides that the return requirement is an essential element of duress?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3014.181,3028.178,"Well, then the Court is going to have to reach these other questions about the scope of the statute, the constitutional violation which the Court decided the case on and the sense from problems with the intent issue."
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3030.885,3038.795,"Or you can say it isn't a constitutional issue at all, there is no constitutional issue, it is just a definition of an element of the --"
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3038.795,3041.059,The Court --
1979.78-990,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3041.059,3043.047,It is not a separate crime at all?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3043.047,3044.783,The Court could resolve that.
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3062.748,3068.107,Or we could decide as a matter of policy that the defendant must return within a particular time?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3068.107,3071.41,That is absolutely right.
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3071.41,3073.765,There is certainly no constitutional issue involved.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3073.765,3080.99,"Well, except that we have argued that the absolute return requirement does impinge upon the fact-finding function of the jury."
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3080.99,3084.16,On the freedom to escape?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3084.16,3086.133,"No, I am not saying --"
1979.78-990,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3086.133,3087.356,The freedom to escape?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3087.356,3089.609,I am certainly not saying there is a right to escape here.
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3091.115,3096.522,You must be saying there is a right to escape under certain conditions.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3096.522,3098.274,I suppose you could put it that way.
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3100.069,3101.106,What else is it?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3101.106,3103.65,It is just the defense.
1979.78-990,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3105.398,3111.207,"Well, it is like duress in any criminal case, it is not a right to kill somebody."
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3116.053,3118.48,In self-defense exactly.
1979.78-990,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3122.79,3129.6,Would you argue that there is a constitutional right to escape from cruel and unusual punishment in the prison?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3129.6,3131.32,"Not in this case, Your Honor."
1979.78-990,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3131.32,3132.182,I did not ask this case.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3135.05,3148.093,"No, I think there are probably some conditions that might be characterized as cruel and unusual that would not amount to the serious bodily injury that we are dealing with in this area."
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3174.422,3186.102,What about a prisoner who says he escaped because he was facing certain death and he was in death row and about to be executed next Monday?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3186.102,3196.669,"I think that is a unique situation, Your Honor, because there are plenty of avenues for appealing convictions and death sentences and practically inexhaustible review procedures."
1979.78-990,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3196.669,3198.036,Recommend them all?
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3198.036,3211.75,"Well, no, because then if he has been duly found guilty and all of his legitimate avenues are over, I don't believe that is the situation with these other case."
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3213.282,3218.637,"You don't think that coercion defense would be available, then, under any circumstances?"
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3218.637,3221.938,"Well, if someone on death row is brutalized --"
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3221.938,3227.785,"No, the finest prison in the world -- the finest death row in the world and he is to be executed next Monday."
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3227.785,3245.495,"I don't think if he escapes he would have a coercion defense, because there the difference is -- and the whole reason why we have this affirmative defense that there are some situations where normal avenues of review are just not available to prisoner."
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3285.269,3291.096,Maybe it is partly because the threat of death is a lawful threat --
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3291.096,3292.427,Exactly.
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3292.427,3295.782,-- in which due process has brought it to that point.
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3295.782,3298.513,Exactly.
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3466.737,3467.885,"Your time has expired, Mr. Kohn."
1979.78-990,1,39655,richard_s_kohn,,3467.885,3469.513,"Thank you, Mr. Chife Justice."
1979.78-990,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3469.513,3474.93,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Kneedler?"
1979.78-990,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3474.93,3478.469,I would just like to make a few points.
1979.78-990,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3583.398,3591.744,"Of course if he is apprehended very promptly after his escape, he can always testify that he intended to return."
1979.78-990,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3591.744,3597.257,"Well, again I think it might depend on the type of duress to which he was subject."
1979.78-990,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3621.348,3623.571,He might be apprehended when he was going around the block?
1979.78-990,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3623.571,3625.831,"Oh, right sure yes, exactly."
1979.78-990,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3627.112,3628.98,He could testify he was on his way back.
1979.78-990,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3632.231,3633.026,Sure.
1979.78-990,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3639.541,3640.148,"Thank you, gentlemen."
