2014.14-103,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.935,"We'll hear argument next today in Case No. 14-103, Baker Botts v. ASARCO. Mr. Streett."
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,7.935,55.29,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At the end of a bankruptcy case, a professional must file a detailed fee application. Numerous interested parties may object and the court must hold a hearing to resolve those objections and make an independent assessment of reasonable compensation. Each of those steps is indispensable to accurately determining the professional's core fees and the estate's administrative expenses, allowing the trustee to close the case and ultimately pay the estate's creditors. Everyone agrees that preparing the application is compensable as reflected by Section 330(a)(6)'s guidance for determining the amount of that compensation."
2014.14-103,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,73.54,81.56,"Well, the principle basis, as I understand it, is that when you prepare it, you're -- you're serving the -- the trustee."
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,95.65,98.92,It would certainly not be in the vast majority of cases.
2014.14-103,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,117.36,122.655,"So you'd acknowledge it's okay if the trustee objects, then he doesn't have to pay, right?"
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,122.655,124.33,"I would not acknowledge that, Your Honor, but --"
2014.14-103,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.33,125.185,I didn't think you would.
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,125.185,127.96,But that is the reason there should not be a categorical --
2014.14-103,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,127.96,130.06,But the trustee is not the estate.
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,130.06,131.41,"That's correct, and there's no --"
2014.14-103,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,131.41,136.88,"The estate wants to keep as much money as it can to give to the creditors. That's the purpose, right?"
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,136.88,147.17,"Well, in this case, for example, the estate paid all of Baker Botts's core fees and wanted to pay all those fees, and you had ASARCO coming in as the reorganized company and objecting."
2014.14-103,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,165.46,173.505,"If you hired another law firm to fight this objection, would that other law firm have been entitled to fees too?"
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,173.505,178.18,It would possibly be entitled to fees through 330(a)(1)(b)
2014.14-103,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,197.66,201.01,I just want to understand your rule completely.
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,216.31,217.13,Yes.
2014.14-103,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,217.13,224.065,"Approved their lawyer? But if the trustee hasn't, then they have to assume the costs of fighting --"
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,224.065,227.02,"No, your Honor, that's not our position for two reasons."
2014.14-103,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,286.9,289.945,I take it you -- excuse me.
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,300.325,301.3,"Yes, that's correct."
2014.14-103,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,301.3,301.57,All right.
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,305.04,316.53,"I don't think it's irrelevant because it shows the error of the Fifth Circuit's way in adopting a categorical rule that prohibits compensation, even when the trustee wants to pay the professional the full amount."
2014.14-103,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,350.55,353.545,That was in the context of a fee splitting statute though.
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,353.545,354.44,That's correct.
2014.14-103,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,433.045,444.88,"Well, but just -- on the parity point, if you're not doing bankruptcy work and you send the client a bill and they don't pay it, if you've got to take litigation action or whatever, you don't get paid -- you don't get those fees back."
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,450.025,450.47,That's right.
2014.14-103,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,560.0,579.525,"Mr. Streett, do you have a position on enhancements? If -- if the creditors say that enhancement is -- you did a good job but it's not worth the enhancement, is defending the enhancement also, under your rule, compensable?"
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,579.525,588.0,"We believe it would be compensable, in the sense that it passes by the minimal compensability threshold that puts it into the bankruptcy court discretion."
2014.14-103,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,614.88,643.055,"You practice in bankruptcy. I mean, you know it pretty well because what I was trying to think of, which is really balancing on the side, but the phrase ""likely to benefit,"" it has -- it says ""likely to benefit."" Now, it seems to me there must be instances where you, representing the -- the debtor, hire accountants or various others to do technical work, conveying and where -- where, in fact, it's quite clear that it won't mean more money for the debtor."
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,650.295,650.745,Correct.
2014.14-103,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,650.745,652.66,And you do it and it benefits only the creditor.
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,656.745,657.45,"Yes, and that --"
2014.14-103,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,657.45,658.51,Is that right? Am I just --
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,658.51,663.51,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor, and that's why there are two prongs within Section 330(a)(4)(A)(ii)"
2014.14-103,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,678.65,690.71,"Well, then you're in trouble, because if -- if all those things -- I mean, there are a set of things, such that when you carry them out through accountants or conveyers or others, will in fact cost the estate a lot of money."
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,709.95,710.51,The way --
2014.14-103,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,710.51,714.7,"That's administration of the estate, then this would have to be administration of the estate."
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,718.73,722.42,We agree that this is administration of the case for the --
2014.14-103,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,722.42,723.98,"Oh, you're saying this is administration."
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,727.34,733.175,It falls within either one. We think the most natural home for it is necessary to the administration of the case.
2014.14-103,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,742.44,742.58,I see.
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,742.58,752.39,"-- of the case or beneficial to the estate, because Congress recognized there are going to be a lot of things that a professional has to do, as Justice Breyer said, that may cost money in the short run."
2014.14-103,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,763.47,771.115,"You're ignoring one important aspect of difference which is in everything else, you're acting for the estate."
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,785.79,786.98,I don't think --
2014.14-103,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,786.98,789.605,Not because it puts more money in the estate's pocket.
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,789.605,790.03,Yes.
2014.14-103,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,808.88,822.61,"Well, except that preparing the fee application: A, it's specifically allowed by statute; and B, if they compensate you for that, there's -- then you'll do a very careful job, and there will be less necessity to have to defend it."
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,827.235,837.78,"Well, let me take that question in two parts, because I think if Congress drafted the statute to say preparing the fee application is compensable, then we would have a very different case."
2014.14-103,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,903.35,919.93,"But people know -- I mean, the American rule in the legal area is very fundamental, and it strikes me bankruptcy is one of those areas where they go into considerable detail telling you who pays what and when you can get it, just like you say here."
2014.14-103,0,56133,aaron_m_streett,,944.07,948.585,"Congress certainly could have done that, but that's simply not the way it wrote 330(a)"
2014.14-103,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,966.265,974.49,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fletcher."
2014.14-103,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,974.49,991.705,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We agree with Petitioners that when a bankruptcy professional is seeking compensation under Section 330(a) successfully defends its fee application, the bankruptcy court may increase the amount of the award to compensate for the time it reasonably spent on the fee defense."
2014.14-103,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1022.065,1025.965,Where does it fall within the (4)(A)?
2014.14-103,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1025.965,1030.68,"Justice Breyer, we don't think it's viewed as being subject to the (4)(A) at all. (4)(A) --"
2014.14-103,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1030.68,1041.36,"If it's not subject to (4)(A) at all -- I mean, (4)(A) forbids certain -- it says you can't -- cannot allow compensation for, and then, you know, it has the list there."
2014.14-103,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1044.79,1053.545,"Justice Breyer, (4) -- (4)(A), which appears on page 3(a) of the record of appendix, it describes limits on compensation for services."
2014.14-103,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1060.55,1063.0,So where -- where is the authorization to give it?
2014.14-103,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1063.0,1077.96,"In the authorization in Section 330(a)(1)(A) that says you can allow reasonable compensation for the underlying service that the bankruptcy professional has rendered in the bankruptcy case. So here, for example, Baker Botts prosecuted the -- the fraudulent conveyance action, among many other things."
2014.14-103,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1086.46,1095.15,Where does it say that you can get the money that's necessary for you to get the -- the money you pay to get the reasonable compensation. Where does it say you get that?
2014.14-103,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1095.15,1097.14,There's no explicit provision.
2014.14-103,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1097.14,1097.62,All right.
2014.14-103,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1115.69,1127.405,"Well, Justice Breyer, what I think is different about this is that the things that you have to do to get paid when you're a bankruptcy professional that we're here concerned with here are things that are creatures of the bankruptcy system itself and 330(a) itself."
2014.14-103,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1145.17,1147.58,So why isn't that in the administration?
2014.14-103,1,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1147.58,1150.04,"I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.14-103,2,56133,aaron_m_streett,,1150.04,1157.98,"Well, he claims that it could be on either a service, or a benefit, or a need in the administration of the estate."
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1157.98,1185.5,"So our view is that the problem with it is that sort of Section 330(a)(1)(A) is the sort of starting point, and it says reasonable compensation for actual necessary services rendered. And then (a)(4) limits which services are compensable. It says in order to be compensable, you either have to be necessary to the administration of the case or for the benefit of the debtor. We don't think that preparing and defending your own fee application is a service rendered at all. And so we don't think it's subject to the (a)(4) limits."
2014.14-103,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1185.5,1187.21,Why -- I'm sorry.
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1187.51,1202.05,"I was just going to say, instead, we think the question that the bankruptcy court should be asking is, do we need to provide some additional award to make the professional whole for the extra time and costs that they had to go through to vindicate their right to get their award of compensation for the underlying services that they --"
2014.14-103,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1202.05,1203.955,Sounds like a policy judgment.
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1220.08,1230.21,"Well, we -- we do think it makes a good sense, the rule that we're advocating, but we also think it's grounded in the statute and in the way that this Court has addressed other statutes that also provide for awards of reasonable attorneys fees."
2014.14-103,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1230.21,1238.895,"Why isn't the problem here better dealt with by sanctions? If a party like ASARCO makes frivolous objections, then they -- then sanctions can be imposed on them."
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1243.885,1245.6,"I absolutely agree, Justice Alito."
2014.14-103,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1279.81,1291.57,"No more so than -- than the -- the lawyer who submits a bill outside of bankruptcy to a client, and the client objects, and the lawyer has to -- has to litigate."
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1305.945,1306.89,That's true.
2014.14-103,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.89,1309.585,And why can't bankruptcy lawyers do the same thing?
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1309.585,1315.71,"Well, I think that would be contrary to the policy of the -- of the bankruptcy statute and the Section 330(a) in particular."
2014.14-103,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.71,1315.77,Why?
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1315.77,1322.035,Because the -- the problem that we're dealing with here is that it's true that litigation can arise between lawyers and clients over fee issues.
2014.14-103,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.035,1322.27,Right.
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1322.27,1331.16,"But the Section 330(a) creates a structure where it's not just your client that you have to please, and the showing that you have to make isn't just that I perform services that are within the terms of our contract."
2014.14-103,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1372.23,1392.68,"What was your reason for not going with the administration of the estate? And my intuitive judgment of it, which is pretty not totally informed, of course, is there -- there are loads of things that -- that -- that lawyers do who represent a trustee -- who represent debtors, that it will cost the estate a lot of money."
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1444.97,1447.465,"Well, Justice Breyer, we -- we basically take an earlier term."
2014.14-103,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1455.17,1455.23,No.
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1455.23,1455.34,Right.
2014.14-103,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1455.34,1458.09,"No, I understand your argument, and all know that's true about it."
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1473.905,1484.78,"So I -- I think if you were going to -- you disagree with our position and your view is that this is a service, and so the question is, Does it fall within either of the categories under Section 4 that make it compensable."
2014.14-103,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1489.88,1490.05,Yes.
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1490.05,1491.3,It's not for the benefit of the estate.
2014.14-103,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1491.3,1491.67,I know that.
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1494.625,1495.58,Because --
2014.14-103,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1495.58,1504.62,-- you -- you rejected. You had a reason for not doing what seems linguistically the simplest thing and say it is part of the administration.
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1508.02,1515.26,"Well, it's because linguistically -- I don't want to belabor the point -- but just linguistically, we don't think it's reasonable to describe this as a service rendered, and so we -- we don't get to the --"
2014.14-103,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1515.26,1517.525,The administration of the case.
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1517.525,1534.0,"But you only ask about administration of the case if you decide that it's a service rendered, right? Section (a)(4)(A) says, ""The court shall not allow compensation for services that were not reasonably likely to benefit the estate or that were not necessary to the administration of the case."" Our view is that defending your fee application --"
2014.14-103,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1534.0,1534.17,Service.
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1534.17,1538.98,"-- isn't a service that you're rendering to the client at all, and so you don't ask these questions."
2014.14-103,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1538.98,1539.52,Ah.
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1539.52,1545.3,But -- but I can also answer because if you disagree with us about that and you think it is a service and you think it is subject to the --
2014.14-103,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1545.3,1550.66,Is -- is there another part that says it's service to the estate rather than service to the case or something like that?
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1550.66,1563.905,"It's -- it's -- the term is used in 330(a) -- (a)(1)(A), which describes compensation for -- reasonable compensation for actual and necessary services rendered by a trustee and examiner or a professional person."
2014.14-103,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1563.905,1564.2,Render --
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1564.2,1567.01,I think the most natural read --
2014.14-103,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1567.01,1567.33,Okay.
2014.14-103,3,56123,brian_h_fletcher,,1568.185,1590.115,"But -- but just to answer the -- the question that you were posing before, you know, why did we -- why are we hesitant to say that this is a service that can be compensable if it's reasonable or necessary? It's, frankly, because ordinarily, services are compensable whether the attorney wins or loses, and we are very concerned about making sure that people don't get paid for unsuccessfully defending their fee applications, and that's what's led us to this interpretation."
2014.14-103,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1590.115,1595.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Oldham."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,1595.08,1623.27,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 330(a) of the bankruptcy code compensates all types of professionals for their services rendered for the estate under Section 327(a). But when adversarial fee litigation arises and a professional either hires a lawyer or just happens to be a lawyer and engages in purely self-interested fee litigation work at the expense of the estate, that is not a service rendered on behalf of the estate within the meaning of Section 330(a)"
2014.14-103,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1642.34,1645.03,So how does the fee fit into this?
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,1645.03,1645.68,I'm sorry?
2014.14-103,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1645.68,1648.94,"The -- the fee, the fee -- the fee preparation fee."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,1648.94,1650.52,And I want to go straight to that question.
2014.14-103,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1706.87,1716.515,"Mr. Oldham, why aren't they all tied together so you recognize that the application for the fee is compensable?"
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,1716.515,1717.25,Correct.
2014.14-103,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1717.25,1719.385,It's like the opening pleading.
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,1745.175,1768.02,"Well, I don't think they go together because Congress didn't put them together. What Congress authorized under Section 330(a)(1), especially when read together with Section 327(a), is that professionals are entitled to compensation when they're working for the estate. But when -- when professionals have hired their own lawyers or happen to be lawyers and are litigating adverse to the estate, that is not -- they're not on the same team anymore."
2014.14-103,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1851.74,1857.645,Do lawyers these days actually charge private clients for fee preparation?
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,1857.645,1858.415,No.
2014.14-103,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1887.07,1898.72,"Well, I've -- I've been out of practice for half a century, but my -- my -- my thought was that -- that -- that lawyers do -- do charge for the amount of time preparing the bill."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,1900.175,1901.19,"Well, again, I --"
2014.14-103,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1901.19,1902.65,We can -- we can check it out.
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,1902.65,1907.62,I think the only sense in which lawyers do that is to the extent that -- that it's built into overhead.
2014.14-103,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1914.92,1918.62,You ought to think -- might want to think about it. (Laughter.)
2014.14-103,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1918.62,1937.11,"Is -- is there any writing that says that when lawyers, outside bankruptcy, determine their -- their fee structures, that they include reimbursement for the risk that they might have to go into court to defend it? I've never heard that."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,1937.11,1946.67,"Well -- and we -- we cite the Gibbons-Grable case in our brief, but there's -- there's a number of things that go into, you know, rate setting of for law firms and one of them certainly is a risk of nonpayment."
2014.14-103,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1976.26,2008.28,"On that theory, if -- I mean, if -- if you're supposed to get some fees -- say, $100,000 -- and in that fee is -- is various risks of the extra money it'll cost to collect or the extra risk of you won't get it, you'll only get half and -- and you -- you set the rate at 100,000. And so now a different risk is eventuated -- namely, you had to go to litigation -- and that wasn't in the 100,000."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2032.265,2033.26,"That's right, Your Honor."
2014.14-103,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.2,2063.45,"Well, no, of course, it doesn't exist -- you're quite right -- outside of bankruptcy. But now you're saying that the 100,000 does include all kinds of -- for various payments for things that might make it more expensive to get the money."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2067.7,2068.75,"Well, I think --"
2014.14-103,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2068.75,2072.925,"And this is just one of them, I mean, the -- that you have to go into court and litigate, is just one of them."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2091.675,2093.86,"Well, I think we would object to that, Your Honor, and I --"
2014.14-103,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2093.86,2094.535,Because?
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2094.535,2101.99,"Because if -- if -- if the conscious decision is made that $100,000 is reasonable compensation for the services they're about to render --"
2014.14-103,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2101.99,2102.28,"No, no."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2117.17,2118.575,"I do, Your Honor."
2014.14-103,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2129.96,2130.21,All right.
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2130.21,2131.1,-- non-bankruptcy market.
2014.14-103,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2131.1,2132.62,Maybe this is not worth pursuing.
2014.14-103,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2132.62,2134.3,And that was -- that was my question.
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2142.895,2143.68,Yes.
2014.14-103,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2145.38,2150.46,The same rate that it would charge to a -- to a non-bankruptcy client.
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2150.46,2150.96,That's correct.
2014.14-103,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2165.04,2165.62,In the papers --
2014.14-103,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2165.62,2171.55,"Mr. Oldham, you -- you agree, don't you, that in this system, the court can do enhancements? Yes."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2171.55,2173.04,"Yeah, that's correct."
2014.14-103,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2175.92,2176.275,Yeah.
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2196.21,2198.8,"Well, there's -- I guess there's two responses to that."
2014.14-103,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2215.19,2215.37,"No, no, no."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2272.58,2280.8,"Well, I would agree with your characterization of the government's position that it is effectively authorizing a broad scope for -- for bankruptcy courts to just give enhancements."
2014.14-103,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2289.875,2314.195,"No, it does, because the text just says ""reasonable."" And then the question is what's reasonable? And ""reasonable"" can include, you know, you're getting the same hourly rate as some other lawyer, but ""reasonable"" is, also, you had to do this over a very extended period of time and ""reasonable"" is, also, boy, you had to spend a lot of money in order to get them to pay you anything at all."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2317.365,2319.77,Well -- and if I could make one more point on the text.
2014.14-103,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2332.31,2335.58,"Yeah, it's reasonable for all the other work you're doing."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2382.615,2396.19,"Well -- and to respond to that hypothetical, I think the difference is under -- in your hypothetical, to apply to 330(a)(1), would be Congress came in and said, you're going to get -- or you -- you told your -- you know, whoever is helping you, I will not pay you for bringing it to the courthouse."
2014.14-103,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2402.23,2404.47,But it doesn't say you can't get paid for it.
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2432.4,2438.68,"Well -- and, again, textually -- I won't belabor -- but textually, I think it disassociates reasonable compensation for services rendered."
2014.14-103,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2443.93,2452.315,"Well, it doesn't have to go be- -- I mean, I just don't understand what that means. It's this -- it's the clear service rendered, it's shoveling my driveway, it's doing the work for the estate."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2460.34,2461.94,And let me give you two other responses to that.
2014.14-103,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2478.25,2480.26,"But here's the problem, I think, with that response."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2497.755,2503.08,"Well, the American rule applies to litigation, and so obviously, in bankruptcy, you have some litigation, you have some non-litigation."
2014.14-103,4,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2522.52,2524.315,"Well, the American rule can't trump the statute."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2572.16,2576.74,"Well, and I think if that's the rationale then this Court's decision in Cooter and Gell would have come out the other way."
2014.14-103,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2588.0,2599.13,"What about other statutes? I was thinking the same thing, there are other statutes that provide -- that undo the American rule, and they say you're entitled, if you're victorious, to reasonable attorney's fees."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2603.4,2620.995,"Under -- under classics fee-shifting statutes where Congress -- the answer is yes, in a number of those cases, courts have said you get your fees on fees, but those statutes are very different textually, and, I think, in their rationale. Those statutes say that you get your reasonable attorney's fee incurred in an action."
2014.14-103,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2694.52,2695.99,Do you practice in bankruptcy?
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2695.99,2696.8,I'm sorry?
2014.14-103,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2696.8,2698.24,Do you practice in bankruptcy?
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2698.24,2699.085,"Yes, Your Honor."
2014.14-103,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2699.085,2705.235,And do you happen to know whether fee litigation is more common in bankruptcy than in other fields?
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2705.235,2709.7,"Well, there have been some studies that have tried to address that and see --"
2014.14-103,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2709.7,2709.79,Okay.
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2709.79,2734.36,"-- whether -- I mean, I think the argument that we have seen is more of a logical one, that there are more potential objectors in bankruptcy because a -- a party has to file their fee application, and theoretically more people get to review it, but I think there's a very strong argument that some courts have accepted that, outside of bankruptcy practice, there's a paying client in every single case who has the full incentive, because they're footing the bill, to study and object and litigate if they want."
2014.14-103,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2750.52,2761.225,"Well, all right, but if you look at the fee-shifting statutes, we looked up a lot, we found quite a few which say that the court can award a reasonable attorney's fee."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2761.225,2761.84,Correct.
2014.14-103,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2761.84,2775.515,"It's broader than here. But the words, basic active words are reasonable attorney's fees, and almost all of them have been interpreted to allow compensation for the reasonable fee."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2794.75,2795.75,"Well, it's reasonable --"
2014.14-103,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2795.75,2797.65,A reasonable compensation.
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2797.65,2799.55,"For services rendered, Your Honor."
2014.14-103,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2799.55,2802.69,There is a reasonable attorney's fee.
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2805.425,2809.24,"Well, when you excerpt just those parts, I agree with you, but I think you have to look at the full language --"
2014.14-103,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2809.24,2809.32,Yeah.
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2809.32,2820.955,"-- which is in the fee-shifting context, it is reasonable attorney's fees and then usually it says, incurred, and then it talks about a civil action, like in the Jean case, the Equal Access to Justice Act."
2014.14-103,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2849.36,2859.32,"But that happens later, everything's closed and they discover that through some odd thing they have to spend $10,000 to get the $90,000 that was awarded to them."
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2874.015,2879.23,"Well, if you're asking -- I mean, certainly the -- the bankruptcy court maintains some jurisdiction for a party to go back."
2014.14-103,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2879.23,2885.63,"But there's no -- just under all these other statutes, there is so many attorney's fees statutes that --"
2014.14-103,4,56134,jeffrey_oldham,,2885.63,2906.96,"There are, and let me just say that if we're going to, you know, sort of think about what rule might make sense, I think it's important to remember that the -- the fee-shifting statutes, just like Your Honors talked about, where it's true fee shifting, that is, there's a dispute that arises, the loser has to pay the, you know, the attorney's fees for the winner, Congress used that in the bankruptcy code. For example, if there's an automatic stay."
2014.14-103,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3104.38,3107.89,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Streett, four minutes."
2014.14-103,5,56133,aaron_m_streett,,3107.89,3119.265,"Thank you. The bankruptcy code uses broad, open-ended language and commits these questions to bankruptcy court discretion, and that's no different than the fee shifting statutes."
2014.14-103,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3123.24,3145.825,"Will you answer his last point? Why does it make any sense to say that the lawyer can get -- make his fee reasonable by getting his litigation expenses, but the accountant, who's also entitled to reasonable fees, cannot? If he has to sue, he has to pay his own lawyer, and you don't assert that that -- that that is compensable, do you?"
2014.14-103,5,56133,aaron_m_streett,,3145.825,3157.04,"We -- we do assert that would be compensable, either as an expense to the accountant or it could be included as part of the accountant's reasonable compensation for his underlying services on the bankruptcy, as the government argues."
2014.14-103,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3157.04,3157.54,"Oh, you do? Okay."
2014.14-103,5,56133,aaron_m_streett,,3158.855,3159.45,"Yes, we --"
2014.14-103,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3159.45,3162.36,I thought you said earlier the trustee had to approve it.
2014.14-103,5,56133,aaron_m_streett,,3169.555,3180.53,"The trustee would have to approve if those services were to be directly compensable, not if they were to be compensated as expenses or as part of the underlying reasonable compensation of the accountant."
2014.14-103,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3189.17,3193.12,Are there case authorities supporting the answers you gave?
2014.14-103,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3193.12,3194.195,It does eat those costs.
2014.14-103,5,56133,aaron_m_streett,,3194.195,3205.84,"Yes, we cite one that surveys the entire case law on this point in our reply brief, I believe it's footnote 4. To get back to Justice Breyer's question, you cannot read ""services"" in isolation."
2014.14-103,5,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3231.355,3254.575,"Except -- except that in Woods, looking at the predecessor statute, which also talked about services rendered, we held that the phrase ""reasonable compensation for services rendered,"" quote, this is us, ""necessarily implies loyal and disinterested service in the interest of those for whom the claimant purported to act."""
2014.14-103,5,56133,aaron_m_streett,,3254.575,3265.31,"And I'm glad Your Honor brought this up, because the idea that litigating a fee application is adverse to the estate, cannot be right. The code requires you to litigate the fee application if it's challenged."
2014.14-103,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3307.25,3316.84,"How do you answer the question about suppose the objection to the fee is sustained? Does the lawyer, nonetheless, get the work?"
2014.14-103,5,56133,aaron_m_streett,,3316.84,3351.57,"It would pass the minimal compensability threshold, but courts have consistently exercised their discretion for decades to deny that compensation, because the nature and value of unsuccessful defense is very different from that of a successful defense. And ASARCO is the one asking this Court to make a major change from the status quo that has prevailed across this country in the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions where courts have wisely and responsibly exercised their discretion to award fees where they are necessary to make the underlying fee reasonable, and to deny fees where the defense is unsuccessful or otherwise wasteful."
2014.14-103,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3358.425,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
