2009.08-351,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.076,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-351, Alvarez v. Smith."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,7.683,9.652,Mr. -- excuse me.
2009.08-351,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,50.448,70.406,Is there any other area -- is there any other area of law where we permit a prejudgment attachment and/or seizure of property without a neutral magistrate reviewing the reason for that seizure?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,75.308,83.603,"--Except in some narrow circumstances, and I note -- and certainly in garnishment cases and in replevin cases that you would have to have that type of hearing."
2009.08-351,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,88.255,88.692,But that's--
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,88.692,90.677,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-351,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,90.677,93.567,--I don't deny that there's a State interest.
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,104.703,113.746,"Your Honor, historically, that has always been at the civil forfeiture hearing, and that's going -- as I say, going back to Gelston, because what -- what Gelston recognized is that--"
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,113.746,119.225,"Mr. Castiglione, you have been asked to address the mootness question -- both counsel."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,119.225,119.791,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,119.791,124.708,Have forfeiture proceedings occurred in the plaintiffs' cases?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,130.659,134.987,"No -- Your Honor, the forfeiture cases have concluded, it's true."
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,135.424,137.581,Have concluded?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,137.581,138.267,--They have concluded.
2009.08-351,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,182.687,195.102,"Well, has there ever been a case in which this Court has considered the merits of a dispute where the individual claims of the named plaintiffs expired before we heard argument and a -- and a class had not yet been certified?"
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,195.102,196.666,"That's not the case here, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,208.754,209.783,"No, but that wasn't my question."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,211.893,213.203,"No, it has not, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,213.749,217.497,And the -- the claims of all the named plaintiffs are -- have expired?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,217.497,226.7,"Well, the injunctive claims may have expired, with the possible exception of the two Respondents whose -- whose cash cases were defaulted."
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,229.635,234.975,There were no damage claims when the final judgment was entered in the district court?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,234.975,236.74,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,236.74,239.49,"So it was a final judgment, and it went up on appeal."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,254.234,274.85,"Well, but after the -- the Seventh Circuit reversed the district judge's decision granting the motion to dismiss, upon -- upon remand, the plaintiffs -- then, at that point, asked for a certification of the damage class and a restitution class and expressly stated that they wished to pursue a claim -- a claim for damages and restitution based on--"
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,274.85,275.552,But--
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,275.552,278.099,"It wasn't granted then, and it still hasn't been granted."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,278.099,278.91,"--That's true, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,279.285,286.954,"So you have nobody before this Court with a live claim, neither the original named plaintiffs nor a certified class."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,286.954,288.545,--I would -- well--
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.545,288.872,So who's here?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,288.872,297.744,"--For -- for mootness purposes, Your Honor, I think the -- the fact that plaintiffs were allowed to ask for damages and -- and filed a pleading asking--"
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,297.744,300.521,--They did not ask for damages originally.
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,300.521,301.397,"--No, they did not."
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,301.397,306.3,"So as the case comes to us, we have a district court final judgment dismissing the case."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,314.422,315.217,Yes.
2009.08-351,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,315.217,321.561,"I -- I suppose, if the case is moot, then you are entitled to a Munsingwear order."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,321.561,321.998,I would--
2009.08-351,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,321.998,323.745,So there's no controlling authority.
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,323.745,325.497,"--We would -- that's our position, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,325.497,335.351,And then I suppose the district court doesn't know whether to award damages or not until it gets a final decision from -- or a decision from the Seventh Circuit or this Court.
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,335.351,336.322,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,363.544,367.587,"If it been there originally, but the problem is it wasn't there."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,374.759,387.222,"That -- with the possible exception of the two Respondents whose claims defaulted, Your Honor, in that it's unclear what it -- to the extent they were seeking the return of their property, their situation has not changed."
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.126,391.39,What were they seeking to have enjoined?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,391.39,407.276,"They were seeking, Your Honor -- they were asking the court to declare that the Illinois statute was unconstitutional for not providing an interim hearing, and an injunction preventing -- preventing Illinois from enforcing the statute."
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.276,417.724,"But -- I -- since they defaulted in the -- in the final hearing, how can -- can they possibly have any claim left with regard to an interim hearing?"
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,417.724,420.239,"Well, I just think the nature of their claim hasn't changed."
2009.08-351,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,433.937,444.432,"So am I forgetting, but didn't this start out as a class action and wasn't the claim -- wasn't the class action denied?"
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,444.432,446.4,"--It was denied as moot, that's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,446.4,447.773,And you didn't appeal that?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,447.773,452.507,"Well, we didn't -- we didn't appeal at all."
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,464.69,468.265,And the plaintiffs -- the plaintiffs didn't appeal the denial of certification.
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,468.265,471.374,"The two -- well, no, Your Honor, they did not."
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,477.227,481.275,"Well, maybe we should -- we should ask the plaintiffs about that."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,487.959,497.001,"I'm saying they may not be moot, Your Honor, in that the claim for relief has not -- and they defaulted before, in at least one of the cases, before the complaint was even filed."
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,504.953,513.325,"You said in your opening that there is just the one proceeding, and that's the petition for forfeiture."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,544.373,557.011,"Well, maybe I can explain, and I think it also goes to the -- what is -- why the 8,850 -- the use of 8,850 and the Barker speedy trial factors makes sense."
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.5,585.793,And they -- and they can do that before the -- before the time period has expired?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,585.793,586.499,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,592.731,600.99,"But surely your position is going to be that the statutory procedure pre-empts and takes the place of any Slocum hearing, isn't it?"
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,615.313,626.169,"--Well, I -- the -- what Slocum does, Your Honor, we think -- we believe that Illinois has recognized for at least over 50 years that a property owner has a common law right to come in."
2009.08-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,626.169,629.012,But that was before the statute was enacted.
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,629.012,631.215,"That's certainly true, Your Honor, but that--"
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,631.215,633.886,The statute is a dead letter if you allow a Slocum action.
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,643.881,648.221,"--Well, Slocum I think is a way of getting into court, getting the government--"
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,648.221,648.958,Exactly.
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,650.424,668.057,"--Well, once -- once the government does act, Your Honor, then at that point I'd say if in fact the government's being -- once the government files a forfeiture action, if the government's dilatory, there's remedies under -- under Illinois law, our Code of Civil Procedure, or even perhaps a motion to dismiss for--"
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,668.057,673.571,"But the statute says the government isn't dilatory until -- until the time period, 40 days."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,677.522,681.956,"--Oh, the -- I think -- I think certainly, Your Honor, the government does have the time periods."
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.513,696.154,Before the 40 days?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,696.154,697.573,"No, I would say after the 40."
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,698.072,698.622,"Oh, okay."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,715.379,718.581,"--Well, I would say Slocum provides a hearing after 40 days, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.518,726.267,"It doesn't have to do anything for 40 days, is what the statute says."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,726.267,727.658,And we don't dispute that.
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,728.204,737.699,"But you say if it -- you don't dispute that doesn't have to do anything, but you -- you assert that if it does nothing, you can bring a Slocum action."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,740.261,742.324,"--Well, Slocum is an equitable remedy."
2009.08-351,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,753.317,756.41,Slocum then is the answer to a very different case.
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,767.952,777.68,"--Well, our position, Your Honor, is that the -- the statute -- is the regime that Illinois has adopted with the time periods, does -- does comply with due process."
2009.08-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,782.571,787.211,But isn't the basic argument that you make that a forfeiture hearing is all the process that is due?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,787.211,787.929,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,787.929,798.189,"Now, let me ask you this question: Suppose your statute said there shall be a forfeiture hearing with all the procedures you want, but the forfeiture hearing shall take place 1 year after the seizure."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,799.69,805.968,"Under this Court's view -- decision in FDIC v. Mallen, I don't think you would look to the outer limits, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,806.436,807.356,"Yes, I'm saying the minimum."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,814.59,821.995,"--Again, applying -- well, if it is possible for the States to do it in a shorter fashion--"
2009.08-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,821.995,824.226,"Clearly, it's possible to do it in less than a year."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,824.226,826.132,"--And if a State -- if a State's practice were to do so, but I would say--"
2009.08-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,826.132,830.176,"Well, there is no practice, no background practice."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,837.036,837.411,--One year later.
2009.08-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.411,837.894,--or a year later.
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,838.55,843.002,"Well, that's shorter than the time period that this Court found complied with due process in 8,850--"
2009.08-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.002,844.343,"Well, I understand what the Court has held."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,846.89,849.948,--I think -- I think--
2009.08-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.948,857.368,"And if you agree that it's unconstitutional, then you have to agree that time is -- is relevant to the question whether the forfeiture hearing--"
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,857.368,859.727,--I would not agree -- I would not agree that it's unconstitutional.
2009.08-351,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,859.727,863.459,--So you would then say it would be constitutional to say one hearing 1 year later?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,863.459,864.976,I think facially it is.
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,864.976,865.787,Ten years?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,865.787,869.16,"Well, I think, again, I'd go back to FDIC v.--"
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,869.16,869.644,Ten years?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,869.644,872.689,"--Well, no, I would say 10 years without any judicial intervention--"
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,872.689,874.72,"You've -- you've given up the position, then."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,883.187,886.279,"--Well, 40 days I think is consistent, is I think a reasonable--"
2009.08-351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,886.279,887.589,"It may be, but that's a different argument."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,894.024,904.99,"--If -- if -- I would say this: If the statute said you can't come in -- the State said you can't proceed for 10 years and no one has any -- property owner or interest owner has no way of going into court, that probably would be--"
2009.08-351,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,904.99,916.5,"I ask you this about the government's interest involved here and the practicality of the situation, and I want to put aside the innocent owner defense, which I hope to ask your adversary about."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,962.76,964.199,--I think there are several burdens.
2009.08-351,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,986.017,988.17,"I mean, he was just talking about probable cause."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,989.437,990.482,"Well, just something along the line--"
2009.08-351,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,990.482,1002.384,"Look, I thought this case, though I grant you I could well be wrong, is not about a final forfeiture hearing where you have to show that it's more probable than not that the car was used for drugs."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,1011.254,1012.611,--Yes.
2009.08-351,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1012.611,1014.3,And there are lists of circumstances.
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,1037.947,1046.207,"Well, first of all, Justice Breyer, we say the complete deprivation of one's liberty is not the same as the deprivation of property."
2009.08-351,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1062.747,1065.528,So you're saying the answer to the question is there is no way?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,1073.305,1074.946,--It does merge with the merits.
2009.08-351,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1075.601,1076.1,Okay.
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,1077.773,1078.943,"--Well, there's still a--"
2009.08-351,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1078.943,1079.899,Then I don't see why you win this case.
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,1079.899,1080.913,--there's no formal hearing.
2009.08-351,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1080.913,1081.256,What?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,1081.256,1082.804,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1082.804,1084.535,"I mean, is there a way or not?"
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,1087.05,1091.222,Those statutes are a way to getting into -- to getting into court--
2009.08-351,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1091.222,1091.705,Look--
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,1091.705,1092.688,--to expedite the hearing.
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1097.546,1100.011,How do you get an expedited hearing?
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,1111.714,1118.133,"Forty-five of those days, Your Honor, is what would be the property owner deciding whether to file a claim."
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1138.328,1141.842,"And the bond is for costs, not to get your car back."
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,1141.842,1142.092,"The bond is for costs, right."
2009.08-351,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1142.653,1150.823,"Is there -- is there any procedure for putting up a bond for the car so you can get the car back, for the full value of the car?"
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,1150.823,1151.728,"--There isn't, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1185.459,1190.488,We will afford you additional time because the Court's questions have intruded upon your rebuttal time.
2009.08-351,0,37796,paul_castiglione,,1190.488,1191.222,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1191.222,1205.763,Mr. Jay.
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1205.763,1218.211,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to begin, if I may, with the colloquy that Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia had with my co-counsel about the hypothetical where the State mandates a minimum time--"
2009.08-351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1218.211,1220.726,"Well, I would think you'd begin with the mootness question."
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1220.726,1222.66,"--I would be happy to begin with the mootness question, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.973,1267.832,"Well, what were they seeking to enjoin?"
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1267.832,1272.406,"It's not entirely clear from their complaint, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1305.236,1307.627,What did the Illinois court do?
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1312.626,1319.606,"Your Honor, the Seventh Circuit remanded for the district court to fashion -- to fashion some kind of procedure, that's right."
2009.08-351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1348.123,1355.216,Am I right that what is -- what is the rationale your supporting it for the following: My car was parked on the street.
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1400.166,1408.974,"Well, let me begin, Your Honor, by pointing out that it's not the law, because the State's ultimate burden at the hearing is not preponderance of the evidence; it's probable cause."
2009.08-351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1411.801,1415.721,You mean they can keep my car even if it's more likely than not that it was never involved?
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1415.721,1424.342,"--When the -- when the State shows probable cause, the burden shifts to the claimant to prove by a preponderance -- so the ultimate burden is by a preponderance."
2009.08-351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1424.342,1424.748,"But it's still -- okay, fine."
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1424.748,1425.372,But it's--
2009.08-351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1425.372,1425.762,Thank you.
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1444.285,1445.098,"--And, Justice Breyer, you--"
2009.08-351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1445.098,1447.407,"And the Florida statute, by the way, doesn't do that."
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1450.89,1452.688,--The Florida statute--
2009.08-351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1452.688,1453.093,Am I right?
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1453.093,1464.932,"--The Florida statute -- you are correct -- unique as far as I know among all the statutes legislated by the 50 States that use asset forfeiture or the Federal Government, does provide an adversarial probable cause hearing within the--"
2009.08-351,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.932,1465.244,Okay.
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1482.017,1490.84,"--The constitutional justification, Justice Breyer, requires that a reviewing court look at each step in the process, and it's not just a matter of 6 months from beginning to end."
2009.08-351,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1507.881,1508.723,I'm sorry.
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1510.553,1514.815,"--Your Honor, there's more to investigate than just the probable cause to seize."
2009.08-351,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1532.759,1535.664,But -- but you are -- but you're sort of begging the question.
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1587.115,1589.346,--Let me respond to that in a couple of steps.
2009.08-351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.914,1696.863,May I just get you to answer what I thought you were going to do at the beginning of the argument.
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1703.5,1712.621,"--And that, of course, as I think the hypothetical recognizes, Justice Stevens, is different from a statute like we have here where there's a maximum time, but it may well take place within--"
2009.08-351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1712.621,1712.886,I understand it's different.
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1714.119,1717.305,"--My answer, Justice Stevens, is that it might well be unconstitutional as applied."
2009.08-351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1718.978,1720.179,Wouldn't it be unconstitutional on its face?
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1720.179,1730.831,"--It wouldn't be unconstitutional on its face, Justice Stevens, because sometimes the State has a valid interest in holding property for more than a year, as Mr. Castiglione said."
2009.08-351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.811,1740.873,Would that justify a statute that says in all cases it shall be held for at least 18 months without telling the owner?
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1740.873,1756.583,"--I think, Your Honor, that if the State responded to an 8,850 defense and said -- and said nothing other than the statute says 18 months or 10 years, and -- you know, and we have done nothing during that time, I think that it would be unconstitutional as applied."
2009.08-351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1791.867,1804.645,Suppose a situation in which the property taken is really essential to the -- to the living of the person from whom -- who owns it -- a car -- and the person needs a car to get to work every day.
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1822.715,1830.289,"--I think that as the Federal framework reflects, that is the kind of situation that is -- that can be addressed by legislation."
2009.08-351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1854.434,1855.701,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-351,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1855.701,1859.136,There is no -- there's no hardship under the Illinois statute?
2009.08-351,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1864.651,1868.024,"You are correct, Justice Ginsburg, that there is no statutory provision, no."
2009.08-351,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1868.024,1868.508,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,1871.398,1878.378,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is not moot."
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.928,1953.393,And you say it was likely to -- these same named plaintiffs were likely -- likely -- to face this same situation again?
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,1953.393,1955.234,"--No, that's not what I'm saying, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.235,1958.341,"Well, if you are relying on -- on, you know,"
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,1967.232,1969.962,"--I respectfully beg to differ, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.657,1992.251,You are begging the question.
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2002.401,2004.979,"Well, I -- I can make that argument--"
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2004.979,2006.341,Just an asserted class on your part.
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2007.199,2009.698,"--Yes, and that was also true in Geraghty, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2011.383,2011.882,"No, it wasn't."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2017.77,2019.521,"--Yes, it did, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2019.521,2025.238,So both issues -- both the merits and the denial of the class certification -- were still active before the Court.
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2030.468,2034.015,"Well, we couldn't, Your Honor, because it was inextricably linked to the merits."
2009.08-351,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2034.904,2049.539,"But -- but in many appeals parties plead in the alternative and say, if you -- if we win on the merits, reverse the dismissal of the class certification because we still want to proceed as a class."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2057.569,2065.392,--I don't think that it is significantly different when one considers the concerns that animated the Court's decision in Geraghty.
2009.08-351,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2095.285,2099.548,"Mr. Peters, I think the Court in Geraghty said it split the interests."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2124.753,2129.971,"I -- I certainly agree that it is not an identical situation, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2162.567,2170.471,"But we must take it as it came into the Seventh Circuit, which is no appeal from the denial of class certification."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2181.203,2205.52,"--That was -- that was all that was before the Seventh Circuit because I don't -- it seems to me that it is just sort of a gratuitous gesture to say, I am appealing the denial of the class certification ruling, when the class certification ruling is itself based entirely on the denial of the merits."
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.684,2228.087,As it turns out it -- it wouldn't have been gratuitous.
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2228.259,2231.051,"--Well -- I understand Your Honor's position, although I--"
2009.08-351,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2231.051,2241.589,"But if I have a different position, which is I'd like to see if it's practical to decide this case now, two things stand in the way in my mind which I'd like you to address."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2338.796,2342.31,--I think that -- that waiting would be the prudent thing to do.
2009.08-351,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2369.673,2376.111,"Well, but then if it's -- if it's money that is being conditionally released, there's no security for the government."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2379.094,2384.106,"Well, there -- there could be grounds for -- there could be ways of getting security for it."
2009.08-351,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2402.097,2402.893,May I ask you--
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2402.893,2403.236,Sure.
2009.08-351,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2403.236,2406.063,--exactly what you think needs to take place at this hearing?
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2410.875,2411.203,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2419.543,2421.727,"Well, whatever the period is: 10 days, 14 days, whatever."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2423.369,2423.899,Yes.
2009.08-351,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2423.899,2433.956,"I have two questions: Must it be an adversarial hearing, and must the State disprove the innocent owner defense?"
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2433.956,2435.957,No and no.
2009.08-351,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2455.699,2467.647,"Well, but my understanding of Krimstock is that a lot of those seizures -- and others know more about this than I do -- were for DWI, and that it is possible to assert an innocent owner defense there."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2488.841,2498.165,"Well, if there was -- my answer to that, I think, Your Honor, is in two parts: One is the Federal Government is already doing something like that with the CAFRA."
2009.08-351,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2509.942,2513.721,I thought that -- I thought the government said it doesn't apply to cash.
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2518.248,2520.265,--The CAFRA doesn't apply to cash.
2009.08-351,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2520.936,2521.451,Right.
2009.08-351,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2521.451,2525.81,"Well, let me give you this example which is pretty much based on something that you -- you wrote in your own brief."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2554.405,2554.545,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2554.545,2558.2,--reason to believe that Joe was involved in drug dealing?
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2558.2,2559.198,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.287,2579.19,I thought you said -- I thought you said the innocent owner defense didn't have to be inquired into in the probable cause here.
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2581.015,2586.326,It -- it is not ordered by the Seventh Circuit but I -- we would believe that an innocent owner--
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2586.326,2587.293,"Okay, you want--"
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2587.293,2588.885,"--argument should be included, and--"
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2588.885,2589.59,--Okay.
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2595.334,2595.759,"--No, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.759,2596.149,No?
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2596.149,2596.773,As applied.
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2596.773,2598.477,Just as applied?
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2598.477,2600.755,"Yes, we made that clear in the complaint."
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2603.208,2604.225,"No, how can you have an--"
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2604.225,2605.208,--to the contrary until this Court.
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2605.208,2608.597,--How can you have an as-applied challenge to an entire class?
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2608.597,2625.557,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, what we're suggesting, the order of the Seventh Circuit does not invalidate any provision of this Act and in fact it's entirely consistent with section 2 of the Act, which incorporates by reference Federal remedies which include interim remedies."
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2636.177,2652.954,"Why -- why -- to -- to have an as-applied challenge, regardless of whether the Illinois law provides a -- a remedy, wouldn't you be able to individually assert under section 1983 unconstitutional action?"
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2667.071,2670.977,"--There is a Federal remedy, Your Honor, but that is not--"
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2670.977,2671.632,Why isn't that enough?
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2671.632,2688.314,"--That's -- that's certainly not enough, Your Honor, for the following reason: It is largely impractical for most people -- many of the people who are involved in drug forfeiture seizures are people with modest to low incomes, probably little to no access to attorneys."
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2696.309,2700.778,"But they will know about the probable cause hearing that you want to -- that you want set up, right?"
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2700.778,2707.242,"--If -- this is why it should be a class, and it clearly applies to a large class of people."
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2707.242,2710.741,Which -- which is why you are asking for a facial challenge.
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2713.193,2713.693,"No, Your--"
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2713.693,2716.364,--regardless of what the individual circumstances are; isn't that so?
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2716.364,2717.911,"--No, that is not so."
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2717.911,2718.676,It is not so?
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2718.676,2720.204,"Yes, and the reason is--"
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2720.204,2723.109,"Well, what are the individual circumstances of all the other people in the class?"
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2730.936,2732.281,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2775.652,2787.351,"What if -- what if at your innocent owner or the hearing that you are seeking, you establish, well, I was going to sell my baseball card to give me the money to -- to survive, to get food?"
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2789.334,2814.246,"--There would have to be -- first of all, we don't know how that would administratively be handled because of the posture of the case, but my suggestion, Mr. Chief Justice, would be this: That the likely result in a case -- in this case, is that there should be hearings for all car owners and that there should be a baseline dollar value below which a person is not entitled to a hearing."
2009.08-351,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2814.842,2819.339,"So just to get back to the cars, I thought your answer to Justice Alito was a little abstract."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2827.274,2827.695,--Yes.
2009.08-351,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2827.695,2831.598,"At your hearing, the -- it's not registered to him."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2840.656,2849.45,"Well, in -- in those circumstances and that's the only car, I would say, most likely, the property should be returned to the car owner."
2009.08-351,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2865.618,2866.679,"Well, aren't they always going to say that?"
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2893.541,2901.509,"--Well, I don't think that that is likely to happen, and I think what's going on in New York is proof that that is not how it works out, and I think--"
2009.08-351,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2901.509,2905.833,"Well, the situation is much worse than that, that they don't have the -- that they need time to investigate."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2929.808,2929.87,"--No, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2930.838,2936.492,"--Well, then I don't understand how this -- how you can possibly have the innocent owner issue adjudicated at this quick hearing."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,2959.511,2960.54,"Well, except--"
2009.08-351,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2960.54,2964.289,"Counsel, can you unpackage for me this hearing?"
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3053.953,3060.828,"--Yes, Your Honor, but let me go back in response to your question and, I think, in part to Justice Alito's."
2009.08-351,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3082.24,3085.02,Isn't that one of the problems with the Seventh Circuit decision?
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3133.811,3140.199,"--I think it's invalid as applied to categories of people, but I would continue to maintain--"
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3140.199,3148.119,You think -- you think it's unconstitutional as applied to everybody who is not given this -- this preliminary hearing.
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3166.626,3170.626,--On that--
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3170.626,3175.996,"I mean, just -- just because you don't say in your complaint, this is a facial challenge, it amounts to a facial challenge."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3184.26,3191.724,"--The Seventh Circuit, however, did not endorse completely what we alleged in the complaint."
2009.08-351,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3210.87,3210.948,"Okay, can we--"
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3210.948,3211.447,There are--
2009.08-351,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3211.447,3212.133,--Go ahead.
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3212.492,3219.098,--There are going to be circumstances when the value of the property is de minimis as compared to the cost of the hearing.
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3220.007,3221.972,That is not the class you asked to be certified.
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3226.395,3240.51,"--Yes, I -- I did, Your Honor, and in that regard, I was mistaken, but the Seventh Circuit corrected my mistake and only ordered a remand for a determination as to who it would be, who would be entitled to--"
2009.08-351,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3240.51,3240.76,Where -- where does the Seventh Circuit--
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3240.76,3247.6,It doesn't change this -- this action from a class action -- from a facial challenge into a nonfacial challenge.
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3257.049,3274.136,"--Well, Your Honor, I think what the Seventh Circuit did does change it because now the ruling is what was determined by the Seventh Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit did not say that every single person is entitled to a hearing."
2009.08-351,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3274.136,3276.086,"Well, can I get to the merits for a second?"
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3276.086,3276.932,"Yes, sir."
2009.08-351,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3276.932,3279.556,Go back to what Justice Alito and Justice Sotomayor were asking.
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3293.158,3293.61,Yes.
2009.08-351,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3293.61,3294.425,All right.
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3332.7,3333.371,Some of them are worth--
2009.08-351,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3333.371,3333.777,But if you go to the other--
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3333.777,3334.525,--a lot of money.
2009.08-351,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3334.931,3348.973,"--If you go to the other, which is whether there's an innocent owner or whether in fact you should give bail to the property -- I mean, that's -- I know we give bail to people, but I don't know that we give bail to property."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3361.279,3362.328,I don't--
2009.08-351,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3362.328,3367.214,And why do you give up in respect to baseball cards or anything in effect to the first?
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3367.214,3396.776,"--Well, I wouldn't like to give up my favorite baseball card, but the reason that I said that, Your Honor, is this: The Mathews criteria, which we are espousing here, require a cost-benefit analysis, and if the value of the property under that -- using that criteria does not warrant a hearing, then as to that property, there shouldn't be a hearing."
2009.08-351,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3400.028,3408.21,"So it's as -- so it's as applied in every case, which I think ties in a little bit to the mootness question that we began with."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3419.456,3437.682,"--I -- I continue to maintain, Your Honor, that the -- as long as there was standing when the case was filed, and as long as there is a live class that could be represented by these class -- or putative class--"
2009.08-351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3437.682,3440.244,"""My potential class"", you should call it."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3440.244,3440.65,--Potential class.
2009.08-351,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3511.102,3512.338,"Well, that's an interesting -- that's an interesting question."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3520.398,3534.706,"--No, what -- what I'm saying, Your Honor, is if we're -- if we're defining mootness as the ultimate return of the property, then the property was returned pursuant to settlements in four of the cases."
2009.08-351,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3558.399,3567.173,"Of course, all of these problems really arise out of the fact that the effect of the court of appeals' decision basically was to overrule the motion to dismiss, left everything open on remand."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3588.508,3590.692,"--I certainly agree with that, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3594.067,3596.251,The mootness -- the mootness decision won't really decide anything.
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3598.642,3599.628,--Yes.
2009.08-351,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3599.628,3608.308,"But if you just say, we -- probably, in my judgment, we ought to dismiss this writ as improvidently granted and let the record be developed and the case go by, and we could decide the issues."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3608.308,3611.639,"That, it seems to me, is a very wise choice of action."
2009.08-351,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3611.639,3615.464,--But where you said -- you said that--
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3615.464,3616.4,For obvious reasons.
2009.08-351,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3616.946,3629.397,"--the Seventh Circuit -- your complaint, you say, is -- you asked for the universe, every kind of property of due process hearing within 10 days or a short period."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3644.792,3646.059,"--Well, they--"
2009.08-351,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3646.059,3647.526,Where -- where is there any narrowing?
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3647.526,3656.756,"--Well, the narrowing, as I perceive it, Your Honor, is this: I believe the Court said at different times whether an appropriate remedy can be fashioned."
2009.08-351,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3687.526,3688.322,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-351,2,43200,thomas_peters,,3688.322,3689.679,Thank you.
2009.08-351,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3689.679,3692.506,"Mr. Castiglione, why don't you take 3 minutes?"
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3692.506,3693.617,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3709.203,3709.843,I thought they didn't.
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3712.421,3715.623,"One did, Your Honor, but it wasn't in response to the Federal litigation."
2009.08-351,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3720.029,3723.979,The mootness was not a result of any settlement between the city and--
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3723.979,3724.385,That's correct.
2009.08-351,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3727.821,3729.166,--Your -- your friend said the opposite.
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3729.915,3733.678,"Well, it settled, Your Honor, just as through a normal course."
2009.08-351,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3737.722,3739.675,--I don't understand.
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3739.675,3740.58,"Well, I'm--"
2009.08-351,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3740.58,3742.907,They got all of their property back?
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3742.907,3743.766,"--Oh, no, no."
2009.08-351,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3751.888,3753.67,"No, I don't understand."
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3755.717,3756.076,Yes.
2009.08-351,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3756.076,3758.841,"The people who had money at stake, what happened to the money?"
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3758.841,3763.088,Two of them -- two defaulted and one reached a settlement with the State.
2009.08-351,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3763.088,3763.618,A settlement?
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3763.618,3763.743,"Yes, sir."
2009.08-351,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3763.743,3768.443,So you have at least one case where the mootness is attributable to a settlement.
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3778.394,3779.705,"No, I understand, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3788.84,3793.777,But we don't do Munsingwear orders where -- where the mootness is a result of a settlement.
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3793.777,3797.275,"Our position, Your Honor, is that the settlement wasn't in response."
2009.08-351,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3804.695,3808.147,I thought your answer is that they didn't all settle.
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3808.147,3809.738,They all didn't settle.
2009.08-351,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3812.471,3814.69,"Well, what good would a Munsingwear order do, anyway?"
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3816.375,3817.127,They could.
2009.08-351,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3817.127,3817.923,Yes.
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3817.923,3820.236,"They certainly could, if you -- they have the right to do that, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3820.236,3831.072,"And then if the district judge said -- having read this opinion, which was vacated, says, well, I guess it states a cause of action, I will deny the motion to dismiss -- we would be exactly where we are now."
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3831.072,3832.414,We -- and we would.
2009.08-351,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3833.1,3837.054,Can I just get clarification?
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3844.737,3845.751,There--
2009.08-351,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3845.751,3846.129,Not a defense--
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3846.129,3846.659,--Right.
2009.08-351,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3846.659,3849.985,--but the examples Judge Breyer said: My car was just sitting there.
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3849.985,3851.28,"There is not, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3853.685,3853.966,All right.
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3872.348,3875.191,"Not that we -- Illinois doesn't provide for a bond, Your Honor."
2009.08-351,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3881.317,3897.917,"Well, that may be part of the Mathews issue, that once you prove probable cause, giving away -- giving back money just never would probably be rational to hold a hearing about, but that might not be true for real property, correct?"
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3901.965,3902.932,--I'm not sure I understand Your Honor's question.
2009.08-351,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3902.932,3904.008,If you apply a Mathews analysis--
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3904.008,3904.508,Yes.
2009.08-351,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3904.508,3915.961,"--the multifaceted item would say for the seizure of cash, maybe only the hearing has to address probable cause, but for real property it has to go further."
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3925.971,3927.391,Let me attempt to address that.
2009.08-351,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3954.129,3955.112,"Thank you, Counsel."
2009.08-351,3,37796,paul_castiglione,,3956.267,3956.969,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
