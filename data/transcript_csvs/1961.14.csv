1961.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.444,"Number 14, Harold Beck Kesler, versus Department of Public Safety, Financial Responsibility Division, State of Utah."
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,13.132,17.791,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,358.883,373.182,"Mr. Skeen, did the court below determine whether the petitioner had complied with the -- with the provisions of state law concerning the restoration?"
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,373.182,405.944,"We submitted the case on a stipulated set of facts which outlined what the judgment debtor had done and it's clear in this case that there was a request by the judgment creditor under the statute and we think it's very clear that the -- before starting the proceeding, the bankrupt made a timely application to have his license restored."
1961.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,405.944,407.571,But did he comply with the Act?
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,419.173,419.372,Yes.
1961.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,419.372,420.551,-- at least notwithstanding.
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,426.356,449.763,The Court made no formal findings in the case we submitted it on the stipulated set of facts to the three-judge court and the -- it's certainly clear that there is no question about that based on the case before the three-judge court.
1961.14,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,455.305,466.991,Does that bar this Court from considering whether there isn't relief for him under the state law which he has not exhausted?
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,513.934,519.424,"Well, I might answer it in this way, Your Honor."
1961.14,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,559.672,567.565,"Well, you're -- neither your state agency, your Supreme Court held that the debt was not discharged."
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,577.366,583.532,"If he -- if he were sued on the debt, of course, the discharge would be controlling --"
1961.14,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,583.532,584.855,So that -- so that --
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,584.855,586.13,There's no question about that.
1961.14,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,586.13,596.368,"So that the -- what your state agency did as approved by your Supreme Court is not to say that the debt isn't discharged, didn't say that."
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,623.256,637.593,"Well, of course admittedly, the cases hold that the Bankruptcy Act simply destroys the procedure to collect the debt."
1961.14,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,637.593,638.065,Right.
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,638.065,639.879,The debt is still there.
1961.14,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,844.985,846.968,But may I ask you not to mention --
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,846.968,848.266,Sir.
1961.14,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,848.266,856.639,"Your Act is not like the New York statute even apart from those amendments, is it?"
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,876.846,878.477,That's right.
1961.14,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,901.995,935.497,"What do you say to, apart from the difference that Justice Whittaker just called attention, what do you say to the consideration given by Judge Hand in writing in Reitz against Mealey for the three District Court -- for the District Court, what do you say to the considerations of Judge Hand that this business of spelling out in the statute that the creditor should ask a clerk to forward the judgment."
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,978.112,981.445,"Well, that's of course is a good question."
1961.14,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1005.41,1005.759,But your statute --
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1005.759,1007.163,-- or permanently.
1961.14,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1007.163,1015.373,Your statute doesn't give -- doesn't give him that control and if he fulfills the condition to which the Chief Justice has referred.
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1015.373,1015.569,The --
1961.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1015.569,1028.147,"Mr. Skeen, that's the reason I asked you if that particular portion of your Act had been passed on by the court below?"
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1028.147,1035.325,"Well, the Court did not pass on the question as it's been presented to be here."
1961.14,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1073.384,1096.694,"Well, drivers who bring about sometimes gas or certainly loss of injury to one sort or another, dangerous ones at times, such drivers of greater hazard, if they don't have to pay any consequence for their negligence to disregard the rules of the road, isn't that true?"
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1096.694,1096.899,That's true.
1961.14,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1096.899,1100.738,So that the State has an interest in deciding who shall have a license.
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1145.442,1145.598,But --
1961.14,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1145.598,1148.854,-- to a certain act.
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1148.854,1152.371,"That's alright as far as it goes, Your Honor, but --"
1961.14,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1152.371,1153.472,"It doesn't have to go very far, (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1153.472,1160.841,It doesn't make him a better driver -- doesn't make him a better driver because he happens to be able to pay.
1961.14,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1162.193,1162.452,"Certainly, (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1162.452,1174.386,"He -- he's still may be a bad risk on the highway, but a driver who can pay, turn over the money is free to use the highway."
1961.14,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1174.386,1174.721,He may --
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1174.721,1183.786,"Whereas one who's a poor man and can't pay, he is permanently deprived of using an automobile."
1961.14,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1183.786,1200.304,"But wouldn't it be permissible in either case for the State in the exercise of its -- (Voice Overlap) -- you shall be -- it can have a certain accident, be prohibited from driving for a classified reasonable appearance."
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1200.304,1206.798,"Well, I think personally that there's a great merit to that suggestion."
1961.14,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1206.798,1211.154,"But isn't that the difference between the Reitz case, the New York statute than your statute."
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1211.154,1213.584,That's one important difference.
1961.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1218.483,1227.999,"Well, there is a escape hatch though, this provision about subsequently showing financial responsibility."
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1227.999,1229.257,Plus paying.
1961.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1229.257,1230.059,I beg your pardon?
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1230.059,1231.501,Plus paying.
1961.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1240.231,1241.077,He must pay in addition to that?
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1241.077,1242.727,He must pay in addition.
1961.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1242.727,1243.863,In addition to that.
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1243.863,1244.196,Yes.
1961.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1244.196,1244.911,Yes.
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1244.911,1260.423,He must pay in addition and that's the part that we believe makes it contrary to the purpose and intent of Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act.
1961.14,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1260.423,1272.251,"May I ask a question to you, [Inaudible]?"
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1272.251,1275.733,He must also pay.
1961.14,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1287.981,1288.195,"Well, the theory of that --"
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1288.195,1290.494,-- in the position of this bankrupt.
1961.14,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1290.494,1299.445,"The theory of that is that the State is interested in people carrying certain minimum amounts of protection, isn't that it, $10,000 in any one accident?"
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1299.445,1300.043,Yes.
1961.14,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1300.043,1302.29,"That's what your -- the theory of that statute, isn't it?"
1961.14,0,23133,e_j_skeen,,1302.29,1308.212,That's right.
1961.14,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1413.914,1415.727,Mr. Madsen.
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1415.727,1421.009,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1961.14,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1574.614,1577.711,Is this -- did this originate with the uniform commissioners?
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1577.711,1581.79,I don't know where these controls originated Your Honor.
1961.14,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1591.419,1594.058,"Mr. Madsen, just a minor question."
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1602.133,1602.895,That is correct Your Honor.
1961.14,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1602.895,1604.214,-- is it for period?
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1604.214,1619.801,"And I think the reasoning behind that and this is only my opinion but I believe the reasoning behind the business of making it permanent rather than for a limited period would be that if you make it for a limited period, the possibility of collection is thereby frustrated."
1961.14,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1633.977,1635.54,That's just the point.
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1652.05,1652.61,Yes.
1961.14,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1774.923,1784.201,"But the only person that can trigger this â€“ can initiate this is the creditors, can the -- could a state official invoke this?"
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1784.201,1785.705,The State on its own motion?
1961.14,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1785.705,1786.159,Yes.
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1786.159,1789.279,"In given instances it can, Your Honor, not from a matter of judgment."
1961.14,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1789.584,1789.981,I mean not for --
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1789.981,1793.224,-- another provision that has to deal with accident reports --
1961.14,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1793.224,1795.608,"Well, I mean for a failure to pay a judgment."
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1795.608,1795.893,No.
1961.14,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1857.159,1866.115,"No sanctions then, effective sanctions are levied against one who has means to discharge any judgment."
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1866.115,1866.972,That's correct.
1961.14,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1872.014,1881.296,"Well, I'm not a -- I'm one of these unique creatures that doesn't drive a car but aren't there other sanctions for denying a license and revoking it?"
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1881.296,1882.82,"Of course, Your Honor, there are certain --"
1961.14,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1882.82,1885.698,Why do we say there were no other sanctions against the fellow (Voice Overlap)?
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1885.698,1890.209,"Your Honor, in this context, I'll stand for the correction of Mr. Chief -- of Mr. Justice (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1890.209,1890.605,Mr. Madsen --
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1890.605,1893.815,"Of course, there must be certain abilities to drive and test."
1961.14,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1893.815,1894.748,No.
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1903.446,1905.207,Nonpayment of a judgment.
1961.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1909.074,1914.334,"The provision, restoration provisions are properly before us in this case?"
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1914.334,1931.875,"I believe they are in this particular, Your Honor, because even though the lower court did rule on this matter, this question of getting the -- having -- requiring the bankrupt to request the return of his license and getting consent of the judgment creditor wasn't done in this instant."
1961.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1966.916,1976.257,"But it is true -- it is true, is it, that the -- that they could not restore the license if they did not pay the judgment --"
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1976.257,1977.021,That's correct.
1961.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1977.021,1983.353,-- even though they were able to provide adequate insurance for the future?
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1983.353,1984.904,That's correct.
1961.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1985.576,1986.002,Yes.
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1986.002,1987.217,-- must be made.
1961.14,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1987.217,1987.806,Mr. Madsen.
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,1988.09,1989.349,"Yes, sir."
1961.14,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1989.349,2006.574,"Under the Reitz, meaning right of the statute, 1936 Act of New York could, to use the phrase of my Brother, could the State Commissioner have triggered the proceedings unless the clerk sent up a judgment?"
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,2006.574,2008.0,"No, that's the difference."
1961.14,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2011.943,2015.175,"No, no, I don't think I put my question."
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,2025.881,2028.524,"It would have had to with an automatic statute, yes."
1961.14,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2029.065,2033.84,But how did the -- the nonpayment of the judgment debt get deployed.
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,2033.84,2037.391,It was mandatorily required for the clerk to forward them all of the Commission.
1961.14,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2037.391,2039.668,But you haven't taken my question as I may state here.
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,2043.841,2044.471,Oh no.
1961.14,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2044.471,2045.038,Alright.
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,2045.038,2046.888,That's correct.
1961.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2046.888,2053.719,"Mr. Madsen, may I interrupt you just once more. You mentioned this is a uniform law and that there were 21 States that --"
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,2053.719,2054.541,That's correct.
1961.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2054.541,2061.101,Does a uniform law include this restoration provision as you have it here?
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,2061.101,2063.708,"As I remember, it does, Mr. Chief Justice."
1961.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2072.746,2078.697,I wonder if you and the counsel could agree on the little memorandum on that issue and submit it to the Court.
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,2078.697,2079.485,I'd be happy to.
1961.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2079.485,2081.206,Would you do that please?
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,2081.206,2082.79,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.14,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2082.79,2089.054,Could I ask you Mr. Madsen over this law as a product of the uniform --
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,2089.054,2091.116,You asked me and I answered I don't know.
1961.14,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2091.116,2091.561,"You didn't know, alright."
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,2091.561,2108.776,"Through the drafts memora, but considering all of this creditor control, in summarizing, they are that the judgment creditor must initiate the action and Mr. Justice Douglas added and certif -- request that the judgment be certified up."
1961.14,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2171.307,2171.629,Was any (Voice Overlap) --
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,2171.629,2194.59,"-- all of these provisions, if it please the Court, have the net effect not of becoming the principal concern of the Act but rather a concern for the judgment debtor to reduce the otherwise harshness of the Act had it been nothing more than the automatic revocation statute that was upheld by this Court in the Reitz case."
1961.14,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2387.626,2417.522,But does it -- would you agree the case gets down to this that this Court has to decide whether the exercise by Congress of the bankruptcy power whereby honest debtors are discharged for inability to pay their debt preempts or does not preempt an interest that the State may have in its own like which by indirection may also involve putting some pressure on the discharged debtor.
1961.14,1,25750,gordon_a_madsen,,2417.719,2418.348,Right.
1961.14,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2420.466,2425.302,"Mr. Madsen, may I ask you this, just this one more question."
