1972.72-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.174,We will hear arguments next in 72-11 Palmore against the United States.
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,31.001,33.919,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1972.72-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,118.352,123.597,And his claim was based upon the fact that this was a felony charge?
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,123.597,124.514,Yes sir it was.
1972.72-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,124.514,130.658,"In other words, he at least implicitly conceded that he could have been charged honest to mere charge?"
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,130.658,132.11,"Yes, indeed so sir."
1972.72-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,185.246,189.953,There maybe a difference between a “petty offense” and misdemeanor.
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,189.953,190.549,Indeed there maybe --
1972.72-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,190.549,193.424,"Any event, you say that maybe that whatever the--"
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,193.424,198.291,"In any event whatever the law and event, a felony is our proposition in this case."
1972.72-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,436.86,444.889,You don't submit or do you that the answer to the first question necessarily controls the answer to the second?
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,444.889,446.555,Here is nothing to do with the answer of the second.
1972.72-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,448.744,449.932,Whether it's an appeal or –
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,449.932,450.787,Certiorari –
1972.72-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,450.787,454.651,Certiorari here and that's basically a question unrelated to --
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,454.651,461.798,"Completely unrelated, it's the mode of seeking review the statutory mode and it's purely a question of statutory interpretation."
1972.72-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,463.218,468.862,(Inaudible)
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,468.862,473.486,"For purposes of a statute, Your Honor, not for purposes of Article III section one of the constitution."
1972.72-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,473.486,474.952,I mean that’s the question.
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,474.952,475.826,That is the question.
1972.72-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,481.395,484.374,(Inaudible) different answer?
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,484.374,485.48,Indeed I answer.
1972.72-11,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,486.454,487.214,You do?
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,487.214,497.776,I do get different answers and I say that because under the statute the question of course is purely one of statutory construction what did congress intent under Article III of the constitution.
1972.72-11,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,593.885,596.367,"O'Donoghue, he is a judge, was he not?"
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,596.367,598.16,"O'Donoghue was a judge, Your Honor."
1972.72-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,615.056,616.4,That was Justice Harlan's opinion?
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,616.4,618.275,"That was the plurality opinion, yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,618.275,618.592,Yes.
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,618.592,620.341,The plurality opinion by Mr. Justice Harlan.
1972.72-11,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,620.341,621.643,It was not a Court opinion.
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,621.643,623.324,Not a Court opinion in Lark.
1972.72-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,689.044,694.137,"In general, is this statute to somewhat like that of California like in the other states?"
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,694.137,700.063,"Somewhat, yes, quite like a state, Your Honor but of course, totally foreign to Article 3."
1972.72-11,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,713.201,717.759,"Mr. Flegal, you say totally alien to Article 3."
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,726.182,729.649,"At least with respect to the other two branches of Government, Your Honor."
1972.72-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,748.078,753.184,"That really is basically unanswered question, isn't it?"
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,753.184,756.403,"Oh, of course, of course and it is a question which is not raised in that case."
1972.72-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,768.446,774.918,"Well, even the first, even these are the ways the other two branches of Government, it is not a wholly established--"
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,774.918,777.389,"It is not a wholly established principle, that's right and so--"
1972.72-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,777.389,780.237,"And further, it is conceded that these are not articles three judge --"
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,780.237,783.965,"Precisely, Your Honor, precisely and of course, there is no holding --"
1972.72-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,783.965,788.307,"Consensus conceded, there is no need for you to so many time proving that part."
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,788.307,793.064,"Yes, the question then arises, are we entitled to this right?"
1972.72-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,867.027,876.195,Now you emphasize these benefits and safeguards but those are benefits and safeguards that most of the citizens and most of the states do not have.
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,876.195,881.573,"Oh precisely, it is not a Fourteenth Amendment benefit and safeguard at all, Your Honor and we don't contend that it is."
1972.72-11,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,881.573,888.489,"Yeah, that is what made me wonder about your great emphasis on it since most of the 200 million people in the country are subject to it."
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,888.489,907.288,"Right, our contention, of course, is that the original constitution and certain protections in the first Ten Amendments, for example, grand jury indictment Article 3 in Sixth Amendment trial by jury are of course rights which are afforded litigants when the Federal Judicial powers brought to bed, not necessarily required under the Fourteenth Amendment in the States."
1972.72-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1077.859,1096.747,"Back in the days when-- whether now the interior states of the United States with territories, Utah and so on, the territorial courts out there, of course, trial felonies including capital offenses, were those are Article Three Judges?"
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,1096.747,1100.111,"It is an interesting question on theory, Your Honor."
1972.72-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1116.743,1118.075,What’s exactly? [Voice Overlap]
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,1118.075,1118.517,I think what it means –
1972.72-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1118.517,1121.955,"I joined that opinion, but what, maybe I knew what it meant when I joined that."
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,1121.955,1125.234,I think what it means Your Honor.
1972.72-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1140.883,1142.394,Is that a circular argument?
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,1142.394,1143.186,That is right.
1972.72-11,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1170.565,1176.821,"How, in fact, were those judges nominated and appointed and what tenure did they have?"
1972.72-11,0,23894,frank_f_flegal,,1177.606,1181.069,"Various proposals had been used in the different territories, Your Honor."
1972.72-11,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2461.934,2464.664,May it pleases the court.
1972.72-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3655.962,3664.556,The case in last five or six years ago from the Canal Zone involving destruction of property down there?
1972.72-11,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3664.556,3670.152,"Yes, Mr. Justice but the case was here on review of a judgment of the Court of Claims."
1972.72-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3670.152,3670.67,Now what?
1972.72-11,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3670.67,3675.21,The question arose in the Canal Zone but it was a -- if we were thinking the same case --
1972.72-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3675.21,3676.935,I think we are.
1972.72-11,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3676.935,3685.188,It was a suit in the Court of Claims to recover from the United States on the ground that the United States had seized the building as part of the defensive zone.
1972.72-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3685.188,3688.12,And he was doing this sorting down there.
1972.72-11,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3688.12,3710.169,"I have looked for cases from the Canal Zone that got to this Court, there are many which have come to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and there are a good many where petition for certiorari have been filed and denied without not on jurisdictional ground, but I couldn't find one which had been entertained on the merits from the Canal Zone."
1972.72-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3710.169,3711.7,How are the judges in the Canal Zone?
1972.72-11,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3714.424,3718.035,All I can tell you is that is not life tenure.
1972.72-11,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3718.035,3719.349,They are usually from Kentucky.
1972.72-11,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3719.349,3726.654,Whether it's four years or ten years.
1972.72-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3921.93,3925.964,Does your position require the overhauling of O'Donoghue or not?
1972.72-11,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3925.964,3927.363,"No, not at all."
1972.72-11,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3927.363,3928.683,Because?
1972.72-11,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3928.683,3944.818,"Because we have today the United States District Court and the United States Court of Appeals, in the District of Columbia circuit, which not only are undoubtedly, but as I will show a little later are by expressed statement of Congress Article III courts."
1972.72-11,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3944.818,3952.243,But as you say that -- you say these are just different courts and judges that were involved in O'Donoghue?
1972.72-11,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3952.243,3960.872,These judges here of the Superior Court are of a different court and of a different quality of judges than those involved in O'Donoghue.
1972.72-11,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3973.427,3978.927,And you think that these particular court and judges involved here with a pass muster under O'Donoghue?
1972.72-11,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3983.667,3998.492,"I feel fairly sure that Mr. Justice although it's a long time ago, and it's a hard feel to be sure of anything that at the time of O'Donoghue was decided, there was either the municipal court at the District of Columbia or the Court of General Sessions."
1972.72-11,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4005.613,4006.804,Well I think minor cases here?
1972.72-11,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4006.804,4024.203,"I think limited to imprisonment for one year, but imprisonment for one year is a number of this Court's decision has hold is taken quite seriously and there was no intimation that those courts were Article III courts were anything but Article I courts."
1972.72-11,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4024.203,4037.284,"I question doesn’t go so far as Mr. Justice White’s, does your position required, so you think at least to some withdrawal from some of the language you note down in the brief?"
1972.72-11,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4037.284,4043.452,"No Mr. Justice, I do not think so at all."
1972.72-11,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4164.015,4167.676,"In that case, was bigamy a felony, I assume it was?"
1972.72-11,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4167.676,4172.438,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.72-11,2,23894,frank_f_flegal,,5281.769,5283.621,I appreciate that Your Honor.
1972.72-11,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5311.067,5315.715,The citizens do stand on a different basis with respect to the powers of Congress?
1972.72-11,2,23894,frank_f_flegal,,5315.715,5316.976,"Oh, clearly Your Honor."
1972.72-11,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5326.634,5330.246,And it's a question how far that difference can stand?
1972.72-11,2,23894,frank_f_flegal,,5330.246,5336.389,That is a legislative difference and we suggest it has no extension to Article 3 Safeguards and Protections.
1972.72-11,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5367.555,5392.381,"But then as you read Seventeenth Clause of Section 8, Article I, the legislative power of Congress over the district is narrower, is less broad than the legislative power of the state in creating its own ordinance of government."
1972.72-11,2,23894,frank_f_flegal,,5392.381,5393.26,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1972.72-11,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5393.26,5393.84,And why?
1972.72-11,2,23894,frank_f_flegal,,5393.84,5403.977,And the difference is the difference between the Fourteenth Amendment which is the State's Federal Constitution restriction on a state legislature and the Bill of Rights and original constitution on Congress.
1972.72-11,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5403.977,5405.95,"Well, how about the extent of it?"
1972.72-11,2,23894,frank_f_flegal,,5410.546,5415.201,"Yes indeed so sir, indeed so and I say that because this Court has so held."
1972.72-11,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5437.087,5437.891,And in the territory --
1972.72-11,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5437.891,5438.832,And in the territory --
1972.72-11,2,23894,frank_f_flegal,,5438.832,5447.914,"And in the territories, Your Honor, depending upon whether or not the territory is been incorporated or not and whether it's being fundamental or not, those are --"
1972.72-11,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5447.914,5453.074,But there is no in respect to territory that you need an Article III Court?
1972.72-11,2,23894,frank_f_flegal,,5453.074,5457.421,"It’s been assumed Your Honor, I know of no case in this Court which is ever squarely so held --"
1972.72-11,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5457.421,5460.491,"Well, assume it had, it still wouldn't make any difference to you?"
1972.72-11,2,23894,frank_f_flegal,,5460.491,5461.935,"It would make no difference to me, Your Honor."
1972.72-11,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5484.887,5490.784,Then you are giving residents of the District of Columbia something more than residents of Maryland?
1972.72-11,2,23894,frank_f_flegal,,5490.784,5497.034,I am giving the residents of the District of Columbia precisely the same as I would give the resident of Maryland and that is the right --
1972.72-11,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5497.034,5498.392,Let me put it to you this way.
1972.72-11,2,23894,frank_f_flegal,,5513.993,5514.668,Correct.
1972.72-11,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5514.668,5526.039,"So that in that sense, you are suggesting that the residents of District of Columbia get something that residents of no other state had except --"
1972.72-11,2,23894,frank_f_flegal,,5526.039,5529.862,"Weren't tried before the state tribunals, and they get a precisely the same --"
1972.72-11,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5529.862,5537.268,"[Voice Overlap] before the state tribunals, except to the extent that is comparable 10 year in Massachusetts, and several other states."
1972.72-11,2,23894,frank_f_flegal,,5537.268,5543.245,"Several other states, but that is a question on which we -- a fact on which we place no reliance for our proposition."
1972.72-11,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5555.089,5559.656,Or even if the State of Court was trying for a federal --
1972.72-11,2,23894,frank_f_flegal,,5559.656,5585.022,"That's the arguendo assumption Your Honor, if the governments we think that goes too far and if there are serious problems if Congress ever passed the hypothetical legislation that the government state Court argument rest upon, this Court is confronted some of those problems in the Seventh Amendment context, with the State Courts trying Federal Civil Actions and in some cases the Federal Employer liability acts in so forth, implied as part of the remedy."
1972.72-11,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5623.047,5624.031,Thank Mr. Flegal.
