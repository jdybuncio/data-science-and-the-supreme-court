1997.96-1829,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.888,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1829, Montana v The Crow Tribe of Indians."
1997.96-1829,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,9.278,12.84,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
1997.96-1829,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,50.699,57.93,"Mr. Smith, I'd like to pursue with you what you assert is the underlying cause of action here."
1997.96-1829,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,76.251,85.701,"Justice O'Connor, we believe the action in this matter is limited to a cause of action for money had and received, a cause--"
1997.96-1829,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,85.701,106.661,"Well, that's interesting, because I thought it had been determined in earlier litigation that there was a Federal cause of action here based on a... an invasion of tribal sovereignty and a preemption by Federal law of any State tax law."
1997.96-1829,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,106.661,109.253,"--Your Honor, that is--"
1997.96-1829,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,109.253,115.11,And I thought we had basically summarily affirmed that notion.
1997.96-1829,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,116.72,125.201,"--Your Honor, that is correct in the Crow II decision, the 1987 Ninth Circuit decision."
1997.96-1829,1,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1731.037,1738.004,"Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1829,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1777.16,1779.206,"Which footnote is it in your brief, Mr. Pelcyger?"
1997.96-1829,1,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1779.206,1820.721,"Footnote 18, page 24, Mr. Chief Justice, in which the district court denied the motion... this was in 1990, long before the trial in this case, in which the district court denied Montana's motion to dismiss, stating that the current phase of this case was an extension of the district court's previously invoked equity jurisdiction and that, once violations of significant tribal interest were established, the district court had ""broad equitable powers"" that refers... broad equitable powers to construct a remedy that refers to State law and is not defeated by it, so it was known throughout this litigation what this case was about, and this is not a pleading case."
1997.96-1829,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1820.721,1827.498,"Well, Mr. Pelcyger, why shouldn't the remedy be tailored to the damages suffered by the tribe?"
1997.96-1829,1,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1863.313,1866.015,Let me say first that that's not the question that's presented.
1997.96-1829,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.295,1869.513,I'd like you to answer that question.
1997.96-1829,1,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1869.513,1872.246,--I would be glad to answer that question and I'm glad you asked it.
1997.96-1829,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1890.192,1890.817,I don't understand what that means.
1997.96-1829,1,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1893.036,1894.502,--It means that Westmoreland--
1997.96-1829,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.502,1895.612,Because the tribe would have taxed it?
1997.96-1829,1,40187,robert_s_pelcyger,,1895.612,1897.611,--The tribe would have taxed it.
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2588.381,2603.485,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.96-1829,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2603.485,2611.404,"Mr. Lamken, sometime in the course of your argument I'd appreciate your saying why this case isn't controlled by California v. United States."
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2625.897,2626.85,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1829,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2686.061,2688.622,"Well, you say a Federal cause of action."
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2693.917,2694.541,"Certainly, and--"
1997.96-1829,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2694.541,2700.132,So there must have been... the United States must have had a right to go into court to make the assertion that it should recover.
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2709.458,2712.847,"--Cause of action can be... the phrase, cause of action, can be used two ways."
1997.96-1829,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2754.471,2783.693,"As I understand your theory, if California taxed a corporation that was doing business in California and Nevada and the corporation said, you know, really, this is interstate commerce, you can't tax our income, and settled with California, under your theory I guess Nevada could say, we don't have a corporate income tax, but you know, you took the tax that really should have been ours, so we'll sue you, State of California."
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2785.285,2802.186,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe that that case could be brought, and I think this is in part a response to Justice O'Connor's question, and that is that the purpose of a remedy such as restitution is to restore the parties to the position they would have occupied had Federal law been respected to begin with."
1997.96-1829,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2812.4,2815.54,"Well, under that, Nevada says, you know, this money must belong to somebody."
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2818.928,2837.703,"--Well, the next step, however, in the analysis, Your Honor, is, where there's a gross disparity between the two... between the injury to the plaintiff and the unjust gain to the defendant, the court can deny restitution because the restitution would not... the enrichment was not unjust visavis the plaintiff."
1997.96-1829,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2843.107,2855.321,"Their point is that, that I take it that the, Montana's point is that in the absence of this unlawful tax of the 58 million, or whatever, the tribe couldn't have gotten the money."
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2885.152,2890.588,"Our response to that is the same response that the court below had, which is, it's not supported by the evidence, and there's two reasons why--"
1997.96-1829,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2890.588,2894.726,"And what does... and fine, so what is... what does the evidence support, in your view?"
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2894.726,2907.861,"--First, the evidence supports that in the absence of the Montana tax, Westmoreland is willing to pay additional royalties to the tribe whether by way of tax or by way of royalty agreements in any amount that it saved from the Montana tax."
1997.96-1829,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2912.828,2913.687,Is that right?
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2935.117,2943.846,"There's a letter from Westmoreland to the tribe in joint appendix page 87, and during that it says that we have previously negotiated regarding additional royalties."
1997.96-1829,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2961.731,2973.695,"That's a quite different statement, any additional payments to you will have to be in lieu of instead of in addition to, and you characterize that as a sort of volunteering to give you the money that we save from the tax?"
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2973.695,2988.515,"--In light of the negotiations that had occurred, that is what it means, and on page 397 and 400 of the joint appendix, again there is testimony that they're willing to share any savings that the tribe could obtain from the Montana tax for them through use of its governmental authorities with the--"
1997.96-1829,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2988.515,2989.796,"Oh, so now they're willing to share it."
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,2998.637,3000.417,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1829,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3000.417,3003.604,"That's more plausible, but you've already cut your claim by 50 percent now."
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3003.604,3014.959,"Your Honor, it's not... I don't think there is a precise one... necessarily a proven precise onetoone correspondence between the loss to this tribe in this case and the amount of restitution awarded by the court of appeals."
1997.96-1829,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3014.959,3015.505,"Well, exactly."
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3028.234,3035.731,"Well, I think Your Honor, equity starts... restitution starts with the unlawful gain to the defendant, and the reason it starts there... and I'll go to how it can get reduced."
1997.96-1829,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3044.462,3052.569,"On that theory, I take it you disagree with your colleague on the same side, is that if Westmoreland had recovered all the tax itself, then the tribe would not be able to get any money."
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3052.569,3065.75,"--If Westmoreland had recovered the money, under the doctrines of benefits conferred the claim would no longer be against Montana but upon... the beneficiary of the tax would be Westmoreland, so the tribe's action would have to run against Westmoreland and not the State of Montana."
1997.96-1829,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3065.75,3070.186,You mean they would have been able to recover this money from Westmoreland if Westmoreland had recovered it from Montana?
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3070.186,3072.217,"The answer is potentially yes, and this is--"
1997.96-1829,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3072.217,3074.575,But what... why was Westmoreland a wrongdoer?
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3077.683,3081.323,"--Yes, Your Honor, and that would depend on the validity of the 1976 tax."
1997.96-1829,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3088.038,3090.006,The tribal tax.
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3090.616,3091.053,--Excuse me.
1997.96-1829,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3091.053,3092.928,--The amount of the tribal tax is not equal to the amount of the--
1997.96-1829,2,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,3092.928,3094.677,That's correct.
