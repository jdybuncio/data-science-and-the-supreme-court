1980.80-251,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.987,We will hear arguments next in Rostker v. Goldberg.
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,62.923,66.541,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-251,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,143.958,147.577,Do all males in that age group have to register?
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,147.577,156.866,All male citizens and all male resident aliens; only aliens not in non-immigrant status.
1980.80-251,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,156.866,161.003,But all males including ministers and--
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,161.003,165.039,"All of them register, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.80-251,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,248.459,259.433,"--Might I ask, Mr. Solicitor General, is the registration statute explicit as to the permissible uses of the registration lists?"
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,259.433,262.718,--It is not.
1980.80-251,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,270.474,278.497,"Well, what I'm getting at, of course, is, may the registration lists be used, for example, to staff nonmilitary jobs?"
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,278.497,280.83,It may--
1980.80-251,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,280.83,291.887,"What I'm thinking about is during the war, do you recall, when not we, but our allies had all kinds of registration lists which they then used to bring women into war industries."
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,291.887,298.625,"--If you're inquiring for service other than within the Armed Services, my understanding is that it does not."
1980.80-251,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,298.625,299.327,It does not.
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,299.327,303.029,It's for induction into the military services.
1980.80-251,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,308.599,314.42,"Except, I suppose, that people who are in certain classifications might be assigned outside the military?"
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,314.42,319.305,That was certainly done under the Act and I assume it was done lawfully.
1980.80-251,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,411.064,413.85,"Mr. Solicitor General, you used the term, ""reactivated""."
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,424.891,444.905,"The statute was still in effect but in 1975 the President discontinued registration under the statute, so the statute still authorized the President by proclamation to reinstitute registration."
1980.80-251,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,444.905,451.975,So you have no problem about the action being the proper vehicle for the issues that are not here?
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,451.975,454.677,We do not raise this in our jurisdictional statement.
1980.80-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,469.603,481.327,"Well, General McCree, may I ask, is the statute one that simply authorizes the President by proclamation to require registration or that it directs him?"
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,481.327,484.279,It authorizes him by proclamation.
1980.80-251,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,484.962,491.1,And then after this 1980 action in Congress he did issue a proclamation?
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,491.1,513.53,"--He did issue a proclamation requiring young men who were born in 1960 and 1961 to register and then on a continuing basis persons who were born after January 1, 1963, on or before the 30 days prior to their 18th birthday."
1980.80-251,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,525.004,528.475,"General McCree, I might have missed it."
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,530.508,536.712,"Were they amended in the court below, Mr. Justice?"
1980.80-251,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,536.712,537.331,Yes.
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,537.331,539.347,Yes.
1980.80-251,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,558.809,562.86,Is it now aimed at the new statute or the old?
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,562.86,575.52,"It is aimed at the old statute because the statute wasn't changed to require the registration of women, and it's still a male-only registration statute."
1980.80-251,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,575.52,579.222,"Then that's what's before us, is that correct?"
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,579.222,581.84,"That's what's before the Court at this time, if the Court please."
1980.80-251,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,581.84,599.236,Mr. Solicitor General... we began interrupting you with our questions and I'm now continuing the interruption... you stated that the three-judge district court held that this statute was constitutionally invalid because it invidiously discriminated against men?
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,599.236,600.002,Against men.
1980.80-251,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,600.002,601.503,"That's clear, is it?"
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,601.503,602.186,That's clear.
1980.80-251,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,712.74,726.334,"Mr. Solicitor General, would you take that position if the classification was one that was racially discriminatory, based on the authority to raise?"
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,726.334,727.65,I think we would take that.
1980.80-251,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,731.102,734.59,"If it was decided, it said, would have registered only negroes and no whites?"
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,734.59,743.779,"--But we would say that that would not be rationally related to an important governmental objective, because--"
1980.80-251,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,743.779,747.663,I thought a rational basis test doesn't talk about an important government objective.
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,748.997,757.769,--A rational relationship to a legitimate... the Court is correct... a legitimate governmental objective.
1980.80-251,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,757.769,758.971,And you say that would not be legitimate?
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,758.971,761.157,And we would say that would not be a legitimate governmental--
1980.80-251,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,761.157,769.161,Then gender-based discrimination could be supported as related to a legitimate governmental objective; not racial?
1980.80-251,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,769.161,770.763,--We submit that it would and--
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,1914.137,1923.428,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-251,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1974.444,1989.721,"May I interrupt you at this point and ask, is it not possible that your next suit, if you win this one, and if women were not drafted on an equal basis with men, would not the same men who are complaining here today bring suit on that basis?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,1992.589,1995.958,"Well, I don't think that that would be the case."
1980.80-251,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2008.348,2009.617,Inconsistent in what way?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2009.617,2019.99,--Inconsistent in that the theory of this suit and the theory of the District Court was that you register people as an inventory.
1980.80-251,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2019.99,2021.525,You register them equally.
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2021.525,2025.544,Register equally as insurance against an unpredictable future.
1980.80-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2032.483,2037.685,What interest do your clients have in having women registered if there are none of them going to be drafted?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2041.671,2046.807,"Well, I don't think that that's true, that we can say that none will be drafted."
1980.80-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.592,2055.646,But you must assume that some of them will be drafted or there's nothing worth fighting about.
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2055.646,2061.031,"--It is safe to assume, I think, that over--"
1980.80-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.031,2065.835,"Therefore there is a connection between registration and drafting, so your first proposition is wrong."
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2065.835,2070.054,"--No, Your Honor, I have to disagree with that."
1980.80-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2083.896,2092.235,"Do you concede that the Government may draft in unequal numbers, that they could set quotas that 75 percent of the draftees will be male and 25 percent will be female?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2094.187,2109.631,"--I would concede, indeed, I would embrace the point that the military needs at the time that mobilization is necessary ought to dictate the proportion in which men or women are drafted."
1980.80-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.631,2112.832,And do you concede that there are different military needs for men and for women?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2112.832,2115.934,There may be at a given time.
1980.80-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2115.934,2116.9,But today?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2124.706,2128.825,It would support a differential induction.
1980.80-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2131.294,2135.764,But you would concede that a differential induction would be constitutionally permissible?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2135.764,2137.531,Yes; based upon military needs.
1980.80-251,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2137.531,2149.239,"Mr. Weinberg, if you continue to prevail in this case, does that mean that every past registration and conscription act of this country is unconstitutional?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2149.239,2153.541,I don't believe that that would be the case.
1980.80-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2191.047,2193.047,How about veterans' preference acts?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2193.047,2194.249,--Pardon?
1980.80-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2194.249,2198.867,How about veterans' preference acts dating from previous draft acts?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2198.867,2230.938,"I think that the Court decided that in Feeney and noting in Feeney that the result of the veterans' preference winds up disproportionately favoring men was a function of the service, which, incidentally, was a result of the inequality of conscription, among other things."
1980.80-251,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2266.861,2285.759,"Mr. Weinberg, up to now your arguments, at least as I follow it, is that there were better ways to do it than Congress did, there were more logical ways, but, does that make it, the failure to do that, does that make it unconstitutional?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2285.759,2287.959,"Well, we go well beyond saying--"
1980.80-251,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2287.959,2289.394,You haven't got that far yet?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2289.394,2290.961,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1980.80-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2318.48,2326.317,Yet you don't challenge the statute that prohibits the use of women in certain combat positions?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2326.317,2331.704,"With all due respect, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we deny the existence of such a statute."
1980.80-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2350.031,2358.87,Would a decision in your favor here have any effect on Navy policies?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2358.87,2360.922,You mean the statute?
1980.80-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2360.922,2362.288,Right.
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2362.288,2365.19,It would not directly implicate that statute.
1980.80-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2420.459,2429.615,"You don't challenge here the freedom of assignment in the... rather, the limitation of freedom of assignment in the Navy or the Air Force?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2429.615,2431.167,This case does not raise that.
1980.80-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.167,2433.269,And you don't challenge it?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2433.269,2435.019,No.
1980.80-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2437.471,2440.089,"Well, we judge this case on the assumption that that is valid."
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2440.089,2441.689,That is correct.
1980.80-251,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2484.701,2493.89,"Mr. Weinberg, the District Court's analysis, of course, was in the context of the heightened scrutiny test, the Craig v. Boren test, wasn't it?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2493.89,2494.44,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-251,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2494.44,2506.197,"Suppose we don't agree that was correct, what have you to say to the Government's argument that in any event what ought to be applied here is the rational basis test, and by any measure that that test is satisfied?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2506.197,2516.153,"Well, the finding of fact that military flexibility is in fact undermined by exclusion does not depend upon what test is used in the analysis."
1980.80-251,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2529.313,2532.182,"What's this go to, the legitimacy of the Government interest?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2532.615,2533.365,--Pardon?
1980.80-251,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2533.365,2534.648,What does it go to?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2536.384,2537.184,"No, Your Honor."
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2602.159,2607.48,Wouldn't that objective be equally undermined by excluding everybody under 18 and everybody over 26?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2607.48,2609.848,I think not.
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2614.836,2619.454,That includes an awful lot of people with a lot of different and varied experiences.
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2619.454,2622.673,"--Yes, it does."
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2622.673,2625.442,"That the military could well use, I suppose."
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2625.442,2634.63,"And under certain circumstances, eligibility for induction continues well past the age of 26."
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2637.249,2651.775,You did not attack the constitutional validity of the statute based upon its discrimination in favor of everybody in this country under 18 years of age and everybody in this country over 26 years of age?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2651.775,2656.746,"No, Your Honor, for two reasons I don't think an age discrimination case would have been appropriate."
1980.80-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2686.932,2688.115,We're only talking about registration.
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2688.115,2690.131,"And that's what I'm saying, that--"
1980.80-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.131,2696.102,"Because from what you suggest, you might as well register everybody over 26 and get a much larger pool to draw from."
1980.80-251,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2701.773,2705.993,And a lot of former servicemen are over 26--
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2705.993,2718.217,--And to the extent that they generally have continued service obligations and so are within the reach of the statute.
1980.80-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2718.217,2720.817,--That's not necessarily true at all.
1980.80-251,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2735.727,2753.288,How do you distinguish the policy question involved in fixing the ages and the policy question made at this stage for limited purposes of excluding women?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2759.442,2769.066,"Well, to start with, the policy decision to exclude women which was made in 1948 was not a considered decision at all."
1980.80-251,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2809.977,2821.333,Since when is it the function of the courts to inquire into the atmosphere in which the Legislative Branch acts?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2821.333,2829.32,"--Where the atmosphere is shown in specific testimony, in specific statements."
1980.80-251,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2829.32,2835.491,"Well, in a case of our Court, this Court, that... do you suggest that that's a proper criterion?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2835.491,2861.474,"I think that in the Arlington Heights case where the question came up, starting, if it's not clear on its face, we then look for congressional intent, indeed, in this very statute on the amendment that was considered in O'Brien, where you looked to whether there was any evidence of an improper intent."
1980.80-251,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2905.987,2928.018,"Well, Mr. Weinberg, if we disagree with the District Court and with you that there ought to be a heightened scrutiny standard here and agree with the Government that that it should just be the rational basis test, can we affirm the judgment of the District Court?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2928.018,2929.118,"Yes, I believe you can."
1980.80-251,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2929.118,2929.752,How?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2929.752,2959.538,"Particularly, because the defense for the statute even under the rational relationship test is the military flexibility argument that the Solicitor General has described and because that argument simply does not relate in any rational way to either the facts or the intent of the statute, the function of the statute."
1980.80-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.538,2983.939,"Yes, but if it's just a rational relationship, I would think if you, unless you disbelieve that you could get as many women as you wanted, or that were needed, on a voluntary basis, it would be quite rational to decide not to go through the entire rigamarole of registration and the drafting of women just to get the ones you could get without any expense whatsoever."
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2983.939,2991.026,"Well, in fact, there is no substantial basis in the record for believing that we can with confidence predict that we will be--"
1980.80-251,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2991.026,2994.145,"Well, is there any basis for our believing that we can't?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2994.145,2996.163,--Yes.
1980.80-251,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2996.163,2997.113,In the record?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,2997.113,2997.863,In the record.
1980.80-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3002.334,3003.567,Well what record are you talking about?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3003.567,3006.769,--The record before the trial court and the record before Congress.
1980.80-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3008.802,3019.41,"What if we read the record different than you did and then thought that there was not only ample basis in the record but a finding, and evidence, that you can get the women without registration?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3022.445,3043.442,"If it could be stated that we can safely predict that there would not arise a situation where volunteers would be inadequate, that would be a different situation, but that's not what we face with registration."
1980.80-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3043.442,3043.858,"Well, that isn't what I asked you."
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3046.142,3051.446,"Yes, if we had a guarantee, yes, is really would not be needed; the answer is yes."
1980.80-251,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3080.031,3089.304,"Well, Mr. Weinberg, finally, why isn't the rationality test, in light of the clauses of the Constitution we're dealing with, the proper test here?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3089.304,3106.348,"First of all, this Court, although often asked to, has never accepted a military relationship or national defense exception to normal standards of constitutional scrutiny."
1980.80-251,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3106.348,3107.681,What about Schlesinger v. Ballard?
1980.80-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3107.681,3109.031,And Parker v. Levy?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3109.031,3140.402,"Parker, like Glines and Huff, and Greer v. Spock, are so-called military enclave cases, and they all go off on Parker v. Levy's language about the military being a separate society unto itself internally requiring for matters of discipline and base morale a separate standard."
1980.80-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3142.021,3153.662,And we said there that the constitutional First Amendment overbreadth attack that was available in the nonmilitary context was not available in the military context.
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3153.662,3157.881,--That's within a military enclave.
1980.80-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3180.146,3180.746,What about Ballard?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3180.746,3184.948,"With Schlesinger v. Ballard, there are a number of distinguishing characteristics--"
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3184.948,3185.764,That was within the military as well.
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3185.764,3186.097,--Pardon?
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3186.097,3187.114,That was within the military.
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3187.114,3189.149,That was most directly within the military.
1980.80-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3200.255,3201.274,What was the holding in Frontiero?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3201.274,3211.562,"In Frontiero the holding, I believe, was that the distinction drawn--"
1980.80-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3211.562,3213.347,This was in the military?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3213.347,3221.353,"--It was within the military, but because the distinction drawn was based on stereotype, it failed the heightened scrutiny."
1980.80-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3221.353,3222.887,Failed heightened scrutiny?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3222.887,3223.52,Heightened scrutiny.
1980.80-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3223.52,3224.822,Not the rational relationship?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3224.822,3226.172,Definitely not the rational relationship.
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3226.172,3228.591,"It was not a Court opinion in Frontiero, is that correct?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3228.591,3232.309,There was a plurality opinion in Frontiero--
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3232.309,3234.595,"Not a Court opinion, so it's difficult to say what it was based on."
1980.80-251,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.595,3235.761,What was the fifth vote based on?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3235.761,3248.319,"--The fifth vote was based on... I believe, Your Honor, that the fifth vote was based upon an application of a test that went far beyond rational basis."
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3251.205,3252.055,"Reed v. Reed, wasn't it?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3252.055,3253.407,--It was Reed; exactly.
1980.80-251,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3253.407,3255.941,Why doesn't Reed apply?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3255.941,3257.924,It's a heightened scrutiny but--
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3257.924,3262.245,"Well, the test is a test of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as--"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3262.245,3266.547,"--As it applies to gender, which was a close and substantial relationship."
1980.80-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3266.547,3272.201,--Reed v. Reed just says this Court scrutinizes cases that are brought before it.
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3272.201,3280.124,"It looks for a substantial relationship, and that, I think, Craig v. Boren says that's what Reed says."
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3317.063,3320.015,Like Kahn and Shevin?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3320.015,3320.831,--Like Kahn and Shevin.
1980.80-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3422.513,3431.419,"Mr. Weinberg, before you... I see your light was gone on... before you sit down, I'd be interested in hearing what the other three of the four points are that were controlling."
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3431.419,3435.621,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3457.986,3463.89,"Well, it seems to me... maybe I'm out of step, but it seems to me you have the cart before the horse."
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3476.114,3482.452,Except where that act draws some form of discriminatory--
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3482.452,3489.772,"Well, as the Solicitor General has pointed out, Congress here exercised one of its explicit powers under the Constitution and with that you don't agree?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3491.058,3493.324,--If it was an assignment that--
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3493.324,3512.721,"And I didn't understand the Solicitor General to suggest, and I hope he didn't suggest, that Congress even in the exercise of an explicit power such as this is not governed by the explicit prohibitions in the Constitution, and one of them is contained in the Fifth Amendment, and that's the one upon which you rely."
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3522.141,3524.927,"--I think not, as this Court said as recently as--"
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3524.927,3526.945,There is no question of the power.
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3526.945,3528.231,--There's no question of the power--
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3528.231,3532.433,"And the question is, is that power limited or prohibited?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3532.433,3556.981,"--I would go one step further, as this Court has repeatedly said, when a legislature, including Congress, enacts a statute based upon gender and the distinction of gender is on the face of the statute, it is based upon gender, it is the burden of those defending the statute to come forth and establish by empirical evidence, in fact--"
1980.80-251,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3556.981,3564.237,"Well, perhaps... maybe the Court has said that, but I trust I never have because I don't think they're defending a statute, I think you're attacking it."
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3564.237,3569.824,"--But, Your Honor, once the attack shows that it was gender-based discrimination, this Court--"
1980.80-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3569.824,3581.615,But doesn't the burden shift as soon as the Government does... and you've conceded they've done here... show there's a difference in military need based on sex?
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3584.198,3635.75,"--Your Honor, that would affect registration only if two different statutes were involved, one, a statutory prohibition on women participating in certain close combat activities, and the other, more importantly, a change in the Military Selective Service Act limiting the induction of people to people who will be assigned to those prohibited roles, because otherwise we are conflicting with history and Congress did not mean to conflict with history because we have always, as the testimony of General Tice and all the generals is clear, we have always drafted a very substantial, indeed, often a majority of draftees specifically for the noncombat areas."
1980.80-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3732.664,3739.418,"I would just ask if the case would be different in constitutional terms if the military had taken the position, we don't like women, we don't want any of them in the Army?"
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3740.751,3746.721,--It would be a different matter of somehow meeting an evidentiary burden.
1980.80-251,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3746.721,3749.106,"Which they might have said in 1948, by the way."
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3749.106,3749.706,They didn't.
1980.80-251,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3762.097,3772.639,"Mr. Weinberg, you have emphasized the testimony and I quite agree with you, if I were in your place I would, of some of the military men."
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3807.859,3812.18,"--Yes, I think the District Court specifically rejected a number of them."
1980.80-251,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3812.18,3812.496,All eleven?
1980.80-251,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3826.523,3829.975,We can read the testimony as well as the district judge could read it.
1980.80-251,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3829.975,3832.776,And if so what authority justifies us in doing that?
1980.80-251,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3832.776,3838.33,Perhaps the Kassel opinion handed down this morning.
1980.80-251,1,21676,donald_l_weinberg,,3838.33,3841.18,I have not had the opportunity to read that.
1980.80-251,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3919.215,3921.984,I think you're going beyond Justice Powell's question now.
