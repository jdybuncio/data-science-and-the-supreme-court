2009.08-304,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.026,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 08-304, Graham County Soil and Water Conservation District v. The United States, ex rel. Wilson."
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,11.087,13.368,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.438,120.897,"But under your proposal a State that itself is guilty of fraud can, in effect, immunize -- if not immunize itself, at least render the information unusable by conducting a hearing."
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,120.897,130.833,"--Well, Your Honor, the government certainly argues that it would result in State and local governments immunizing themselves from qui tam liability."
2009.08-304,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,151.701,158.245,"And it's also the original source, if -- if the relator is the original source of the information."
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,158.245,181.201,"Yes -- yes, Justice Ginsburg, that -- even if there is a State report that a -- that a -- is in the public domain, a local government could still be sued under that document, if -- in spite of that document, by either the United States or a qui tam plaintiff that stands as an original source."
2009.08-304,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.016,207.644,"But what about the argument that Congress wanted to, in its most recent provisions, wanted to expand qui tam availability and this would -- if you would -- if you include State and local reports, that will shrink the availability?"
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,207.644,234.96,"--Your Honor, there is no question that Congress looked at the pre-1986 public disclosure bar, the provisions that existed between 1943 and 1986, and during that time frame an action, a qui tam action, would be barred if it was based upon information that was available to the -- the Federal Government."
2009.08-304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,371.789,373.961,It would be a -- would it be a civil hearing?
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,378.867,388.159,"Your Honor, I am referring to a deposition that is actually filed with the court in connection with the summary judgment motion and the case then settles."
2009.08-304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.063,394.375,What -- what provision would it come under?
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,394.375,397.421,"--Justice Scalia, the phrase"
2009.08-304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.29,414.411,Documents are -- documents are a hearing?
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,414.411,439.668,"--Your Honor, the -- if Congress had meant to limit that word ""hearing"" to literally in-person oral arguments or in-person testimony, it -- the result would be that a criminal indictment could be copied by a qui tam plaintiff and an action brought based upon that."
2009.08-304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,458.989,459.988,Meant more than hearing?
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,459.988,462.02,"--Yes, Your Honor, and that's the part of the problem, is--"
2009.08-304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,462.02,465.221,That's an argument that doesn't go very far with me.
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,466.298,483.932,"--Your Honor, the -- the problem is -- is that Congress really did not speak very clearly at all with respect to the False Claims Act, and so we're -- we're left with this mess of trying to figure out exactly what Congress intended."
2009.08-304,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,485.293,492.35,"In your view, must an administrative report be a report that is generated by some government unit?"
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,496.691,502.848,"--Justice Alito, the Petitioners would not read that phrase as -- that broadly."
2009.08-304,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,536.052,536.972,But I'm not sure why.
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,565.868,573.331,"Well, Your Honor, the public disclosure bar uses the phrase ""administrative hearing"" twice, and it's referring to Black's Law Dictionary."
2009.08-304,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,582.639,586.235,"When you say ""twice"", you mean in the first clause that says"
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,588.89,589.889,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-304,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,600.251,609.169,"But there is a redundancy there if the statute means what you say it does; it says ""administrative hearing"" in both the first clause and the second clause."
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,609.169,614.727,"Yes, Your Honor, there is a redundancy based upon Petitioner's construction of the statute."
2009.08-304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,643.419,650.15,"Well, I think there would be a good lawsuit as to whether GAO report."
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,655.305,662.395,"--Well, Justice Scalia, let me also point out that there is a redundancy in connection with the use of"
2009.08-304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,716.25,718.406,"Yes, well, that argument does not scare the government."
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,728.12,729.54,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.125,756.984,"And that was on -- on the basis of the first, the first phrase rather than the second?"
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,756.984,759.683,"Yes, Your Honor, based upon the first clause of the statute."
2009.08-304,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,759.683,766.995,"Is this particular audit report we are talking about, this is the audit report was done by an independent accountant?"
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,768.792,769.463,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-304,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,792.844,799.496,--Is that -- is that audit on file with the Department of Agriculture?
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,799.496,816.163,"--Your Honor, I would have to go beyond the record, but yes, we have conducted a -- submitted a Public Information Act request, and essentially a week after the document was transmitted to Graham County it was transmitted to the United States Department of Agriculture."
2009.08-304,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,816.163,824.345,"The arguments in this case, my initial reading of them, are more balanced than any I can remember, really."
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,903.33,908.11,"Well, Your Honor, Justice Breyer, first of all, the government hasn't been consistent."
2009.08-304,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,936.986,939.061,"As you can tell, I have taken that point in."
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,939.061,939.498,--Yes.
2009.08-304,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,939.498,941.42,So my question wasn't that.
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,950.105,972.687,"Well, I would suggest that the weight that should be given is to the partners of the Federal government, States and local governments that are in the trenches administering these programs, that will have tremendous difficulty if there is a rash of qui tam actions that are brought that disrupt ongoing Medicaid and other investigations."
2009.08-304,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,972.687,974.391,How will that happen?
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1011.561,1024.715,"Justice Sotomayor, there are going to be some exceptions to many States' Public Information Act requests, things such as attorney-client communications, in some cases criminal investigations."
2009.08-304,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1134.232,1145.307,"But Congress obviously wanted more than that, because if Congress's intent was the one that you are announcing then it should have just permitted original sources to sue."
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1160.379,1172.637,"Yes, Your Honor, it -- it added the original source provision, and it identified certainly sources of information and said, you cannot bring an action based upon those specific sources."
2009.08-304,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1172.637,1173.105,May I--
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1173.105,1173.901,Those include--
2009.08-304,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1173.901,1179.463,--May I ask this question: Is the fact that they've included the news media consistent with your view?
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1179.463,1181.385,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-304,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1181.385,1185.273,That seems to be a much more open source of information than you're raising.
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1185.273,1186.396,Exactly.
2009.08-304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.82,1227.224,"Stars and Stripes, maybe."
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1227.224,1228.113,"Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-304,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1229.801,1232.036,"Well, but that's not terribly persuasive."
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1256.291,1272.782,"Mr. Chief Justice, two points I would like to make in response is: First, these clauses -- and there are three clauses, the first one beginning with ""in"" and the third one beginning with ""from"" -- they do not serve different purposes."
2009.08-304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1287.308,1288.886,We should stop calling them clauses.
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1289.885,1291.027,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2009.08-304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.353,1306.494,Phrases.
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1306.494,1308.242,"--the preposition ""in"" -- phrases."
2009.08-304,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1351.74,1360.514,"Can you tell me just as a practical matter, suppose -- suppose the county says, you know, we found out that we were defrauded by this contractor, and it sues the contractor."
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1372.574,1377.789,"Your Honor, if there has been a public disclosure--"
2009.08-304,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1377.789,1382.928,Which there would be if there's a complaint filed by the county--
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1382.928,1383.614,--Yes.
2009.08-304,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1383.614,1384.772,--against the contractor.
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1384.772,1392.986,Essentially what the lower courts have done is they would allowed a qui tam action to go with regard to a completely different claim.
2009.08-304,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1400.609,1402.875,Depends on the identity of the claim?
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1402.875,1403.53,--Yes.
2009.08-304,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1404.154,1412.245,"And -- and suppose in their race to the courthouse, the qui tam plaintiff files on Monday and the county files on Tuesday?"
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1412.245,1425.757,"Under -- under that scenario, if the qui tam action is filed before the public disclosure, then the qui tam action would not be bourne--"
2009.08-304,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1427.847,1428.989,"May I, just one -- one quick question."
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1435.486,1436.516,"--No, Your Honor."
2009.08-304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1447.045,1450.682,"Part of the random nature of the whole provision, right?"
2009.08-304,0,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,1450.682,1452.635,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-304,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1455.599,1455.931,Thank you counsel.
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1460.708,1463.598,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-304,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1493.086,1499.802,"Let's begin at the beginning, and that is with the first phrase with the, what is it,"
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1511.621,1513.887,--No.
2009.08-304,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1513.887,1515.26,--include States?
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1515.26,1529.143,"No, the -- the text of category 2 compels the result here, although we do believe that the better view of category 1 is that it is also Federal as well, and the context -- the overall context--"
2009.08-304,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1529.143,1530.769,Suppose -- suppose it isn't?
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1548.667,1555.258,"--Because each of those categories is distinct, not only grammatically, but as far as function."
2009.08-304,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.176,1576.53,"Why -- why should we read the second category back to alter the meaning of the first, rather than reading the first phrase forward to alter the meaning of the second?"
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1609.219,1613.422,"The argument for category 2 is less compelling, we agree."
2009.08-304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1639.658,1641.799,"The question is, what sense does that make?"
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1655.307,1655.822,Yes.
2009.08-304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1655.822,1658.025,What's the state of the law on that?
2009.08-304,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1662.618,1664.63,You say that just as to administrative.
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1668.971,1669.111,No.
2009.08-304,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.111,1670.675,You want the whole thing to be just Federal?
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1670.675,1672.734,"No, we think the better view is that the whole category is--"
2009.08-304,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1672.734,1673.155,The whole category?
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1673.155,1673.674,--exclusively Federal.
2009.08-304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1673.674,1674.563,I think you'd have to say that.
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1677.811,1687.79,"The -- the court of appeals have basically gone the other way, but they have looked at it in a very superficial matter and have not really directly addressed the issue."
2009.08-304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1687.79,1688.558,What are we supposed to do?
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1734.241,1745.736,"Well, the False Claims Act in sections, the pertinent sections 3729 and 3730, refers to the Federal Government many times but never with the modifier ""Federal""."
2009.08-304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1748.111,1759.514,"Is there any history, which I pay attention to -- is there any legislative history or anything else that you can point to, to me that's important, showing that that first criminal hearing means just Federal?"
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1759.514,1770.32,"--Yes, the -- the legislative history shows throughout -- beginning with the House and Senate bills and going forward that these -- the earlier version shows these were exclusively Federal."
2009.08-304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1770.32,1772.21,And they meant criminal hearing.
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1776.067,1778.005,"Exactly, and you have references--"
2009.08-304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1778.005,1778.598,"You say ""exactly""."
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1779.971,1780.583,--Yes.
2009.08-304,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1828.063,1841.01,"Why -- what was the reason for that be, given that there are so many joint Federal-State grant programs, like the one that's involved here?"
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1854.833,1868.45,"Because it gives no -- a report produced by a State or a local government -- and again, their argument is not just State but every little local entity producing these reports fall under the category 2, according to them."
2009.08-304,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1878.932,1885.196,You think the Federal Government is focusing on everything that is disclosed in every civil proceeding that occurs in Federal court?
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1885.196,1896.144,"--No, but Congress was selecting general categories and as a general category the Federal proceedings they thought were more likely to put the government on notice--"
2009.08-304,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.144,1901.408,"News media, they are likely to be keeping track of all local newspapers as well?"
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1901.408,1917.541,"--Well, I think that as a general category it was reasonable for Congress to assume that the news media disclosures would be disseminated in general to the general public and would put pressure on the government to take action, and the government would pay attention to that in general."
2009.08-304,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1917.541,1919.6,"I mean, they could have said ""national news media""."
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1921.865,1923.332,"It said ""news media""."
2009.08-304,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.332,1927.037,"It includes a local radio station, a local community newspaper, right?"
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1928.051,1930.269,Congress was drawing the lines--
2009.08-304,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.269,1937.39,"And yet, State proceedings, which are excluded, right?"
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1937.39,1937.733,--Yes.
2009.08-304,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1937.733,1940.498,Even state supreme court cases and so forth.
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1942.217,1961.317,"Well, under, under -- this Court recognized in Cook County that the 1986 amendments abolished the government knowledge rule and allowed the qui tam relators to bring cases even where the government, Federal Government, had possession of information about the fraud."
2009.08-304,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1976.358,1979.809,"Mr. Hurt, let me just give you what's really troubling me about this case."
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1992.475,1993.239,Correct.
2009.08-304,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1993.239,1994.725,Does that make any sense?
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,1994.725,1999.564,"It does, because Congress drew it -- picked it as a general category."
2009.08-304,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.166,2015.135,That doesn't show that it makes sense.
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,2020.223,2040.809,"--One of the huge problems with Petitioners' position is it's going to sweep into category 2 an enormous number of reports and audits that the Federal Government is likely to never see, never come across, and you need these concerned citizens to go -- you want the citizens to go and look at these."
2009.08-304,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.809,2048.385,"Counsel, are you sure that -- your argument is that this is sandwiched between two Federal descriptions?"
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,2066.706,2071.94,The Petitioners have not pointed to an example of a State congress.
2009.08-304,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2080.389,2083.637,I'd like to go back to Justice Ginsburg's very first question.
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,2100.597,2101.662,Yes--
2009.08-304,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2101.662,2111.734,"And what's the practical -- your answer was, well, that's because -- I want to know the practical rationale for that, the practical reasons why that should make sense."
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,2111.734,2125.37,"--Because reports and audits are just a totally -- a category that is much -- many magnitudes greater than the number of criminal, civil, and administrative hearings."
2009.08-304,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.094,2159.136,Which decision of ours do you think would prompt Congress to go back and do this right?
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,2187.373,2190.466,"Well, unfortunately we have to deal with the statute as it is."
2009.08-304,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2216.171,2218.14,Suppose that the second phrase said
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,2225.748,2228.697,"No, I would not."
2009.08-304,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2228.697,2231.54,What's the difference between that and the way it's phrased now?
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,2231.54,2236.398,"Because it is -- Congress did put it in a separate category, so--"
2009.08-304,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2236.398,2238.086,"No, no."
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,2251.125,2253.235,--I think that--
2009.08-304,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2253.235,2255.485,"Why wouldn't you make the same argument with relation to ""news media""?"
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,2255.485,2261.308,"--I think the contextual clues would be less compelling there in that situation, and you would have--"
2009.08-304,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2261.308,2261.499,Why is that?
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,2261.499,2267.792,--Because you would have a category that would have a mixture of exclusively Federal and nonfederal.
2009.08-304,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2285.286,2289.36,"This audit report is required by Federal law, isn't it?"
2009.08-304,1,36002,mark_t_hurt,,2289.36,2295.358,"Yes, as are many reports, Medicaid reports by private recipients, today."

2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2420.119,2430.118,"--Well, Your Honor, I -- I want to start by making clear that we disagree that that's a better interpretation of the first clause, but I will take it as the premise."
2009.08-304,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2430.118,2438.693,"Well, it's a lot hard to say you have to put a caret mark and say -- vidi -- means Federal civil, criminal and administrative hearings."
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2438.693,2442.128,It -- it may indeed be harder to do that.
2009.08-304,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2472.926,2473.913,Well -- I didn't mean to interrupt.
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2483.862,2500.289,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that -- that again, as Justice Alito's question at the very beginning of the argument illustrated, the literal language of the word administrative would encompass hearings conducted by private hospitals or universities as well."
2009.08-304,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2502.57,2511.458,"--Well, we would just -- we would just take the sections from your brief today and say well no, you have got to read it in the context in which it appears and this is all Federal, which means it's all governmental."
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2511.458,2519.83,"--That's -- that's right, Your Honor, and governmental in a particular nature, of a particular nature, the Federal Government."
2009.08-304,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2550.788,2556.754,"I just want to get your expertise on this, because you have probably read the legislative history of the 1986 amendment."
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2573.449,2574.198,--No.
2009.08-304,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2574.198,2575.231,I'm not right.
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2576.9,2580.806,"Well, I guess it depends on what you mean by the relevant context."
2009.08-304,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2580.806,2586.523,"--What I'm -- the relevant context has to do in my mind at the moment primarily in respect to the first clause,"
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2604.86,2607.246,"No, Your Honor, it is -- it is clear from the legislative--"
2009.08-304,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2607.246,2607.984,Yeah.
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2611.076,2614.855,--That it was Federal proceedings that Congress had in mind.
2009.08-304,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2617.073,2617.541,--And the word hearing--

2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2626.397,2627.224,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2009.08-304,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2627.224,2630.379,The committee that reported the bill.
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2630.379,2630.91,I'm -- that's right.
2009.08-304,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2631.44,2633.218,In both houses or just one house?
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2633.218,2654.197,"Well, we have the -- the committee report and the bill that was recorded by the House which states specifically at that point, the public disclosure bar referenced information which the Government, capital G, disclosed the basis of allegations in a prior administrative civil proceeding."
2009.08-304,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2655.913,2656.412,The House.
2009.08-304,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2656.412,2658.819,"Well -- well, North Carolina has got a government, too."
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2658.819,2659.521,Excuse me?
2009.08-304,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2659.521,2661.489,"North Carolina has a government, too."
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2661.489,2670.892,"Well, as we note, Your Honor, the statute uses the term ""Government"" with a capital G throughout to refer to the Federal Government."
2009.08-304,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2670.892,2673.235,Same rule for Congress?
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2673.235,2674.077,Excuse me?
2009.08-304,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2674.077,2675.157,Same rule for congressional?
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2675.157,2683.934,"Well, congressional -- the -- the term congressional is frequently used without a capital, but State legislatures are not referred to as congresses."
2009.08-304,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2702.348,2717.045,"There was an explanation for it in the opposing brief, that Congress in -- what was it -- 1986 didn't think that the legislature was generating reports, audits, as distinguished from administrative agencies."
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2717.045,2740.396,"Well -- well, Your Honor, it is of course a -- a truism, that -- that programs are administered by the executive branch more than the legislative branch, but that is no reason to think that Congress would have meant to exclude, if those State legislatures did conduct a hearing with respect to fraud by the State, exclude that as a public disclosure."
2009.08-304,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2747.766,2750.687,Well that -- that doesn't follow like the night the day.
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2758.964,2780.347,"--Well, Your Honor, I -- I think that it is more likely as -- as the development and progress of the clause reflects, that Congress was focused on what does the government know and what does the disclosure show about the whether the government is already or is likely to focus on the fraud."
2009.08-304,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2780.347,2788.516,Is the Justice Department seeking to get this -- this piece of -- of statutory text clarified?
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2800.885,2816.99,"There -- I -- there are currently under consideration bills or, and as I understand it, they are not, there are other bills that are in contemplation that would revise the language of the statute, but -- but would not necessarily focus on this."
2009.08-304,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2819.548,2820.238,Could it make it worse?
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2821.549,2822.816,--I -- I don't know.
2009.08-304,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2823.346,2834.265,"I think the question was has the Department of Justice, recognizing that there's a circuit split this very question recommended that Congress amend the statute in this particular--"
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2834.265,2845.319,--I -- I don't believe that as of yet the department has taken a specific position on -- on the legislation that is contemplated in this particular ambiguity.
2009.08-304,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2845.319,2852.788,"--There is one ambiguity whether this clause, the first -- what we call first and second refers to State as well as Federal."
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2874.668,2875.167,The Senate--
2009.08-304,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2875.167,2878.275,--and the conference is yet more ambiguous on that point.
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2892.52,2895.456,--The context is -- is Federal.
2009.08-304,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2976.986,2990.873,"--Do you think that the -- when a -- when State employees want to immunize themselves from fraud, they are going to say, okay, we will disclose it where anybody -- a prosecutor could pick it up, but we will take care of the qui tam obligation."
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,2990.873,3003.959,"--Well, Your Honor, I think it's important to note that, in order to be a public disclosure -- the second category at the very least -- all that needs to have happened is that information be disclosed to -- to one additional person."
2009.08-304,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3032.2,3037.476,But there's lots of disclosures -- there's lots of disclosures in Federal reports that the government isn't pursuing.
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,3037.476,3052.723,"--Well, we think that the -- the disclosures -- the allegations in the types of reports, audits, investigations, that are referenced in the clause are the type that would evidence that the government is pursuing them."
2009.08-304,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3099.591,3105.339,But why can't it -- why can't it protect itself if these reports are in its possession?
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,3124.286,3138.5,"Well, Your Honor, Petitioners' reference to this audit being in the possession of the government -- it's happenstance that this particular report, the Crisp & Hughes report, was sent to the Federal government official."
2009.08-304,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3214.919,3228.181,"Isn't that argument suggesting that the court didn't even need to reach this issue, even assuming that the State administrative reports are included in the bar?"
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,3228.181,3230.821,"No -- no, Your Honor, I don't think so."
2009.08-304,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3230.821,3236.18,"Well, aren't you arguing that what was in this audit report wasn't sufficient to show the fraud?"
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,3237.131,3245.736,"No -- again, this report here did have information that was indicative of fraud, and this report--"
2009.08-304,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3245.736,3246.22,In which way?
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,3246.22,3247.36,--Excuse me?
2009.08-304,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3247.36,3248.124,Which way?
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,3255.276,3257.62,There -- there were multiple allegations.
2009.08-304,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3286.016,3288.169,"Of course, the Attorney General can always bring suit, right?"
2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,3296.307,3296.931,--But only if we--

2009.08-304,2,21013,douglas_hallwarddriemeier,,3300.336,3306.099,--And what is at issue here is whether the Federal government is ever going to learn of the fraud.
2009.08-304,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3306.099,3307.086,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-304,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3310.505,3312.333,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-304,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3349.94,3351.25,"Now, I agree with you about that."
2009.08-304,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3355.891,3356.624,Well--
2009.08-304,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3356.624,3365.699,And the reason that it's -- it's basically silence -- the reason I am thinking that cuts against you is because of this sorting of the context where they are focusing on Federal.
2009.08-304,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3381.861,3394.843,"--Yes, Justice Breyer, that the government assumes and repeats throughout its brief that the False Claims Act is exclusively Federal in nature; therefore, you read all of its terms as essentially being -- being Federal."
2009.08-304,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3399.074,3403.337,"When we say everybody's working in a certain context, how -- how many people is everybody?"
2009.08-304,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3413.039,3415.708,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, your point is well-taken, that this would only be--"
2009.08-304,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3415.708,3421.878,"I think in the -- it was -- it probably came out in governmental affairs in the Senate, which I think had 17 members at the time."
2009.08-304,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3421.878,3422.814,--Yes.

2009.08-304,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3507.637,3511.368,"That's the same -- that's one of the arguments that, I think, is balanced on the other side."
2009.08-304,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3523.566,3528.991,"--Your Honor, it does give rise to a -- a false claim will, of course, give rise to criminal liability."

2009.08-304,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3545.167,3550.712,But what your claim is -- is that the government -- the Federal government is not the only person harmed?
2009.08-304,3,18476,christopher_g_browning_jr,,3550.712,3552.194,Yes.
