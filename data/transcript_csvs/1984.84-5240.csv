1984.84-5240,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.678,We will hear arguments next in Jean against the Commissioner of Immigration.
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,16.593,36.845,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, this is a case about invidious discrimination in enforcement of the immigration laws of the United States against black Haitian refugees who were seeking political asylum in the United States."
1984.84-5240,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,115.926,123.873,"Mr. Kurzban, are any of the people detained who constituted the member class still detained?"
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,125.874,141.635,"Yes, Your Honor, although it is not in the record directly, there are 400, approximately 400 Haitians who are presently detained, and they constitute 70 percent of the population incarcerated at the present time in south Florida."
1984.84-5240,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.635,145.726,"The court below remanded the case, did it not?"
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,145.726,146.617,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-5240,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,146.617,150.668,For findings of the District Court?
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,161.207,172.296,"I think it is very unclear, to be quite frank, Your Honor, about what the standard is on remand and what the en banc court said."
1984.84-5240,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.31,193.978,"The question of whether the neutral standards since adopted by regulation by the government were complied with and as applied kind of a compliance standard, is that what you understand?"
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,193.978,196.75,"--Well, again, I honestly think it is unclear."
1984.84-5240,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.124,272.581,I guess the difference is that when you started the action there were no government regulations in effect governing the detention and parole.
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,272.581,283.818,"But there was a statute, Your Honor, that said... there was a facially neutral statute, 1182(d)(5), and low-level immigration officials enforced that statute in a discriminatory way."
1984.84-5240,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,300.251,310.165,"Well, do we have the cart before the horse a little bit, trying to decide the constitutional issue before we know whether in fact it is being discriminatorily applied?"
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,316.84,324.475,"--Well, Your Honor, I think in some circumstances that is correct, but not in this circumstance, for several reasons."
1984.84-5240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,371.876,381.312,"Mr. Kurzban, is it your position that the government may not discriminate in administering the immigration laws on the basis of nationality?"
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,381.312,384.345,"Well, Your Honor, I think it depends on who we are talking about."
1984.84-5240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,417.536,421.177,Is that because of the regulations and the statute?
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,421.177,430.382,"No, it is because this Court has always recognized that race and national origin discrimination are suspect--"
1984.84-5240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,430.382,432.606,"We've got two separate questions, I think."
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,460.045,469.201,"--I do not know that that follows, Your Honor, because on the record in this case, they remanded it back on a standard that masks discrimination."
1984.84-5240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,498.089,503.174,We ordinarily require something more of a controversy than just a debate about moral force.
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,503.174,523.336,"That's correct, Your Honor, but there is a very live controversy here, with the 1,700 people who have been released and for whom the injunction has now been lifted by the en banc court's decision, who are subjected to being redetained, and in Footnote 10 of the government's brief, they indicate that they may very well redetain them."
1984.84-5240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,563.281,569.336,"Well, it may not be... even if it isn't moot, it may not be ripe, the constitutional issue."
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,577.363,588.119,"--Well, Your Honor, we believe it is right because we are dealing with this case from the standpoint of a continuing pattern and practice of discrimination."
1984.84-5240,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,601.757,609.923,"Suppose the District Court gives you just what you are asking for here, even if that stretches the mandate, the remand."
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,609.923,615.247,"Well, what we are asking for, Your Honor... maybe it hasn't been made clear."
1984.84-5240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,629.466,631.877,Even though the regulations forbid it?
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,631.877,634.228,"Well, just as the statute--"
1984.84-5240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,634.228,638.452,You think the lower-level people just continue to violate the law?
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,638.452,639.524,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1984.84-5240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,648.637,650.97,"Well, if they are going to do that, an injunction won't do you much good."
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,650.97,656.043,I think if this Court issued an injunction and issued a declaration--
1984.84-5240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,656.043,657.633,We wouldn't issue the injunction.
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,657.633,664.319,"--Well, I think if this Court issued a declaration and remanded it back to the en banc court to issue an injunction--"
1984.84-5240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.319,672.005,"You would just have another reason... you would just have another weapon to use against lawless conduct, but there is already a weapon to use against it."
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,677.318,685.553,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but what we have here is a continuing pattern and practice of discrimination, despite neutral statutes."
1984.84-5240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,731.491,737.876,"May I just ask one other... what if you've got an injunction that said, obey the regulations as they now exist?"
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,740.658,743.312,--I think if it is done under the Constitution--
1984.84-5240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,743.312,754.329,"No, I just said... the injunction doesn't mention the Constitution, but says, you know, under pain of contempt and all the rest, you are hereby enjoined to obey the regulations that are now in effect."
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,754.329,763.943,--I think that coupled with declaratory relief making it clear that the government cannot use the impermissible criteria of race or national origin--
1984.84-5240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,763.943,768.176,"Well, then, say you can't use the impermissible criteria of race because the regulations forbid you from using it."
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,770.938,772.889,--Yes and no.
1984.84-5240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,782.154,783.626,But does it give you the moral statement you want?
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,785.066,795.374,"--Well, in part, yes, but also because the Eleventh Circuit here has made a statement saying the constitution does not apply, and what we are asking is that that decision be--"
1984.84-5240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,795.374,807.061,"--What if we added to that a statement saying the Eleventh Circuit reached a constitutional question it never should have reached, took the view of the concurrence and dissent, but entered an injunction saying obey the regulation?"
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,808.651,810.434,--Under what standard?
1984.84-5240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,810.434,813.318,Under the standard set forth in the regulation.
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,815.038,821.042,"Well, the problem here is that the Eleventh Circuit also remanded it back on a facially legitimate and bona fide standard."
1984.84-5240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,839.044,844.468,"My question didn't... say we vacate everything they did, and we say, this is the injunction to enter."
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,859.299,862.049,--Would it be covered with declaratory relief I think is the question.
1984.84-5240,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,862.049,869.485,"It would say nothing about the answer to the constitutional question, on the theory that we don't answer constitutional questions unless we have to."
1984.84-5240,0,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,869.485,890.439,"I think given the history of discrimination here, given that continuing pattern and practice of discrimination, that it is necessary for this Court to issue a declaration making it clear that under the Constitution no race and nationality discrimination is permissible."
1984.84-5240,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1314.365,1321.871,Mr. Solicitor General.
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1321.871,1337.582,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I assume that it goes without saying that there is no warrant to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in this case."
1984.84-5240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1471.381,1476.494,"Well, Mr. Lee, the District Court made its fact findings of no discrimination."
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1500.829,1501.92,No.
1984.84-5240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1534.021,1543.077,"Well, I guess I just don't understand why the constitutional issue should be resolved if it can be resolved on the basis of the statute and the implementing regulations."
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1543.077,1546.019,"--Well, I am not sure that I have any serious disagreement with you."
1984.84-5240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1560.218,1574.73,"General Lee, you say as I understand it the reasoning of the en banc court was that these allegations of national origin discrimination were irrelevant because the government has the power to engage in national--"
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1574.73,1575.789,Precisely.
1984.84-5240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1575.789,1583.896,"--But if the court below had made finding that there was no national origin discrimination, it seems to me that Justice O'Connor's question is very apt."
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1591.891,1592.472,Yes.
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1673.233,1695.449,"General Lee, before you get into the main part of your argument, I am still puzzled by part of the en banc court's disposition, which, as I read Page 330 of this appendix, it contemplates a remand to the District Court in order to determine whether the people in detention are properly detained, and as a part of that determination to decide whether there is any discrimination going on."
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1697.189,1698.601,I am not sure.
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1724.997,1731.702,Doesn't that imply an unwillingness to accept at face value the finding of no discrimination?
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1731.702,1743.45,"Well, not necessarily, if you do assume that the class applies to these post-judgment arrivals, because there could be some additional facts--"
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1743.45,1745.121,Are the post-judgment arrivals the 400 people--
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1745.121,1746.082,"--They are, yes."
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1746.082,1747.444,--who are now in detention?
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1747.444,1753.386,"Yes, because as to the pre-judgment arrivals, they were all released, because of the APA ruling."
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1753.386,1761.452,Would you agree as to those 400 people that on remand it is appropriate to determine whether they are the victims of any improper discrimination?
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1761.452,1762.071,"No, for a couple of reasons."
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1762.692,1764.742,So you don't sustain the judgment of the Court of Appeals?
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1764.742,1773.1,"--Well, I am just not sure what the Court of Appeals had in mind as to that particular aspect."
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1773.1,1775.481,We shouldn't affirm something we don't understand.
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1776.372,1781.996,"Well, it is just that particular... it is just that particular... there is--"
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1781.996,1786.518,"Well, but the whole case, whether there is discrimination going on as to these 400 people."
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1788.271,1796.815,"--Well, except that the Court of Appeals did not decide the issue as to whether these 400 are or are not part of the class."
1984.84-5240,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1831.029,1838.442,"General Lee, I hate to back up on this, but is it true that we don't know whether the 400 are in here or not in?"
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1838.442,1843.117,"Well, the 400 are here."
1984.84-5240,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1858.808,1862.199,The 400 are here?
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1862.199,1863.21,Excuse me?
1984.84-5240,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1863.21,1864.692,The 400 are here?
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1864.692,1866.342,"Oh, you mean in this Court?"
1984.84-5240,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1866.342,1867.244,Yes.
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1867.244,1869.775,"No, it is not clear that they are."
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1978.496,1980.296,"General Lee, I hate to interrupt again."
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1980.296,1980.787,Yes.
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1980.787,1982.269,This keeps running through my mind.
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1982.269,1983.338,Yes.
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.338,1990.693,You are arguing that constitutionally you would not be inhibited from discriminating against these people on whatever ground seems appropriate.
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2005.953,2006.594,That's correct.
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2006.594,2009.486,Why isn't that the complete answer to the government's position?
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2021.154,2021.953,You don't have to.
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2025.225,2026.086,I understand that.
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2026.086,2034.612,"What your question really goes to, Justice Stevens, is whether certiorari ought to have been granted in this case in the first place."
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2072.236,2073.528,Thank you.
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2073.528,2087.256,"Now, the real question, the real question then is whether this established right to exclude or to admit also applies to the parole stage."
1984.84-5240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2110.551,2111.102,Mr. Lee.
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2111.102,2111.562,--Excuse me.
1984.84-5240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2111.562,2123.51,"In your view, would the Constitution provide any protections to people being detained pending parole as to the conditions of their detention?"
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2123.51,2129.494,"As I read this Court's decisions, Justice O'Connor, the answer to that question is yes."
1984.84-5240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2191.126,2193.338,Shortly after he left office?
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2193.338,2203.532,"--Well, the report was, but the appointment of the Commission, the appointment of the Commission occurred in 1980, and the report was issued in 1981."
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2670.4,2675.744,"General Lee, can I ask a question prompted by Justice O'Connor's question earlier?"
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2685.181,2685.821,"Yes, sir."
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2685.821,2691.043,Does that mean that there will be constitutional protection to different... choice among different alternatives?
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2705.502,2706.564,"Well, I think so."
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.062,2719.812,--Whether or not he can be totally excluded.
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2719.812,2720.493,Right.
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2720.493,2726.006,But the decision to parole or to detain doesn't really affect the decision whether to let him in or not.
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2726.006,2734.801,"Well, it is our position that they are identical, because the decision whether to parole or not to parole is really a decision whether to admit or not to admit."
1984.84-5240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2737.363,2742.037,But you wouldn't say that about the difference between solitary confinement and general population of the prison?
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2742.037,2746.609,"Of course not, because those do not pertain to the judgment whether to admit or not admit."
1984.84-5240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2751.094,2762.06,"Well, are they really identical, Mr. Lee, because presumably someone paroled could have parole revoked and then be excluded, could they not?"
1984.84-5240,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2762.06,2810.352,"--Of course, and an alien once admitted can also have that admission revoked, and can be deported, but the point is, and I am merely faithfully reporting the decisions of this Court as I read them, the point is that the crucial distinction as announced by this Court in Landon versus Plasencia is rights pertaining to his admission, because the question is, is he to be held, so to speak, on the boat, and not permitted to enter until such time as we make a judgment whether he really fits the category of persons who are entitled to enter, and that is what makes the difference between the exclusion cases and the deportation cases."
1984.84-5240,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2913.051,2917.664,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Kurzban?"
1984.84-5240,2,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2917.664,2918.204,Thank you.
1984.84-5240,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2918.204,2920.115,You have eight minutes remaining.
1984.84-5240,2,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2920.115,2921.267,Thank you.
1984.84-5240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3215.2,3223.134,"Mr. Kurzban, the District Court found otherwise, and the en banc court remanded for findings on whether there was discrimination."
1984.84-5240,2,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,3226.177,3230.388,"I interpret the en banc court as merely paying lip service, Your Honor, because they--"
1984.84-5240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3230.388,3231.61,Lip service to what?
1984.84-5240,2,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,3231.61,3250.442,"--Lip service to the question of race and nationality discrimination, because while making a broad holding on the constitutional grounds, then gave a very narrow standard of review, the facially legitimate and bona fide standard, and under that standard mere protestation of innocence, for example, may be enough."
1984.84-5240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3298.865,3304.758,May I ask if you view this as related just to the 400 subsequent arrivals?
1984.84-5240,2,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,3304.758,3316.595,"No, Your Honor, not at all, because the en banc court also vacated the injunction that prevented the government from redetaining the 1,700 Haitians who have been released."
1984.84-5240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3319.547,3322.579,Do you think the hearing on remand will encompass everybody?
1984.84-5240,2,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,3322.579,3333.086,"--No, the hearing on remand is constituted by the Eleventh Circuit, made it very clear that it only pertains, only pertains to the 400 people who are in detention."
1984.84-5240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3333.086,3335.078,And are they all subsequent arrivals?
1984.84-5240,2,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,3335.078,3336.709,"Some... most are, but some aren't."
1984.84-5240,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3337.85,3340.092,I see.
1984.84-5240,2,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,3342.051,3346.455,"Those 400 and the 1,700 are all members of the class."
1984.84-5240,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3347.787,3349.039,"Thank you, gentlemen."
