1967.703,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,27.313,"Number 703, Jack Allen Barber, petitioner versus Ray H. Page, Warden."
1967.703,0,28669,ira_g_rothgerber_jr,,33.738,39.323,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.703,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,933.322,936.4,What citation of that case that Third Circuit --
1967.703,0,28669,ira_g_rothgerber_jr,,936.4,943.263,Virgin Islands against Aquino Your Honor is 378 F.2nd 540.
1967.703,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,947.654,950.971,Thank you.
1967.703,0,28669,ira_g_rothgerber_jr,,950.971,993.308,"The Fifth Circuit also has differed from the Tenth Circuit's casual test in Holman against Washington which is also referred to in our brief, it is cited 364 F.2nd 618, where the Court took note that compulsory process is not the only method of securing attendance of witnesses and said that the right of confrontation is too valuable right to be sacrificed for the convenience of a party."
1967.703,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1047.837,1064.973,"Well, are you conceding that if there had been vigorous cross-examination at the preliminary hearing, the transcript would have been proper -- pro se the transcript and evidence at the subsequent trial?"
1967.703,0,28669,ira_g_rothgerber_jr,,1064.973,1065.722,No Your Honor.
1967.703,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1078.456,1080.798,"Well, Mattox was a different case."
1967.703,0,28669,ira_g_rothgerber_jr,,1086.766,1087.437,Yes Your Honor.
1967.703,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1087.891,1092.693,-- the case where there had been a trial.
1967.703,0,28669,ira_g_rothgerber_jr,,1092.693,1093.422,Yes Your Honor.
1967.703,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1093.422,1098.025,And then the two witnesses died and there was later a retrial.
1967.703,0,28669,ira_g_rothgerber_jr,,1098.025,1098.88,That is correct Your Honor.
1967.703,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1098.88,1118.395,"And I suppose that it's arguable in a way that the cross-examination at a trial is one thing, cross-examination at a preliminary examination is quite a different thing and that they are not substitutable one for the other in terms of the due process standard?"
1967.703,0,28669,ira_g_rothgerber_jr,,1118.395,1165.21,"Indeed Your Honor, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit makes this very distinction in Government of Virgin Islands against Aquino because at a preliminary hearing, particularly here where the preliminary hearing preceded the date of information by three days so that the counsel even assuming that he were counsel only for the petitioner, he doesn't know the charges that are pending against his petitioner and all of us who are lawyers know that at a preliminary hearing of the standard is only one of showing probable cause and it isn't very prudent representation of one's client to enlarge upon the prosecution state -- prosecution's case which is always a possibility."
1967.703,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1165.21,1193.86,"That's why I have so much -- I have some difficulty in understanding why you make such a point of Mr. -- this lawyer's alleged lack of faithful representation of his client because even if he were the most deciduous and rigorous lawyer in the world, it might very well be that at a preliminary examination, he might decide to withhold across --"
1967.703,0,28669,ira_g_rothgerber_jr,,1193.86,1195.752,That is correct Your Honor --
1967.703,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1195.752,1201.563,"-- not be prepared, very likely would not be prepared for a cross-examination?"
1967.703,0,28669,ira_g_rothgerber_jr,,1201.563,1203.206,That is quite correct Your Honor.
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,1595.099,1600.953,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.703,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1790.525,1791.302,Mr. Owens.
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,1791.302,1791.949,Yes sir.
1967.703,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1791.949,1796.298,You agree in -- I wonder if I'm correct on this.
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,1803.637,1804.502,Yes sir.
1967.703,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1806.76,1811.471,And that was binding on him throughout the trial?
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,1811.471,1812.724,I believe so Your Honor.
1967.703,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1812.724,1822.332,"Well, if that's true, suppose you had produced this witness and he testified in open court."
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,1822.332,1823.421,At trial.
1967.703,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1823.421,1830.154,Then is it your position that the lawyer could cross-examine him?
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,1830.154,1831.413,You mean at trial?
1967.703,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1831.413,1832.548,Yes sir.
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,1832.548,1835.213,"Yes certainly, he could cross-examine there."
1967.703,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1835.213,1836.477,"You couldn't stop him, could you?"
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,1836.477,1837.607,No sir.
1967.703,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1837.607,1840.35,"Well then he didn't waive, did he?"
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,1840.35,1844.187,"Yes, I think preliminary hearing and trial are two different things."
1967.703,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1844.187,1860.73,"I am saying he waived, he waived the cross-examination at the preliminary trial of this witness and you produced that witness at the trial itself."
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,1863.892,1865.027,Certainly not.
1967.703,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1865.027,1869.823,"So his waiver did not carry over to the trial itself, did it?"
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,1869.823,1873.282,I suggest that it did.
1967.703,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1873.282,1874.537,"Well, I'm lost."
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,1874.537,1906.59,"I think in Oklahoma at least, under the decisions of our court of criminal appeals in this area where they have held before in similar cases that where witnesses aren't available at the trial and he has been available at preliminary hearing where the counsel has had a full and adequate opportunity to cross-examine and he is unavailable at trial, then the transcript is admissible."
1967.703,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1917.943,1922.446,And that ruling includes he is presumed to know that that witness won't be available?
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,1922.446,1922.75,No.
1967.703,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1923.687,1925.67,"Rather he'd assume he will be available, wouldn't he?"
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,1925.67,1943.151,I think he is presumed to take the calculated risk of either cross-examining him or risking the possibility that this witness might die or for some other reason be unavailable at trial.
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1994.549,2001.657,"When you say unavailable Mr. Owens, I suppose you mean unavailable without fault on the part of the prosecution?"
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2001.657,2003.708,"Yes, certainly."
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2003.708,2007.685,Would you mind telling me what the sequence of events that were here?
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2012.553,2015.082,"I really don't know for sure, Your Honor."
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2019.751,2021.032,Was he convicted?
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2021.032,2031.372,"He was -- apparently, an agreement was reached between the prosecution that he would not be prosecuted in the state court in return for his testimony."
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2036.532,2047.402,Did the state -- did the state inform this petitioner that it had made that agreement and was going to consent to taking him out of the state?
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2047.402,2049.397,The record again is silent there.
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2050.659,2053.632,"There's nothing to indicate that they did do that, isn't it?"
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2053.632,2055.054,No sir.
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2058.022,2062.333,When did he go to Texas?
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2062.333,2074.663,"I have set out the date I believe in my brief between the preliminary examination and the time that the defendant, petitioner here came on for trial."
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2074.663,2074.937,Yes.
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2079.158,2079.492,Yes.
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2079.492,2085.61,But when between there did they relinquish him to the federal government?
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2085.61,2088.759,I don't believe we have anything in the record to show that exact date.
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2095.434,2098.138,And you think that that might be important?
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2098.138,2101.665,You mean the length of time after the preliminary hearing that they --
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2101.665,2108.288,He was available to the prosecution?
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2108.288,2112.47,It could be.
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2112.47,2114.295,There's nothing in the record to show --
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2114.295,2118.371,I believe not sir.
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2252.158,2264.496,"May I ask, how often in practice do lawyers examine the witnesses for the prosecution at preliminary examinations?"
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2268.739,2281.285,"I think ti probably is about 50/50, Your Honor from experience and from my practice, I think I'd exercise the right about 50% of the time."
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2281.323,2299.451,"I'm just wondering if we decided with you, would that mean that in every case where there was some cross-examination that the prosecution would say to the witness, you're free to go any place you want and if you're not available at the time of trial, we will read your testimony."
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2299.451,2299.608,No.
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2306.631,2308.847,Why would this be the exception to that?
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2308.847,2320.369,"Certainly, the prosecution I suggest could not do anything to intentionally make the witness unavailable."
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2324.666,2329.404,Here didn't they do something to make him unavailable?
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2367.67,2373.886,I'm not sure Mr. Chief Justice that they released him to the federal government.
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2374.197,2375.351,"Well, how would he get over there?"
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2375.351,2392.805,"I think simply -- if this is a typical case, it would be one in which the prosecution made an agreement with him that he would testify for the state in return for which they would not prosecute him or would work out some recommended sentence."
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2414.597,2417.269,A crime that he'd committed before this one?
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2417.269,2419.167,I think so.
1967.703,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2420.125,2425.571,"Well, isn't that giving him away to another jurisdiction so as to make him unavailable?"
1967.703,1,19732,charles_l_owens,,2425.571,2430.411,"No, I think simply releasing him is not --"
1967.703,2,28669,ira_g_rothgerber_jr,,3359.269,3363.205,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.703,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3500.72,3501.622,You're welcome.
