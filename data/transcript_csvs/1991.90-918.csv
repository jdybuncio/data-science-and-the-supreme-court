1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.621,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-918, Christine Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools and William Prescott."
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,10.777,12.745,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.655,200.264,"Well, back pay, of course, is not the equivalent of damages."
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,200.264,215.102,"I agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think the principle is that in Guardians and Darrone the reason back pay was found to be available is that once the Court finds an implied right of action it infers the availability of traditional damages."
1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,219.271,229.486,"I don't see how you draw upon a case which allowed back pay as saying that therefore damages are available, unless just by a rather distant implication."
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,229.486,240.09,"--Well, I think it is by implication in the sense that I think the reasoning that led the Court to think... to conclude rather... that damages... that back pay is available, that same reasoning applies here."
1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,264.472,266.298,This was Guardians that you're talking about now?
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,266.298,268.798,"This is Guardians, which I think then was--"
1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,268.798,273.921,I think it's very difficult to draw any very compelling inference from Guardians.
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,275.061,278.012,--I think it is hard to draw it from Guardians alone.
1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,280.168,281.386,What's the other case?
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,281.386,281.995,--Darrone.
1991.90-918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,291.399,306.331,"Mr. Klein, I think that our cases in Touche Ross and maybe the Sierra Club indicate that the Courts won't engraft a remedy on a statute that Congress didn't intent to provide."
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,310.765,314.357,"I don't in the following sense, Justice O'Connor."
1991.90-918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,326.65,329.726,You think it has nothing to do with scope of the remedy?
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,329.726,332.038,"I don't, for the following reason."
1991.90-918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.978,372.552,Do you think that we have employed that notion even in statutes enacted under the Spending Clause?
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,372.552,379.988,"I do, because I think that notion explains the Guardians, Darrone cases, which is a Spending Clause statute."
1991.90-918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,379.988,397.011,"Well, I thought under the Spending Clause theory we were a little more careful about binding a damages remedy if it might be beyond the scope of what we assume the States have contracted with the Federal Government to do."
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,397.011,404.758,"I think you have, but I think that distinction was drawn actually by Justice White in his opinion in Guardians."
1991.90-918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.024,408.069,I'm not sure that was joined by anybody.
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,408.069,411.131,"--It was actually joined by the Chief Justice, but I think that--"
1991.90-918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,411.131,412.677,That part was?
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,412.677,413.723,"--I believe so, sir."
1991.90-918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,413.723,415.942,I was fortunate.
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,417.191,436.339,"I think the point that Justice White made, which it seems to me is a fair point, that if you're talking about an imply... a damages remedy in a context where it's an unintentional violation, it's difficult, the Pennhurst concern about contractual understandings is appropriate."
1991.90-918,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,464.704,471.608,"Well, what would you do if you were faced with an unintentional violation, so to speak?"
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,475.279,476.513,Of title IX?
1991.90-918,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,534.597,542.234,"Mr. Klein, could the petitioner have pleaded a cause of action under section 1983?"
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,542.234,544.266,"I believe she could have, Justice Blackmun."
1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,578.689,589.717,"Well, wouldn't she have to show too that there was a policy on the part of the school board before she could sue the school board, rather than individuals who she claimed discriminated under Monell?"
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,589.717,596.308,"Well, she would have to certainly meet the criteria under Monell, and I think we can meet those criteria in the--"
1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,596.308,599.9,But it's a criteria you would not have to meet under title IX.
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,599.9,602.944,"--Well, let me say I don't think we'd have to meet it under title IX."
1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,607.069,620.563,"So that if, if we upheld your position here, people who had previously sued under 1983 and had to prove a policy under Monell would be relieved of that obligation?"
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,620.563,625.296,"--I think that's right, Mr. Chief Justice, but I want to say I don't think that's surprising in the following sense."
1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,642.024,645.975,The Eleventh Amendment has never applied either to municipal corporations or to counties.
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,645.975,648.083,"That's correct, but it is applied to States."
1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,648.083,654.487,"Yes, but we're not talking about a State here and we're not talking about a State in the typical Monell situation."
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,657.845,658.609,Right.
1991.90-918,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,681.774,684.179,"Mr. Klein, what's your position on punitive damages?"
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,684.179,694.657,"My position is that punitive damages would be allowed, but I will acknowledge, Justice Kennedy, that that doesn't follow inexorably from the conclusion that compensatory damages would be allowed."
1991.90-918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,716.697,721.445,"Mr. Klein, couldn't an argument be made that this isn't covered by 1983?"
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,721.445,722.257,Yes.
1991.90-918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,723.599,729.082,Have we held... have we held that sex discrimination is covered?
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,729.082,733.423,--Have you held that sex discrimination is covered under 1983?
1991.90-918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.965,750.354,I see what you're saying.
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,751.62,752.683,Through title IX.
1991.90-918,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,758.976,778.89,"--Mr. Klein, to the extent that the Eleventh Amendment waiver is at least a relevant consideration for us, is there any clear indication that the intention, the congressional intention in doing that was to open the States wide open to damage remedies as opposed to getting around a more limited Edelman and Jordan?"
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,778.89,779.764,--Yes.
1991.90-918,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,802.272,809.86,"Well, there wouldn't to the extent that it was merely injunction, but to the extent that equity would be awarding any monetary relief there would be a reason."
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,809.86,810.61,That is correct.
1991.90-918,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,874.444,875.71,Okay.
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,875.71,883.238,"I'd like to move back just a moment, if I could, because I think this issue of direct congressional intent bears some elaboration."
1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,982.294,993.728,"Mr. Klein, was the language of section 1866... rather of the 1866 Civil Rights Act... with respect to remedies the same as the language of title IX?"
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,993.728,995.524,"No, no, it was not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,995.524,997.663,Then why does one bear on the other?
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,997.663,1003.879,"Because the Court's principle in several cases... it was not just Sullivan, the 1982 case."
1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1019.763,1024.417,"Well, is that rule, for example, stated in the Sullivan case?"
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1024.417,1026.761,I believe... I believe it's flatly stated.
1991.90-918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.147,1194.443,Where is that in your brief?
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1194.443,1215.998,"That, unfortunately, and I apologize, Mr., Justice Scalia, that is in the brief of the amici curiae, the American Council of the Blind, and it is discussed on pages 24 through 25."
1991.90-918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.998,1217.669,Does it have the text of the statute?
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1218.81,1224.04,"The statute, Justice Scalia, simply incorporates the remedies available under 504."
1991.90-918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1225.508,1229.023,"--So when you say that Congress said, you mean some of the legislative history says that?"
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1229.023,1229.507,That's what I--
1991.90-918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1229.507,1231.225,I wish you'd make the distinction.
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1231.225,1232.006,--I apologize.
1991.90-918,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1232.006,1233.053,Some of us think there's a difference.
1991.90-918,0,31305,joel_i_klein,,1234.223,1243.611,What I meant to suggest is the statute expressly incorporates the remedies available under 504.
1991.90-918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1388.255,1390.784,"Very well, Mr. Klein."
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1392.862,1395.627,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1482.936,1485.139,May I ask this one question?
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1499.961,1506.241,"Well, as far as equitable relief is concerned I think that there are a number of options available to a school system."
1991.90-918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.112,1516.423,You mean this student should bring suit or to get an order against a discharged employee to be disciplined?
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1517.423,1518.423,--If necessary.
1991.90-918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1520.546,1525.466,"--What in this particular case, what kind of equitable relief could possibly justify even filing the lawsuit?"
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1525.466,1529.636,"Well, there are two steps to the process, and I think it's important to emphasize both."
1991.90-918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1556.251,1563.482,"No, no, I understand, but my question is devoted to a... the plaintiff in the case and the... I gather you assume there is an implied cause of action in the case."
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1563.482,1566.027,"Yeah, we don't question that."
1991.90-918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1566.027,1574.119,"And what is the possible, even theoretical possible remedy that the individual plaintiff in this case could have available that would motivate even bringing the case?"
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1576.431,1584.208,"It goes back to the agency remedy, is that the conciliation process can produce internal changes, discipline, restorative measures, restorative--"
1991.90-918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.208,1585.302,--But that's not responsive to my question.
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1585.302,1586.925,--It is because it moots the equity point.
1991.90-918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1597.422,1601.654,Moot what claim for equitable... what is the claim for equitable relief that she could ever assert?
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1601.654,1616.789,"--Well, in the context of a student who has been sexually victimized in any way one issue is whether, as a result of the misconduct, she has been fully restored to the educational status she is entitled to under title IX."
1991.90-918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1630.096,1633.094,But those are arguments for saying there's no need for a private cause of action.
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1633.094,1635.359,"No, sir, they're not, because if the--"
1991.90-918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1635.359,1640.763,"You still haven't responded to my question, what equitable relief she could get if she has a cause of action."
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1640.763,1669.018,"--If the school does not restore her to a status that she would have enjoyed but for the discrimination, then she can go into court and say they have acknowledged misconduct but they have not taken enough action to restore me to my pre-act status, and then can ask for the district judge to give additional relief, require additional corrective measures to restore the student to the pre-misconduct status."
1991.90-918,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1748.518,1751.576,"Well, this is one... isn't this one such case on your argument?"
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1756.606,1758.559,"--Well, there is none needed, but steps were taken that were--"
1991.90-918,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1758.559,1759.965,Okay.
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1764.869,1776.427,"--Not at this point, and that claim was dropped, and it was dropped by virtue of the compliance steps taken by the school system, which were the result of the extant enforcement mechanism."
1991.90-918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.252,1795.31,"Mr. Pearson, it seems to me you're asking us to adopt a topsy-turvy implication from the statute."
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1822.97,1823.298,No.
1991.90-918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.712,1848.554,"It isn't that you wouldn't have a cause of action, it's that there was... there was a defense."
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1854.552,1881.634,"Well, we're not disputing the existence of cause of action, but the question is is the remedy that we're talking about in the context of this case somehow an inversion of traditional, established legal priorities, and the answer is in the law, by virtue of the longstanding existence of the law of immunities, equitable relief was in fact the primary exclusive relief against immune institutions, both State by virtue of the Eleventh Amendment and governmental."
1991.90-918,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.634,1883.571,--And is this an immune institution?
1991.90-918,1,16720,albert_m_pearson_iii,,1885.601,1889.897,It will... it may be immune institution; it may not be.
1991.90-918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2133.876,2137.094,"Very well, Mr. Pearson."
1991.90-918,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2138.25,2151.697,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.858,2342.464,Is it your position then that the language relied upon by the petitioner is from our decision in Bell against Hood is limited to constitutional violations?
1991.90-918,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2342.464,2343.355,"It is, Your Honor."
1991.90-918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2529.062,2532.887,This is the 1986 act you're referring to?
1991.90-918,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2532.887,2535.511,"Right, the Equalization Act."
1991.90-918,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.511,2541.541,"But in this case there would clearly be a remedy against a private school here, wouldn't there, on the facts of this case?"
1991.90-918,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2541.541,2543.524,"Not in damages, Your Honor, we submit."
1991.90-918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2670.692,2675.955,When you talk about this statute are you emphasizing the fact that it's a Spending Clause statute?
1991.90-918,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2675.955,2689.949,"--We are emphasizing the fact that the obligation is tied to receipt of Federal funds and therefore we believe it is significant, as members of the Court have suggested, that entities be aware of what sorts of obligations they are accepting."
1991.90-918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2689.949,2707.067,"Well, you're not... I gather then that you're not proposing that we adopt a general rule that anytime we find an implied cause of action in any statute damages are not authorized unless Congress has said so expressly?"
1991.90-918,2,41813,stephen_l_nightingale,,2707.067,2718.891,"The... what we suggest, Your Honor, is that the Court should approach the materials relating to each statute and determine what remedies Congress has authorized."
1991.90-918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2726.842,2728.84,"Thank you, Mr. Nightingale."
1991.90-918,3,31305,joel_i_klein,,2732.761,2734.087,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-918,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2958.372,2965.791,Mr. Klein... unless they had teachers... they thought that most of the discrimination would be against teachers rather than students.
