2007.06-1204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.682,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-1204, Republic of the Philippines v. Pimentel, et al.."
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,10.122,23.225,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns a dispute over the ownership of the property, the Arelma assets, that the Republic of the Philippines believes were stolen by Ferdinand Marcos while he served as the Republic's president."
2007.06-1204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,37.453,39.188,I just didn't hear you.
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,41.671,43.201,--By the courts of the Republic.
2007.06-1204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,64.553,66.413,That's been pending how long?
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,66.413,78.547,"It's been pending... well, the Republic initially filed a forfeiture petition in 1991 directed at a range of assets related to former president Marcos."
2007.06-1204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,107.145,109.332,So it's from 2004 to 2008?
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,109.332,110.832,"It has been, Your Honor."
2007.06-1204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,140.9,144.366,"--Well, it gets way ahead of the analysis and probably way ahead of your argument."
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,161.376,163.328,"--Well, I certainly will, Your Honor."
2007.06-1204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,203.765,222.257,"Mr. Rothfeld, will you explain then how it was that the Philippine Government supported the litigation against Marcos that led to the, what was it, the $2 billion judgment?"
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,222.257,224.099,That's right.
2007.06-1204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,224.099,225.287,Said that it had no objection to that suit.
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,250.964,262.538,"Well, I think not, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that there is in fact no inconsistency at all."
2007.06-1204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,316.094,318.749,Is there anything else in the estate?
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,318.749,336.553,"There is litigation going on in the Philippines now before the Sandiganbayan as to what is in the estate, and I think that one of the problems, of course, is that, as is true of many corrupt regimes that have misappropriated state assets, unraveling it is enormously complicated."
2007.06-1204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,342.223,346.253,"Well, let me ask a slightly different question from Justice Scalia's."
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,354.421,356.999,I think that there are some assets.
2007.06-1204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,361.513,369.603,Enough assets to satisfy the claims of the individuals who... who brought suit in the United States?
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,369.603,372.523,"--No, there are not and there may never have been."
2007.06-1204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,372.523,388.158,"So the position of the Philippines, going back to Justice Ginsburg's question, was we have no objection and in fact I think it was we support the litigation in the United States, but when it comes time to collect a judgment we're claiming they don't get a penny because everything belongs to us."
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,390.736,393.234,"I think that is not an entirely fair summary, Your Honor."
2007.06-1204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,406.9,410.164,"Well, they weren't just suing to condemn the regime."
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,413.865,415.49,"That is true, Your Honor."
2007.06-1204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,430.923,451.321,"No, but we live in a practical world and if in fact there were no apparent assets that might satisfy that judgment that the Philippine Government did not claim, then their... then their support of the... of the earlier litigation was at the very least in tension with their... with their overall position."
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,451.321,455.912,"--Well, I think that that... again, I would respectfully disagree with that."
2007.06-1204,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,494.318,503.612,"Then why doesn't the Republic take the position that, because that was vetoed for reasons apart from the Republic's discretion, that the current assets would be an appropriate source of payment?"
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,503.612,514.687,"--There have been a number of efforts in the Philippine Congress, and there is now pending bills in the Philippine Congress, to compensate the claimants in amounts equivalent to those settlements."
2007.06-1204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,525.29,531.929,There's one other point of Philippine law that's unclear from the briefs.
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,562.229,572.803,"Well, we quoted the relevant portion of Philippine law, which is equivalent to our permissive intervention, which would have permitted the claimants to seek to intervene in the proceeding of the Sandiganbayan."
2007.06-1204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,573.569,575.239,"Seek to intervene, but no right to intervene?"
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,575.239,578.003,--It is not a matter of right; it is permissive intervention.
2007.06-1204,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,611.554,612.818,Could you address that?
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,635.246,642.167,"--Well, I think that that's... sovereign immunity and dismissal under Rule 19 are two different but closely related and essential aspects of the relief of the Republic."
2007.06-1204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,686.101,698.252,"Why couldn't... why couldn't the Philippines, not having been a party in this action, pursued whoever did get the assets from this action--"
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,698.252,698.861,--Well--
2007.06-1204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,698.861,701.142,"--in normal litigation, if they objected to the resolution."
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,701.142,704.64,"--Well, let me amend your question in one respect."
2007.06-1204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,714.917,718.103,I guess they weren't there for the adjudication on the merits.
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,718.103,723.227,"--They were not there for the adjudication of the merits, that's right, because they had asserted their sovereign immunity."
2007.06-1204,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,815.129,827.875,Would you agree that the Republic is ultimately not going to be able to collect these funds unless it sues in the United States and waives its immunity in that suit?
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,833.262,847.725,"Well, I don't think it's directly relevant, but I think that if one looks at the bigger picture, it is true... if the Republic... if this action is dismissed, the Sandiganbayan rules, and let's say that it rules for the Republic, the Republic becomes the owner of Arelma."
2007.06-1204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,886.476,898.142,"Well, is it... is it fair to the private claimants here in the United States to say, wait until the Philippine court renders a judgment in favor of the Philippines, and then they can come in and enforce the judgment against Merrill Lynch or whomever is holding the assets?"
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,898.142,907.358,"--Well, I think if the Sandiganbayan rules for the Republic, the assets are the Republic's assets."
2007.06-1204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,909.561,911.545,"Well, under the determination of the Philippine court."
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,916.386,920.306,"--Well, it did without the participation of the Philippines."
2007.06-1204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,920.306,925.445,"Well, you just told me that the Philippines court may judge the opposite without the participation of the private claimants."
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,925.445,930.615,"Well, but the... but again, Your Honor, it's important to remember the private claimants have no claim to the Arelma assets."
2007.06-1204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,934.269,939.563,"That seems to me to be an argument on the merits, rather than with respect to which case should proceed first."
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,939.563,944.781,"--Well, it goes, I think, to the question of whether their claim is one which is entitled to be heard in the United States."
2007.06-1204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,970.036,982.015,"Would the private claimants be able to undermine the added force of the judgment in the Philippines, assuming a proceeding is brought here, on the ground that they were not allowed to participate in the proceeding in the Philippines?"
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,982.015,989.17,"Well, I think... I would say probably not, Your Honor, because again their interests are entirely derivative of the Marcos estate."
2007.06-1204,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,999.477,1000.415,In privity with the estate?
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1009.474,1011.487,"No, I do not suggest any connection between them."
2007.06-1204,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.093,1032.041,How much of an interest does the estate have if it is all going to be claimed by... by these private plaintiffs?
2007.06-1204,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1032.041,1038.867,"Well, the estate has a... as I say, these assets have been moved around or hidden."
2007.06-1204,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1046.458,1047.271,"Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld."
2007.06-1204,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1059.453,1071.808,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a sovereign government cannot be made a party to a case because of its immunity from suit, that fact must be given great weight in determining whether the suit nonetheless may proceed."
2007.06-1204,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1080.069,1087.973,"When you say Mr. Kneedler, then you are not agreeing with Mr. Rothfeld, who says it's automatic?"
2007.06-1204,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1087.973,1104.872,"We believe it would be dispositive in most cases, we think, only if the sovereign's interests would be adequately protected by the judgment or in the rare case that we've identified in our brief where the sovereign's interests are adequately protected by another sovereign, in the case of an Indian tribe being protected by the United States."
2007.06-1204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1142.528,1146.137,But suppose a case... and you have to do a lot of supposing.
2007.06-1204,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1164.753,1171.205,"I think that's probably correct if the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act governs the service of process under the Act, and if the--"
2007.06-1204,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1171.205,1175.827,"I understand, but in my hypothetical case it's just as if somebody is at the North Pole and you can't serve them."
2007.06-1204,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1175.827,1176.155,--Right.
2007.06-1204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1244.581,1254.826,"Mr. Kneedler, getting back to your previous point, why isn't the Philippine National... why don't... why doesn't the Philippine National Bank adequately represent the interest of the Republic?"
2007.06-1204,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1261.387,1263.215,--Because the Philippines... excuse me.
2007.06-1204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1283.003,1292.656,"Well, they are... they're certainly subject to Philippine law, and I understand that there's no dispute that under Philippine law the assets would be taken from the Philippine National Bank for the benefit of the government."
2007.06-1204,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1292.656,1321.988,"That's true, but the interests of the Philippine Government in obtaining... in having its interest confirmed that it owns these assets as of the time of the wrongdoing going back to 1972, that interest would not be advanced by PNB because PNB is holding them in escrow depending... pending the outcome of that very dispute between the Marcoses and the Philippine Government and couldn't be expected to advance in this case the Government of the Philippines' interest or claim of ownership to those assets."
2007.06-1204,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1345.416,1351.085,"Doesn't that depend on there being a foreign judgment, which we don't have in this case?"
2007.06-1204,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1351.085,1361.892,"--We... we don't have it yet, but that... that reflects the important interest of having our courts stay their hands pending the outcome of the proceedings in the Philippines in which that would be determined."
2007.06-1204,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1361.892,1377.698,"Isn't it also a requirement that in that proceeding in the foreign nation that all claimants would have an opportunity to be heard, which is not true here?"
2007.06-1204,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1377.698,1390.506,"Well, what... what the statute requires is that the foreign proceedings be in accordance with due process and that parties claiming an... an interest in the property be entitled to be present."
2007.06-1204,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.897,1436.94,"Mr. Kneedler, may I ask you this question: Would the case be different if there were secured creditors rather than judgment creditors?"
2007.06-1204,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1436.94,1451.669,"In... in U.S. courts a secured creditor would get past the standing stage, but would not... would not get past the bona fide purchaser for value without knowledge of the wrongdoing."
2007.06-1204,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1460.228,1466.194,"Well, it's been doing it on a fairly sporadic basis."
2007.06-1204,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1477.721,1478.471,"Well, I think it--"
2007.06-1204,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1478.471,1484.359,Maybe... let me put the... sort of my response in the form of a question.
2007.06-1204,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1499.572,1512.972,"--Well, I... perhaps in an extreme case, but I... first of all, I think the courts of the United States should be very reluctant to deem a foreign government's conduct inequitable in the sense that you're describing it."
2007.06-1204,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1548.084,1555.19,Is there any explanation why the freeze that was imposed by a U.S. court in 1987 was simply allowed to lapse?
2007.06-1204,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1555.19,1559.719,That was the preliminary injunction and I'm not sure what happened after that.
2007.06-1204,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1586.35,1586.614,"Well, maybe--"
2007.06-1204,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1586.614,1588.614,--from the very beginning.
2007.06-1204,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1588.614,1608.152,"--Well, maybe they have been have been candid about their claims, but they... in real-world practical terms, the claim to these assets and the representation at the same time that it's appropriate for these people to proceed in the United States for a money judgment, are at least in some tension with each other, aren't they?"
2007.06-1204,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1608.152,1609.011,I do not believe so.
2007.06-1204,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1669.737,1672.237,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,1678.154,1696.038,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to address as a first point the issue you raise, which is perhaps seminal to you, and that is whether there is an adequate alternative remedy to the human rights victims, either in the United States or in the Philippines."
2007.06-1204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1714.329,1725.916,"Well, doesn't the... maybe this makes no difference, but doesn't the Philippine National Bank have the... whatever they call them, the share certificates or stock certificates that represent the Arelma assets at this point?"
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,1725.916,1726.338,That's right.
2007.06-1204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1731.633,1732.133,Okay.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,1739.147,1740.458,"They can, and that's in fact what is occurring."
2007.06-1204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1740.458,1741.145,Okay.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,1741.145,1750.157,"However, it's also apparent from the facts in this case that those certificates were never the property of the Philippine Government, never, ever."
2007.06-1204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1756.764,1773.351,I thought the issue in the Philippines is the question of whether the money that went into the stock certificates eventually belonged to the people of the Philippines from the beginning or belonged to Marcos personally?
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,1773.351,1774.507,"--Well, that's--"
2007.06-1204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1774.507,1782.458,And you're saying that there's no possibility whatsoever that a Philippine court could say that this money initially belonged to the people of the Philippines?
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,1782.458,1785.879,--They could not say that in a forfeiture proceeding because--
2007.06-1204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1785.879,1788.44,I'm saying whether they... I don't care what the name of the proceeding is.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,1790.877,1792.234,"--Yes, sir, absolutely."
2007.06-1204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1792.234,1792.797,All right.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,1805.464,1810.617,"Because the judgment in the Philippines would not be in rem, Mr. Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1810.617,1812.586,I thought Justice Souter just answered that.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,1845.79,1859.849,"I think your understanding is correct in that regard; however, the law both in the Philippines and in the United States draws a clear distinction between the ownership of stock and a corporation's ownership of assets."
2007.06-1204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1890.038,1899.722,I would like you to address... you seem to put heavy weight on this in rem characterization.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,1934.834,1941.847,"--Justice Ginsburg, I believe interpleader is, statutory interpleader, is an in rem nature of a proceeding."
2007.06-1204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1992.296,2017.865,"Did... did the district court in Hawaii or the Ninth Circuit ever decide what the Petitioners tell us is the basic question, that is do these assets belong to the Philippine Government under that 1955 statute, or do they belong to the Marcos estate?"
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2031.639,2042.808,"Your Honor is correct that there was an underlying belief by the court, that the court accepted as valid the Republic's claim that it owned the assets, the assets were stolen."
2007.06-1204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2057.817,2065.813,"But it didn't say, find, that: And they belong to the Marcos estate and not the Philippine Government."
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2065.813,2068.984,Not the latter part of your equation.
2007.06-1204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2080.306,2083.228,I didn't see that finding in the court of appeals decision.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2127.867,2133.692,I'd like to go through each way in which they say they can and convince you that they can't.
2007.06-1204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2152.154,2152.825,Wait a minute.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2161.103,2166.181,"--Because ownership of the share certificates is not a right to the assets, a per se right."
2007.06-1204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2171.6,2178.174,So you're saying an in rem proceeding against the certificates simply will not resolve the issue; that's the... that's the guts of the answer.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2178.174,2178.518,--That's correct.
2007.06-1204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2186.858,2189.28,"Yes, well, that isn't what they say."
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2245.866,2258.486,"Well, an important fact that you left out was that in the year 2000, when the Philippine Government through PNB controlled the Arelma certificates, a request to Merrill Lynch was made."
2007.06-1204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2285.585,2287.693,"But may I ask you this question, though."
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2327.13,2341.593,"But I believe there is an important part of the equation that's left out of that question, and that is the rights of the Philippine government as the new shareholder will not be any greater than those of the prior shareholder."
2007.06-1204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2343.811,2344.561,Okay.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2355.745,2357.119,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2357.119,2364.82,And the suggestion I thought that Justice Breyer had made and that I made was this time they can do something further.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2379.048,2381.03,Nothing prevents them from making the demand.
2007.06-1204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2399.399,2407.27,"Well, the difference in the redo is that in the second case that's just been hypothesized, the Philippine government is represented."
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2417.266,2423.608,"--Well, they had that right in the year 2000 when they chose to exercise their sovereign immunity."
2007.06-1204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2428.309,2433.337,Any party that's beyond the process of the court has a right to come in.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2434.806,2437.18,"--Well, they were brought in."
2007.06-1204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2461.42,2461.811,There is a huge change.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2503.654,2506.979,Then you have a redo of what they started out this proceeding doing--
2007.06-1204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2506.979,2507.76,With a difference.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2507.76,2509.276,--which was judge shopping and forum shopping.
2007.06-1204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2511.212,2514.555,But isn't that what... that's what sovereign immunity means.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2567.956,2576.67,"--Well, what Your Honor is suggesting is that there should be a per se rule under Rule 19(b)."
2007.06-1204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2577.873,2578.373,Not necessarily.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2581.513,2587.089,"Well, then we have two lower courts that have balanced and weighed all appropriate factors."
2007.06-1204,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2602.786,2607.567,"In making that balancing, what weight did they give to the sovereign immunity of the Philippines?"
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2607.567,2608.722,--Significant weight.
2007.06-1204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2620.624,2628.464,I thought that the Ninth Circuit went on a statute of limitations in New York.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2644.551,2660.093,"Let me pose a different example to you, Justice Ginsburg, and that is, what if this were a bankruptcy proceeding and the foreign sovereign said: Oh, those assets really belong to us, they were stolen, and we'll decide that in our country."
2007.06-1204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2679.615,2683.535,So there might be a different situation in your hypothetical with respect to bankruptcy.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2694.641,2701.764,"Well, I submit that the underlying principle is a solid one, and that is U.S. courts do have in rem jurisdiction."
2007.06-1204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2719.086,2731.595,"Yes, but may I ask a sort of... maybe it's too elementary a question, but has any court ever decided the merits of the question whether the Marcos estate or the Philippine Government owns these assets?"
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2731.595,2733.33,"The lower court... well, not as--"
2007.06-1204,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2733.33,2736.985,"It decided there was no remedy, I understand that."
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2739.968,2744.749,"--It has, based on evidence, based on depositions, that these assets belonged to Marcos."
2007.06-1204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2744.749,2747.107,Where is that?
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2769.426,2770.69,I... are you saying that--
2007.06-1204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2770.69,2783.202,I just did not find in either the district court or the court of appeals an answer to that basic question: Whose assets are they?
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2793.931,2802.818,"--There are a number of findings, but obviously, because the Philippine Government was not a party in the case, there was no finding specific to the Philippine Government."
2007.06-1204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2813.782,2821.748,But then you're ignoring a 1955 law that says anything that belongs to Marcos that he didn't get legitimately belongs to the government.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2821.748,2825.2,"Well, again, that's a forfeiture issue."
2007.06-1204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2876.663,2884.801,Because aren't those issues that could be addressed when the Philippines attempt to enforce a judgment they would get in the Philippines if they do in fact get such a judgment?
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2884.801,2887.861,"Well, then we run into such issues like the act of state doctrine."
2007.06-1204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2905.557,2922.816,"Do you have... I mean I don't see you have a claim there as opposed to the... the worst that would happen, not necessarily good for your clients, but the worst that would happen would be that the assets would be devoted to victims and their families in the Philippines."
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2932.359,2933.0,"--Well, I--"
2007.06-1204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2933.0,2938.201,I mean they'll treat you like another creditor and you have... but is there some terrible unfairness going on?
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2938.201,2947.822,"--What Your Honor is suggesting is that a useful approach to this case is to say, well, if the Philippine Government gets the money, then won't that benefit everybody?"
2007.06-1204,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2957.757,2968.751,"Is there... is there something special going on, specially unfair, in respect to the delays where you are treated differently than other litigants in the Philippines?"
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,2968.751,2970.204,Yes.
2007.06-1204,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2979.981,2983.573,"Counsel, what does unfairness have to do with it?"
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,3017.497,3023.479,"Well, I think the issue was resolved pursuant to 19(b)."
2007.06-1204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3042.377,3049.625,May I go back on exactly that point on the equity to Justice Breyer's last question?
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,3084.845,3087.984,"Well, our judgment has not been enforced."
2007.06-1204,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3104.634,3108.131,So they just... they in fact are obstructing the process--
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,3108.131,3108.537,That's right.
2007.06-1204,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3108.537,3109.898,--trying to recognize it?
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,3109.898,3112.632,And the U.N.... the United Nations Human Rights Committee has so found.
2007.06-1204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3112.632,3123.893,"Let me ask you this: Did the Philippine Government formally take a position in raising these obstructive barriers, the $8 million filing fee, for example?"
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,3123.893,3124.659,It did not.
2007.06-1204,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3124.659,3125.86,Okay.
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,3128.25,3135.263,"It was sua sponte with the... actually raised with the Marcoses initially, and the court simply said yes, it's $8.4 million."
2007.06-1204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3135.263,3148.133,"Isn't that... I mean it sounds shocking, but I thought that in the Philippines, as in many countries, the filing fee is determined by what you're asking for."
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,3176.044,3177.434,That's... you're correct in your analysis.
2007.06-1204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3189.007,3197.552,"Counsel, before you sit down, you haven't mentioned anything about your argument that the Philippines don't have the right to raise this."
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,3198.035,3198.754,Absolutely not.
2007.06-1204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3214.109,3219.247,"Well, the Philippines National Bank and Arelma were, and of course they've appealed."
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,3224.01,3231.991,"--That's true, but we've also pointed out that Arelma and PNB have thrown in the towel as to the merits."
2007.06-1204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3243.205,3252.765,"Yes, they do because if they are able to successfully knock out the judgment, then they are back to square one."
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,3258.589,3275.817,"Well, perhaps under Rule 19(b) the lower court may still rule that there is a... a definitive judgment as to them against other creditors."
2007.06-1204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3277.316,3289.296,"If there was no authority of the court to proceed, then the judgment is... is as though it were never made."
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,3289.296,3296.215,"--Well, that's perhaps one way of looking at it, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1204,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3422.85,3436.72,"If... if the proceeding can't go forward because of sovereign immunity, that judgment would shield Merrill Lynch from any other claim."
2007.06-1204,2,40389,robert_a_swift,,3462.851,3465.694,"--Well, let me... let me take you on, on that point."
2007.06-1204,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3489.811,3490.779,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-1204,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3493.841,3496.59,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2007.06-1204,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3530.359,3533.888,You agree that the Ninth Circuit gave sovereign immunity great weight in the balancing?
2007.06-1204,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3533.888,3534.951,--I think it gave it no weight at all.
2007.06-1204,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3664.994,3665.633,"Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld."
2007.06-1204,4,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3703.556,3705.916,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice; it's been a great honor."
2007.06-1204,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3705.916,3707.727,Now counsel are excused.
