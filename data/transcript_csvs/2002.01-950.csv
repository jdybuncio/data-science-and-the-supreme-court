2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,75.945,79.605,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-950,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,188.793,194.49,"But as far as that clause is concerned it wouldn't help you with the corporate, if you had a corporate farmer."
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,196.494,202.441,"--Only the individual petitioners are entitled to invoke the Privileges and Immunities Clause, yes, and there are individual petitioners."
2002.01-950,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,202.441,206.646,"There are two individual petitioners I think in this group, is that so?"
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,206.646,209.619,"A... a husband and wife, Darrel and Diane Kuiper, yes."
2002.01-950,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,333.534,353.181,"This argument's probably better addressed to the respondents than... than you, but do you understand the respondents to argue that the percentage of... of milk solids which is one, and labeling, which is the second part of the statute, simply will cease to exist if... if this pricing regulation is not upheld?"
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,353.181,355.61,"--No, that... I don't understand that to be their contention."
2002.01-950,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,355.61,364.15,"I... I thought that that was going to be... when I got into the case I thought, well, they're going to say that it's just impossible to have the labeling, but I... I don't understand them to argue that."
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,366.041,368.618,"I... I don't understand them to argue that either, Justice Kennedy."
2002.01-950,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,382.237,391.957,"--Well, is it true that the pricing and pooling laws were adopted to help the milk producers comply with the fluid milk content provisions?"
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,391.957,394.719,"I... I don't think that's factually accurate, Your Honor."
2002.01-950,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,394.719,399.9,That was what the attorney in the Shamrock case conceded.
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,399.9,400.568,Not... not--
2002.01-950,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,400.568,400.803,You don't agree?
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,400.803,402.496,"--I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor."
2002.01-950,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,409.127,409.612,Yes.
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,409.612,422.005,"--which is a particular provision of the stabilization plan, that is the pricing plan, not the pooling plan, was adopted to help compliance with California's composition standards."
2002.01-950,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,422.005,427.472,And section 7254 does use the word indirectly.
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,427.472,443.729,"It does, Your Honor, but it's very interesting to look at the parallel phrasing of section 144 of the Farm Bill, 7 U.S.C. 7254, and the preemption provision of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, which is 21 U.S.C. section 343-1."
2002.01-950,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,447.054,447.475,Yes.
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,447.475,460.263,"In the preemption provision of the NLEA, Congress was talking about was... what was preempted, and it was saying anything a State does directly or indirectly to have labeling requirements different from Federal law is preempted."
2002.01-950,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.513,466.988,Right.
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,466.988,481.317,"Now, unless California is prepared to say that it's entire pooling and pricing plans were preempted by the NLEA in 1990, which I don't think you're going to hear from Mr. Urban, the entire pooling and pricing plans weren't unpreempted by section 144 of the Farm Bill, either."
2002.01-950,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,490.156,497.909,"Just... just before you get there... well, maybe it's a part... does... do Nevada producers have a... a Federal marketing order?"
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,497.909,499.032,"Nevada, yes."
2002.01-950,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,499.032,500.919,And Arizona as well?
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,500.919,501.39,Yes.
2002.01-950,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,501.39,509.658,"They... they... do they opt out of it if they want to sell the milk to... to California producers, or--"
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,509.658,515.635,"The sales to California... or, to California processors, excuse me, are not regulated by those milk marketing orders."
2002.01-950,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,522.241,534.313,"--I see, and... and so far as the Nevada and Arizona dairy farmers are concerned, they can sell to California without implicating any mechanisms under the Federal marketing order?"
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,534.313,535.35,That's correct.
2002.01-950,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,535.35,544.184,"Now, the court below didn't deal with the Privileges and Immunities issue, right?"
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,544.184,546.617,"Oh, it did actually, Justice O'Connor."
2002.01-950,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,546.617,547.077,It did.
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,547.077,549.544,It affirmed the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal.
2002.01-950,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,549.544,549.763,Okay.
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,549.763,552.031,It's on page A14--
2002.01-950,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,552.031,552.221,Okay.
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,552.221,553.147,--of the petition appendix.
2002.01-950,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,553.147,553.603,All right.
2002.01-950,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,553.603,561.48,"And its only reasoning was, the statutes and regulations do not, on their face, refer to citizenship or residency."
2002.01-950,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,607.168,609.122,"Very well, Mr. Englert."
2002.01-950,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,611.687,617.295,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-950,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,716.978,740.431,"Ms. McDowell, as to the exemption from the National... from the Nutrition and Labeling Act, is this... is this a special exemption that California has, or do a number of States have congressional exemptions from the Nutrition and Labeling Act?"
2002.01-950,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,740.431,744.933,"Well, this specific provision, section 144, applies only to California."
2002.01-950,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,744.933,748.946,"Yes, but are there similar exemptions in... in effect in other States?"
2002.01-950,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,748.946,762.869,"Well, the Nutrition and Labeling Act does contain an exemption for maple syrup composition and labeling that might have been designed to benefit the particular States where maple syrup is produced."
2002.01-950,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,816.5,822.021,"But there... but there was no... but there is no Federal marketing order that supersedes it, or am I wrong there?"
2002.01-950,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,822.021,826.264,"--No, it authorized the promulgation of one if California dairy farmers approved."
2002.01-950,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,854.687,855.439,Is the Federal--
2002.01-950,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,855.439,856.981,--Why doesn't that resolve this case?
2002.01-950,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,856.981,864.712,"Because there... there is no Federal marketing order that applies to California, and of course the--"
2002.01-950,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,864.712,865.626,"Oh, I... I see."
2002.01-950,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,873.023,879.973,"--Well, if there was a Federal milk marketing order for California, milk from Nevada would be treated the same as milk from California."
2002.01-950,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,887.151,897.679,Has Congress ever provided a... an exemption for anything that looks like this California pricing and pooling scheme?
2002.01-950,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,897.679,899.842,"Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
2002.01-950,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,920.984,925.255,I thought the only thing Congress had ever... maybe there's something else.
2002.01-950,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.255,933.133,I thought it was only insurance that Congress had performed the extraordinary act of waiving the Commerce Clause.
2002.01-950,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,934.623,939.392,That's certainly one of the most familiar instances of this--
2002.01-950,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.392,939.868,It's the only one I... only one I know of.
2002.01-950,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,940.668,946.785,--There are other instances in which Congress has affirmatively authorized particular action by States.
2002.01-950,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1033.363,1034.548,May I ask just one just one factual question?
2002.01-950,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1034.548,1034.746,Yes.
2002.01-950,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.746,1038.699,Am I correct in thinking California is the only State that does not have a Federal order?
2002.01-950,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1038.699,1041.46,"That's not entirely correct, Justice Stevens."
2002.01-950,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1056.242,1057.478,"Of its own, yes."
2002.01-950,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1057.478,1058.223,--California is the largest economy.
2002.01-950,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1058.223,1064.2,"And my other question is, do you... does the Government think we have to reach the Privilege and Immunities issue to decide the case?"
2002.01-950,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1064.2,1068.507,"Well, the Court granted certiorari on the Privileges and Immunities question."
2002.01-950,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1083.457,1094.638,"And it wouldn't take care of the... the ruling on the statute would take care of everything, but not Privileges and Immunities, because that covers only individual persons, not corporations."
2002.01-950,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1094.638,1095.835,That's correct.
2002.01-950,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1118.539,1119.593,"Thank you, Ms. McDowell."
2002.01-950,2,36821,mark_j_urban,,1122.01,1126.487,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-950,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1166.674,1177.898,"How do you respond to your adversary's contention that when you use the word construe, Congress does not ordinarily tell this Court how to construe a provision of the Constitution?"
2002.01-950,2,36821,mark_j_urban,,1177.898,1187.57,"First of all, in the McCarran-Ferguson Act statutes the Court found that there was a Dormant Commerce Clause exemption."
2002.01-950,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1199.089,1199.564,Well--
2002.01-950,2,36821,mark_j_urban,,1199.564,1201.652,--or it would have used both of those words.
2002.01-950,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1201.652,1210.003,"--Well, certainly, looking over a large group of statutes that Congress has enacted, there may be something to what you say."
2002.01-950,2,36821,mark_j_urban,,1220.824,1229.472,"But beyond that, Your Honor, the... they then say, construe to preempt, prohibit, or otherwise limit."
2002.01-950,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1259.195,1273.369,"Of course, Congress is sort of at a loss for words, because it... it's only the Commerce Clause... that's the only provision of the Constitution that Congress can instruct us not to apply, so it's understandable."
2002.01-950,2,36821,mark_j_urban,,1292.651,1295.123,"That's... that's correct, Your Honor."
2002.01-950,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.955,1421.865,"Mr. Urban, the problem, as I see it, is not whether they... you might construe the language as broad enough to cover the Dormant Commerce Clause, but the thing it saves is, legislation regarding milk solids and fats and so forth, and doesn't say anything about saving pricing legislation."
2002.01-950,2,36821,mark_j_urban,,1421.865,1424.007,"That... that's true, Your Honor."
2002.01-950,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1434.442,1434.971,Right.
2002.01-950,2,36821,mark_j_urban,,1434.971,1440.385,--and still protect the Dormant Commerce Clause exemption from milk content and labeling laws.
2002.01-950,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1440.385,1446.41,In... although you would not prevail if we so held.
2002.01-950,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2593.907,2606.161,"Well, Justice Kennedy, the Court has said very consistently in its Dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence that the intent of the Congress must be unmistakably clear."
2002.01-950,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2606.161,2609.632,Were... were those statutes preemption statutes as well?
2002.01-950,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2613.338,2616.773,"In... in some instances, they were."
2002.01-950,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2616.773,2628.282,"--and... and the argument is that... but let's say that it was simply a preemption case that, well, directly or indirectly Congress doesn't want have to spell out everything, so it says indirectly, so this... so this is not preempted."
2002.01-950,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2632.573,2645.907,"Well, that's what the Court did in New England Power Company v. New Hampshire, and the statute being construed, the provision of the Federal Power Act being construed in that case, like the statute being construed in this case, was not so much a preemption clause as an unpreemption clause."
2002.01-950,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2706.8,2712.063,What is the answer to the last point on privileges and immunities?
2002.01-950,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2778.292,2779.32,It's all true.
2002.01-950,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2792.682,2798.803,"I see, you're saying it might violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause even if... or, why?"
2002.01-950,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2798.803,2800.174,It's... it's exactly--
2002.01-950,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2800.174,2813.728,"The... what... it's a violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause for a State to discriminate against out-of-State commerce, because after all, out-of-State commerce is mostly produced by out-of-State residents?"
2002.01-950,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2813.728,2817.108,"--I... I'm not making that broad an argument, Justice Breyer."
2002.01-950,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2817.108,2817.633,Then what is--
2002.01-950,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2817.633,2839.555,"I'm saying that in this case, as in the Chalker case, there is an extremely high correlation between place of business and residency or citizenship of individuals, and just as this Court said, we don't care that someone from Alabama could have a principal place of business in Tennessee, because most people from Alabama don't have a principal place of business in Tennessee--"
2002.01-950,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2839.555,2839.808,--Yes.
2002.01-950,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2839.808,2854.371,"--so too, here, the Ninth Circuit should not have cared that Nevadans could have... could produce milk in California when 93 percent of all dairy farmers do produce milk in the State and, indeed, on the very farm where they reside."
2002.01-950,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2854.371,2878.643,"So if Massachusetts passes a statute... you know this area better than I at the moment, but if Massachusetts passes a statute and it says, we're fed up with nectarines from California, they're too woolly, and therefore no more nectarines from California coming into Massachusetts, it's absolutely true, every nectarine farm down there is owned by a California resident, none by Massachusetts residents."
2002.01-950,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2885.746,2890.685,"I... I certainly suspect it's a violation, but we're we're not asking this Court actually to hold that there's any--"
2002.01-950,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2890.685,2890.96,"No, no, I know that."
2002.01-950,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2890.96,2891.795,--Privileges and Immunities violation.
2002.01-950,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2891.795,2892.873,"I know that, but there's nothing to the contrary--"
2002.01-950,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2892.873,2893.718,Just that there should be--
2002.01-950,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2893.718,2894.034,--Okay.
2002.01-950,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2894.034,2895.271,--substantive constitutional scrutiny.
2002.01-950,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2895.271,2895.474,Yes.
2002.01-950,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2895.474,2900.257,The Ninth Circuit didn't give this case any substantive constitutional scrutiny.
2002.01-950,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2900.257,2901.657,"Yes, well, that's primarily the Dormant Commerce Clause."
2002.01-950,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,2907.194,2911.752,"Right, but on... on both issues, Justice Breyer, the Ninth Circuit declined to engage in any substantive analysis--"
2002.01-950,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2911.752,2912.046,I know.
