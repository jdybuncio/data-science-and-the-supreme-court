1983.82-1643,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.647,We'll hear arguments next in Interstate Commerce Commission against American Trucking Associations.
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,29.83,32.343,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1643,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,228.529,236.564,"Under that, Mr. Phillips, was the usual remedy retroactive, cancel it out all the way?"
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,236.564,239.206,The usual remedy in what context?
1983.82-1643,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,239.206,243.29,You just said that they exercise their discretion under that rule?
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,243.29,244.041,Yes.
1983.82-1643,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,244.041,246.412,Cancel the filed tariff.
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,246.412,249.684,In cases of significant rate bureau violations.
1983.82-1643,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,249.684,254.096,But that was the only thing the Commission would do?
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,254.096,254.637,No.
1983.82-1643,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,258.771,259.87,Such as?
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,259.87,272.138,"It could bring a civil proceeding for a penalty, could decide to declare the rate invalid and prescribe a rate for the future, the traditional remedies it had always used."
1983.82-1643,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,272.138,273.961,And require adjustments.
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,273.961,276.331,Could require adjustments.
1983.82-1643,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,276.331,279.464,"Well, could it cancel it out only for the future?"
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,279.464,280.834,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,280.834,283.956,Could it also revoke approval of the rate bureau agreement itself?
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,283.956,287.379,"Yes, Justice Stevens, it could revoke approval of the rate bureau agreement."
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,287.379,295.344,"May I ask if the issue in the Aberdeen case involving the symbolization rule, does that pertain to rate bureau or is that entirely separate?"
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,295.344,307.911,"Well, rate bureaus are the ones ordinarily who file tariffs, and as a consequence they are the ones who would be placing the symbols on the tariffs, but the symbolization requirement applies to anyone who files a tariff."
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,312.505,315.896,Is the failure to put the right symbol on the tariff a violation of a rate bureau agreement?
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,315.896,317.528,"No, Your Honor."
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,320.27,323.292,Would it be possible to decide this case one way and the other case the other way?
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,323.292,324.603,I think it would be possible.
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,324.603,329.048,And not a necessary conflict.
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,329.048,330.678,"Not a necessary conflict, no, Your Honor."
1983.82-1643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.799,339.494,"Mr. Phillips, could you give examples of significant violations that would be subject to the retroactive rule?"
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,339.494,340.095,Sure.
1983.82-1643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,387.656,393.69,"Well, the Commission would have an opportunity when the rate is first filed to disallow it, would it not?"
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,393.69,395.24,Yes.
1983.82-1643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.624,407.789,"Well, is this rule really a product of the Commission's lack of funding or staffing to get around these things earlier?"
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,407.789,412.32,"--Well, not nearly so much as the symbolization rule, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-1643,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.358,485.799,"Mr. Phillips, rejection is a creature of statute in a sense."
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,488.322,489.512,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1643,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,493.366,503.774,So presumably the Commission is bound to follow whatever constraints may be contained in the statutory creation of rejection.
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,503.774,513.948,"Certainly the Commission is bound by the statute with regard to that; however, 10762(e) does not, by its terms, make any reference to rejection."
1983.82-1643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,515.51,522.235,"Does the terminology of rejection, though, indicate that it is something that has not yet gone into effect?"
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,522.235,524.367,"--Well, that was the position of the Court of Appeals--"
1983.82-1643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,524.367,525.996,Is there a suggestion there that that is the meaning?
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,525.996,531.221,"--Well, that is what the Court of Appeals believed that you can only properly define rejection that way."
1983.82-1643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,561.82,579.872,But does the whole structure set up by Congress suggest that when there is an interval in which the Commission can accept it or not and then it goes into effect and thereafter there are other procedures whereby the Commission could initiate an examination for the future?
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,585.575,590.978,I don't believe that that's the inference to be drawn from this particular statutory scheme.
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,654.321,660.405,What about the fact that subsection (e) is part of that one section which generally deals with processing of new rates?
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,664.637,670.882,"Well, there is a three year statute of limitations for an overcharge liability so that--"
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,670.882,672.873,But you could reject ten years later.
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,672.873,673.184,--Sure.
1983.82-1643,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,704.577,717.434,"Mr. Phillips, what if Congress with respect to rates the Commission may do the following: it may reject; it may suspend; it may be hearing and find unreasonable."
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,735.677,746.145,"In absence of some indication, I submit, in the legislative history that says that Congress set out those three that those were the ones that had in mind and meant for the Commission not to go beyond those three."
1983.82-1643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,915.657,936.65,"Let me just ask you one more thing, Mr. Phillips, and that is could the Commission reject a proposed rate within the time provided in the statute simply because it lacks enough information on the proceedings to let it make a sound decision?"
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,936.65,942.454,--The Commission does have the power to reject for lack of information although the tariff filing--
1983.82-1643,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,942.454,948.819,So why does it need this rather unusual power to go back on an issue?
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,948.819,968.22,"--Justice O'Connor, in order to use the power you are talking about there would have to be something in the tariff filing itself that would make clear whether or not there has been a rate bureau operation problem, and tariff filings are just a set of numbers which do not in any way give you any insights into whether there may have been a tariff rate filing problem."
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,989.875,992.777,Is there not another consideration here?
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1001.342,1003.643,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1003.643,1013.35,"If that is true and then there is an incorrect tariff filed that violates the agreement, the people who file it run a very substantial risk of treble damage liability, do they not?"
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1013.35,1017.714,"Well, there is no question that there is some deterrent value to having antitrust liability--"
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1017.714,1020.864,I would think that would be a greater deterrence than the fear of rejection.
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1020.864,1029.75,"--Well, the Commission recognized that but nonetheless believed that... The antitrust liability notion is cumbersome."
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1039.217,1047.331,If they talk to a venturesome lawyer they would not have much trouble getting representation I would not think in a case like this because it is a clear violation if there is no immunity.
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1047.331,1050.334,"--Well, I do not doubt that the attorney may be willing to undertake the expense."
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1086.617,1092.922,Do we have any feel for how often these violations occur?
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1094.552,1095.263,Significant violations?
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1095.263,1097.844,--The significant ones that this rule contemplates.
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1097.844,1101.337,"Well, the rule has been in effect since the end of 1980, and we do not have any--"
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1101.337,1104.179,"No, but the Reed-Bulwinkle Act has been in effect for a lot longer than that."
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1107.011,1119.891,--The problem with the 1948 to 1980 period was that the thrust of the Commission's regulatory efforts was made in approving rate bureau agreements and reviewing what agreements furthered the national transportation policy.
1983.82-1643,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1141.045,1144.845,I had a little feeling in reading the briefs that maybe this was kind of a theoretical problem.
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1146.958,1155.654,"Well, there is certainly a theoretical element to it any time a litigant challenges a rule on its fact rather than wait for it to be applied."
1983.82-1643,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1272.459,1275.511,Has this always been the Commission's view?
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1275.511,1278.614,Has what always been the Commission's view?
1983.82-1643,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1279.975,1281.115,The position that you are furthering.
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1281.115,1284.146,"Well, the Commission adopted the rule in 1980."
1983.82-1643,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1292.922,1293.693,Retroactive?
1983.82-1643,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1293.693,1294.865,Retroactively.
1983.82-1643,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1318.351,1321.663,Mr. McEligot.
1983.82-1643,1,37859,patrick_mc_eligot,,1321.663,1324.544,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1643,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2143.382,2159.552,"Mr. McEligot, Mr. Phillips stressed reliance on American Trucking for the position that he took."
1983.82-1643,1,37859,patrick_mc_eligot,,2161.823,2163.375,"Well, there are two points there."
1983.82-1643,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2468.935,2471.947,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Phillips?"
1983.82-1643,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2471.947,2477.781,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1643,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2531.457,2532.598,Can I ask just one question?
1983.82-1643,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2536.6,2542.333,--The proposed rules themselves do not discuss what hearing would be provided for.
1983.82-1643,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2569.101,2570.073,Before the rejection or after?
1983.82-1643,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2570.073,2570.834,After rejection.
1983.82-1643,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2570.834,2571.532,After--
1983.82-1643,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2571.532,2573.225,After the effective date you mean?
1983.82-1643,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2573.225,2578.668,"--No, the tariff is filed and goes into effect and then they think they found a violation."
1983.82-1643,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2578.668,2579.129,Right.
1983.82-1643,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2579.129,2584.701,"Do they have to have some kind of hearing to determine there was a violation before they reject, or they just go ahead and reject?"
1983.82-1643,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2584.701,2598.049,"No, they file a complaint suggesting rejection and then go ahead and proceed with the entire... the same process they use for any other post-effective action on a particular rate that exists."
1983.82-1643,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2633.783,2634.714,"Thank you, gentlemen."
