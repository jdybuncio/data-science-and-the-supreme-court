2015.14-723,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.095,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 14-723, Montanile v. The Board of Trustees of the National Elevator Industry Health Benefit Plan. Mr. Stris."
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,12.095,36.635,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this ERISA case, a fiduciary has sued a beneficiary to establish and enforce an equitable lien by agreement. As this Court has repeatedly acknowledged, an equitable lien is enforceable only against specific property and its traceable product in the defendant's possession."
2015.14-723,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,36.635,56.255,"Mr. Stris, there's some fuzziness about the facts in this case, and maybe at the outset you can clarify them. Different figures are given about how much money from this settlement was actually delivered to your client."
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,69.425,83.78,"I think I can, Justice Ginsburg. So I -- I want to start with what's in the record, and then I want to add some color that I think will provide context. So as far as what's in the record, there was a genuine issue of -- of material fact on how much dissipation there was."
2015.14-723,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,86.18,88.9,"Before we get to dissipation, how much did he receive?"
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,88.9,89.13,Yes.
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,94.91,113.61,"I think that's clear from the record. What's also clear procedurally -- and this is important, and this is Page 64 of the Joint Appendix -- is that he took the position in opposing summary judgment that he has very little of the money remaining, and he cited a declaration and an attached sheet that I admit are confusing."
2015.14-723,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,113.61,120.51,"And -- and this $200,000, did he put it in a general account or was it set aside in a specific account?"
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,120.51,132.735,"It is nothing in the record to indicate that, but I think as far as the rules work, it wouldn't matter because the rules for equitable lien by agreement, the tracing rules, are actually very robust, Justice Kagan."
2015.14-723,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,146.33,171.32,"But Mr. Stris, it does make a difference, because if he just put it, say, in the bank account where he had all of his other money, then how -- how could we say that he spent all of the proceeds on childcare and living expenses? If you have one mixed pot, how can we say, oh, yes, this came from the settlement and not from his general funds?"
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,171.32,173.24,"It's a very fair question, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.14-723,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,218.125,218.8,"Well, what --"
2015.14-723,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,218.8,223.14,"Well, I -- I don't know if it's the right Latin phrase or -- ""pro tanto"" or something."
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,231.02,232.84,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's correct."
2015.14-723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,270.825,278.04,Equitable lien by agreement. Was there an agreement -- do you think there's an agreement here because of the Plan?
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,278.04,280.85,"I think the -- that issue, we've lost."
2015.14-723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,319.775,328.065,"Just as a background matter, when we left, as I understand, Great -- Great-West, we left -- left the issue open."
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,349.13,349.5,Yes.
2015.14-723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,387.055,388.05,For future payments.
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,388.05,388.99,Against future payments.
2015.14-723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,391.66,392.39,Suppose that weren't available.
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,392.39,392.58,Okay.
2015.14-723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,413.025,413.775,In law.
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,413.775,428.18,"Well, the second prong of Davila wouldn't be satisfied. So ERISA does not -- ERISA's broad preemptive sweep does not go so far as to stop plans from policing outright fraud. Now, the more difficult issue is your question --"
2015.14-723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,428.18,428.435,Right.
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,428.435,458.275,"-- which is, what if there's not outright fraud? What is -- what is the obligation of the beneficiary who gets that check and knows it's three times, you know, what I got, like, this can't be right. You know, if -- if the beneficiary is a bad actor and says, you know, I'm going to get one over on the Plan, and I'm going to keep this money, and I'm going to spend it, in the rare case where that person was of limited means and they spent the money down and it was dissipated, I think unfortunately, I would have to say that I -- I think a plan would not have a remedy."
2015.14-723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,461.68,468.15,"And -- and -- and because State law, legal remedies are preempted by ERISA?"
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,468.15,468.44,Yes.
2015.14-723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,470.28,477.195,"Is that a position that's generally accepted, or is this an arguable point?"
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,477.195,479.795,"From the perspective of this Court's cases, or -- or --"
2015.14-723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,479.795,480.39,Yes.
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,481.39,484.12,"Well, I mean, I think the -- the letter of your cases --"
2015.14-723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,484.12,486.27,I -- I thought Great-Western had left that open.
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,486.27,486.75,Yes.
2015.14-723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,495.35,504.015,"I'm just asking, is there a rule in the courts of appeals, or in the -- in the legal system generally, or -- or are they divided on this, or just nothing written on it?"
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,504.015,508.53,"Well, in the context of ERISA, how you would rule on this case would determine that issue."
2015.14-723,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,518.865,528.06,"Counsel, if -- if you prevail here and are representing a fund, what would you advise them to do so they don't confront this result in the future?"
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,528.06,528.5,Yes.
2015.14-723,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,604.15,611.52,"When you say ""they act promptly,"" what do they act promptly to do? And is it always the case that they can act promptly enough?"
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,611.52,612.39,No.
2015.14-723,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,620.755,644.57,"Well, presumably in the -- in the hypothetical, your -- your opposing counsel will be advising the recipient to, I -- I suppose, spend it right away, because then there won't be anything left; it will have been dissipated, or put it in different accounts, or -- or commingle it with, you -- you know, a variety of things."
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,657.56,662.58,"I -- I understand that point. I -- I think the answer is, no, not in any meaningful way."
2015.14-723,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,672.1,674.57,How do -- how do you put people on notice? That's a --
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,674.57,674.81,Pardon?
2015.14-723,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,674.81,678.83,That's a legal concept. A letter is one thing.
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,689.37,693.905,"Here's what plans do, and here's what plans should do: They -- they write a letter."
2015.14-723,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,717.645,721.33,How -- how do you find -- how does the Plan find out that there's been a settlement?
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,721.33,723.18,"Well, they -- they find out in many ways."
2015.14-723,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,733.4,733.61,I'm sorry.
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,735.415,737.6,A State court lawsuit is filed.
2015.14-723,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,737.6,740.365,You mean by the beneficiary to recover --
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,740.365,741.39,The tort.
2015.14-723,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,741.39,742.17,-- the tort claim?
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,742.17,742.805,Yes.
2015.14-723,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,742.805,745.41,And how is the Plan notified of that?
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,745.41,764.44,"Well, because of the risks that we're talking about right here in this dialogue, plans are very sensitive to making sure that the minute that there's a potential subrogation recovery, they write letters to everyone: To the participant, to the participant's lawyer, to the tortfeasor, the tortfeasor's lawyer, the insurer."
2015.14-723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,768.67,770.315,"Do they, heavily?"
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,770.315,772.61,In some cases they do some; some cases they don't.
2015.14-723,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,773.305,774.805,"But they say they do, anyway?"
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,774.805,778.98,"Well, I've -- I've seen both. Look, I -- I don't actually think it's a pretty controversial point."
2015.14-723,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,792.815,800.32,"Would it basically, ignoring the impact of that letter by a beneficiary, be a basis for the sort of fraud action you were talking about earlier?"
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,800.32,800.67,No.
2015.14-723,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,802.32,808.53,"So the -- the beneficiary, even the beneficiary's counsel gets a letter saying, by the way, we have a lien on this, you know, good luck."
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,822.56,824.69,It would depend on the facts of the case.
2015.14-723,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,865.32,866.08,Mr. Stris --
2015.14-723,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,866.08,869.195,This may be where the law leads us.
2015.14-723,0,38345,peter_k_stris,,880.72,880.96,Okay.
2015.14-723,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,975.07,987.5,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders."
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,987.5,1028.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I could just start with Justice Alito's question about what -- what sense this framework makes, in limiting available relief to equitable relief in ERISA, Congress, I think, contemplated that there wouldn't be a remedy for plan breaches in every case. And so the framework this Court developed was to distinguish between equitable relief on the one hand and things like damages that, clearly, Congress didn't mean to include in the relief that would be available. And so -- I think it's been true since Great-West when this Court interpreted equitable relief pretty narrowly that a beneficiary will have an incentive in some cases to structure a settlement in order to avoid paying reimbursement to the Plan."
2015.14-723,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1070.25,1076.869,"Ms. Anders, in Great-West, the government filed on the side of the Plan."
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1081.265,1097.53,"I think in Great-West, I think we were taking a somewhat broader view of equitable relief than the court ended up adopting in that case. And so as we get here today, we've taken this position because we think it is absolutely the logical consequence of Great-West and Sereboff together."
2015.14-723,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1097.53,1099.9,So you took your position because of Great-West?
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1099.9,1101.77,That's absolutely right.
2015.14-723,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1123.46,1123.93,Probably what --
2015.14-723,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1123.93,1124.94,You thought -- you thought --
2015.14-723,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1124.94,1125.5,I'm sorry.
2015.14-723,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1125.5,1133.86,But you thought Great-West adopted a -- a narrower understanding of what equitable meant in this context than you thought was appropriate.
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1133.86,1136.82,I think at the time we were arguing for a broader understanding.
2015.14-723,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1152.235,1167.345,"But would you -- say, what is the government's position on commingling? There's no -- the beneficiary gets the check, puts it in his bank account, together with whatever else he has in there."
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1170.295,1179.19,"I agree with my friend that the commingling rule at equity, I think, reflected the fact that once funds have been dissipated, the lienholder can no longer collect."
2015.14-723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1203.975,1229.515,"Why can't -- in a case where there's no time problem -- forget the delays and so forth -- but like this one, the Plan sue the lawyer? I mean, if there was $500,000 and the lawyer received 200,000 -- but he certainly received it with notice. It's not any kind of good-faith purchaser -- why can't they get it back from him?"
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1229.515,1232.27,I think there may be situations in which the Plan could sue the lawyer.
2015.14-723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1232.27,1234.84,Why couldn't they normally in my situation?
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1234.84,1236.44,I think they probably could.
2015.14-723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1236.44,1236.93,All right.
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1246.22,1253.65,"Well, I think that's right, and I think lawyers also have ethical rules that -- that prevent them from -- from dissipating funds --"
2015.14-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1253.65,1254.47,But wait a minute.
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1276.06,1277.47,No.
2015.14-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1289.22,1294.23,"To -- to get the whole amount from the lawyer, right, so leaving the lawyer without his fee?"
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1294.23,1295.21,Yes.
2015.14-723,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1296.585,1300.2,"I thought in most States, the lawyer has a lien on the fee."
2015.14-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.75,1307.03,Yeah.
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1307.03,1307.63,I think --
2015.14-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1307.63,1311.5,That has to be or nobody would take these cases. (Laughter.)
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1311.5,1312.39,That may be correct.
2015.14-723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1314.78,1316.41,I don't see why it would be.
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1355.575,1356.29,All right.
2015.14-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.755,1371.02,"I think it must depend on how the agreement reads, and I can't imagine the agreement wouldn't -- wouldn't require the beneficiary to turn over the net."
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1379.6,1390.32,"Well, I think a lot of these plans are going to disclaim a common fund or -- or -- you know, they're going to disclaim their -- their -- any obligation to have the attorneys' fees counted against them."
2015.14-723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1391.53,1391.67,I'm --
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1391.67,1392.69,-- going to -- the entire amount --
2015.14-723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1392.69,1393.47,-- thinking in my mind --
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1393.47,1395.32,-- but just to -- just to make a -- a broader --
2015.14-723,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1395.32,1396.28,There is a model.
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1425.43,1425.58,Right.
2015.14-723,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1459.74,1470.465,"All -- all of those things you say -- all of those things you say the Plan can do, though, are -- are a lot more complicated than simply saying they should be able to recover that to which they're entitled under the agreement."
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1494.685,1515.55,"Well, I think -- I think an important point, Your Honor, is that no matter how the Court rules here, the Plans are going to have those obligations and they're going to have those burdens, because Great-West permits beneficiaries to structure their settlements to avoid paying reimbursement to the Plan. So because of that, ever since Great-West, Plans have taken these measures and -- and they will continue to take them even if the Court rules for Respondents."
2015.14-723,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1515.55,1522.065,"What are the concerns on the other side, which you have mentioned and -- and which your -- your friend also mentioned? What are they?"
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1522.065,1529.33,"So one concern, as you said, is that -- that whatever rule the Court announces, it's going to apply in the pension and disability benefit context too."
2015.14-723,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1578.035,1586.5,"Ms. Anders, could I -- could I shift gears a little bit and -- and just ask: The test that we've set up is whether a remedy is typically available at equity."
2015.14-723,1,24910,ginger_d_anders,,1592.205,1598.31,"I think ""typically available in equity"" meant remedies that were considered to be equitable in nature."
2015.14-723,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1611.45,1619.225,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal."
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1619.225,1654.915,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Three things are undisputed. First, that Montanile signed a form saying, quote, ""I agree to reimburse in full the Plan from any settlement."" Second, the Plan provides that such funds are, quote, ""Assets of the Plan not distributable to any person without the Plan's written release."" And third, under Sereboff, that the Plan would have an enforcement claim under 502(a)(3) if Montanile still possessed the funds. What we're disagreeing about is whether Montanile's decision to commit a second wrong of spending the Plan's money himself has made him judgment-proof."
2015.14-723,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1674.735,1679.73,I -- I have no idea where you think this lien attached.
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1693.835,1700.79,So it -- it's -- Barnes says that the -- that the lien attaches at the moment that he is -- that he has gotten title to the thing.
2015.14-723,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1708.56,1714.87,"So your position is at that moment it goes to the lawyer, it's his money, all 500,000."
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1716.21,1727.35,"To a -- to a lien of $121,000 on it. And so our claim is not that we have some general remedy at law that we can get compensatory consequential damages or punitive damages."
2015.14-723,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1757.35,1758.76,So I -- I found a list.
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1859.0,1861.67,"So -- so first of all, we're not advancing that theory, Justice Breyer."
2015.14-723,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1929.21,1935.93,"That would be wonderful, if he said ""has an equitable right to compensation."" I mean, you know, that sounds like cleanup to me."
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1935.93,1943.055,"No, it's not, Justice Scalia. I think it's not, for several reasons. Number one is, of course, in that case, the entire fund was gone."
2015.14-723,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.08,1960.745,Is -- is -- is that the requirement?
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1960.745,1962.22,"Well, I think that otherwise --"
2015.14-723,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.22,1963.365,Is some of the fund there?
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1963.365,1967.66,"Otherwise, Your Honor, there wouldn't have been any reason -- there is a requirement that, in order for --"
2015.14-723,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1967.66,1972.2,"There was an equitable jurisdiction, so long as the person had possession of the fund at one point."
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1972.2,1972.81,I don't think that there's --
2015.14-723,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1972.81,1977.05,"And then -- and when the suit is completed, it's discovered that all of the fund is gone."
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1977.05,1977.72,"No, your Honor."
2015.14-723,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.15,2010.25,Wait.
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2015.675,2032.41,"Because we think that the proposition that they're trying to say is wrong, the idea that when you dissipate a fund, you lose your equitable claim. Our point is that is -- that's generally true; not true in a circumstance when a defendant frustrates an otherwise valid equitable claim."
2015.14-723,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2032.41,2039.375,So -- so you ought to be able to bring suit in equity without asserting that the person ever had the fund in his hands.
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2039.375,2041.07,"Well, you can't do that, of course."
2015.14-723,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2041.07,2042.35,"You say, he owes me the money."
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2042.35,2044.81,"You can't do that, of course, as Knudson says."
2015.14-723,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.63,2056.28,"You're saying even if you know the person has dissipated all the funds, you can sue for the equitable lien, even if you know the funds are all gone?"
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2056.28,2057.37,"Correct, Your Honor."
2015.14-723,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.77,2063.77,Do you have any cases?
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2063.77,2064.19,Sure.
2015.14-723,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2092.725,2123.51,"It has to be pretty easy for you to protect yourself, doesn't it, as soon as at some suitable time after the injury you do write a letter to the person and say, look, you need to know that if you sue somebody, the money is ours, and because we have these rights of subrogation, or let us know if you're going to, and we'll show up in court with you and -- and -- and help you? Where -- see, I guess it would probably be pretty easy to -- to monitor it yourself."
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2141.44,2143.51,"So -- so three things, Your Honor."
2015.14-723,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2198.91,2199.17,Right.
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2205.58,2205.84,Right.
2015.14-723,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.32,2284.48,"Mr. Katyal, equity itself is a formalistic distinction."
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2296.88,2306.885,"Well, Justice Scalia, as Justice Frankfurter says, equity, quote, ""assures mechanical rules and depends on flexibility."" Every equity treatise -- look at Pomeroy, for example, of Section 111."
2015.14-723,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2308.6,2311.365,Pomeroy doesn't -- doesn't support you as --
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2311.365,2312.89,I think very much --
2015.14-723,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2312.89,2315.58,-- Pomeroy's quotes are contrary to what you --
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2315.58,2316.53,-- very much it does.
2015.14-723,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2355.79,2359.965,"Well, I don't know that you can read our precedence in this area to say that they're very flexible."
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2379.43,2385.39,"Well, they are technical when it comes to that first question, is there an equitable claim in the first -- first instance."
2015.14-723,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2424.23,2429.62,The -- the essence of Great-Western -- I don't know if I'm reading it rightly or not.
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2441.26,2441.74,Right.
2015.14-723,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2441.74,2469.375,"The most that I read about a substitution decree or deficiency decree is that it's an ancillary jurisdiction to issue those. Is that consistent with saying it's equitable? Isn't it just a legal claim that equity sometimes permitted an -- an equitable court to exercise, but wouldn't it still be legal --"
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2469.375,2469.695,Right.
2015.14-723,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2470.01,2472.915,-- and not within -- within the -- the scope of ERISA?
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2472.915,2478.19,"Justice Sotomayor, this is, again, part of the urban legend that -- that's being developed around this."
2015.14-723,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2522.47,2526.73,I'm still a little bit confused by all of this.
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2541.415,2545.95,So with -- with respect to the -- the lawyer piece is much more complicated.
2015.14-723,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2607.44,2625.175,"Can you say again, when does the lien attach? Is it when the tortfeasor pays -- gives it -- the check to the lawyer, or is it when the beneficiary actually gets the 200,000?"
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2625.175,2632.975,"Well, I don't think that the answers are clear on that, but I do think it's when he takes -- I think the most this Court has said it's when he takes title to the thing."
2015.14-723,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2821.48,2824.5,So you don't have priority over other creditors.
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2832.39,2847.68,"Well, we are then -- you know, as long as we can't trace it in a world of no tracing. So there's obviously some funds here that we may able to trace, because as the interchange with Justice Ginsburg was suggesting, it's not totally clear what was spent and what isn't. But with respect to the rest, yes."
2015.14-723,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2876.0,2886.235,I just want to be clear: I understand your position and your answer. Fund has -- has a claim for reimbursement from the accident proceeds.
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2899.67,2900.69,So if --
2015.14-723,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2900.69,2901.58,Was that your answer?
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2901.58,2904.6,"Well, it is in the situation of a dissipated fund."
2015.14-723,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2909.41,2910.615,"Well, it's -- it's your example."
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2914.49,2914.74,Yes.
2015.14-723,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2914.74,2916.99,"Nothing has been spent, but there's a creditor."
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2924.95,2925.82,"Well, Justice Kennedy --"
2015.14-723,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2925.82,2927.31,I thought you would have priority.
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2927.31,2929.67,I would if -- it sounds like we could trace that fund.
2015.14-723,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2931.44,2932.04,It's traceable.
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2932.85,2933.03,Right.
2015.14-723,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2990.145,2996.6,"But it seems, Mr. Katyal, that you are relying on remedies that really developed very late in equity's life."
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3033.725,3040.16,"So, Justice Kagan, I'd spot you that with respect to swollen assets, you know, which does come around in the 1930s, and so maybe there's an argument there."
2015.14-723,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3059.03,3067.98,"Well, you take the -- the deficiency judgments, which, I take it, was a rule was needed to give equity that authority, because everybody thought equity didn't have that authority."
2015.14-723,2,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3067.98,3080.19,"Well -- well, even if you can make that argument about deficiency judgments, which I'll respond to in a moment, you can't make it about substitution or monetary decrees, which is a distinct body in equity. And with respect to that, in 1864, absolutely."
2015.14-723,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3245.215,3249.885,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stris, you have four minutes remaining."
2015.14-723,3,38345,peter_k_stris,,3249.885,3254.17,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd just like to make two brief points."
2015.14-723,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3504.04,3506.33,"I'm sorry, counsel. You say he filed a cert petition."
2015.14-723,3,38345,peter_k_stris,,3508.94,3510.73,"It's not on behalf of the same client, no."
2015.14-723,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3528.98,3529.65,"Well, I'm just trying to --"
2015.14-723,3,38345,peter_k_stris,,3529.65,3530.04,-- in the Bilyeu.
2015.14-723,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3530.04,3537.27,"Are you saying that, because he represented a different client and took a position in that case, he's somehow bound by that here?"
2015.14-723,3,38345,peter_k_stris,,3537.27,3537.67,"Oh, no, no."
2015.14-723,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3567.85,3578.61,"Well, I would be surprised by the proposition that lawyers are somehow collaterally estopped if they take a particular position on behalf of one client from taking a different position in a different case."
2015.14-723,3,38345,peter_k_stris,,3578.61,3578.75,No.
2015.14-723,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3607.785,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
