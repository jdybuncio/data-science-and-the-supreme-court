2000.00-24,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.137,"We'll hear argument on Number 00-24, PGA Tour, Inc. vs. Casey Martin."
2000.00-24,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,9.287,26.179,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, The Ninth Circuit in our view made two critical mistakes in applying the Disabilities Act to this type of claim by a professional athlete."
2000.00-24,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,93.987,103.44,"Mr. Farr, the language of Part 3 of the act literally could cover the player."
2000.00-24,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,126.227,127.537,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
2000.00-24,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,128.949,130.499,To reach your conclusion.
2000.00-24,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,130.499,131.25,--That's correct.
2000.00-24,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,162.709,172.947,"Well, Mr. Farr, you keep talking about goods and services, but the statute is not limited to goods and services, as Justice O'Connor's question indicated."
2000.00-24,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,202.917,210.782,"Well, if I may separate this into two things, because the $3,000 applies only to a very small piece, which is the qualifying tournament."
2000.00-24,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,215.477,215.724,Right.
2000.00-24,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,217.546,218.237,But that's where one starts.
2000.00-24,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,224.742,234.848,"Well, except that it makes a difference because I think in a common sense kind of way we can say well, he is not getting any goods and services, but he is trying to exercise a privilege of playing."
2000.00-24,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,234.848,255.611,"Well, except for, it seems to me that in fact the word privilege, if it means the privilege to work for a place of public accommodation, to provide the input of labor to a place of public accommodation, then naturally following that logic, Title 3 would apply to anybody, an employee, an independent contractor or anyone."
2000.00-24,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,255.611,260.192,"But once again, when you phrase it the way you do, it makes it easier for your case."
2000.00-24,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,286.272,288.773,"Well, I think it does, to be honest with you, Justice Souter."
2000.00-24,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,303.984,304.332,Yeah.
2000.00-24,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,317.461,327.899,"Well, it depends on performance but in a very specific sense of course, the performance by any professional athlete determines ultimately what he or she gets paid."
2000.00-24,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,339.925,341.177,"Well, except that the statement is too broad."
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1610.218,1627.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to take the liberty of beginning with Petitioner's second point, because I think it's something we have recently heard discussed here, and it's I think quite important."
2000.00-24,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1638.047,1638.768,A what school?
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1638.768,1641.77,"--It's a Q, they call it the Q School."
2000.00-24,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1735.641,1744.967,"Mr. Reardon, all that proves, all that proves is that you could play golf under different rules, just as you can play baseball under different rules."
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1752.651,1756.745,There are two leagues.
2000.00-24,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.185,1759.677,They play under different rules.
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1788.625,1791.026,"Well, for the National League, it is fundamental."
2000.00-24,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.179,1794.479,Why.
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1795.551,1796.02,--You're changing--
2000.00-24,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.02,1796.21,--Simply because that's what they do.
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1797.572,1813.725,"--But Your Honor, but Your Honor... I cite, I cite what happens in the Q School to demonstrate the fact that walking is not indeed fundamental because they don't require it."
2000.00-24,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1813.725,1818.255,All that it demonstrates... all that it demonstrates is that you can play the game under a different rule.
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1833.175,1834.197,It could.
2000.00-24,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.197,1834.658,Would that make any difference?
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1834.658,1835.827,Rules could be changed.
2000.00-24,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1835.827,1849.367,"And could a player who has a disability, which means he has, which causes him to have an excessively long torso, could he demand that the umpire call strikes on him from, you know, from his eyes to his hips?"
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1849.367,1850.387,"No, he could not, Your Honor."
2000.00-24,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1851.028,1851.458,Of course he couldn't.
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1851.458,1852.588,--It's fundamental.
2000.00-24,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.588,1853.108,It's a silly rule.
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1853.108,1854.32,It's fundamental to the game.
2000.00-24,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.32,1855.9,"All sports rules are silly rules, aren't they?"
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1855.9,1857.442,I don't think it's a silly rule.
2000.00-24,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1883.819,1914.918,"Mr. Reardon, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in a strikingly similar case to this one determined at the end of the day that the walking rule was fundamental because it put additional physical stress on each competitor after a tournament lasting several days and perhaps in hotter inclement weather, and on hilly conditions, it could impose quite an additional stress on the players in the final rounds."
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1914.918,1916.561,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2000.00-24,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1916.561,1922.404,"And therefore, that it was an aspect of the physical challenge involved."
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1922.404,1923.784,That case is in this Court.
2000.00-24,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.373,1954.906,Should the nature of the disability make a difference?
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1954.906,1966.653,"Basically because if it doesn't, then you are not really gauging the second part, which is to consider whether or not an alteration is going to do something fundamentally."
2000.00-24,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1978.681,1982.224,"Well, what would be your example of a superficial disability?"
2000.00-24,1,40329,roy_l_reardon,,1982.224,1986.114,"Ingrown toenail, Your Honor."
2000.00-24,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1986.114,1991.057,"Well, I think if you have an ingrown toenail, it doesn't seem superficial."
2000.00-24,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2815.472,2840.175,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, This case presents an important question of the coverage of the Disabilities Act, as well as an issue of its application."
2000.00-24,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2853.496,2854.985,"Miss Underwood, may I just ask a question right there?"
2000.00-24,2,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2870.817,2885.155,"Well, that's rather like the fact that a university that, that offers, to which the public can apply doesn't then admit the whole public."
2000.00-24,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2892.801,2893.94,The students are not performing.
2000.00-24,3,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3434.859,3436.829,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2000.00-24,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3636.212,3636.732,"Thank you, Mr. Farr."
