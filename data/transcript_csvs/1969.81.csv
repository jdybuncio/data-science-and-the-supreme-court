1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,21.219,21.596,Mr. Chief Justice --
1969.81,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,21.596,23.203,Mr. Dineen.
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,23.203,26.407,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.81,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,260.785,275.946,"Is it clear Mr. Dineen that the Court have the power by way of equity, discretion or some other source to waive the bond requirement and accept your alternative proposal?"
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,275.946,281.932,"Your Honor, it appears to us that it's clear that they did not have that discretion."
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,351.964,355.108,What did you say the suit was filed for?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,355.108,357.513,This is an eviction action Your Honor.
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,357.513,359.466,It -- nonpayment of rent?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,359.466,363.199,"Well, there were two actions."
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,368.784,371.279,And you offered to pay the money in the court?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,371.279,375.608,We offered to pay the money in the Court at the time of the appeal.
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,388.28,389.787,Was there any defense?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,389.787,391.025,"Yes, there was Your Honor."
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,408.065,409.333,What Connecticut statutes?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,409.333,417.956,There're Connecticut statutes Your Honor that require that any building that is considered a tenement house or a garden type apartment.
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,479.048,482.339,"But you offered to pay the rent first, plus the cost?"
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,482.339,483.597,I beg your pardon Your Honor?
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,483.597,488.276,"Did I understand that you say awhile ago, you had offered to pay rent plus the cost?"
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,488.276,493.749,We had offered to pay rent every month from the time of the appeal.
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,495.11,496.916,That would pay at all?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,496.916,497.772,I beg your pardon Your Honor?
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,497.772,500.118,"That would pay all the man was claiming, that company --"
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,500.118,500.595,"No, Your Honor."
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,508.879,510.157,But would it pay the back rent?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,510.157,512.654,"It would not pay the back rent, Your Honor."
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,597.707,599.921,What did you say your second defense was?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,599.921,602.524,The first was that there wasn't any tenement house certificate.
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,618.823,620.52,He waives his right to collect rent?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,620.52,622.983,Collect rent as such Your Honor.
1969.81,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,639.146,641.861,What was the basis of the prior action?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,643.468,645.652,That was an eviction Your Honor.
1969.81,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,671.583,678.427,"So, that was the first action in the eviction action because your clients have allegedly were committing a nuisance?"
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,678.427,679.324,That was the allegation Your Honor.
1969.81,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,679.324,681.657,And then -- and that's never been resolved.
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,692.142,692.669,That's correct.
1969.81,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,692.669,698.675,"And secondly, since they brought this earlier action, they didn't have any right to ask you for rent as such (Voice Overlap) --"
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,698.675,699.511,That's correct Your Honor.
1969.81,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,701.378,716.108,"But I don't understand, how you can say that if you had kept paying rent this question would still have arisen because if you had I suppose in this action which is only based on a nonpayment of rent, it couldn't have arisen."
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,719.07,719.887,Yes Your Honor.
1969.81,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,764.683,765.41,Nonpayment of rent --
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,765.41,773.202,Nonpayment of rent for a specific month which was back in the month of May which was what they were claiming.
1969.81,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,816.119,821.337,But how would you lose if you paid the rent?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,825.846,826.533,The eviction --
1969.81,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,826.533,831.192,"And you did pay rent, you'd win."
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,831.192,836.37,"Well, not necessarily because this is a very -- it's a very technical action."
1969.81,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,890.483,901.748,"You mean the Connecticut Court would say that for the past six months you paid $72.00 everyday, every month on the second, therefore, you are out?"
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,901.748,902.141,Yes Your Honor.
1969.81,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,902.66,903.728,That's what the Court would say?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,903.728,912.121,If you didn't meet the terms of the lease and the eviction action were brought on the basis of -- then termination of the lease for failure to comply with it.
1969.81,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,943.697,954.217,"Mr. Dineen, let me see if I can get one opinion clear there were some findings here and then there are some colloquy in the record which would seem to explain the findings."
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,974.239,976.103,"Yes, we did challenge those Your Honor."
1969.81,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,976.103,994.412,"But now if those findings, let's assume first that you are right from -- and that the findings are in error, do we review a finding of the Court at the first instance of the state on a factual issue in which undoubtedly credibility and other similar factors are --"
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,994.412,996.216,"No, no Your Honor."
1969.81,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1008.679,1014.527,Was it not also relate to whether a bond would be accepted --
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1014.527,1014.981,No Your Honor.
1969.81,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1014.981,1015.77,-- Under any circumstances?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1015.77,1021.877,-- because as I understand the Appellate Division decision there is no discretion in the court to waive the bond.
1969.81,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1103.404,1117.274,"Well, that would defend if you -- while you approach this issues about the statute on this face and the statute in the trial."
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1136.844,1138.897,I'm not arguing that Your Honor.
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1177.185,1179.221,Where is that finding?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1179.221,1179.997,I beg your pardon Your Honor?
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1179.997,1182.472,Where is that finding you made was indicated?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1182.472,1183.041,"Which finding, Your Honor?"
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1183.041,1189.899,Finding of facts about whether they were of indulgence?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1189.899,1199.55,There was a motion made to the trial court that we be entitle to waive the bond and at that time we filed an affidavit.
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1199.55,1201.287,Where is that?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1201.934,1204.038,"I believe that's in the appendix, Your Honor."
1969.81,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1204.038,1211.501,"I believe that's finding one and two, I'm sure what page it's on."
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1211.501,1217.224,"And in the appendix on page 10, we have the motion to where the surety bond."
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1224.487,1229.327,"Now, where's the finding of the Court whether there was indulgence shown?"
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1229.327,1232.618,I don't believe the Court ever made a finding Your Honor.
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1235.103,1237.716,Now what did he show what the man does?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1237.716,1238.902,Yes Your Honor that's is in --
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1238.902,1242.303,What's his occupation?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1242.303,1244.848,He was working at Series Rolebook at the time.
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1244.848,1246.764,Regularly?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1246.764,1248.464,Not regularly Your Honor.
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1254.757,1257.021,During the course of the trial of before it?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1257.021,1258.498,During the course of the trial.
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1280.82,1283.664,So you agreed to get some kind of fund in the Court?
1969.81,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1288.107,1293.075,Well didn't the corporation think it was a relevant whether he was indigent or not?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1293.075,1301.757,"Well, that's -- this our understanding of the court's opinion that whether he is indigent or not there isn't the power to waive the surety bond."
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1304.689,1312.158,"Suppose there's not if it's in theoretical thing, why should we have it up beyond the constitutional question?"
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1312.158,1319.716,"Well, the Appellate Division as I understand it makes a clear that there is any power to waive the surety bond that the surety bond must be complied with."
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1319.716,1323.319,Suppose does not and suppose he doesn't need this waive.
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1326.801,1328.337,I don't understand Your Honor.
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1328.337,1341.954,"Suppose it is not an essential, would you still claim that eventhough you're not indigent you could get it it's not constitutional question decided."
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1341.954,1343.152,If you're not indigent?
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1343.152,1347.122,"Yes, there's no finding of them."
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1347.122,1347.95,"Well, I --"
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1347.95,1356.989,Or you say you can get to that issue without having something or some kind of find or of something to show that really you use any of it.
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1356.989,1358.534,"Well, we have an affidavit --"
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1358.534,1361.536,That's right but is there any finding?
1969.81,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.536,1370.686,"Well, could you make the court make a finding on -- even to that you, if they thought would be relevant?"
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1370.686,1379.935,"Since, we were denied and as I understand on the basis because indigency is irrelevant because the surety bond is required."
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1397.326,1400.378,"Suppose he has waived $50,000.00."
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1407.372,1411.128,"But we have an affidavit Your Honor, that that indicates that he is indigent."
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1411.128,1415.567,But I understand you just say that's irrelevant whether he was or not?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1415.567,1427.7,That's what the lower court said and that's what the appellate court had said that they would not waive the surety bond because they didn't feel that the statute given the power to waive it.
1969.81,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1427.7,1440.551,"Well, if Equal Protection on your argument to -- is an absolute requirement that there must be a right to appeal and still having some difficulties seeing whether it makes any difference."
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1450.346,1455.903,"Well, we make two arguments on the basis of Equal Protection."
1969.81,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1471.327,1476.58,But does it make a difference to your case whether you could or could not put up the rent during the pendency of the appeal?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1483.149,1485.161,"Yes, I'm not going that far Your Honor."
1969.81,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1518.584,1532.9,"But if you're right and if your position is some on the Equal Protection ground, would you posture not be the same, if you didn't have a dime to pay into the treasury of the court or refuse to pay it?"
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1532.9,1544.882,"Not precisely, I don't think because we do recognize that there is a reasonable and legitimate interest that the State may have in protecting land owners."
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1579.605,1582.956,How many months did you offer to pay?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1582.956,1585.761,The requirement was that we put up a surety bond --
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1585.761,1588.963,"I know about this, but how much money, you should you attempt to offer to payment."
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1588.963,1591.376,We offered to pay month by month from the time of the appeal.
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1591.376,1594.211,How many months did you offer to pay?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1594.211,1598.989,We did in fact pay Your Honor five months during the course of the entire appeal.
1969.81,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1599.089,1604.749,And yet handed an affidavit of indigency not be in able to make the bond?
1969.81,0,23803,francis_x_dineen,,1604.749,1607.564,"The affidavit was that we couldn't make the bond, yes Your Honor."
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,1915.668,1918.131,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.81,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1944.752,1948.612,"Now, what's the states connection of the Housing Authority?"
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,1948.612,1948.982,The State --
1969.81,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1948.982,1950.407,This is a federal?
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,1950.407,1954.469,The Public Housing Authority is established by both state and federal statute.
1969.81,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1954.469,1957.808,This is a joint -- the state's interest is through that --
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,1957.808,1979.869,"And also the state's interest in protecting property owners who have been, shall I say denigrated by the tenants by nonpayment of rent, so that they have their rights to their own property and to the retention of their property."
1969.81,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2125.064,2128.854,"Well, is -- was the other case pending then?"
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2128.854,2131.21,The other case has never been dismissed or --
1969.81,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2131.21,2136.288,But was it pending during that three-month period that you say they didn't pay their rent?
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2136.288,2137.753,I believe it was Your Honor.
1969.81,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2138.362,2145.097,"Well, is he correct that when a case dispossess the case that pending you don't use the pay rent?"
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2145.097,2156.439,"Your Honor, I don't understand that to be the situation of the initial summary process or the previous summary process action was brought for reasons other than the statutory reasons for summary process."
1969.81,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2156.439,2159.8,"Well, why wasn't it carried through?"
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2159.8,2173.641,I believe it wasn't carry through because the attorneys for the Housing Authority recognized the fact that it wasn't a proper motion and they then had other reasons for bring the summary process action which is the nonpayment of rent.
1969.81,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2173.641,2176.236,Which was brought about by the first action?
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2176.236,2178.152,No it would -- they claim it was brought about by the first action.
1969.81,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2178.152,2180.468,"Well, that first action."
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2183.46,2183.749,May it please --
1969.81,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2183.749,2187.532,Because now you got a clearly not paying their rent.
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2187.532,2194.617,"If you please Justice Marshall, this is the claim of the appellant that the second summary process action was brought because of the first one."
1969.81,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2194.617,2199.385,"Well, if it's not their claim that you've never withdrawn the first case, still then?"
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2199.385,2201.99,"They have claimed that, yes."
1969.81,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2201.99,2202.819,Was that true?
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2202.819,2203.855,"Yes, it is."
1969.81,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2203.855,2205.712,Why?
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2205.712,2209.73,"Since, I am not the Attorney for the West Haven Housing Authority, I can't answer that question, Mr. Marshall."
1969.81,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2209.73,2211.564,Are you defending the real issue?
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2211.564,2216.513,I'm defending them as an amicus of filing a brief from behalf of the state of Connecticut.
1969.81,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2216.513,2221.104,"Well, you're not responsible for what they did of course, I agree with you."
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2221.104,2224.834,"But you are right that the action was never withdrawn, the first action."
1969.81,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2224.834,2233.426,And you just don't know?
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2233.426,2237.326,The appellant is not having complied with the notice to quit.
1969.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2306.871,2309.933,"Now, that's the Judge Dehenzel --"
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2309.933,2310.939,"Dehenzel, yes."
1969.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2310.939,2322.79,Dehenzel and that's justice who is denial on page 23 of this appendix together and the full hearing to which you referred that appears on page 13 to 22 of the appendix.
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2326.91,2331.788,"Yes, it is Justice Stewart."
1969.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2331.788,2339.871,And the same Judge Dehenzel had decided in favor of the plaintiff landlord?
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2339.871,2343.624,"A hearing on the merits on January 9, 1968, that's correct."
1969.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2343.624,2350.568,"And that I guess it's not in the -- that hearing is not in this appendix, is it not?"
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2350.568,2354.03,The hearing is not made a part of the transcript to his decision I believe is.
1969.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2354.03,2356.226,The judgment is I get on page seven.
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2356.226,2357.412,"That's correct, Justice Stewart."
1969.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2357.412,2360.464,"Seven or eight, thank you."
1969.81,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2360.464,2371.01,"I can't find that the Court of Appeals of the Appellate Division whatever you call in Connecticut adopted that at on us relied upon that, did they?"
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2371.01,2382.393,They did -- it is mentioned in the decision of the Court of Appeals or the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court that the lower court found that the action is taken for reasons of delay.
1969.81,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2382.393,2385.517,Is that one of the reasons that they affirmed?
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2385.517,2395.3,That's our position Your Honor that that's the reason they did affirm.
1969.81,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2488.906,2491.381,What's happened to the $360.00?
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2491.381,2495.243,I believe it's still in the custody of the clerk of the Court.
1969.81,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2614.613,2634.391,"I've read this opinion three times now and I -- maybe I'm just stupid but I don't see any indication that the Court rule that if this appeal have been taken without any suggestion of dilatory tactics, it would been decided differently."
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2634.391,2637.173,All I can suggest Justice Douglas is that we read it differently.
1969.81,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2644.633,2646.497,I'm just talking about the opinion of the Appellate Division --
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2646.497,2649.97,I realize you are and I -- we read it differently that's all I can --
1969.81,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2649.97,2654.812,"So, sometime could you supply a supplemental memorandum and I don't want to take your time."
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2654.812,2656.377,I will be glad to do that.
1969.81,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2656.377,2664.98,Just underline of the -- marking the lines in the paragraphs in this opinion that possibly indicate that.
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2664.98,2666.295,I will do that Justice Douglas.
1969.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2666.295,2670.457,May I ask you a question about the statement of page 20?
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2672.553,2673.589,Page 20?
1969.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2673.589,2673.846,Yes.
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2673.846,2674.086,Justice Black?
1969.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2674.086,2677.926,The court said you told me that to the counsel.
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2716.531,2724.651,I can find it Justice Black but I can't find where the quote is taken from.
1969.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2724.651,2727.184,Here on page 20.
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2727.184,2727.95,I find that --
1969.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2727.95,2729.258,The last paragraph.
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2729.258,2740.464,But this appears -- this is the colloquy between attorneys for the plaintiff and the court.
1969.81,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2740.464,2745.153,It doesn't appear to any of the statutes have decided but there maybe other statutes.
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2745.153,2746.548,"No, it does not."
1969.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2746.548,2748.953,But he purported to the reading from the statute.
1969.81,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2748.953,2750.58,"Yes, maybe you could add that --"
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2750.58,2758.068,"Actually, this quotation is taken from the Section 52-542 of the Connecticut Statutes."
1969.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2758.068,2759.406,That is what you said?
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2759.406,2760.302,"Yes, if --"
1969.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2760.302,2763.117,"Well, unless what?"
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2763.117,2765.6,"Unless, it appears to the judge who tried the case that the --"
1969.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2765.6,2772.306,"Well, but what's the premise on which that unless is based?"
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2772.306,2777.005,"That no appeal shall be taken, if I may read the whole sentence, maybe in the context here --"
1969.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2777.005,2778.26,I understand.
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2778.26,2780.187,No appeal and this is from the statute.
1969.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2780.187,2780.265,Alright.
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2780.265,2781.359,And I quote it.
1969.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2797.139,2797.586,Alright.
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2807.229,2808.866,"Yes, I am."
1969.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2808.866,2811.149,But why doesn't if that's the statute?
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2811.149,2811.958,Why doesn't or why doesn't it?
1969.81,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2811.958,2812.914,Why does it not?
1969.81,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2814.88,2819.927,But I thought this was an Equal Protection Court not whether the things you can state or not?
1969.81,1,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2819.927,2820.444,"Well, this is the --"
1969.81,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2820.444,2822.926,But does the bond should have to be furnished?
1969.81,2,23803,francis_x_dineen,,2822.926,2826.129,"If I may Justice Douglas, this is the position of the appellants."
1969.81,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2826.129,2827.209,"Yes, but I mean --"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2827.209,2830.009,We do not feel that there's a substantial federal question involved.
1969.81,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2830.009,2836.257,I understand that and their some members of the court appeal the same way perhaps.
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2849.071,2852.195,"No, it just makes provision for a surety bond in all cases."
1969.81,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2852.195,2861.096,"No, no, it just says it shall be stayed unless it appears?"
1969.81,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2869.109,2874.883,That statute Mr. Ahern as Mr. Justice Douglas suggest that if it's the one appearing on page 4 of the appellate brief.
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2874.883,2875.871,It is Your Honor.
1969.81,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2875.871,2880.868,"It has nothing at all to do with the requirement of a surety bond, does it?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2882.313,2888.541,It just states that a surety bond shall be required.
1969.81,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2888.541,2889.697,Unless?
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2889.697,2895.374,Unless it appears who tried the case that the appeal was taken for purpose of delay.
1969.81,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2896.949,2900.56,"No, the unless is modifies the state law."
1969.81,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2900.56,2902.205,Yes.
1969.81,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2902.205,2904.957,Not the surety bond?
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2909.129,2912.652,If you've raised the point that haven't occured to me that's the trouble Mr. Justice Douglas and I'm trying to --
1969.81,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2912.652,2916.155,If the stay was entered Mr. Dineen.
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2932.055,2936.04,"Yes, he could in our opinion."
1969.81,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2936.04,2940.369,"Well, that would seem to me to be the crux of the case."
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2940.369,2951.673,I think this is where the appellants in the Housing Authority disagreed whether or not the surety bond in all cases must accompany in appeal.
1969.81,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.796,2972.904,The landlord could the Court waive -- did the Court say no bond because the person is indigent and the appeal is in good faith?
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,2972.904,2977.467,We haven't been able to find the Connecticut case that provides that Justice White.
1969.81,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.79,3004.373,The appellant -- do you think the Appellant Division assumed that the waiver of surety bond was permissible that the appeal was in good faith?
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3004.373,3011.751,"There seems to be language in that decision as I recall it, that would lead me to believe so, yes."
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3011.751,3017.929,"Mr. Ahern, do you know in Connecticut that the Court waive a close bond should be bond, couldn't it?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3017.929,3019.765,Yes.
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3019.765,3024.979,And when those come over here too that seem to say that?
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3024.979,3030.106,"Justice Marshall, I couldn't say whether they would be appeal to this Court."
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3035.853,3048.357,But the problem I really have is why the argument is made by the Appellate Court could not legally waive the surety bond.
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3048.357,3061.081,I think that's probably because of the word “shown in the statute” and they're referring to the same that this is the statute under which they have appeal to this Court in which they claim is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3064.532,3067.746,"Well, do you agree that show means that?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3067.746,3079.254,I think it means to show unless the Court appeals that there are equitable considerations that should be taken into consideration by the Court.
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3112.55,3118.047,"Well, if you do see of Equal Protection problem it shall mean what it says, don't you?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3118.047,3122.948,"That's the crux of this case this morning, I believe Justice Marshall."
1969.81,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3122.948,3129.024,"You don't have and I understand it, you don't have any records on, is that correct?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3129.351,3139.892,We have cases in other jurisdiction which was cited which give the seem to give courts that authority and we feel they apply to this situation also but we do not of any Connecticut authority.
1969.81,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3139.892,3145.461,"The only kind of authority, I guess, is that Appellate Division's opinion in this case, is it?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3145.461,3149.472,"It's breaking new ground Justice Stewart, I believe."
1969.81,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3339.569,3354.564,Do you think that its on question under the federal -- under the Connecticut statutes that you take any appeal whether frivolous or non frivolous the bond is required?
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3354.564,3355.738,"In this case, yes."
1969.81,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3357.113,3358.351,In this case.
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3365.026,3369.776,"No, we take the position on appeal bond is required."
1969.81,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3369.776,3384.234,"And that if the appeal bond is not filed, there is no appeal to this not just to be but that the order of eviction is executed?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3384.234,3388.97,The surety bond is essential to the appeal.
1969.81,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3388.97,3389.956,In any event?
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3389.956,3391.962,That's correct.
1969.81,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3391.962,3399.868,But do you think that you -- but you said awhile ago that you thought the --
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3399.868,3402.672,"Well, I'm talking about the language of the statute at this point."
1969.81,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3412.372,3413.939,Are you sure that's correct?
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3413.939,3414.815,We feel that it could.
1969.81,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3419.723,3422.427,And that it would I think it is unless they --
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3422.427,3431.313,"In the context of the proper case where the situation is such that the tenant for valid reason has not paid the rent and cannot pay the rent, we think that it would."
1969.81,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3433.469,3436.551,He may not pay the rent or put up the bond?
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3436.551,3438.655,Pardon me?
1969.81,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.655,3446.128,I would suppose the Court will decide if there are some valid reason not or not paying rent for putting up the bond?
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3449.899,3453.43,But he could continue to pay the rent as they claim in this case.
1969.81,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3453.43,3454.606,Yes.
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3459.694,3461.413,"Yes, we do Your Honor."
1969.81,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3465.801,3468.434,But certainly cited in the people's statute.
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3468.434,3472.793,"It's in the tip of the statute as far as its language is concerned, yes Justice White."
1969.81,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3472.793,3500.615,"The trial judge seems to have at least given some consideration to the idea that he first found that the appeal was taken in good faith and not the purposes of delay, then he would considerably questioned because page question of the paying the alternative of rent into the Court that the top page 22 in your appendix."
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3516.413,3517.429,That is correct Your Honor.
1969.81,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3521.918,3524.75,"Now, the Appellate Court didn't approach that question?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3524.75,3534.141,I don't think it had to Chief Justice because of the fact that it went along with the finding of the trial court that the action was instituted for purposes of delay.
1969.81,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3534.141,3537.223,"Well, at least six times by my count here."
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3573.517,3575.483,We will attempt to analyze it to that effect Mr. Chief Justice.
1969.81,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3575.483,3581.844,"As I understand Mr. Ahern, you're going to try to demonstrate Justice Jacob's opinion or Judge Jacobs?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3581.844,3582.96,Judge Jacobs.
1969.81,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3582.96,3589.096,"And rest itself or address to itself for the state, did you say that?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3589.096,3590.591,"Well, if I may say --"
1969.81,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3590.591,3591.749,"Well, is that what's going to do of --"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3591.749,3592.885,"Yes, Justice Brennan."
1969.81,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3593.232,3603.161,"In other words, you're telling us that we are to read this opinion is not addressed only to whether the appeal have to be dismissed for one rebuttal of law."
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3611.514,3618.541,That's correct Justice Brennan.
1969.81,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3649.328,3660.928,I suppose this Housing Authority like most public housing authorities has a waiving list of other poor people who are or claim to be eligible for occupancy here.
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3661.974,3673.024,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't know if the record shows it but certainly, I think the Court can take judicial notice of the fact that there aren't sufficient housing accommodations for the poor and that there would be a list of people waiting."
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3691.308,3699.781,I still have big difficulty on the landlord in all when they paid this $72.00 a month into Court.
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3705.358,3706.005,If I may --
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3706.005,3708.738,"-- they fail to pay it, they loss everything."
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3708.738,3722.599,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I think the record will show that the offer to make payment into Court was made at the time the hearing was held on the motion to waive surety bond which was nine months after they stopped paying rent."
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3728.206,3737.239,"Well, then am I wrong that if that stage, if they put up a surety bond they didn't have to pay their nine months behind, did they?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3737.239,3738.756,Not in summary process action.
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3740.154,3743.086,"Well, that's what I'm saying as of this."
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3748.723,3749.861,That's correct.
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3749.861,3753.202,And the -- was solely for the protection of the landlord.
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3753.202,3754.15,Correct.
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3754.15,3762.304,And why did he had ever surety bond when he was sure of his rent -- $72.00 a month?
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3762.304,3764.431,Why would he have to?
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3780.805,3785.863,"Well, they didn't -- with the surety bond wouldn't call that nine months in arrears either?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3785.863,3786.649,"No, it would not."
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3786.649,3791.4,"Well, so far is that particular point to nine months are arrears is out of the picture?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3791.4,3803.421,"Well, I think these all comes in to the fact that the trial judge found that there dilatory tactics used because normally for summary process action takes considerably less than seven months to have a hearing on the merits."
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3803.421,3806.099,"Oh, I see them less then two hours."
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3806.099,3811.105,"Well, not in Connecticut that they have a hearing in Connecticut, the full hearing on the merits, Justice Marshall."
1969.81,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3811.105,3811.852,I see.
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3811.852,3812.07,I have nothing --
1969.81,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3812.07,3836.397,"Mr. Ahern, do you think the action of the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court of April 11, 1968 appearing on page 66 of the appendix, throws any lie upon the question in which Mr. Justice Douglas and the Chief Justice expressed an interest?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3851.399,3855.888,"Well, certainly on page 67, the paragraph which starts on that page."
1969.81,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3884.655,3891.628,"This owner here has to do with finally the vacation of the stay of execution, is it not?"
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3892.596,3894.732,"Yes, it does Your Honor."
1969.81,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3894.732,3901.976,And they do review in some length the Appellate Court what they refer to as dilatory instructions?
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3901.976,3903.451,That is correct.
1969.81,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3907.104,3919.212,"At 69 in the opinion, the Appellate Court also notes apparently with some emphasize as I read it to upon the review of the whole matter."
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3933.273,3939.13,"I would trust that the statement of the trial judge would be given as widest application in that connection, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.81,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3939.13,3939.589,Thank you Mr. Ahern.
1969.81,3,23524,f_michael_ahern,,3939.589,3941.226,Thank you very much.
1969.81,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3941.226,3942.204,The case is submitted.
