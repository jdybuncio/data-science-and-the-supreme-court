1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,0.0,7.17,This case presents issues central to the operation of co-curricular activities in the public secondary schools in this country.
1989.88-1597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,134.537,150.196,"Well, Mr. Daubman, is there some provision in the Federal act that at least with regard to clubs covered by the act would limit the participation of the faculty sponsor?"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,150.196,166.824,"The act basically provides that a school district that has a safe harbor provision, which basically provides that a school district does not have to provide a faculty sponsor, but if it does so in terms of a role of a monitor, that that is permitted under the act."
1989.88-1597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.824,174.247,"And it goes further and says the sponsor will act as no more than a custodian, in effect?"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,174.247,174.747,Yes.
1989.88-1597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,174.747,177.566,That the faculty sponsor will not be active?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,177.566,178.332,That is correct.
1989.88-1597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.332,189.256,"Do you suppose the act would be applied so as to limit the participation of the sponsor for the scuba class, for example... the Scuba Club?"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,189.256,202.397,"The sponsor for the Scuba Club, in our particular case there were really... there was a faculty sponsor that was subject to the direction of the administration."
1989.88-1597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.397,211.853,"I'm just asking whether the Federal act would apply across the board to all clubs covered by the act, whether they are religious or not?"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,211.853,213.139,That's correct.
1989.88-1597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,213.139,221.645,So that the type of participation you've been describing would not be permitted under the Federal act by the faculty sponsor?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,221.645,236.154,"What... the problem presented is that we did not have a forum at the high school and therefore not a forum under the Equal Access Act which provided for custodial sponsors, but rather provided for active participation."
1989.88-1597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.154,239.189,I thought the court below found that you did have a forum.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,239.189,241.789,The district court found otherwise.
1989.88-1597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.908,244.408,Right.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,244.408,245.093,--That's correct.
1989.88-1597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,245.093,245.576,Right.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,245.576,246.326,And in that regard--
1989.88-1597,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,246.326,249.395,So we're talking about the present situation.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,264.238,266.023,"--No, it does not, Your Honor."
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,310.802,325.212,"Yes, but am I correct, Mr. Daubman, that even if you had no classes that related to scuba diving or athletics you would still maintain that a Scuba Club would be non... would be... would not make... not convert the school into a limited public forum, wouldn't you?"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,325.212,326.828,That's not entirely correct.
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,341.322,350.777,"I thought your test was a little... was one that, if the school could sponsor the activity as a curriculum activity, that it would be all right to have a club, even though it didn't have a class."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,361.566,362.835,--It would not--
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,362.835,363.535,Under your view.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,365.703,370.689,"--Under my view, it would not bring the act into play."
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,370.689,371.305,--And the reasons?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,371.305,377.344,The absence of a French class does not mean the absence of foreign language department.
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,378.027,389.918,"Well, say there's no foreign language department... let me push you... but you still want to have a French class on the theory that it's the kind of activity a school can sponsor without getting into all these sensitive issues?"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,389.918,398.091,"--If the club's object... goals and objectives were instruction or discourse regarding the French language, then I would agree with you."
1989.88-1597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.683,420.687,"Mr. Daubman, one of your clubs involves helping handicapped children."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,435.547,440.101,"Well, the name of the club, or the activity, is Peer Advocates."
1989.88-1597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.688,449.54,Why is that?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,449.54,452.409,Because the act talks about clubs that are student initiated.
1989.88-1597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.409,467.984,"Oh, that's for the club... for a club to be entitled to be admitted under the act, it has to be student initiated, but I don't read the act anywhere as saying that for purposes of the test of the act, of whether you're a limited forum, the club has to be student initiated."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,470.12,481.242,It... what it says is that the act provides that student... that it applies to student initiated clubs.
1989.88-1597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,481.242,481.644,"No, it says"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,509.694,531.508,"Quite apart from that, with respect to Peer Advocates, the situation presented there... two points: first of all, that was... purposes of the pretrial stipulation, in terms of what clubs were going to be determined to be at issue as to whether they were noncurriculum-related for purposes this... of this lawsuit, was raised for the first time on appeal in the briefs."
1989.88-1597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,549.736,550.921,Did you make this point in your briefs?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,551.605,553.121,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,553.121,555.89,--What about the Chess Club?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,561.777,565.681,"Yes, it is, and logical thought processes that are associated with that."
1989.88-1597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,601.038,608.275,Could teachers at different schools take different positions about whether or not the Chess Club is curriculum related?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,617.364,621.635,--What we are bound by is the record presented in this case.
1989.88-1597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,626.053,629.688,"Well, what I'm asking is, what is the test for a curriculum-related club?"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,634.842,637.127,"--Ultimately, it is what this Court thinks, sir."
1989.88-1597,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.096,640.879,"Well, I don't know."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,648.669,651.287,--I think the... I think it is a factual determination.
1989.88-1597,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,651.287,657.291,"Well then, if it's a... it has to be clearly erroneous to overturn the district court."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,657.291,658.391,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1597,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,659.091,660.91,"Well, that isn't what the Eighth Circuit did."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,662.679,664.862,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and we've urged that point."
1989.88-1597,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.862,666.296,I would think you would be arguing that.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,666.296,666.98,I'm sorry?
1989.88-1597,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,666.98,668.665,I would think you would be arguing that.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,668.665,669.698,I am arguing that.
1989.88-1597,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,672.3,675.502,But I'm not... are you sure it's a factual determination that's a--
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,675.502,685.041,"--What the Equal Access Act provided, quite clearly, is that there was a broad discretion granted to school officials."
1989.88-1597,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.201,710.173,"But if this issue is open to de novo review by the court of appeals, I would suppose they know more about what's curriculum related in Omaha than... is this in Omaha?"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,710.173,711.525,"Yes, it is."
1989.88-1597,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,711.525,713.075,In Omaha than we do.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,718.679,724.333,"Well, certainly the district court judge knows more about what's going on and what's curriculum related in Omaha than the Eighth Circuit does."
1989.88-1597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,724.333,727.635,"Well, did he make findings of fact?"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,727.635,728.535,At the trial level?
1989.88-1597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,728.535,728.937,Yes.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,728.937,738.443,"Yes, and those were not really discussed in the Eighth Circuit opinion."
1989.88-1597,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,746.397,751.166,Did he make findings of fact that all the clubs were curriculum related?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,751.166,753.535,"--At the trial level, yes."
1989.88-1597,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,753.535,755.035,This was Judge Beam?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,755.035,755.568,"Yes, it was."
1989.88-1597,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,755.568,756.404,Now on the Eighth Circuit?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,756.404,758.754,That is correct.
1989.88-1597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,758.754,767.86,"You're arguing now, Mr. Daubman, that the high school did not have a limited open forum, is that right?"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,767.86,768.045,That's right.
1989.88-1597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,768.045,773.114,You... are you asking us to construe the Equal Access Act to reach that conclusion?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,773.114,775.882,That's correct.
1989.88-1597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,841.141,843.86,I think that the Federal statute prohibits that.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,887.805,901.732,"What the act does is provides a definitional framework for when you have a limited open forum triggering the applicability of that act, and it is our contention that we did not have a limited open forum under the terms of that act."
1989.88-1597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,901.732,901.982,Why?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,904.182,909.819,Primarily because we had... we did not have noncurriculum-related student groups.
1989.88-1597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.017,943.675,"That's all it takes to make it faculty related, is that you have a sponsor on the faculty who directs the group, and the group can be engaged in any subject whatever."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,959.835,970.142,What we are urging is that the definition of curriculum-relatedness really goes to the heart of what the school officials have chosen to do with the co-curricular activities.
1989.88-1597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,982.767,990.556,"Well, it would certainly... that would certainly... your construction would certainly enable any school district that felt like it to totally avoid the Equal Access Act."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,990.556,994.325,I think that certainly that risk is present.
1989.88-1597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,995.425,996.86,"Well, do you think that's what Congress intended?"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,996.86,1014.721,--I think Congress intended... I know Congress intended that what ought to be done in terms of the school district's response to the Equal Access Act is to allow school districts in their discretion to make educational decisions as to what academic and co-curricular programs they're going to sponsor.
1989.88-1597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.252,1039.371,But the Eighth Circuit disagreed with the trial court.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1039.371,1044.173,--The Eighth Circuit disagreed with the trial court in interpretation of the Equal Access Act.
1989.88-1597,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1051.845,1055.664,It didn't define... purport to state a standard for deciding.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1055.664,1057.849,It gave no guidance.
1989.88-1597,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1057.849,1058.633,May I interrupt?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1060.367,1061.0,I think the test is--
1989.88-1597,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1061.0,1066.954,Justice Kennedy asked you awhile ago... I think I... I'm afraid I interrupted before you could really answer him.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1066.954,1100.776,"--The test, I think... and again, balancing... keeping in mind the three concerns that the Equal Access Act addressed: free speech rights, nonestablishment of religion and school district discretion, the correct, and I think most proper way to interpret the act to satisfy those three concerns, is to determine whether or not the co-curricular activity student clubs, whatever you want to call them, do in fact relate to the curriculum of the high school and the school district officials--"
1989.88-1597,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.776,1101.226,In fact.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1102.294,1114.852,"--In fact, and if school district officials, in doing... in structuring their co-curricular activities in student clubs, treat it truly as co-curricular, treat it truly as part of the educational program that it offers, as the trial court found--"
1989.88-1597,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.852,1115.285,--What is truly?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1116.121,1117.404,--In fact.
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1121.356,1122.458,"Well, may I ask you a question?"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1141.337,1150.108,"--One of the other basic educational choices that Westside community schools made, again long prior to the passage of the Equal Access Act--"
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1150.108,1150.992,"Well, they said they weren't going to do that, I know."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1156.762,1161.581,"--Again, we don't... keeping in mind we don't have adversary clubs."
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1161.581,1170.504,"Are you suggesting, in other words, that Congress intended to allow that kind of latitude in the clubs and not allow the religious groups to meet?"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1170.504,1170.939,No.
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.49,1182.244,Because isn't it true that one of the costs of having a noncurriculum-related club is that you must allow not merely religious groups but political groups?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1187.298,1190.183,"--Sure, and it's those adversarial types of clubs--"
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.183,1195.654,"And if you have a Chess Club, the price you pay for that is, you must let all these other groups in?"
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1195.654,1197.154,"--Well, if the Chess Club is--"
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.154,1199.539,If a Chess Club is noncurriculum related?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1199.539,1200.725,--That's correct.
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.725,1201.658,Yes.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1209.997,1214.299,It depends on the curriculum or the... what the school district' done.
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1214.299,1216.234,"Well, you can put anything on the curriculum, under that view."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1216.234,1217.617,"Well, and that's what Congress did."
1989.88-1597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1226.24,1237.914,"Mr. Daubman, I... tell me if I'm correct, that I think that you're using the term ""curriculum"" to mean not just the formal courses that are taught in the school."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1240.033,1240.966,That is correct.
1989.88-1597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.966,1254.942,"That you are saying that anything becomes part of the school's curriculum if the school wants to teach it, even if the school wants to teach it only through these extracurricular activities... so-called extracurricular."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1261.263,1261.613,No.
1989.88-1597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1262.163,1262.998,Basically.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1262.998,1264.765,"--Well, I wouldn't phrase it that way, obviously."
1989.88-1597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1264.765,1265.115,Well--
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1270.469,1290.199,"Well, and I think as pointed out in the briefs of the Respondent and the government, the dictionaries do it that way, too, but the testimony at trial, from the students' own expert witness, defines ""curriculum"" in the same manner that was defined by, or used by our administration, long before passage of the act."
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.199,1297.971,"Well, in your answer to Justice Stevens you indicated that the Democrat or Republican Club would be noncurriculum related because it's adversarial."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1299.404,1299.904,No.
1989.88-1597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1359.643,1375.121,"Under your view, Mr. Daubman, supposing that a school, perhaps not Westside, but some similar school, said we're going to have Republican and Democratic Clubs as extensions of the curriculum, as extensions of the civics class."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1383.458,1390.381,"--The problem there is, again, that those clubs are expressing a particular point of view."
1989.88-1597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1390.381,1392.347,But why should that be a limiting factor?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1392.347,1397.385,It's a limiting factor in terms of the operation of our club structure is all I'm saying.
1989.88-1597,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.385,1401.772,The statute doesn't require... doesn't permit you to apply that limiting factor.
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1415.512,1417.364,That's correct.
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1417.364,1426.404,"May I ask you, in your brief I thought you endorsed the test that Congressman Goodling advocated, and he's quoted on page 70 and 71 of your brief."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1434.491,1435.693,The position being?
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1435.693,1440.378,"Well, first there's a subject matter of the meeting of the type which a public school could sponsor."
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1479.168,1487.424,"I've not abandoned that argument, Your Honor, but that, Representative Goodling's test, if you will, as well as other things suggested in the legislative history--"
1989.88-1597,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1487.424,1489.643,But doesn't that test solve most of these hypotheticals?
1989.88-1597,0,15825,allen_e_daubman,,1489.643,1490.71,--It does.
1989.88-1597,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1494.195,1495.714,"Very well, Mr. Daubman."
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1501.35,1504.135,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1612.837,1613.939,May I interrupt you on that?
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1613.939,1614.456,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1614.456,1618.908,Supposing the school does not teach any physical education courses at all.
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1622.878,1625.996,Congress discussed that and in the legislative history addressed that also.
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1625.996,1630.648,"I know they said no, but in terms of just looking at the language of the statute, why wouldn't it or would it?"
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1631.85,1648.026,"I think in fact that the existence of the football team with no physical education still could have the... the... the relationship which would not trigger the act because of the... the coaches being involved to the... such a extent, the paid salary of--"
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1648.026,1648.793,Supposing you don't have coaches.
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1651.828,1655.196,"--Oh, I think then in that situation that the act could apply, in fact."
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1655.196,1656.648,"The act could or... obviously, it could--"
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1656.648,1657.165,"It would apply, Your Honor."
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1657.165,1657.665,--Yes.
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1657.665,1669.656,"And the reason that I think Congress in looking at that issue, and what they were looking at is more of the typical situation where the school has the football team and the team's a little bit different than the clubs."
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.825,1672.158,I know.
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1683.466,1683.966,"--No, we're--"
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.966,1687.585,"Because that's the price, is it not, if you... if you become a public forum."
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1687.585,1694.506,"--My response to that is this, Your Honor, that Congress wanted to eliminate invidious discrimination against religious and political speech."
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1694.506,1698.575,"But is it not true that if you... if you say it's a limited public forum, that's the consequence."
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1702.21,1703.779,"For instance, I would not think that a club for--"
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1703.779,1704.412,Is that your view or not?
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1704.412,1707.498,--Not with relate to a group that would be advocating drug use and drug abuse.
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1708.6,1708.816,Why not?
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1708.816,1719.822,"Because that is... Congress addressed that in the act and stated at... under Section D, Number 5 that to sanction meetings that are otherwise unlawful and a group that was promoting the use--"
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1719.822,1724.626,"No, not the use, just the... advocating change in the law to make it permissible."
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1724.626,1725.81,--That would be covered by the act.
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.96,1836.866,You don't know... you don't know whether there's been a lot of people that applied who... do you know who's applied?
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1836.866,1848.674,"--There was statements... and actually that was addressed, Your Honor, in the lower court, and what was discussed there was there was a club that was going to... a soccer club was actually going to be formed, and there was a lack of student interest involved."
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1859.912,1860.831,"Yes, but isn't it also--"
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1861.647,1862.214,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.214,1863.297,Sounds unsafe.
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1863.297,1864.299,"It does sound unsafe, yes."
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1868.485,1877.007,"But isn't it also true that the school policy had been rather clear that they would not permit a Young Republican or a Young Democrats club to be formed, so there was... probably nobody would bother to apply."
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1877.007,1878.776,"Well, Your Honor, that is correct."
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1898.02,1905.51,"Do you think it would be an impermissible educational decision to say we would rather have none of these groups at all and if we have to abolish all clubs, we'll do that?"
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1905.51,1906.01,"Yes, I do."
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1909.228,1911.83,Let me... let me just take it one step further.
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1911.83,1912.147,"--Yes, sir."
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1912.147,1914.882,The government identifies four clubs that they say make it a limited club.
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1921.453,1925.005,That's exactly what the school board in this particular case has stated they would do.
1989.88-1597,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1925.59,1927.974,"Would that be permissible under the act, in your view?"
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1927.974,1931.828,--They have the right to... there's nothing in the act that prohibits them from closing down the club forum.
1989.88-1597,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.907,1957.143,Do you agree that could be done under the Equal Access Act?
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1957.143,1957.895,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1976.04,1986.745,"You... the... you... you win this case and they close down the club system, and you suggest that they constitutionally could not do that?"
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1986.745,1987.178,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1990.616,1992.049,And keep your group off the campus?
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1992.049,1994.484,"--Keep my group off the campus in this context, Your Honor."
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1994.484,1996.536,But you say there's a constitutional question?
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1996.536,1997.07,Yes.
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.07,1997.703,What?
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,1997.703,2026.622,"And that is this: The school board, and the testimony at trial stated clearly, and it's... it's really unequivocal that informal meetings on a regular basis, even so far as meeting at lunch on a regular basis with a Bible open and discussing the Bible or these students discussing each other's spiritual concerns that they had or religious concerns that they had or religious viewpoints, if that was done on a regular basis during lunch, not any kind of extracurricular activity period, that they would prohibit that activity."
1989.88-1597,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2026.622,2027.255,Did the school board--
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.255,2028.655,--That's a different question.
1989.88-1597,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.655,2033.459,Did the school board say... say why they would close down the clubs if this case went against them?
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2033.459,2034.443,That they... yes.
1989.88-1597,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.848,2098.866,"Where were these discussions held about, you know, abortion, homosexuality?"
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2100.218,2101.135,"--Some of them, yes."
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.014,2146.897,Unrelated.
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2146.897,2154.52,"Your Honor, my test is simple, and that is, is the particular club directly related to the class and--"
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.52,2158.055,"Well, that just restates... that isn't very illuminating."
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2160.923,2162.89,"--Your Honor, I think... I'd... I... I would say this."
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2197.78,2204.702,"So, is it just going to be a formal thing because a logic is sort of a... an extension of the mathematics course?"
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2204.702,2205.852,--I don't think you could take it that--
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.852,2208.004,Or logic?
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2208.004,2208.804,"--Your Honor, I don't think--"
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.804,2218.693,"We teach logic in the school, and the best way... one of the best... one of the... one of the ways of stirring up interest in it is a chess club."
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2218.693,2225.03,"--Your Honor, number one, in this particular class... club setting in the class function there is no class in logic."
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.582,2227.382,Mathematics?
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2227.382,2244.51,"--Thee was a mathematics class, but that... the chess club, for instance, was exactly what Congress was... one of the clubs frequently discussed in reviewing the act, the history of the act, that would trigger the existence of a noncurriculum club, therefore the limited open forum under the act."
1989.88-1597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2244.51,2253.866,"Under your test could two math professors at two different schools disagree as to whether or not a chess course was directly related, assuming their textbook is the same?"
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2253.866,2264.857,"I would defer to Congress on that, and I would say that in that particular situation since the chess club did come up fairly frequently in the debates going back and forth, that that would trigger the act."
1989.88-1597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2265.874,2266.609,I... I'm not sure.
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2274.463,2275.299,"--No, they're not."
1989.88-1597,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2292.508,2295.293,Even if a math professor disagrees with that?
1989.88-1597,1,33043,jay_alan_sekulow,,2295.293,2316.876,"I would think so because even if the math professor would disagree, I think... I believe that that would still present the same problem, and that is if, in fact, we take a posture... if this Court were to take a posture that anything related to the missions and goals, which is what the district court stated, which the Eighth Circuit rejected entirely, would circumvent the act."
1989.88-1597,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2321.428,2325.481,The act doesn't list chess clubs or anything like that.

1989.88-1597,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2689.566,2695.118,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1597,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2779.307,2784.444,"But also these other groups we've talked about also have the same right, like the Ku Klux Klan and so forth?"
1989.88-1597,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2784.444,2785.594,Yes.
1989.88-1597,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2789.812,2793.966,And... and Congress was motivated by treating all of them equally with one... one another.
1989.88-1597,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2793.966,2795.835,"--Of treating them equally, subject to--"
1989.88-1597,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2795.835,2799.287,You don't find in the legislative history a predominant interest in the religious groups?
1989.88-1597,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2799.287,2800.003,--I beg your pardon?
1989.88-1597,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2800.003,2805.374,You don't find in the legislative history a predominant interest in protecting the religious groups?
1989.88-1597,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2805.374,2819.784,"Oh, I think the primary thrust was to protect religious liberty, because the problem that presented itself to Congress was one of discrimination that was visited on the heads of students who wanted to participate in religious discussion."
1989.88-1597,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2833.624,2844.399,"And the other groups may have been included, the Ku Klux Klan and... and whatever, because of our establishment clause jurisprudence suggesting that you cannot accommodate religion without accommodating everybody else."
1989.88-1597,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2844.399,2850.636,The bill was originally drafted so as to provided protection only to religious groups.
1989.88-1597,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2906.64,2912.126,"Mr. Starr, is the authority of Congress in this case derived from its control over funds?"
1989.88-1597,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2912.126,2931.874,"I believe its authority derives under the spending powers of Article 1, Section 8, and also by virtue of the statement with respect to any number of members of the House and the Senate, its authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to eliminate discrimination."
1989.88-1597,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.874,2935.492,"Well, it can't be the spending power, because there is no... no remedy of the cut off of funds here."
1989.88-1597,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2937.026,2959.191,"Well, however, Justice Stevens, that the Congress saw fit to apply this statute only to schools that receive federal financial assistance, I suppose if we had a Grove City kind, as it were, of public school system that eschewed any federal funds, this would not apply."
1989.88-1597,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3061.157,3064.794,"Mr.... Mr. Solicitor General, then you say a football team would do it if there's no athletic program?"
1989.88-1597,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3064.794,3067.746,--I don't think Congress contemplated that if we're guided by the legislative history--
1989.88-1597,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3067.746,3071.13,"Yeah, but I mean your reading of the statute, what would that do?"
1989.88-1597,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3074.482,3076.466,--I believe that is a matter of considerable confusion.
1989.88-1597,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3077.118,3079.134,I thought you had a bright line test for reading this.
1989.88-1597,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3079.134,3091.944,"--If... if... I were... if I were interpreting this statute, I would say it would not, because, Justice Stevens, it seems to me that it's rather odd to describe the school football team as a student group wishing to conduct a meeting."
1989.88-1597,3,15825,allen_e_daubman,,3288.569,3298.442,The test proposed by the Respondents and by the government is contrary to the act and is educationally unworkable.
1989.88-1597,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3319.755,3341.621,I assume moral formation is part of your school... what the schools try to teach as well and... and I suppose religious groups are as closely related to moral formation as your... your helping the handicapped club is to sensitivity or whatever you... whatever value you said was being taught by that.
1989.88-1597,3,15825,allen_e_daubman,,3341.621,3342.938,--That's correct.
1989.88-1597,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3342.938,3346.24,"So then if you allowed the one, you should have been allowing the other."
1989.88-1597,3,15825,allen_e_daubman,,3346.24,3351.309,"Again, the act isn't triggered unless we have noncurriculum related."
1989.88-1597,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3462.198,3464.567,"Thank you, Mr. Daubman."
