1976.75-1344,0,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,61.72,64.768,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1976.75-1344,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1402.506,1405.83,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court."
1976.75-1344,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3018.826,3021.961,"Very briefly, Your Honor."
1976.75-1344,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3094.937,3100.23,"But the more recent ones have solved that problem at least on that issue for this case, do they not?"
1976.75-1344,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3101.618,3104.466,They would if we knew the jury convicted for the more recent.
1976.75-1344,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3175.266,3193.24,"Well, Mr. Hirschkop, perhaps the moral to be drawn from this dilemma that is posed is that when a man is indicted for a felony, he perhaps better divest himself of firearms that come under the statute."
1976.75-1344,2,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,3193.24,3212.478,"That might be a harsh moral, Your Honor, because conviction of a felony carries within a number of proscriptions, of rights of citizenship, and if we give full credence to your innocence and proven guilty, you have a right to maintain your rights of citizenship until such time as the court says you are guilty."
1976.75-1344,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3213.62,3214.287,Thank you Gentlemen.
