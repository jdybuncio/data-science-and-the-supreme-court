2009.08-876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.237,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-876, Conrad Black et al. v. The United States."
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,9.606,12.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2009.08-876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.424,141.074,"You -- you don't ask for the first, do you?"
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,141.074,141.859,"--Yes, we do."
2009.08-876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,155.916,162.522,"Are -- are you saying that unless we adopt the limiting instruction that you propose, the statute is then vague?"
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,162.522,164.189,--We have argued that.
2009.08-876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,230.416,241.539,Your theory -- your theory that return to the pre-McNally cases would help you is based almost entirely on the D.C. Circuit case -- case in Lemire -- Lemire.
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,241.539,244.658,"--I think that is not a fair statement, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,260.251,262.87,The -- the government tells us it was an outlier.
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,262.87,269.939,"--Well, it had a different view, as we have pointed out, when they filed the brief in the Carpenter case."
2009.08-876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,291.703,302.761,"Well, since the -- since the body of pre-McNally lower court cases was hardly completely consistent, do you think this is a workable approach?"
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,302.761,314.052,"The honest answer is: I do believe that the statute is vague in all of its -- all of its applications, and I am happy to explain, quickly, because of that, why that is."
2009.08-876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,367.27,375.709,I don't know what's so discretionary and harmful about a bribery or kickback case.
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,391.969,392.735,--I--
2009.08-876,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,392.735,398.205,"To get a contract, to pass legislation, it's illegal to take a kickback."
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,410.28,415.517,"--I absolutely agree with the statements that you made, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-876,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,426.408,430.177,"But it's not your -- it's not within your test, as I understand it."
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,474.456,501.189,"I think that is not a fair statement, Justice Ginsburg, because in our economic system, I think it is fairly inferable, and any jury could so find that if you are a supply agent for a corporation and you are taking a bribe of $10,000 to steer the contract to Company X, Company X would be more than happy, and it would be a matter of indifference to Company X to just give a 10K break to your employer."
2009.08-876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,515.283,527.423,"The problem with the bribe or kickback explanation, unlike -- or you contend, unlike yours, is that there's no basis in the statute for limiting it to that."
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,527.423,528.756,"I think, Justice Scalia--"
2009.08-876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.756,530.625,"I mean, we -- we can't find a statute that says,"
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,543.533,559.442,"--No, and that was going to be the second part of my answer to Justice Sotomayor, and it is a point that Justice Breyer also made in the Morales case, taking -- taking the example of Coates v. City of Cincinnati where the law basically said,"
2009.08-876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,586.212,594.532,"Let's say you have a bank that is going to be opening up a lot of branches in the State, and one of the directors knows this and knows where they are going to open them."
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,616.997,636.559,"--Well, I think that sort of self-dealing likely would be covered, not under my view of the statute, but under Carpenter, because if you were stealing confidential information from your employer, and the Court in Carpenter did say that confidential information is a -- is a form of property as a matter of Federal law--"
2009.08-876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,636.559,638.677,But he is not stealing -- he is not stealing the confidential information.
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,641.962,652.503,"--But under either view, if you are going to steal the corporate opportunity, that, too, is a form of property, and in fact, the property counts in this very--"
2009.08-876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,652.503,656.555,"Well, I don't know that I would call it a corporate -- I don't know if I would call it a corporate opportunity."
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,658.99,673.481,"--Precisely, but -- but this is not unlike cases like O'Hagan, or even Carpenter itself, in which, you know, the value of the use of the information comes from learning the confidential plans of your employer."
2009.08-876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,687.973,691.925,"Just while we are on the Oeschler thing, and then you'll probably want to go on to the other thing."
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,706.018,711.137,"Under the obstruction, or -- I mean, under the -- under the kickback--"
2009.08-876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,711.137,711.47,Kickback or bribe.
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,711.47,712.287,"--No, it couldn't."
2009.08-876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.678,768.724,"Mr. Estrada, let -- let me pursue the notion I -- I floated earlier, that the problem with Professor Altshuler's approach is that there is nothing in the text of the statute that would enable you to limit it to kickbacks and -- and bribes."
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,802.045,814.537,"Your Honor, I don't think that I can give an answer that would be fully satisfactory to a pure textualist, that this can be taken out of the words of the statute."
2009.08-876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1046.185,1061.878,"Well, but presumably, the one thing it's odd to suggest Congress did was sort of run 1346 through 1341, when what it was trying to fix was the Court's understanding of what 1341 provided."
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1061.878,1067.181,"There are any -- there are any number of problems with how Congress chose to do this, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1128.922,1140.545,"What if -- what if I think that even -- I mean, much of your case is directed to the point that you -- you have to narrow it this way to avoid constitutional problems."
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1143.682,1144.182,--Then it--
2009.08-876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.182,1150.086,Why should -- why should I turn somersaults to -- to come out with the -- with the interpretation that you want?
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1150.086,1151.819,--You should not.
2009.08-876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1177.767,1182.504,Where -- where in the record do we find your argument that the statute is unconstitutional?
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1182.504,1197.098,"We made it -- we made it in the district court in a motion to dismiss the indictment, and I don't believe that is part of the joint appendix, but it is Docket Entry 261."
2009.08-876,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.514,1256.3,"Now, what about--"
2009.08-876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1256.3,1260.002,"Under the test that you propose, is the test the same?"
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1264.47,1264.97,No.
2009.08-876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1264.97,1273.076,"Well, then we -- then if we accept your view, we have to have one subset of definitions for private officials and another for public officials."
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1275.076,1283.646,"That is a problem that is inherent, as I said earlier, in trying to do anything to save the statute."
2009.08-876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1284.432,1292.352,"Well, under the judge's bribery case that we just -- that you discussed earlier, couldn't you take the position that that money the judge took as a bribe really should have been paid to the government?"
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1292.352,1303.726,"--Well, oddly enough, that was an argument that was made to Judge Posner and remanded, the Holzer case, and Judge Posner said, Well, that is really untenable."
2009.08-876,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1303.726,1305.261,"But that would fit your test, though."
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1305.261,1309.647,"Well, yes, in a -- in a very formal way."
2009.08-876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1410.496,1416.667,"Counsel, you were -- I think you were about to tell me where you raised it in the Court -- the constitutional argument in this Court?"
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1416.667,1424.605,--We -- we raised that as a predicate for our question presented.
2009.08-876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1539.981,1549.253,Could you just take a moment and explain why any error in the honest services instruction wasn't harmless as applied to the Forum/Paxton transaction?
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1549.253,1551.621,That's -- that's Count Seven?
2009.08-876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1551.621,1552.055,Yes.
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1552.055,1552.723,Well--
2009.08-876,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1552.723,1565.865,"As I understand it, there was no evidence there that the $600,000 was a -- a recharacterized management fee; isn't that correct?"
2009.08-876,0,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,1565.865,1566.331,--No.
2009.08-876,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1617.131,1617.75,"Thank you, Counsel."
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1620.3,1621.801,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1654.506,1661.493,But I don't -- I don't have the heart to inquire into that question if I think that the whole statute is bad.
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1679.205,1680.205,"Well, Justice Scalia--"
2009.08-876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1680.205,1681.471,It doesn't make any sense to make me do that.
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1681.471,1690.326,"--Maybe you should wait for a Petitioner who presents the question, rather than granting relief to a Petitioner who chose not to raise the constitutional issue in this Court--"
2009.08-876,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1690.326,1702.051,"Well, it's a little -- it's a little odd that you -- you would say that an argument that shows a way the statute can be saved cannot be -- cannot be presented."
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1702.051,1704.153,--Well--
2009.08-876,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1704.153,1711.14,"I mean, he's saying the statute could be saved, if at all, if you adopt this -- this construction."
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1715.461,1732.589,"--I think that the Court should reach that issue, the issue whether there is contemplated economic harm as a requirement for the statute, and the government briefed that issue, and I disagree with Petitioner that contemplated economic harm is either an element of the statute or necessary to save its constitutionality--"
2009.08-876,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1732.589,1740.076,"Well, on the other hand, if we just can't find a -- a grounding in the statute for it, then that's because the statute's vague."
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1740.076,1752.384,"--What this statute is, Justice Kennedy, is Congress's effort to reinstate the body of law that this Court held was not a valid construction of the mail fraud statute--"
2009.08-876,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1752.384,1759.038,Before you -- do you -- does the government feel that it hasn't had an adequate opportunity to brief the constitutionality of the statute?
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1759.038,1767.393,"--If the Court wished to address the constitutionality of the statute, the government would brief it more fully, including by making the points that--"
2009.08-876,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1767.393,1769.109,Might this come up in the Skilling case?
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1769.109,1773.88,--The Skilling case raises the question of whether if this Court does not interpret--
2009.08-876,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1773.88,1779.201,"So we have to say, in your view -- no, I'm just -- I'm cutting into you because I don't -- you answered it once you said that."
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1791.092,1796.996,"--If the Court believes that that is a necessary question to resolve, then it should be briefed in a supplemental passage--"
2009.08-876,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1796.996,1797.563,So we should say that?
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1797.563,1806.317,"--But not in this case, because I think if a Petitioner comes to this Court and presents a particular statutory construction question and then seeks to smuggle in--"
2009.08-876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1806.317,1807.035,Counsel--
2009.08-876,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1807.035,1807.635,That would be--
2009.08-876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1807.635,1808.719,--does Skilling -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-876,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1808.719,1809.235,--Go ahead.
2009.08-876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1809.235,1815.073,Directly answer this question: Does Skilling present the pure question or not?
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1815.073,1825.296,"--No, because in Skilling, Justice Sotomayor, the question is whether an element of personal or private gain needs to be read into the statute in order to render it constitutional."
2009.08-876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1832.25,1834.069,We don't know if that's going to be--
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1834.069,1836.771,--That case may present a -- a different issue.
2009.08-876,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1848.096,1857.852,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, you agree that it would be very unusual if in June we announced the opinion in your case agreeing with you and then the next case announced that the statute is unconstitutional?"
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1857.852,1858.918,--Agreed.
2009.08-876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.409,1881.8,"Well, just -- just so we -- we know what is -- what is going on here: It is not the case that the Petitioner here has said here that if we adopt his interpretation, it will render the statute constitutional."
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1908.984,1917.14,"--That's probably a fair characterization of language in his brief, but it does bear note that he never asked this Court to decide that question."
2009.08-876,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1952.496,1960.919,How could it have been a term of art when the courts -- the lower courts were massively confused?
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1960.919,1969.108,"--Justice Ginsburg, I think the description of the lower courts as massively confused is not correct."
2009.08-876,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1971.241,1975.195,"Well, there wasn't even a uniform terminology in the lower courts."
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1977.631,1982.432,All of the lower courts used essential synonyms for what Congress sought to reinstate.
2009.08-876,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1996.092,2008.666,"Now, as I hear that -- I am exaggerating, possibly, but I think every agent has a duty of loyalty to provide loyal and honest services to the master, master agent."
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2077.408,2083.479,"Justice Breyer, I hope you give me a moment to explain my theory of the statute in response to your question."
2009.08-876,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2118.019,2125.556,So is that -- does the right to intangible services refer to an obligation that is legal or moral?
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2125.556,2127.108,"--Legal, Your Honor."
2009.08-876,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2127.108,2128.608,Only -- only legal?
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2155.527,2158.479,"Let me make two points in response to that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2184.445,2201.723,--Then what's the source -- and I think that's inherent in the Chief Justice's question -- what is it -- where did he draw the line and where do we go to look to where you draw the line on what information needs to be disclosed?
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2215.816,2221.903,"--The line is personal conflicting financial interests of the individual, which--"
2009.08-876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2221.903,2223.17,So you are talking about private gain?
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2228.456,2230.742,--I prefer not to address the Skilling case until that has been briefed.
2009.08-876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2230.742,2240.198,"--No, but that's -- you have to, because you have to tell us what draws -- you have to give us the source or some source of limiting, of limitation."
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2242.198,2243.75,"I'm trying to do that, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-876,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2255.124,2273.419,"Now this -- I'm just getting a label, and as I hear you talk, I think it's not what you necessarily -- I found in the brief, or didn't understand it from the brief -- but I found precisely what you said, it seems to me in what I have labeled Altshuler alternative B, does that ring a bell?"
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2273.419,2276.887,"--Well, I don't know what Professor Altshuler's alternative B was."
2009.08-876,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2276.887,2277.337,"Yes, yes."
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2295.799,2296.932,I would not have--
2009.08-876,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.932,2300.183,Now I just heard what you said and it sounded like the same thing.
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2300.183,2303.885,--It's not the same thing and I think this goes back--
2009.08-876,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2303.885,2305.235,It is not causing economic harm.
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2305.235,2311.555,--Not causing economic harm because there are instances where important fiduciary relationships are breached personally.
2009.08-876,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2325.231,2326.114,So what about my racing form?
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2328.5,2338.641,--That -- that is -- implicates a -- one of the two important limiting principles on this statute which is materiality and intent to defraud.
2009.08-876,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2346.161,2346.928,Different matter.
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2391.739,2400.177,"--Justice Breyer, the point that I was making is that this statute does not establish a free-floating federal crime based on a breach of a trivial duty."

2009.08-876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2427.462,2428.262,What becomes important?
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2428.262,2429.864,--The issue of materiality--
2009.08-876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2429.864,2437.368,That the -- for an auditor on April 14th his guy -- or April 1st his employee goes off to a ball game?

2009.08-876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2458.531,2460.883,But the Second Circuit said economic loss--
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2460.883,2461.9,--No--
2009.08-876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2461.9,2464.152,--that there has to be the risk of economic loss--
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2464.152,2464.568,--With all respect--
2009.08-876,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2464.568,2465.768,--in the private sector.
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2465.768,2483.563,"--Justice Sotomayor, the Second Circuit in its Rybicki opinion in the en banc opinion did not say that, nor I think is it fair to say that the Second Circuit had ever said that economic loss was an element of an intangible rights fraud, either pre-McNally or post-McNally."
2009.08-876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.563,2487.364,"What is -- I mean, I'm still waiting to hear what materiality consists."
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2489.947,2505.842,"Materiality, Justice Scalia, it takes the classic definition of your opinions for the Court in Kungis and Gaudin as reasonably likely to affect the decision of the body to whom the statement is made."
2009.08-876,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2505.842,2511.479,"So if the employee would be fired if defalcation had come to light, that's material?"
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2511.479,2514.681,If the government proves that it would be.
2009.08-876,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2515.614,2516.947,"All right, that's the ball game."

2009.08-876,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2517.18,2517.764,Then that's the ball game.
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2520.482,2521.684,"--No, it's not the ball game."
2009.08-876,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2521.684,2524.251,"--The employer finds out about it, he fires -- so it's material because you would be fired for it."

2009.08-876,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2528.553,2530.821,I'm asking about just materiality.
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2541.861,2557.555,"I'll -- I agree, Justice Kennedy, and I intend to answer that question, but I think that it is fair to say, for me that by acknowledging that something can be material if the employer would take different action does not mean that everything that the employee does is a crime."
2009.08-876,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2564.542,2567.828,He drives to the ball game in the government -- in the company car.

2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2610.107,2632.203,"--It is related to it, Justice Ginsburg, in that in a business setting materiality will be in most cases coextensive with economic harm at least if economic harm is conceived as I conceive it, and as the cases have conceived of it as extending to things like harm to reputation that will interfere with a business's ability to go forward."
2009.08-876,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2632.203,2634.638,--But it -- it doesn't answer the racing form case.

2009.08-876,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2813.754,2818.841,And I think in going beyond that is the paradigm case of -- of moonlighting?
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2818.841,2821.325,"--No, it's not."

2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3067.794,3097.415,"--No, but it, in fact, did have one, and the reason that it had one, even though this Court held that the mail fraud statute did not protect the deprivation of intangible rights, there was, nonetheless, at the heart of the pre-McNally cases, a substratum of a universal common law rule of fiduciary duties and agency that has, as an undisputed and not at all vague core, that agents can't engage in undisclosed self-dealing."
2009.08-876,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3098.331,3102.367,"Now, kickbacks and -- and bribes is clear."

2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3178.798,3193.057,"--The right refers, Mr. Chief Justice, to the acknowledgment that there was a common law fiduciary duty that was assimilated into the law of fraud, really, beyond dispute."
2009.08-876,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3193.874,3197.176,So the point -- I guess maybe this is -- maybe I asked you this before.
2009.08-876,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3206.115,3209.167,"--No, it certainly is not, Mr. Chief Justice."
