1970.30,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.057,"-- Number 30, United States against Harris."
1970.30,0,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,33.076,36.173,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,91.841,97.267,Is it clear and do we know in this case that the informant that had not given information in the past?
1970.30,0,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,97.267,112.859,"Oh, we don’t know, except that considering – there are many, many cases in which reliability is placed on the fact that this -- I have now received information from an informant who has given information in the past."
1970.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,118.453,119.087,"Well, --"
1970.30,0,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,119.087,119.365,The absence --
1970.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,119.365,122.291,"-- if it's not for you, it’s not necessarily hard for me believe that, is it?"
1970.30,0,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,122.291,124.424,Pardon?
1970.30,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,124.424,132.183,"Well, do you think it follows from what we do know on the record in this case that we have here clearly an informant who would not given information in the past?"
1970.30,0,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,132.183,152.376,"Yes, because I may have extremely careless operator, I don’t know, but that -- the fact is that if one goes to the cases since -- particularly since Spinelli, but since McCray against Illinois, it was case after case in which it’s almost a formula."
1970.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,187.685,194.571,"Well -- and here, I gather the affidavit identifies the informant as the person, does it?"
1970.30,0,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,194.571,196.229,"And the person, yes."
1970.30,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,196.229,201.211,"Sometimes informant is an electronic surveillance, I suppose?"
1970.30,0,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,201.211,204.974,"I don’t think that’s any problem here, not for the nature of the affidavit."
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,1839.819,1843.304,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1859.026,1860.556,Within the city -- within the city of Middlesborough?
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,1860.556,1861.752,To the best of my knowledge it was.
1970.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1989.611,2001.154,"Suppose the case went up the trial before a jury, and they put on the same informant, would it be up to the Government to prove that he had a good character for truth and veracity?"
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,2001.154,2005.346,"No, it certainly wouldn’t, Your Honor."
1970.30,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2005.346,2013.653,"Suppose this affidavit in the application for search warrant had indeed used the term reliable, trustworthy, --"
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,2013.653,2014.899,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.30,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2023.755,2025.815,"So, that opinion is outstanding on the word prudent?"
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,2025.815,2026.99,"No, I certainly would not."
1970.30,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2033.998,2035.833,And that he was reliable?
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,2035.833,2036.83,"Of course not, Your Honor."
1970.30,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2038.138,2043.817,"Well, you suggest that prudent does negates the idea of reliability?"
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,2043.817,2051.989,"I wouldn’t suggest that negates it but particularly in the informer context, it may well bear a strong inference of unreliability."
1970.30,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2053.033,2054.302,Let me hear that again.
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,2054.302,2059.235,In the informer context the word prudent may bear a strong inference of unreliability.
1970.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2132.631,2141.485,"Would that same argument not apply, if the man was on the trial and summoned to jury and jury was before you and you were trying his guilt and innocence?"
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,2141.485,2142.435,"Of course, in the jury --"
1970.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2142.435,2144.82,And that might put him up as witness?
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,2144.82,2147.437,"It indeed would but in the jury context, there’s a fair --"
1970.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2147.437,2153.025,"Well, do the jury have a right to assume, he was a man of bad character?"
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,2153.025,2154.374,No.
1970.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2156.46,2159.3,The preliminary proceeding of getting a search warrant.
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,2159.3,2159.921,Excuse me.
1970.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2160.702,2165.502,It would in the preliminary proceeding of getting a search warrant but not in the acts of trial --
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,2165.502,2170.531,"No, I wouldn’t suggest that the magistrate should necessarily presume on reliability in this case."
1970.30,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2206.191,2218.59,The word prudent in the context of this statement may have a connection with the fact that the informant feared for his life or property and he was being very prudent in --
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,2218.59,2219.384,Certainly --
1970.30,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2219.384,2221.132,-- not revealing his name and so on.
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,2226.485,2227.468,That certainly --
1970.30,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2227.468,2230.756,And it had nothing to do with reliability or not?
1970.30,1,42193,steven_m_umin,,2230.756,2242.113,"That’s the point, I mean, either context to the affidavit and the context of informant behavior generally lends to the word prudence so many connotations that it’s difficult even to settle on a meaning."
