2006.06-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.817,"We'll hear argument next in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus Coke."
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,9.236,13.24,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.956,199.083,"I thought the words were home of the person who employs, not who receives the services but who employs."
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,199.083,200.052,"Oh, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,217.623,222.528,"By... reading out the words ""of the person who employs"" her?"
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,222.528,235.476,"Well, essentially reading them to say they, they were not intended to address directly the subject of third party employment which is the subject addressed in 109(a)."
2006.06-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.554,289.662,"I thought it also addressed, unlike the more general regulation, just people who have companionship services."
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,299.749,300.367,That would be true.
2006.06-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.09,302.691,What's a footman?
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,306.141,311.377,"--I think that may be beyond my expertise, Justice Scalia."
2006.06-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.048,549.053,"Mr. Farr, I'm not sure I followed your argument with regard to 552.101(a)."
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,549.053,549.334,Uh-huh.
2006.06-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.244,554.777,Page 77a as you said.
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,570.067,573.54,"Well perhaps, perhaps I wasn't as clear as I intended to be."
2006.06-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,579.704,580.674,That's right.
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,580.674,595.474,"However, the... the preceding sentence says the term, referring to the term that is at issue in 552.3, domestic service employment, includes persons who are frequently referred to as private household workers."
2006.06-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.886,615.197,Yeah.
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,618.968,623.392,"--In the specific Senate report, in both the '73 and the '74 reports--"
2006.06-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,623.392,626.514,"This, the one that's cited in the regulation itself."
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,632.368,633.578,--What?
2006.06-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,693.047,706.647,I thought that the Department of Labor's first take on this was that the exemption did not apply to third-party employers.
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,710.08,712.013,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,738.881,744.085,I'm referring to the notice and comment rulemaking in which you place great stock.
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,753.83,754.682,"--I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.06-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.26,783.8,"Well, wait."
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,788.335,789.644,"No, it does not."
2006.06-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,789.644,790.776,I didn't think it did.
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,792.847,793.678,That's correct.
2006.06-593,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,793.678,795.378,"--Run it up the flagpole, see if--"
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,795.378,799.041,"Well, that it solicited comments on that proposal."
2006.06-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,808.228,830.483,"And... and there was no further discussion of it after... after it sent out the notice of proposed ruling that said third party employees will not be exempt, and then it said they will be exempt, did it give reasons for the change?"
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,830.483,832.634,"Yes, if I can just... if I can quibble with the premise of the question."
2006.06-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,839.276,845.491,"Some would be the ones that qualified as... what is the phrase, enterprises engaged in commerce?"
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,845.491,850.335,--That's correct... those would be the ones under the proposed rulemaking that would have been denied the exemption.
2006.06-593,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,870.488,877.313,"Mr. Farr, would you agree that the position expressed in the notice itself would have... in the original notice would have been consistent with the statutory language?"
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,877.313,882.705,"I'm not sure of that, Justice Stevens, to be honest with you."
2006.06-593,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,926.784,929.195,Well there would be a basis in terms of the size of the third-party employers.
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,929.195,939.132,"I mean, it's possible, but as I say, the... I mean, among the difficulties that covered enterprises is not just corporations and big and small corporations."
2006.06-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,990.768,997.313,"Were they covered before, before there was any provision that dealt with household workers?"
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1018.314,1022.678,"No, but I think, Justice Ginsburg, the important point is they were not covered prior to 1974."
2006.06-593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1023.657,1026.13,They were not treated as covered enterprises.
2006.06-593,0,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1026.13,1026.611,--That's correct.
2006.06-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1052.477,1054.228,Thank you Mr. Farr.
2006.06-593,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1064.346,1070.888,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.06-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1119.561,1127.074,"So if the Department of Labor had enacted its regulations as originally proposed, those regulations would have been invalid?"
2006.06-593,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1127.074,1129.157,"No, I don't think so, Your Honor."
2006.06-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1200.286,1218.028,"The statute treats together babysitters and elder care people, but I take it the babysitters if they were working for an agency rather than for the householders, there wouldn't be any exemption?"
2006.06-593,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1218.789,1225.192,"That's correct, and that's tied to a specific term that only applies to the exemption as to babysitters."
2006.06-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1259.105,1270.382,"Isn't it odd that this... the basic thing about the '74 legislation, it was going to add to the Fair Labor Standards Act people who were not covered before."
2006.06-593,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1288.284,1309.909,"Well, we think that that is the consequence of the companionship services exemption, but we don't think that's odd based on the Department of Labor's view of what the purpose of that exemption is and based on the textual difference between, for example, the exemption for baby sitting services and the exemption for companionship services."
2006.06-593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.521,1351.156,"Mr. Salmons, can I ask you a question about the importance of the whole litigation."
2006.06-593,1,21494,david_b_salmons,,1367.275,1375.412,"Well, there is a safe harbor provision that allows for reliance by employers on a statement by the agency."
2006.06-593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1375.412,1376.221,"That would clearly apply to this case, would it not?"
2006.06-593,2,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,1376.221,1377.302,We certainly think it would.
2006.06-593,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1396.505,1401.449,So in your view we're really faced with a question of whether the regulation should be given prospective effect.
2006.06-593,3,21494,david_b_salmons,,1401.449,1403.37,I'm sorry?
2006.06-593,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.381,1412.985,As to whether the Government's position should be given prospective effect because the past liability doesn't... the damage liability just doesn't exist.
2006.06-593,3,21494,david_b_salmons,,1412.985,1415.136,"Well, that is our view."
2006.06-593,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1436.982,1439.123,Not seemingly conflicted.
2006.06-593,3,21494,david_b_salmons,,1441.066,1443.339,"Well, I certainly don't take issue with that."
2006.06-593,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1534.929,1536.121,"Thank you, Mr. Salmons."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1541.193,1543.857,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1629.591,1631.824,Was that later?
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1631.824,1633.986,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1633.986,1635.208,How much later?
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1635.208,1639.688,The final regulations were promulgated in February of 2005.
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1639.688,1640.199,"No, no."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1655.129,1655.91,"No, no, Your Honor."
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1662.393,1663.975,"I mean, you read--"
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1663.975,1665.175,In the final regulations.
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1665.175,1668.577,--You read 3 and 3 says what you said it says.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1672.311,1675.823,That was in the final regulations in February of 75.
2006.06-593,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1675.823,1677.022,The same time that--
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1680.125,1680.996,That's correct.
2006.06-593,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1680.996,1681.907,"They came out together, right?"
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1681.907,1682.698,That's correct.
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1682.698,1683.467,That's what I thought.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1694.165,1694.826,That's correct.
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1695.577,1695.868,All right.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1726.007,1738.596,"Your Honor, the definitional regulation, 552.3, explicitly defines a term used only in the companionship services exemption, ""domestic service employment""."
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1773.579,1788.129,"Did Congress intend to cover, which I guess is a growing situation, that there is an old woman or man and they're very sick and they live in their house, there's only one way to keep them from having to go to an institution."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1794.583,1801.496,"Your Honor, that question has been posed by some of the amici and it is a good question, but not the question before you."
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1801.496,1801.887,Because?
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1801.887,1821.929,"And I submit that if the Department construed section 552.3 to say when our words say ""employed by the household"" that could include a broader notion of the household, for example a son or daughter living outside the household, that might be a permissible construction of the Department's own regulation."
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1824.601,1825.272,It doesn't say that.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1905.975,1910.727,--It's a very important question of public policy and therefore let me answer in two ways.
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1939.536,1948.101,"It wouldn't take a whole lot of imagination for Justice Breyer to give the money to his mother, who could then hire."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1948.101,1949.493,Exactly.
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1949.493,1952.075,"I mean, a clever lawyer would think of that, I think."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1952.305,1954.496,A clever lawyer could do this.
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1954.496,1960.152,"And perhaps there are people, lawyers in the Government, who try to see through that kind of thing."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1960.152,1960.96,But let me answer the second--
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1960.96,1963.762,And there are many... maybe Justice Scalia has the answer.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,1963.762,1967.475,--Let me answer a second way to what is a serious concern.
2006.06-593,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1999.508,2002.988,You're saying it's permissible to change the rules because the industry has changed.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2012.836,2016.987,"As an empirical matter, that is clearly the case, Justice Stevens."
2006.06-593,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2080.15,2091.467,"How... putting aside... putting 552.109 aside, how is 552.3 a plausible interpretation of the statute?"
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2091.467,2097.371,"Your Honor, we think it is the most plausible interpretation for the following reasons:"
2006.06-593,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2153.75,2161.375,What employment would someone who's hired by a third party be engaged in if not domestic service employment?
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2161.375,2171.773,"--The word domestic service employment is not necessary to describe what you described, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2179.446,2181.227,"Well, it could have said a lot of things."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2203.853,2204.864,Your Honor--
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.864,2213.039,You're saying we have to find some difference no matter how imaginative the difference might be.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2216.641,2222.433,--What I'm suggesting is not that our case relies or hangs on that word.
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2251.932,2263.012,"Can I ask you what your proposal is with regard to the contradictory regulations, 552.3 and 552."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2290.558,2295.312,"My solution, Your Honor, has two parts but leads to the same conclusion."
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2331.676,2332.958,What's your other reason?
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2332.958,2338.291,"--It is the only definition which makes sense, which doesn't lead to a whole series of problems."
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2338.291,2341.374,Because of employed and domestic employment versus--
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2341.374,2341.884,For--
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2341.884,2343.364,--domestic service?
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2343.364,2345.067,"--For the following five reasons, Your Honor."
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2389.355,2394.148,"Well, you're getting into arguments now that are not about the regulation but they're about the statute."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2439.738,2447.723,"--Your Honor, of course setting aside, as you do, our argument that Congress has specific intent on this question, looking only at the regulation--"
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2447.723,2448.003,That's statutory.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2450.475,2452.085,--Let me answer in several ways.
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2464.314,2465.996,--They aren't unambiguous.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2484.936,2487.009,"--Again, for two reasons, Your Honor."
2006.06-593,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2520.009,2527.074,"But if they're flatly contradictory, doesn't your argument have to be that 109(a) has lesser status?"
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2528.905,2545.037,"That is certainly my primary argument, that this statute is relatively unique in that it vested two very different sorts of authority in the Department of Labor, one a clear law making authority to actually define and delimit, to specify what the terms in the law mean--"
2006.06-593,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2545.037,2554.073,I'm talking about what you think the Department of Labor was doing when it promulgated 109(a).
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2590.227,2595.039,"--Your Honor, it not only makes sense, it's been the Department's pattern since the Act was adopted."
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2620.555,2634.216,"Yeah, but interpretive regulations are in other areas wholly valid before the courts and entitled to Chevron deference, at least if they're adopted by notice and comment rulemaking."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2646.951,2651.245,"The important difference here, Justice Scalia, is the statute."
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2662.562,2672.54,"I understand that you say it creates two types, but there is no indication that it intended one type of authority to be entitled to less respect from the courts than the other."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2673.92,2674.601,--Your Honor--
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2674.601,2683.015,Where is the proposition that an interpretive regulation is somehow not a full-fledged binding regulation?
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2683.015,2685.687,"--Well, let me qualify the question, if I might."
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2727.125,2734.951,They're different but not necessarily of different... entitled to different respect from the courts.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2771.934,2780.5,"Well, Your Honor, I think we can safely assume in 1974 when Congress created these two types of authority, it did so with knowledge of the law."
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2824.468,2828.511,Skidmore was before a rather significant case called Chevron.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2828.511,2830.001,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2006.06-593,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2846.583,2873.89,"You mean we're going to divide all administrative law now into those... those regulations... those provisions that were adopted by Congress pre-Chevron and those adopted by Congress post-Chevron, and for the ones adopted pre-Chevron we're going to treat regulation as essentially suggestions by the agency which we give Skidmore deference to, and the ones after Chevron, we're going to treat differently."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2880.555,2883.229,"Let me answer in two ways, Your Honor."
2006.06-593,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2888.915,2889.483,Ought not to get as much deference from the courts.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2889.483,2903.404,"--Here we have a case essentially described by Justice Kennedy in Haga, where we have a different statutory scheme combined with a explicit statement by the Agency as to which part of that scheme the Agency is operating under."
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2907.497,2924.117,"Since we're into that, we're into this fascinating subject, I thought that possibly they had... they promulgated the whole thing pursuant to the rulemaking power under that particular statute, because that's what it says in 552.2."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2963.665,2971.079,"--Well, I think the question, Your Honor, is which of the regulations were promulgated pursuant to the specific authority--"
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2971.079,2971.6,All of them.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,2973.912,2984.848,"--Well, I think what you missed is that a simple citation to the exemption does not translate into an exercise of the power to define and delimit."
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3015.837,3016.158,Okay.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,3016.569,3017.961,But part B is different.
2006.06-593,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3017.961,3018.989,Right.
2006.06-593,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3018.989,3022.181,So why are you sure there's a conflict in the first place?
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,3040.994,3043.345,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2006.06-593,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3045.556,3047.359,It's not the way the Agency has done it.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,3050.171,3051.072,--That's correct.
2006.06-593,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3061.308,3063.969,"Yeah, but it says it refers to something."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,3080.211,3084.061,"Well, I think we have to read the definitional regulations together."
2006.06-593,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3107.597,3110.842,"Well it is interesting when you look at... I mean, they're... it's a good point."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,3138.619,3140.98,"--I do not believe so, Your Honor."
2006.06-593,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3170.71,3171.17,Mr. Becker--
2006.06-593,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3171.17,3173.821,There it says... there it says includes.
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,3182.417,3204.924,"--I'm referring to an earlier provision of the same regulation, not the reference to private household workers, but where it states that the definition includes those individuals who are employed by the household, that is in 552.101(a)."
2006.06-593,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3233.071,3279.821,"--Mr.... Mr. Becker, if there is room for the Agency to read this statute either way, one way that the third party employee would come under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the other that they would not, would be treated the same way as the person employed by the elderly person himself or herself, but if the concern of Congress in making this exemption was for the householder with limited funds, if the Agency is subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, it's going to end up being the householder paying for it anyway."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,3292.99,3311.631,"Your Honor, setting aside, of course, all the reasons about Congress's intent in 552.3 which we've already explained, we would not say that that there is any credible evidence in the legislative history or the text of the Act to suggest that cost was a factor."
2006.06-593,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3386.094,3387.133,"Thank you, Counsel."
2006.06-593,4,26575,harold_c_becker,,3387.133,3388.725,--and a full-time babysitter is not covered.
2006.06-593,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3389.777,3393.398,"Mr. Farr, you have three minutes remaining."
2006.06-593,5,27019,h_bartow_farr_iii,,3393.398,3395.511,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
2006.06-593,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3555.568,3556.709,"Thank you, Counsel."
