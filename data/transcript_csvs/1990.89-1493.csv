1990.89-1493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.219,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-1493, the Air Line Pilots Association, International v. Joseph O'Neill."
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,12.93,22.325,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.092,217.023,Call the what award?
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,217.744,218.445,Order and Award.
1990.89-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.456,330.916,--[inaudible] statutory.
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,330.916,331.477,--Yes.
1990.89-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,345.797,346.827,But not arbitrariness?
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,346.827,354.631,--Not arbitrariness in the sense that the court of appeals understood arbitrariness.
1990.89-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,463.224,468.027,But would you think that that was within the district court's finding that the union got the best deal it could?
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,468.027,468.548,--Yes.
1990.89-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.548,472.719,"Including no deal, in effect... just abandoning the strike?"
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,475.012,493.453,"The... well, we believe that the court of appeals' opinions said that the union proceeded on an honest, good-faith determination that this was the best way to proceed and that that satisfied the standard."
1990.89-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.9,523.062,The best way to proceed taking into account what?
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,535.12,535.54,The--
1990.89-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.54,538.503,Is that part of the factor that the union was allowed to take into account?
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,538.503,572.666,"--As we understand the court of appeals' decision, the host of uncertainties and the nature of the factors that are to... I'm sorry, the role of the host of uncertainties that the union and the striking pilots faced and the calculus of factors that are to be taken into account are both disregarded."
1990.89-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.483,590.696,"Well, what do you think for purposes of a good-faith test which you are urging?"
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,612.611,643.242,"Well, it seems to us that if we reach that point, and there does not seem in this case to be any evidence opposing that conundrum, that the union is entitled to take into account the... the total situation of the pilots."
1990.89-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,649.146,650.846,To sacrifice the members of this bargaining--
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,650.846,651.177,--Well--
1990.89-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,651.177,653.829,--unit for the benefit of members of other bargaining units.
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,653.829,655.959,"--With all deference, that isn't what I said."
1990.89-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.959,660.173,"Well, no, I'm... well, it's the way I would put it."
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,662.464,663.646,"No, I--"
1990.89-1493,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,663.646,665.296,"--I mean, it's like the word sacrifice."
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,699.617,707.183,--I think the union can take into account the total labor market situation.
1990.89-1493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,875.983,881.617,"Mr. Gold, the court of appeals used the word ""arbitrary""."
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,889.291,892.163,We believe that they misunderstood the meaning of the word arbitrary.
1990.89-1493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1002.916,1005.367,"Well, Mr. Gold, that was going to be my question."
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1021.627,1035.088,"No, the essence of our argument is that this duty doesn't create a liability for honest mistakes, so--"
1990.89-1493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1035.088,1046.733,"So we're talking here about a standard that applies across the board, administration of the contract, grievances, routine procedures, as well as the more complex context of conducting bargaining?"
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1046.733,1054.629,"--Well, we make three different arguments in support of our position that the court of appeals was wrong here."
1990.89-1493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1144.399,1157.028,"Well, I... on duty of care, you'll recall from the Rawson case where the union allegedly negligently contributed to the death of mine workers, we said that the union could not be sued under State law."
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1165.723,1166.181,"Well, basically--"
1990.89-1493,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1166.181,1173.167,"--I know of no parallel in all of the law, other than for sovereign immunity, which gives an immunity that tests... is that extensive."
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1173.167,1190.018,"--The... as we understand Rawson, Justice Kennedy, the Court also said that a negligence claim would not be actionable under the duty of fair representation."
1990.89-1493,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1210.931,1234.336,"Mr. Gold, I had really thought that our cases had spoken in terms of a reasonableness component to the arbitrary standard here and that you would have us read that out of the standard and limit it to negotiations or actions taken in bad faith or with hostility."
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1254.321,1260.485,"--Well, if I can, there are two things I'd like to say about that."
1990.89-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1404.889,1408.71,"You don't suggest that fairness has any part of it, do you?"
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1408.71,1412.744,"--Well, fairness in the sense of--"
1990.89-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1412.744,1414.374,Is it [inaudible]--
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1414.374,1417.436,"--a duty of loyalty, fairness in the sense of--"
1990.89-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1417.436,1421.399,"--I know, but you sounded like you were saying substantively it was fair."
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1421.399,1425.313,--You mean--
1990.89-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.313,1428.244,The terms agreed upon were fair.
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1428.244,1430.826,--We believe that we can meet--
1990.89-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1430.826,1431.795,"I know, but you don't--"
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1431.795,1433.387,"--that standard, but we're--"
1990.89-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1433.387,1436.54,--You mean judges are supposed to decide whether they were fair or not?
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1436.54,1436.81,"--Well, no."
1990.89-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.75,1467.779,"Oh, it... you don't really... you've been living... the unions have been living with this Vaca standard for a long time, and I have noticed in all the cases that come around here that you've been really hurt very much by that element in it."
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1488.532,1501.091,"Well, that is... that is certainly not the view... the view you just stated is certainly not the view of Vaca that the Fifth Circuit in embraced in this case."
1990.89-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1501.091,1502.831,That may be.
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1510.208,1521.595,We have been living with a regime which is going to end with this case one way or another in which different courts have taken different views.
1990.89-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.845,1541.297,Does the Seventh Circuit go right across the board with this test?
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1541.297,1550.553,"--It had up until the Thomas case, when it appeared to draw a distinction between negotiation and nonnegotiation."
1990.89-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1550.553,1551.464,"Well, that's the last case, isn't it?"
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1551.464,1552.546,I--
1990.89-1493,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.546,1553.235,In the Seventh Circuit?
1990.89-1493,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1553.235,1561.89,"--I believe there is subsequent case which could be fairly read to go back the other way, but I'm not positive."
1990.89-1493,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1566.214,1567.964,"Very well, Mr. Gold."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1569.917,1573.269,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1646.467,1655.924,"What do you think the word ""arbitrary"" suggests to courts of appeals?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1663.898,1667.952,"--Your Honor, I don't think it's that complicated at all."
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.952,1671.512,xxx not answering my question--
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1671.512,1681.559,"What arbitrary means I believe, Your Honor, is simply the question as to whether a reasoned decision was needed and whether a reasoned decision was made."
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.611,1693.077,"--The court is permitted to say, well, we wouldn't have done it this way because we don't think it was reasonable?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1693.077,1694.419,"--Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1696.569,1697.751,What are they... what should they say then?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1697.751,1717.102,"--They should look at the decision, Your Honor, and try to find out and look at what the relevant factors were that the union officials considered in making a decision and then determine if the decision was based upon an in fact consideration of those factors."
1990.89-1493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1727.029,1728.79,How's that any different than negligence?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1728.79,1731.021,"--It's a higher standard, Your Honor, than negligence."
1990.89-1493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1731.021,1732.012,"Well, you say so."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1741.009,1761.271,"You have to look at the factors, Your Honor, that went into the conduct that the union followed and look at the actual circumstances that were taken into consideration which were going to be numerous, and then balance to see if the decision was made based upon a rational consideration of those factors."
1990.89-1493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1761.271,1761.682,Because--
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1761.682,1765.856,That's a higher standard than simply breaching the... breaching a duty or a negligence.
1990.89-1493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1765.856,1769.396,"--Well, it may not have a community standard of care component."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1773.881,1792.293,"Those are difficult items to distinguish, Your Honor, and what we are dealing with is a continuum of arbitrariness, and there comes a point in time like in the Rawson case where this Court has decided that an allegation based upon pure negligence is not sufficient to staying a breach of duty of fair representation."
1990.89-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1807.5,1816.807,"Mr. Harper, would you standard require detailed examination of how the union officials went about reaching this agreement?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1828.855,1851.81,"Mr. Chief Justice, it would require the plaintiffs in this type of situation to identify as best they can through discovery and the trial the factors that were actually in fact considered by the union negotiators or the union officials when they made a decision and then would have to go step further to demonstrate whether or not the decision was based upon a consideration of those factors."
1990.89-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.709,1872.073,"What if a court reviewing the union's conduct feels, yes, the union considers all... considered all the factors that it said it was going to consider."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1876.646,1891.967,"Your Honor, the court does not substitute as judgment for that and if you go back to the case here, the O'Neill case, and look at the basis upon which the Fifth Circuit rendered its opinion, which is the Tedford opinion, you will find exactly that sort of analysis in the Tedford opinion."
1990.89-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1915.252,1920.585,And if a court says we see a factor we think the union should have considered.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1926.329,1929.421,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1929.421,1931.482,But it's a possibility?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1931.482,1940.999,"The trier of fact may find that in the totality of the circumstances, the union didn't act rationally or reasonably in going about the decision that it made."
1990.89-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1952.096,1958.419,"But of course if you say the union didn't act reasonably, that isn't far from a negligence standard, is it?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1958.419,1963.903,"Under some circumstances, Your Honor, in this area it... the line starts to fuzz."
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1965.124,1976.712,"Well, you could... could you live with a standard that says that the court should ask if any rational union negotiator could possibly have come to this conclusion?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1976.712,1978.673,--We're not--
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.673,1985.287,Which is certainly more a... that's a... that gives them a lot more room than insisting that they have to be reasonable.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,1985.287,2003.379,"--Your Honor, all we are are... our position is that all we need to have is an obligation upon these union officials to consider relevant facts and make a decision based upon those."
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2003.379,2022.761,"Well, if a union... if the court thinks a... that there are factors a union... they think the union didn't consider, shouldn't they also ask, well, would any rational person... could any rational person have put those factors aside?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2022.761,2030.608,That's a relevant consideration when you evaluate at the trial level the conduct of the union.
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2056.264,2060.297,"Mr. Harper, the word arbitrary is not a... really a new one for us."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2087.085,2089.485,"I think it's very close to that, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2113.042,2116.564,And a court may think it's wrong but still not think that it's arbitrary.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2116.564,2117.853,"Absolutely, Your Honor--"
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2117.853,2118.333,I see.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2118.333,2120.855,--if in fact the decision has considered relevant factors.
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2143.811,2149.436,Do you think the Fifth Circuit was true to that position?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2149.436,2151.678,"I think it absolutely was, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2161.023,2163.304,There was a triable issue of fact about arbitrariness.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2163.304,2164.364,--And--
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.364,2165.355,And about discrimination.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2165.355,2166.146,--And discriminatory.
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2175.202,2183.428,"Whether there was enough evidence in the record that somebody could have concluded that it was arbitrary, defined in the right way."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2183.428,2185.889,"That's correct and we haven't gotten there yet, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2196.157,2204.471,"Mr. Harper, is there a genuine issue of material fact here as to whether the union acted in bad faith?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2204.471,2215.638,"Your Evidence, there's evidence in the record and inferences that can be drawn from the evidence in the record at this particular time that in fact the union did act in bad faith."
1990.89-1493,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2222.534,2229.607,Did the Fifth Circuit review the evidence with an eye toward the bad-faith allegation?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2229.607,2244.405,"--It does not appear from the record, Your Honor, that the court did that, but I don't think that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal purported to look at all of the items of conduct that this union engaged in and to make a conclusive decision on all elements at the summary judgment level."
1990.89-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.405,2247.397,"Mr. Harper, may I ask you two questions?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2261.64,2266.482,"If that was the only judgment, Your Honor, that was involved in this case, then the answer would be yes."
1990.89-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2266.482,2270.583,So it's not critical for us to decide whether this was a worse deal than a return to--
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2270.583,2271.464,Absolutely not.
1990.89-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2271.464,2274.046,--But it is critical to decide whether they considered it.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2284.272,2305.548,"Your Honor, based upon the record as we developed it through deposition testimony and through the gleaning of notes and records that the negotiators that we were entitled to depose, they did not consider at that critical point in time the unconditional offer to return to work."
1990.89-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2307.819,2317.386,But I'm asking you do you say that because there's a failure of... in absence of any evidence showing they did discuss it or is there evidence of an admission that they did not discuss it?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2317.837,2322.167,--There's evidence of the admission that they did not consider it at this point... at the point in time.
1990.89-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2322.167,2322.327,I see.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2323.739,2332.894,"Yes, we do, Your Honor, through the attachments, and it's probably set forth in a little bit more detail in connection with a motion for reconsideration."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2332.894,2338.417,"And I'd like to point out for the Justice that, you know, our discovery got stopped along the way."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2358.092,2359.191,"No, we don't, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2359.191,2359.511,I see.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2359.511,2361.384,But in fact it is.
1990.89-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2362.984,2365.164,But we don't have to resolve that in order to decide this case.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2365.164,2366.406,"Not at this... not at this level, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2366.786,2382.558,"Mr. Harper, are you saying that in affirming the result below as you want us to do, we could do so consistently with your position and still repudiate the second of the factors which the court of appeals considered?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2411.366,2418.032,We are not claiming and our position is that we have to focus on the result.
1990.89-1493,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2425.385,2425.676,But if--
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2425.676,2432.971,"--and the result is only evidence, Your Honor, of the conduct that the union negotiators engaged in."
1990.89-1493,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2432.971,2438.235,"--Well, then I guess I'm having the same trouble then that I think has been expressed earlier in this argument."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2463.26,2464.081,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2464.081,2485.715,"And are you satisfied... going back to Justice White's question, would you be satisfied if the Court stopped at saying this is one possible result within the realm of reasonableness so that if that test were satisfied, that would be the extent of the Court's scrutiny?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2485.715,2501.124,"And if it's one possible result based upon a... the analysis that we have urged the Court, and if the... that determination then is that it's nonarbitrary because of the process that went through, then the results would be okay."
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2501.124,2504.596,But that involves more than just considering all the factors.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2524.211,2525.57,"The two choice, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.57,2525.991,--Yes.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2530.973,2550.338,"That... you can, Your Honor, and that's why I think that there's more to it in the duty of fair representation, because there are... in contexts like this, there are a number of things that the union negotiators are going to take into consideration in arriving at the conclusion that they arrive at."
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2555.751,2558.733,Can I ask you the same question I asked Mr. Gold?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2573.361,2587.38,"The union, Your Honor, has a duty to represent under the Railway Labor Act the members of this craft or class, and their conduct has to be a... on behalf and the benefit for the craft or class."
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2589.481,2590.913,But that's not just the bargaining unit.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2594.567,2601.99,"--In this case, Your Honor, the craft or class were the Continental pilots at Continental Air Lines."
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2601.99,2605.242,Not pilots at large in other airlines as well?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2605.242,2607.182,"And what the problem is, Your Honor--"
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2607.182,2607.603,"Well, I--"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2607.603,2610.534,"--if you go beyond the class or craft, you're--"
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2610.534,2611.846,--Let's make it clear what I'm asking you.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2639.815,2663.479,"--It may not be, Your Honor, because the problem with that is that that craft or class becomes a minority group within a larger class, and they run the risk, if they don't have this broad duty of fair representation, of being treated very badly in a discriminatory and arbitrary way by the union."
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.479,2671.988,So you say the reasonable factors that can be taken into account are only factors relating to the particular bargaining unit to which the negotiations pertain?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2671.988,2680.142,And what benefits them and what the union needs to do on their behalf in the context of that particular representation.
1990.89-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2680.142,2698.625,"The union cannot make a sort of command decision, saying we realize we're not doing very well by the Continental pilots and we could do better, but the long-run interest of the airline pilots we represent with all the other airlines would be served by this deal that doesn't do very well for Continental?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2698.625,2707.451,"Those are considerations that the union might take into consideration, Your Honor, with respect to representing the craft or class--"
1990.89-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2707.451,2707.698,"Well, but it's--"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2707.698,2708.71,--but they can't override.
1990.89-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2708.71,2712.903,--I think you can give a better... give a yes or no answer to something like that.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2717.596,2720.067,"I don't intend to be nebulous at all, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2731.854,2733.716,"Well, okay, but answer a hypothetical question."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2760.563,2767.729,"Not to the detriment of the craft or class that they're representing, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2767.729,2774.093,"Well, but that doesn't... I think you could answer the question yes or no and then explain if you want to."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2780.708,2784.158,"And then that conduct, Your Honor, could be made."
1990.89-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2803.863,2809.846,"You say it could be arbitrary, but is it as a matter of law arbitrary when they rely on the factors the Chief Justice described?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2809.846,2812.377,"I would say no, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2812.377,2813.699,It's not arbitrary?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2813.699,2820.823,Let me... it would... I'm sorry... if they put the national interest above?
1990.89-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2820.823,2821.354,Yes.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2821.354,2823.123,It would be arbitrary conduct.
1990.89-1493,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2823.123,2824.726,As a matter of law in every case?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2824.726,2826.106,Uh--
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2826.106,2834.083,"Counsel, do you... do you think the court of appeals applied the test they set down in the Tedford case?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2834.083,2835.493,"--Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.493,2857.996,"Well, that test is a three-part test that says to be nonarbitrary the decision must be based upon relevant, permissible union factors; second, a rational result of the consideration of these factors; and three, and inclusive of a fair and impartial consideration of the interests of all employees."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2865.993,2868.184,In some regard they have to--
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2868.184,2885.876,"Well, this is... what the Tedford test is, and that's what the court of appeals applied so they have a free wheeling... they can just decide whether it's fair or not, is that it?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2886.918,2888.067,--No.
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2905.848,2922.841,"Well, literally, this test means that the union... even if the union took... considered all relevant factors and gave rational consideration to it, nevertheless, they might be unfair, an unfair result."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2922.841,2942.793,"In this case, the result... I don't know if it's unfair, Your Honor, but it has been characterized by the chief pilot negotiator as beyond what was reasonable, has been characterized by him as bastardizing forever the seniority system, and has been characterized by the district court as being atrocious."
1990.89-1493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2950.658,2955.991,I take it you have a right to jury trial under that Terry case?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2955.991,2957.173,"Yes, Your Honor, as a result of the Terry opinion."
1990.89-1493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2957.173,2965.138,"Then reasoning backwards, I suppose it helps your position that we have to have a standard that manageable for the jury."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2965.138,2966.279,Absolutely.
1990.89-1493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2967.739,2970.86,"It's backwards reasoning, but I think perhaps we're compelled to engage in it."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,2970.86,2989.704,"--And that's all that... what happens, Your Honor, in cases like suits against fiduciaries, trustees, officers and directors of a corporation, or governmental agents, you have to be able to describe for the jury or the trier of fact where the conduct crosses the line."
1990.89-1493,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2991.194,3003.412,I don't know that a jury could manageably consider an APA-type... Administrative Procedure Act-type of standard as to whether or not they... the unit acted rationally.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,3005.593,3023.466,"--Justice Kennedy, the jury is capable though of making key decisions in antitrust, securities, breach of contract suits, and Justice Stevens has mentioned just last term that the reality of the employment relations are typical grist for a jury judgment."
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3045.38,3050.353,"Mr. Harper, before you do that, let me get... this relates to what the Chief Justice was asking you about."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,3053.764,3054.375,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3054.375,3066.694,"Now, I can understand why a nonunion member might have a cause for feeling aggrieved if the union didn't take it into account, exclusively the interest of his bargaining unit."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,3080.823,3081.695,That's correct.
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3081.695,3082.713,Just a special union for Continental.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,3096.793,3104.788,"They're going to bargain on behalf of the craft, Your Honor, and that the craft's interest has to come ahead of the national interest of the--"
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3104.788,3108.181,"But they have obligations... they have obligations to these other units as well, don't they?"
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,3108.181,3109.391,--Absolutely.
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3109.391,3111.814,Can they settle this one to the detriment of the other ones?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,3111.814,3114.784,"No, Your Honor, they cannot do that."
1990.89-1493,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3114.784,3117.906,They can't do that and yet they can't take it into account either.
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,3117.906,3118.517,I'm sorry.
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3124.482,3128.204,"They could if they had a multiemployer bargaining unit, but they do not."
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,3128.204,3129.834,"We do not have that here, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.54,3228.88,Could I ask you... do you read the court of appeals' opinion as saying that the... that there's evidence of discrimination as an independent reason for reversing the district court?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,3228.88,3230.53,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.89-1493,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3251.344,3253.347,What do you think discrimination means in that sense?
1990.89-1493,1,36056,marty_harper,,3261.601,3274.509,It's conduct that is not based upon the best interest of the unit and disadvantages an individual or a group within the unit.
1990.89-1493,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3310.292,3311.144,"Thank you, Mr. Harper."
1990.89-1493,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3313.544,3315.695,"Thank you, Chief Justice."
1990.89-1493,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3363.897,3365.61,Is this on the discrimination point?
1990.89-1493,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3365.61,3372.052,It is on both the arbitrariness of the settlement and on the discrimination point.
1990.89-1493,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3387.182,3388.644,"What case last year, Mr. Gold?"
1990.89-1493,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3388.644,3392.625,--Trans World Air Lines v. Flight Attendants.
1990.89-1493,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3395.528,3396.619,But what did the district court assume on that point?
1990.89-1493,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3402.353,3402.654,--Yes.
1990.89-1493,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.654,3406.357,"Well, is it entitled to do that on a motion for summary judgment?"
1990.89-1493,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3406.357,3408.287,I don't think it assumed it.
1990.89-1493,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3429.661,3431.402,"But that was controverted, wasn't it?"
1990.89-1493,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3437.015,3452.656,--But are we going to be in a position where the certainty of the law is to depend on whether a jury says that a single district court decision somewhere else makes the law certain?
1990.89-1493,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3463.311,3463.922,Whether there's uncertainty is not the issue.
1990.89-1493,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3470.196,3473.149,"Well, that was not disputed."
1990.89-1493,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3503.008,3505.261,--I think you've answered the question Mr Gold.
1990.89-1493,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3505.261,3505.381,--Okay.
1990.89-1493,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3505.381,3507.564,The case is submitted.
