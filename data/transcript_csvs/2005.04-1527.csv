2005.04-1527,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.211,We'll hear argument next in S. D. Warren Company versus Maine Board of Environmental Protection.
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,9.105,12.747,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it... and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1527,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,87.521,103.175,"Mr. Kayatta, if I took a drum of water out of the river and put it in the garage next to the river for 5 years, and, 5 years later, came out and poured that drum of water back into the river, is that a discharge into the river?"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,103.175,105.184,"--Yes, that would be a discharge into the river."
2005.04-1527,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,105.184,113.738,"How is it different here, where you have the dam restraining the waters for a certain period, and then it's being released later, at a subsequent time?"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,113.899,114.059,Yes.
2005.04-1527,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,114.059,116.094,--isn't that also a discharge?
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,116.094,138.662,"There is... we draw a distinction... and I'm referring just to discharge, I'm not addressing the issue that the Court could get to in another case of whether you actually need a discharge of a pollutant, as to just a discharge into the river... we draw a distinction between actually removing something entirely from the river, exercising control over it."
2005.04-1527,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,163.302,168.686,"Even though it's retained in a... what... an impoundment pool, or whatever, behind--"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,168.686,174.273,"Well, the dams slow down the water as it comes down the Presumpscot."
2005.04-1527,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,189.557,189.778,"Well, this--"
2005.04-1527,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,189.778,203.598,"--So, you think it's a different case if it's not a continuous motion; in other words, that the water is released... you know, it's released on the weekends, but, during the week, it has to build up in the... you would draw a distinction and say there's a discharge, in that case?"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,203.598,221.058,"Mr. Chief Justice, the distinction we would draw would be when the exercise over the water, and the separation of the water from the river, reach the point where it could be said that we're no longer dealing with one unitary body of water, as that term is defined in Miccosukee."
2005.04-1527,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,221.342,227.178,"--But this is an important point for me, and I wasn't quite clear what the briefs told me about it."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,253.586,254.428,--Yes.
2005.04-1527,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,296.441,297.312,I don't--
2005.04-1527,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,297.312,297.686,"So, if--"
2005.04-1527,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,297.686,297.866,--I don't--
2005.04-1527,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,297.866,298.327,But is it--
2005.04-1527,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,298.327,309.921,"--So, if it were established in this case that the water is qualitatively changed in a significant degree because of its oxygen component, that would be irrelevant to the question you're asking?"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,309.921,322.205,"--The water, as it comes into the dam and in the impoundment area, there is a... there are findings, that we are not here challenging, that that water changes as it comes into the impoundment area."
2005.04-1527,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,338.587,338.857,Are you--
2005.04-1527,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.857,348.415,"--You're saying the changes occur in the river, above the dam; and, therefore, what's let... what's let back into the river below the dam is the same river, unchanged."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,348.415,352.287,We're saying that the river flows continuously down.
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,360.493,363.01,"Now, let me just be sure I understand one point fully."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,367.523,369.069,--No.
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,370.391,376.219,I thought you agreed that there was a different... a different oxygen content in the water.
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,376.219,387.212,--The water... take the... Mr. Chief Justice's barrel of water that has not been removed from the river... it comes down the river.
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,395.958,396.401,No.
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,396.401,398.839,The same water that went into the dam--
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,398.839,402.7,"Yes, but it's the same water, with a slightly different chemical composition, isn't that true?"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,402.7,406.069,--It's the same water that went into the dam as comes out of the dam.
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,406.069,408.667,But with a slightly different chemical composition.
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,408.667,410.441,Than it was further--
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,410.441,410.651,Am I correct--
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,410.651,410.821,--up the river.
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,410.821,411.582,--when I say that?
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,411.582,412.656,"Yes, you are."
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,412.656,413.056,Thank you.
2005.04-1527,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,413.056,428.574,"But you said... in response to Justice Kennedy's question, you said that there was nothing, I think, as you put it, in the exiting of the water that was significantly different that... or that we could peg as significantly different."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,444.753,456.025,"Well, the difference, we would say, is that, in the barrel hypothetical, the water has been... the water that is put into the river from the barrel that has been in someone's garage for 5 years--"
2005.04-1527,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,456.025,458.083,Then it isn't the exiting that you're getting at.
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,458.904,459.294,"--Well, we--"
2005.04-1527,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,459.294,472.271,"--I mean, it seems to me... and I don't want to make a joke, but I think you're on to something when you talk about the exiting, because the word ""discharge"", as we commonly use it, is a word that describes how you get rid of something."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,496.864,497.327,--The difference--
2005.04-1527,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,497.327,500.246,And that seems to me where I have trouble with your argument.
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,500.246,501.41,"--Yes, Justice Souter."
2005.04-1527,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,512.813,519.041,"Well, as I understand it, in some or all of these dams, at the point of discharge, there isn't any river down there."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,541.758,555.308,"But the... if you accept the proposition that the river is divided into two different things, then you can start to talk about a discharge of one thing into the other."
2005.04-1527,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,572.791,582.76,"--Miccosukee assumed that... the soup ladle example from the Second Circuit; you took out the ladle, you held it up, and you put the same thing back."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,611.135,611.295,Yes.
2005.04-1527,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,625.286,641.505,"I thought the descriptions that we had was, it is a result of the impoundment and the subsequent release that the water emerges in this unnatural state, in this striated state that Justice Kennedy was referring to."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,641.505,641.705,--Yes.
2005.04-1527,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,645.295,646.578,And not the release.
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,649.587,658.412,"The release simply continues the flow of that water, albeit however it has been changed by mechanisms other than discharges into the river."
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,658.412,661.601,"Well, that's true, but... so, you said it's conceded in this case?"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,693.462,694.494,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,694.494,697.863,"Yes, okay... used to be the Federal Power Commission... tells them,"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,720.161,728.335,The consistent position of the EPA all along has been that 401 requires a discharge from a point source before it applies.
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,728.335,730.17,Really?
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,730.17,730.711,Yes.
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,730.711,735.546,"In other words... discharge from a point source, what is... well, then EPA concedes you win?"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,735.546,736.978,No.
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,744.021,744.651,"Well, fine."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,744.651,744.822,--not in the--
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,744.822,744.982,"So, what's--"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,744.982,745.433,--impoundment.
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,745.433,746.174,--the problem?
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,760.828,776.084,"Well, the... 401 is a triggering, or a threshold determination, as set forth in one of this Court's prior decisions, that gives the State not just a voice, but essentially a mandatory veto over a very broad area."
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,792.484,792.795,Right.
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,805.592,809.524,"--No, their position is precisely that the water is running into the water."
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,809.524,817.587,"Now, have you got anything... I've heard you argue about the word ""discharge""; and you say ""discharge"" doesn't mean ""discharge of water"", it means something else."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,824.429,824.99,Yes.
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,907.437,910.275,"But, Counsel, I keep thinking of this example, and I want you to comment on it."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,927.342,928.999,--The--
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,928.999,931.224,If there were live fish--
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,931.224,931.525,--Yes.
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,931.525,935.084,"--above the dam, and they all... they get killed going through the dam, and they were dead when they--"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,935.084,936.138,Yes.
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.138,936.901,"--came out, would that be a discharge in--"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,936.901,941.544,"Actually, the record here would indicate that that... that could happen with some eels, not salmon."
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,941.544,941.835,--Yes.
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,941.835,943.357,"So, your point is well taken, Justice Stevens."
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.254,962.424,"So, you would say--"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,962.424,962.584,--into the river.
2005.04-1527,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.584,965.642,"--even in that case, that would not be a statutory discharge."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,965.642,966.786,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2005.04-1527,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,967.227,975.161,"Counsel, you don't dispute that FERC could impose the same conditions that Maine has imposed in this case, as a matter of FERC authority."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,975.161,975.171,--Exactly.
2005.04-1527,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,975.943,980.697,"Could they even impose something in the condition to your hydroelectric power license saying,"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,983.393,990.776,"--I think they could... I'm not sure they could word it that way, but they could effectively... FERC could effectively do it."
2005.04-1527,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1003.353,1018.308,"So, you're concerned about conditions... I mean, as a practical matter, in terms of how the result in this case would change things, it's a question of whether FERC has to more or less accept what the State does, or whether FERC simply considers and decides whether it wants to impose those conditions."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1018.308,1018.659,--That's correct.
2005.04-1527,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1057.606,1063.723,You would rather be regulated more aggressively by FERC than by the Maine Board of Environmental Protection.
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1063.723,1064.044,--That's correct.
2005.04-1527,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1093.729,1093.949,Does FERC--
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1093.949,1094.16,"--""# proceeding""."
2005.04-1527,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1094.16,1100.848,"--as a regulator, tend to give greater priority to power considerations, as opposed to local environmental concerns?"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1100.848,1104.378,There was some concern prior to '86 by Congress that FERC was doing just that.
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1136.916,1142.3,"No, no, but it doesn't... it doesn't say... it says they have to comply with State water quality standards, doesn't it?"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1142.3,1149.851,"--It doesn't... Congress did not order, in 1986, FERC to always comply in all situations--"
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1149.851,1152.769,"No, I thought... it says that you have to get your permit."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1168.786,1176.39,"--Well, EPA has some authority with respect to any State water quality standards that are less stringent than EPO's... EPA's own requirements."
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1183.108,1185.013,"In other words, if a State were to say,"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1199.977,1202.042,--If this decision is--
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1202.042,1204.157,It has to be just a Clean Water Act standard.
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1204.157,1205.051,--Yes.
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1205.051,1206.534,I'm not an expert on the Clean Water Act.
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1209.18,1211.157,"If this decision is affirmed, then you will have precisely held--"
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1211.157,1216.501,"No, this decision... I'm not asking you about this decision."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1223.942,1224.283,--Yes.
2005.04-1527,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1224.283,1226.919,"--Does EPA, or anyone else, have authority to say,"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1231.442,1237.148,"I don't know, Justice Breyer, about the wording posed in your hypothetical, so I can't answer the wording."
2005.04-1527,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1279.062,1282.451,"Well, has FERC said that this is a problem, that the States are interfering?"
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1282.451,1285.35,"Well, FERC has sort of been all over the place."
2005.04-1527,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1399.82,1412.971,"But I don't understand, linguistically, why this isn't ""putting something into the water"", to the extent the dam holds back and restrains the water, then it ""puts back into the water"" the water that it had held back."
2005.04-1527,0,45236,william_j_kayatta_jr,,1412.971,1422.348,"--Well, the water slows down, meanders around, as it would in an eddy, and continues on through the dam, down the river."

2005.04-1527,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2555.824,2556.115,I'm sorry--
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2556.115,2556.275,--on most of our rivers.
2005.04-1527,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2556.275,2559.704,I'm not interested... I'm asking for an answer to my question.
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2573.685,2581.257,"Your... Justice Souter, a State... a State could do that if it changed the designated uses for its rivers."
2005.04-1527,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2584.387,2589.814,And you don't think there would be any conflict with the FERC scheme if you did that?
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2598.028,2605.731,"--Well, Your Honor, again, I want to... under the Clean Water Act, the States have primary responsibility for the reduction and for the elimination and--"
2005.04-1527,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2605.731,2605.821,"Yeah, I--"

2005.04-1527,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2606.553,2619.993,"--I think the question... maybe it just... I don't understand, totally, how the Clean Water Act works, but I thought that what we're talking in this statute is a State rule that's called the State Clean Water Act rule."
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2625.961,2626.382,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1527,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2626.382,2627.473,All right.
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2647.173,2654.877,"Well, Your Honor, I'm sure the Federal Government will also address this question, but the parameters of the water quality standards are addressed in Section 303 of the Clean Water Act."
2005.04-1527,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2664.805,2666.026,Are they maximums or minimums?
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2666.026,2668.925,"--Your Honor, it's simply categories in there."
2005.04-1527,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2669.058,2669.468,Yes.
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2671.062,2672.366,"--We... well, they are minimums, Your Honor."
2005.04-1527,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2730.161,2732.678,"General Rowe, may I ask this question?"
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2746.209,2748.866,"There's one body of water, Your Honor... Justice Stevens."
2005.04-1527,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2748.866,2749.207,"So, you--"
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2749.207,2749.427,And that's the--
2005.04-1527,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.427,2749.608,--concede that.
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2749.608,2749.839,--that's the--
2005.04-1527,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2749.839,2749.989,Okay.
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2749.989,2750.59,--Presumpscot River.
2005.04-1527,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2750.59,2750.791,Yes.
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2750.791,2760.269,"All the water is waters of the United States, navigable waters, but the water is being discharged from the facility into the navigable waters."
2005.04-1527,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2809.872,2816.169,"Well, any significant obstruction in the river amounts to a... creates a discharge."
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2816.169,2816.71,"No, I'd... no, Your--"
2005.04-1527,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2816.71,2829.577,"Indeed, if it's a small enough stream, I suppose just swimming in it or lying sideways so you impede the flow, you are causing a discharge into the waters of the United States."
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2831.091,2833.819,"--That... Justice Scalia, that's not what I said."
2005.04-1527,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.154,2851.678,"Well, it depends on how big the river is, doesn't it?"
2005.04-1527,1,25946,g_steven_rowe,,2851.678,2861.437,"--Well, I'm... if it's navigable waters, and you have a huge post that's holding up a bridge, there could be a... there... and it's federally licensed... there could be a discharge resulting from that."
2005.04-1527,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2950.497,2952.059,"--Thank you, General Rowe."
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2962.24,2964.769,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1527,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2993.523,2997.605,"Section 402 uses ""discharge"" in the same sense, I assume."
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2997.605,2998.466,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
2005.04-1527,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2998.466,2999.317,Why doesn't it?
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2999.317,3002.256,"Because it uses the term ""discharge of a pollutant"", which is--"
2005.04-1527,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3002.256,3002.796,Yes--
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3002.796,3011.651,"--which is defined, under the Clean Water Act, as a statutory term of art, to mean the addition of a pollution... of a pollutant from a point source."
2005.04-1527,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3026.004,3027.658,--It is... it is broader.
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3067.111,3073.689,"I respectfully disagree, Your Honor, because, in Miccosukee, it addressed the specific question of whether or not there is an addition."
2005.04-1527,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3113.045,3118.09,"In other words, Miccosukee was concerned not with molecules, but with chemical composition."
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3123.646,3125.251,--That's correct--
2005.04-1527,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3125.251,3125.471,"--Well, that--"
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3125.471,3126.763,--that there was no transmission.
2005.04-1527,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3126.763,3126.985,--Yes.
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3126.985,3133.252,"But I think, Justice Souter, you are right in focusing on the exiting from the dam and why discharges are important here."
2005.04-1527,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.252,3153.924,"If, in Miccosukee, liquid of the same composition had been taken from another body of water, and from... not the body of water that was adjacent and which we held was the same body of water... with the same composition, and that had been added, do you think Miccosukee would have come out the same way?"
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3153.924,3155.728,"Yes, I think it would have come out the same way."
2005.04-1527,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3155.728,3155.968,Really?
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3164.793,3171.924,"Your Honor, if we look to the Miccosukee opinion, at 541 U.S. 109 to 110, it discusses this issue."
2005.04-1527,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3175.893,3176.307,Exactly.
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3176.307,3179.325,And the Court... that question was left unresolved in Miccosukee.
2005.04-1527,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3181.23,3186.606,"Because if it was one body of water, it was okay, and if it was two bodies of water, it was bad, right?"
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3186.606,3194.86,"Yes, but in... at page 109, what this Court said... it talked about the S-9 pump, which was central there, because it was moving the body... that the... the water."
2005.04-1527,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3203.385,3214.275,But it would add pollutants to the other body whether it comes from the adjacent body or whether it comes from some distant body.
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3237.395,3237.916,With--
2005.04-1527,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3237.916,3238.086,And I--
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3238.086,3238.236,--With respect--
2005.04-1527,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3238.236,3238.426,--it seems to me that's--
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3238.426,3238.616,--I think you have--
2005.04-1527,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3238.616,3238.837,--what you have here.
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3238.837,3245.126,"--it exactly backwards with what the position of the United States was in Miccosukee, and it explains why our... we took that position."
2005.04-1527,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3268.651,3269.392,"Counsel, I was--"
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3269.392,3270.144,And its issue was--
2005.04-1527,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3270.144,3277.134,"--surprised, in a case involving a FERC license condition, that no one from FERC signed on to your brief."
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3277.134,3286.873,"--Well, Your Honor, as people in the office are familiar with, in the SG's office, the names in the brief tell very little about who has participated in the discussions and the writing of the brief."
2005.04-1527,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3287.847,3292.831,"But if it's a case involving a FERC license, and FERC isn't there, I think it says a great deal."
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3292.831,3295.819,"--Well, Your Honor, this is primarily a case about the Clean Water Act."
2005.04-1527,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3302.126,3302.186,Do you know what FERC's--
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3302.186,3302.366,"So, we can't draw--"
2005.04-1527,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3302.366,3303.76,--Do you know what FERC's position is--
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3303.76,3304.211,--I certainly--
2005.04-1527,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3304.211,3304.371,--in this case?
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3304.371,3304.812,--do.
2005.04-1527,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3317.056,3319.181,"Well, I'm sure of that, and it involves a reconciliation of--"
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3319.181,3319.332,Right.
2005.04-1527,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3319.332,3320.734,--competing positions.
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3326.23,3338.648,"I think what's illuminating is their consistent position, since 1970, when this provision was first enacted into law, in the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970, 2 years before the Clean Water Act amendments."
2005.04-1527,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3338.648,3346.059,"Do you agree that a State could adopt water quality standards that would, in effect, preclude hydroelectric power in the State?"
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3346.059,3348.566,"I think it's certainly possible, on an individual river."

2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3374.879,3381.78,"--If they did it statewide, it would raise a question of whether or not that action is preempted under the Federal Power Act, not under the Clean Water Act."
2005.04-1527,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3484.446,3500.441,"Just for the few of us who think the dictionary doesn't answer the case, is it possible you could say a word about why Congress would, or would not, have wanted, in effect, to incorporate all State water quality standards into a permission to build a dam?"
2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3500.441,3506.441,"--The reason why, it was because Congress gave the States primary authority under the Clean Water Act to deal with pollution."

2005.04-1527,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3572.647,3573.038,--Your Honor?
2005.04-1527,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3588.751,3592.751,"Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted."
