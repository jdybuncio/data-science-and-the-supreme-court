1965.41,0,19871,carl_rachlin,,8.367,13.347,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2239.723,2245.139,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, Your Honors."
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2339.511,2354.37,Is there -- is there anything in the record to indicate that it is a common practice in that library for the librarian to -- the person asked for a book and the book is not there to ask them to leave immediately?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2354.37,2359.998,"No, there is nothing at all in the record and that -- that is not in the record."
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2359.998,2362.17,"That's what happened here, isn't it?"
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2362.17,2365.611,"Well substantially, I believe that would be correct, Mr. Justice --"
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2365.611,2366.208,Yes.
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2366.208,2377.536,"-- Mr. Chief Justice, I think it would be substantially correct that she said that she assumed when she took the order for the book that they would leave and when they did not, she asked them to leave."
1965.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2378.681,2379.875,MWhat kind of library?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2386.634,2400.997,"Well at that time, it was a kind of arrangement by three parishes to -- to have this library, they voted a tax to maintain it."
1965.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2403.418,2404.952,Was it a reading library?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2404.952,2417.498,"No, sir, it was essentially, it's just to supply books and that is just about all it did to -- to serve the -- they did have branches of -- branches, small branch of library in St. Francis Building in West Louisiana Parish."
1965.41,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2417.498,2419.47,"Was there a table in it, chairs?"
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2419.47,2423.964,"It was a -- I believe there was one table and two chairs, I believe in there."
1965.41,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2426.069,2427.449,How large was it [Inaudible]
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2427.449,2433.256,"Well they sir, it must have been about, -- about 15 by 20."
1965.41,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2436.118,2437.863,Just one room?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2437.863,2445.621,"One room there, yes sir, where the -- where the -- in the -- the lady, Mrs. Reeves who was there, I mean that's what she did."
1965.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2449.388,2450.195,Is she the only one?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2450.195,2450.958,Excuse me.
1965.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2450.958,2451.968,Is she the only one there?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2451.968,2454.298,She was the only one there at that time.
1965.41,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2463.583,2466.413,Do they have any other rooms where they have places for people to read?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2466.413,2471.446,"No sir, there was no other room, that was the only room where they took the orders for the books."
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2471.446,2474.561,But there were several rooms there that were used for the library.
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2474.561,2482.625,"Well they were used for the library, I mean, where they had the early employees working and where they had kept their records and the administrative (Voice Overlap)"
1965.41,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2482.625,2484.618,Well they had to keep the books somewhere.
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2485.853,2486.772,"Yes, they -- they had to keep the books on (Voice Overlap)"
1965.41,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.772,2487.734,Where were they kept?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2487.734,2488.128,They had books --
1965.41,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2488.128,2489.54,In this main room or back in these other rooms.
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2489.54,2497.618,They had books in the main room alright and they had them in the back rooms too and which would not open to anyone.
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2514.122,2517.713,How many employees were there in the -- in these other rooms?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2517.713,2520.845,There were only two people in the whole establishment that day.
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2541.795,2551.313,Does the record show [Inaudible] aspects --
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2551.313,2562.754,I believe the record -- I believe the record does show that that was a -- that was one of the programs instituted by the Congress of Racial Equality.
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2562.754,2565.721,Where do we -- where do we find that in the record?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2565.721,2566.216,"Well, --"
1965.41,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2566.216,2567.587,At page 117.
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2567.587,2568.601,It's not going to be --
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2568.601,2569.396,I asked the counsel.
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2569.396,2581.18,"Well, it's not going to [Attempt to Laughter] -- I -- I really don't believe it's going to be one specific page and one sentence."
1965.41,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2633.661,2635.137,Which witness are you talking about?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2635.137,2636.262,Miriam Finegold.
1965.41,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2636.262,2637.726,Thank you.
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2637.726,2638.207,I believe –
1965.41,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2638.207,2646.606,"I can get that in 117, the deputy [Inaudible]"
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2646.606,2661.127,"Well yes, I believe the sheriff -- now what the sheriff testified to as the best of my recollection and I reviewed this several times, was that he had received a telephone call if there was going to be -- something was going to happen at the library."
1965.41,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2733.612,2738.863,"Well this -- does not make it -- to help make it an ingredient of an offense, doesn't it?"
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2738.863,2753.866,"No, sir, except in this way, the question of whether it was a preconceived plan to conduct himself in such a manner as would forcibly disturb the peace and which is what I believe was charged in here."
1965.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2753.866,2773.048,"Mr. Kilbourne, as I read your brief and as I listen to you here, I -- a question occurs to me is the State of Louisiana telling us that in this parish library facilities are not segregated."
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2785.191,2788.004,"I would -- yes, I believe that they can."
1965.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2788.004,2791.527,Is that the representation of the State of Louisiana?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2791.527,2796.712,Well that's a representation of the State of Louisiana which I make and which I certainly stand by it.
1965.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2797.936,2802.229,Now these cards -- this library of cards.
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2811.631,2812.248,That's in the record.
1965.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2812.248,2813.312,Is there any dispute about that?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2813.312,2814.469,"No sir, there's no dispute about that."
1965.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2814.469,2817.814,Does that practice continue?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2817.814,2820.704,I really -- I just couldn't answer that --
1965.41,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2820.704,2828.113,"Well if there is a blue bookmobile for the Negroes and the red ones for the Whites, isn't it?"
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2828.113,2829.031,"In other words, it works --"
1965.41,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2829.031,2832.709,How can you say it's not segregated?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2832.709,2839.93,"Well it's in the -- well I say it's not segregated because if a White person wants to use that blue bookmobile, they would let him use it."
1965.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2848.626,2852.082,"Well the record says quite the contrary, doesn't it?"
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2856.764,2859.617,I believe -- it is.
1965.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2859.617,2860.344,(Voice Overlap) testimony of the record with the precise (Voice Overlap).
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2860.344,2861.617,I believe it is.
1965.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2866.713,2868.619,You're experiencing now.
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2868.619,2869.285,Sir?
1965.41,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2869.285,2874.145,I say it's happening now and I want to ask you about the last statement that you made.
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2896.552,2899.419,Well I -- I do not believe that that would be --
1965.41,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2899.419,2907.122,"I think that -- I think Justice Fortas is referring to the testimony of Mrs. Laura Spears on page 136, 137 of the record."
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2907.122,2909.854,Yes.
1965.41,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2910.259,2911.104,To 138
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2911.104,2914.831,I think she -- I believe she did testify that --
1965.41,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2914.831,2928.814,"Well she said, the only person who will use the blue bookmobile is Negroes and the blue bookmobile serves the three parishes for all Negroes and occasionally if a White person would come to the blue bookmobile, I've give him the schedule when the red bookmobile would come."
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2928.814,2932.919,"Well, that -- I believe that would be the only testimony that's in the record."
1965.41,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2932.919,2935.31,That looks like a segregated library system.
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2935.31,2952.912,"Well I -- I often get confused when you -- when you segregated system or integrated system because in Louisiana -- I always feel like we had more integration in the place and then probably any place in the United States, I mean, just when the way people live."
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2958.992,2965.899,"Prior to this -- prior to this incident, had Negroes ever gone into that library?"
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2965.899,2967.363,You mean to get a book?
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2967.363,2968.928,Because they have gone in there for --
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2968.928,2969.901,They all went in there because --
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2969.901,2975.669,Gone in there for a service to the library as a White person went?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2975.669,2977.522,"I don't believe I had, no sir."
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2977.522,2984.856,Now will you explain to us why that would be if you didn't have segregation?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,2984.856,2989.294,"No, I really can't -- I can't explain why that could be accepted."
1965.41,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2998.883,3000.869,People still run the bookmobile?
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,3000.869,3001.539,Yes it is.
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3022.606,3023.732,White women.
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,3023.732,3025.121,"They were White women, yes sir."
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3034.21,3037.794,But then these -- in these branches and White women wouldn't work.
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,3037.794,3041.301,"Only one woman then, I think it is time they were White."
1965.41,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3041.301,3048.55,"And they couldn't get any White women to work in there if they allowed Negroes to -- to use the library, is that the fact?"
1965.41,1,39682,richard_kilbourne,,3048.55,3049.546,That's not what I'm saying.
