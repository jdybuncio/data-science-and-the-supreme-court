2002.01-1118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,10.569,"We'll hear argument in case Number 01-1118, Scheidler against the National Organization of... of Women."
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,13.458,17.052,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,138.954,149.978,"I suppose in some instances one competitor can buy another competitor's firm and just close it up in a regular business transaction, and that... that would be obtaining it in that sense."
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,155.634,156.749,"No, Your Honor."
2002.01-1118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,165.172,170.661,Let's assume that the... that the boycott or... or the protests are sufficient to close it down.
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,179.001,185.356,"That is a sense of the word obtain, but it's not the sense relevant for interpreting the Hobbs Act for several reasons."
2002.01-1118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,192.886,196.091,You... you concede it's a sense of the term obtained?
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,201.087,202.945,"Well, I certainly don't... I'm sorry, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-1118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,249.679,252.69,"Of course, that... extortion wasn't charged in that case, was it?"
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,252.69,265.2,"No, Your Honor, but were the Court to uphold the theory in the red and gray briefs, which wouldn't support the judgment, but if the Court were to uphold that theory, it certainly could be charged the next time the facts of Claiborne Hardware come along."
2002.01-1118,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,265.2,267.551,One must wonder why it wasn't charged.
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,267.551,268.46,Yes.
2002.01-1118,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,268.46,273.844,Because it was a State case it wasn't... the reason... reason it wasn't charged.
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,277.559,279.417,"Well, my... that's correct, of course, Justice Stevens."
2002.01-1118,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,313.436,321.981,But are we talking about actions that constitute the commission of some kind of criminal offense in the process?
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,321.981,322.519,"--Oh, yes."
2002.01-1118,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,322.519,323.179,Yes.
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,323.179,323.551,"Oh, yes."
2002.01-1118,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,323.851,328.392,"Yes, and other things, destruction of property and so forth, I suppose."
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,328.392,329.878,"Oh, yes, Justice O'Connor."
2002.01-1118,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,329.878,330.111,Yes.
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,330.111,330.649,There's never been any doubt in this case--
2002.01-1118,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,330.649,335.783,"I mean, we're not talking about conduct that is lawful here."
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,335.783,343.463,"--We are not talking about extortion, but we are talking about some things that could be punished much less severely."
2002.01-1118,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,354.813,356.094,--more than that.
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,358.694,368.353,"--Well, fair enough except the... the jury verdict really is quite at rejection of petitioners' proof in many respects rather than supporting it."
2002.01-1118,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,373.6,382.311,"--I think to paint the picture that we're talking about, just pure speech is... is not the case."
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,382.311,386.852,"--No, but that's why I used the examples of Carry Nation and Claiborne Hardware which weren't pure speech either."
2002.01-1118,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,389.536,391.599,Would you say coercion?
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,409.393,409.765,Yes.
2002.01-1118,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,409.765,410.469,That crime--
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,410.469,423.472,"And that's a very important point supporting our position because Congress at one point had coercion as a predicate act in the Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934 and, at the request of organized labor, took it out."
2002.01-1118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,443.944,463.968,"--Just... just on the obtain point, which I... I agree with you is of great relevance here, if... if a group trespasses on property and... and remains there for a period of days, can it be said that they're obtaining the use of the property, or is... is that too much of a stretch?"
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,463.968,469.745,"I think it's a stretch, Justice Kennedy, but even if it weren't a stretch, it still wouldn't be a Hobbs Act violation for a different reason."
2002.01-1118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,479.366,485.803,"Well, suppose you withdraw in order to avoid confrontation."
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,508.012,508.549,"Well, that actually--"
2002.01-1118,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,508.549,511.234,You make your... you make your muscles move and that's about it.
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,511.234,511.727,--Yes.
2002.01-1118,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,532.189,543.678,I guess it's obtaining property if a group of people through criminal means tell an owner of a business precisely and in detail how he has to run his business.
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,543.678,544.876,"Oh, I don't think so, Justice Breyer."
2002.01-1118,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,544.876,545.247,No?
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,562.791,562.791,If it--
2002.01-1118,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,562.791,566.218,"Now, why haven't they obtained that business?"
2002.01-1118,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,566.218,569.44,"--In the hypothetical example you just gave me, they most certainly have obtained property."
2002.01-1118,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,570.266,574.52,Because I said... say... I regretted putting that in the hypothetical the instant I did.
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1190.471,1193.443,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1221.929,1229.026,"Well, under that definition, I suppose that anytime protesters trespass on property, they've obtained the use of that property and there's a Hobbs Act violation--"
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1229.026,1229.292,If--
2002.01-1118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1229.292,1230.407,--Hobbs Act predicate violation?
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1230.407,1246.01,"--If there's an unlawful use of force or threats or violence, Justice Kennedy, whether it be in the form of trespassing... and the aim... which this Court recognized 8 years ago in this... in this very predecessor case was to shut down the clinics."
2002.01-1118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1253.707,1268.801,"Well, if... if that's... if that's a strained reading of obtained, shouldn't we be... take counsel of... that there's a... serious First Amendment consequences... consequence if we adopt that extensive definition?"
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1268.801,1281.078,"As Justice Souter said in... in the dissent, which you joined, in the earlier case, the First Amendment is not an issue in this case, and it can be dealt with in particular circumstances in particular cases where it arises."
2002.01-1118,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1283.39,1287.643,"Well, the... there's always a First Amendment implication in a protest case."
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1296.189,1300.935,"--Well, it was the question that was presented that was not accepted by this Court."
2002.01-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1307.501,1311.299,"Well, but the point... the point is... the point is not whether there's a First Amendment violation here."
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1334.166,1341.142,"I submit, Justice Scalia, that that is not going to be the... the problem that this Court or any courts are going to have to face."
2002.01-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.534,1357.572,You... you... do you agree that your interpretation would have been applicable to the civil rights sit-ins?
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1357.572,1363.682,"--Under some circumstances, it could have if illegal force or threats were used to prevent a business from operating."
2002.01-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.682,1364.259,Do you--
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1364.259,1365.085,In many--
2002.01-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.085,1371.279,--Do you agree that it would be applicable to many labor picketing situations--
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1371.279,1372.144,"--Well, they--"
2002.01-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1372.144,1373.713,--where they obstruct entrance?
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1373.713,1380.029,--This... this Court specifically carved out an exemption in... in the Enmons case with respect to legitimate labor objectives--
2002.01-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1380.029,1380.939,"No, but--"
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1380.939,1381.432,--and made it--
2002.01-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1381.432,1384.404,--The exception wasn't with regard to labor objection.
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1389.234,1389.977,--What... what this Court--
2002.01-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1389.977,1393.032,What language of the statute enables you to separate labor?
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1393.032,1411.608,"--Well, I... I can't pull a specific piece of the language out of the statute, but this Court said nearly 20 times in the Enmons case that the Hobbs Act was not intended to cover achievement of legitimate collective bargaining demands, and because the Court did not want to--"
2002.01-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1411.608,1413.716,It said any legitimate demands--
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1413.716,1413.966,"--No, it--"
2002.01-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1413.966,1414.709,--elsewhere.
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1418.796,1427.507,"--I... I take that the Court, because it said over 15, nearly 20 times legitimate collective bargaining demands, legitimate union objectives--"
2002.01-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.507,1430.313,Because that's what was involved in the case.
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1448.562,1466.601,"--I... I can only submit, Justice Scalia, that it seemed to me a clear implication of the words used by the Court and the fact that the Court emphasized that it was... that we were dealing with... the Court was dealing with the extraordinary... the potential extraordinary change in Federal labor law, that that phrase was emphasized over and over again."
2002.01-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1467.594,1470.649,So... so you say we simply made a labor law exception to the extortion statute.
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1470.649,1472.014,--In the... in the context of the history--
2002.01-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1472.014,1473.5,"Just... just out of nowhere, a labor law exception."
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1473.5,1475.524,"--No, not out of nowhere, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-1118,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.146,1479.405,You give me no language in the statute that would justify it.
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1479.405,1484.789,--What... what the statute... what the language of the statute does... and here's... here's where... what I would emphasize.
2002.01-1118,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1515.116,1517.595,"But it says there, to obtain control."
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1519.453,1519.824,--Yes.
2002.01-1118,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1519.824,1520.446,Fine.
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1545.625,1545.996,Let me--
2002.01-1118,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1545.996,1561.146,"There's a spectrum that falls within that word control or the word taking over that if you push it to an extreme, the Hobbs Act becomes a coercion statute in respect to a business owner."
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1561.146,1571.094,"--It... the question, it seems to me, was answered in part by this Court in the earlier NOW case by saying that the extortionist doesn't have to gain a financial benefit or take possession."
2002.01-1118,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1576.007,1585.955,I take where you're going is that it is a coercion statute in respect to a businessperson insofar as you ask the owner of the business to do something that he doesn't want to do.
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1585.955,1587.441,"That's... that's part of it, yes."
2002.01-1118,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1589.67,1591.899,"If I think that's too extreme, is there any stopping place?"
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1591.899,1609.815,"--Well, there... there is a stopping point, is whether at the end of the day, through the threats or the... the actions of the extortionist, that property interest that was held by the victim of the extortion has been transferred to the hands of the extortionist in the sense that the aim has been accomplished."
2002.01-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1616.752,1616.935,General Olson--
2002.01-1118,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1616.935,1618.776,"--Mr.... yes, Mr. Olson."
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1648.952,1651.636,"--We... we have not addressed that, Justice O'Connor."
2002.01-1118,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1652.09,1652.546,"Well, I'm asking you to."
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1652.546,1654.048,--I do... I do agree.
2002.01-1118,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1667.982,1670.006,And we have no idea what the jury went on.
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1690.606,1710.108,"--I think that... I think that at the end of the day, although we haven't briefed it and the Government is interested in the definition of extortion, at the end of the day that might have to be the result because the general... generalized verdict does not make a distinction between that which we contend is property right which was obtained by the extortionist or... or was attempted to be obtained--"
2002.01-1118,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1710.108,1713.452,"Well, you wouldn't want us to send it back without resolving the extortion issue, would you?"
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1713.452,1713.989,"--That's... no, I--"
2002.01-1118,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1713.989,1721.254,You want us to send it back so it is... it is... the jury is given a charge only on the extortion theory that you're... that you're delivering.
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1723.362,1729.593,"--Well, I... the question presented, in connection with the Hobbs Act, I think is answered this way."
2002.01-1118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1779.46,1792.669,"Of course, at the time the statute was enacted, a private litigant could get relief, injunctive relief, under the antitrust laws, not under the... not under the section 7 of the Sherman Act, or section 4 of the Clayton Act, but under whatever the other number is."
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1792.669,1793.412,Section 16.
2002.01-1118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1793.412,1797.581,But the question is really whether the first section of the RICO gives us authority.
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1797.581,1799.976,"Well, may I answer that, Justice Stevens?"
2002.01-1118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1799.976,1800.182,Sure.
2002.01-1118,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1800.182,1820.038,"It seems to me that in the context of the language that the... that Congress knew would not create a right, and knowing... Congress knowing that section 16 did specifically create such a right, and knowing that this Court had said that when a right is created and remedies specifically provided, the Court... the Court will not expand."
2002.01-1118,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1832.132,1833.618,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,1844.847,1848.107,"Justice Stevens, and... and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1896.738,1907.308,"But in the next section, it did mention the Government and said that the Government shall have the authority to... to use the injunctive provisions mentioned in the first section."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,1907.662,1907.745,"No, Your Honor."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.745,1914.515,"And then in the third section, it gives private individuals a right to damages, but does not mention that they have the right to use the first... first section."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,1914.515,1918.026,"Justice Scalia, of course, you are correct about section (c)."
2002.01-1118,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1965.21,1968.925,Section (a) says what the court may grant.
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,1999.063,2012.604,"--That's a question that we have pondered for a long time, and... and I think the Motorola brief, which explains... a very important brief... why preliminary injunctions should be available to everybody, makes a good argument for that."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2037.041,2040.468,But you're just addressing the second sentence of section (b).
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2047.156,2048.353,That's right.
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.353,2049.469,Now--
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2049.469,2050.295,That's right.
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2050.295,2055.123,--that... that gives the Attorney General the power to institute proceedings under (a).
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2055.123,2057.808,"Your Honor, it doesn't... excuse me, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-1118,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2066.724,2067.179,What else could it mean?
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2067.179,2075.806,"--It means section 1964 as a whole, Your Honor, and in section (c) private parties are given the right to sue, which is another way of saying the very same thing."
2002.01-1118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2076.565,2077.953,As I... sorry.
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2086.293,2089.098,"Institute proceedings, sue for in the other."
2002.01-1118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2116.136,2134.34,"And I looked... I mean, I couldn't make too much out of the fact that you take the language from the Clayton Act which says the Attorney General may institute proceedings in equity, and you move it to section (b) and just change it to say, he may institute proceedings under this section."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2182.6,2189.659,"Well, Justice Breyer, even if someone made a mistake, the bill, as it stands, is what Congress voted on, and what the President signed."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2194.284,2195.149,I'm with you on that.
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2195.149,2196.801,"--I know you are, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.345,2259.967,Don't you think it's--
2002.01-1118,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2259.967,2264.069,"--We don't agree on whether they get it pursuant to section (a) or section (b), though."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2264.069,2271.605,"--The Scheidler brief, the opening brief, says that section (b) gives the Government unrestricted access to the remedies in section (a)."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2283.084,2296.208,"But... so you say private parties have the power to require... to ask the court to order a person to divest himself of any interest, direct or indirect?"
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2304.299,2305.801,"Justice Scalia, it's not automatic."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2308.196,2315.71,"I understand that, but to put that power and... and to request it in the hands of a power... of a private party seems to me extraordinary."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2315.71,2324.255,"--It's been in the hands of private parties under the antitrust law for more than a half century before RICO was passed, and the courts have had no problem exercising their discretion to my knowledge."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.279,2351.747,"You can understand it in the context of the antitrust laws where the divestiture is the only way to prevent the... the monopolization, but to use that as a punishment for... for extortion is, it seems to me, quite... quite bizarre."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2351.747,2363.802,"--And then I think the court wouldn't grant it to the private party, and they certainly wouldn't grant it unless it was designed to remedy the particular injury that the private party suffered to their business and property by virtue of a 1962 violation."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2376.062,2381.142,But the divestiture... you say the divestiture should never be... should never be used by the courts.
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2381.142,2382.172,"--No, I don't, Your Honor."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.658,2390.511,It could... could simply destroy an organization as the punishment for... for extortion as you--
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2390.511,2393.484,"--The court would only do that in an extreme case, I am sure."
2002.01-1118,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2400.542,2408.965,--Then it's even odder that they don't... the private party can't seek that preliminary injunction even if they can show irreparable injury.
2002.01-1118,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2408.965,2421.142,"To give the extraordinary power of ordering divestiture and not giving a party who is irreparably injured the authority to go into court and say, stop now... temporarily--"
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2421.142,2432.121,"I... I agree, Your Honor, and even though that's not an issue that the Court has to resolve in this case, I think the Motorola brief makes an excellent case for why... since this is a very special remedy, it's not an exclusive list."
2002.01-1118,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2469.81,2483.268,"--Well, you do agree, though, I guess that were efforts to include language authorizing the obtaining of injunctions by private petitioners, and that was not adopted by Congress."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2483.268,2485.497,But they were passed unanimously.
2002.01-1118,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2490.66,2491.774,"Well, we don't know."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2491.774,2500.856,"We don't know, Your Honor, and we can... and as the Court has said in Central Bank and Solid Waste, one never... it's a thin reed to rest an interpretation on what Congress might have had--"
2002.01-1118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2500.856,2509.114,"And they have a long, long discussion of the battle, and everybody says, without any opposition, that this isn't there."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2514.315,2516.46,"--Well, I think that's what Representative Steiger said."
2002.01-1118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2518.401,2519.022,I don't know.
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2519.022,2521.706,But it's certainly not the clear command to the contrary.
2002.01-1118,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2521.706,2523.935,"Well, you have two... two difficult and major arguments here."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2523.935,2525.604,I'd like to turn to it.
2002.01-1118,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2526.702,2529.098,I... I would like to hear your comments on obtaining property.
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2529.098,2530.956,I would like to turn to those.
2002.01-1118,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2562.597,2565.941,Do you think that it includes liberty interest deprivation?
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2565.941,2566.578,No.
2002.01-1118,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2569.45,2573.787,Then what happens to a generalized verdict no matter how you define this--
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2573.787,2576.925,"--Your Honor, the verdict here is based only on property."
2002.01-1118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2590.633,2592.629,"--Yes, but it defined property."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2608.299,2608.604,Right.
2002.01-1118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2608.604,2619.711,"--including a woman's right to seek services from the clinic, the right of doctors or nurses to perform their jobs, the right of the clinic to provide medical services free from wrongful threats."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2619.711,2620.016,Right.
2002.01-1118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2620.016,2629.409,"Now, your brief I think, more or less, seemed to concede that... that at least two out of those three parts were certainly wrong."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2629.409,2630.031,"Oh, no."
2002.01-1118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2630.031,2630.774,You don't.
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2632.632,2633.375,"No, no."
2002.01-1118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2678.048,2678.519,--All right.
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2682.484,2683.432,"--It is, Your Honor."
2002.01-1118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2683.432,2696.601,"--So a... a woman's right to seek services is property which, if they say, I don't want you, the clinic, to serve the woman so the woman can't get the services, that is obtaining property?"
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2696.601,2700.993,It is under these circumstances where she has an actual agreement with the... the clinic.
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.247,2716.271,What have you obtained control of?
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2716.271,2723.208,"Just as in the Carpenter case, you've obtained control of the right to do business and the intangible rights that come out of business, the exclusive rights."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2723.208,2733.982,"Obtaining control means... means nothing at all if... if whenever you deprive somebody of... of a right, you say you obtain control of the right that... that you've deprived them of."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2737.326,2742.239,When one uses a demand to make one cede their control over property... this is my pen.
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2755.288,2763.294,"If I... if I say to you, don't... don't use that pen, or I'll do something unlawful and you don't use the pen, I have obtained the pen."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2763.294,2764.204,You have obtained control.
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.204,2767.009,"In... in ordinary parlance, I have obtained the pen."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2767.009,2779.436,"Your Honor, in the Florida Prepaid case, in the Craft case, in the Drye case, this Court made crystal clear the essence of intangible... and, for that matter, tangible property is the rights that come out of it, especially the right of control."
2002.01-1118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2782.508,2785.38,Or what about the right to perform a job?
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2787.692,2787.858,--Absolutely.
2002.01-1118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2787.858,2792.976,"And... and think of the strike, my goodness, where people can't get into the factory."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2805.031,2805.214,Right.
2002.01-1118,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2805.214,2807.056,There are the soda fountain... the sit-ins.
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2832.69,2833.887,"I'd like to address those, Justice Breyer."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2844.95,2850.811,"No, but just obstructing... just obstructing... you've used the term violence several times."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2852.669,2852.935,It--
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2852.935,2861.934,"As... as your argument to the jury itself indicated, it was enough if they obstructed the entrance and failed to part like the Red Sea--"
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2861.934,2862.167,--Not true.
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2862.167,2863.365,--if somebody wanted to go in.
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2863.365,2865.222,"Justice Scalia, that is not correct."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2895.211,2907.826,"I... I am reading the closing argument on behalf of the clinic plaintiffs at the trial, and it says, in every issue we've shown you the property rights of the clinics and the women were extorted under RICO."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2952.757,2953.5,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2961.142,2963.038,So you're... you're changing your position here.
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2963.038,2963.576,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2963.576,2964.031,I see.
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2964.031,2974.35,"When we made... we made that argument, but we also told the jury that if they were basing any predicate acts on the mere presence and a mere blockade, mere sit-in, they had to put yes to question 6."
2002.01-1118,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2981.491,2986.571,"Well... well, but still... still it seems to me that your... your theory doesn't depend on violence."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,2995.609,2997.633,"--Yes, Your Honor, by... by wrongful means."
2002.01-1118,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2998.542,3008.573,"And... and so... so long as the means were wrongful, the obtaining definitional problem still remains, and I think you should address that."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,3008.573,3010.431,"I'd like... yes, I'd like to go back to the Carpenter case."
2002.01-1118,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3027.193,3028.846,How about Carry Nation?
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,3038.506,3043.79,"--I would, Your Honor, if she had been doing it to get consent, to get the business to change its ways, which I guess she was."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3053.904,3058.568,"But it is... it is strange to think of Carry Nation, that notorious extortionist."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,3064.762,3069.099,"Your Honor, the Hobbs Act doesn't give exemptions for motives, as this Court has repeatedly held."
2002.01-1118,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3071.7,3071.966,What's the difference between--
2002.01-1118,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3071.966,3074.095,"--Ms. Clayton, may I ask you one question?"
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,3084.953,3087.72,"Oh, no, I don't believe I said that."
2002.01-1118,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3087.72,3087.925,I just misunderstood you.
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,3087.925,3094.828,"The... the petitioners had offered a definition of... of extortion that was part with property, and they didn't define it."
2002.01-1118,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3110.055,3113.604,What is the difference between coercion and extortion?
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,3113.604,3116.947,The difference is whether property is being attacked.
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3124.173,3128.01,What would you coerce them to do that is not the giving up of property?
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,3128.382,3129.496,To stop speaking.
2002.01-1118,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3136.6,3138.829,Shouldn't we draw the line this way?
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,3199.347,3201.493,"Not quite, Justice Souter."
2002.01-1118,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3210.493,3212.805,"Well, they wanted a... I mean, but they... the--"
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,3212.805,3213.26,--They--
2002.01-1118,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3213.26,3215.656,--their immediate object was to get the sandwich or the Coke.
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,3216.437,3217.635,"--But... okay, that... that may be right."
2002.01-1118,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3236.916,3252.741,"Well, maybe... maybe it is, but I... I think... among other things, I think we are, and should be more concerned about the First Amendment issues which arise when you cross the line into liberty than the... than the cases were 40 years ago and--"
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,3252.741,3254.293,"But the proper... excuse me, Justice Souter."
2002.01-1118,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3331.631,3333.283,"--You want to retain the labor union exception, however, I assume."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,3333.283,3333.943,--And of course.
2002.01-1118,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3350.54,3350.79,"Thank you, Mrs.... Ms. Clayton."
2002.01-1118,2,23676,fay_clayton,,3350.79,3351.466,--Thank you.
2002.01-1118,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3352.769,3358.342,"Mr. Englert, you have 6 minutes left."
2002.01-1118,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3358.342,3359.828,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."

2002.01-1118,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3393.265,3395.66,"Yes, at the... at the pages I indicated."
2002.01-1118,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3462.45,3466.331,They wouldn't... they wouldn't be if you observed the distinction I was throwing out.
2002.01-1118,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3466.331,3474.96,"--The... the answer to that distinction, if I may, Justice Souter, is Claiborne Hardware and Carry Nation... those fact patterns certainly would be covered even under the distinction you suggest."
2002.01-1118,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3477.189,3478.758,"Yes, Carry Nation would be covered."
2002.01-1118,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3483.216,3487.22,"Well, actually I... I don't think that's historically accurate."

2002.01-1118,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3494.445,3507.282,"It... it... there are... there are examples that this Court should be concerned, I respectfully submit, about calling extortion under Ms. Clayton's definition, and that would include the facts in Claiborne Hardware."
2002.01-1118,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3510.875,3513.309,--If the conduct in Claiborne Hardware was pretty rough.

2002.01-1118,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3517.153,3522.476,"Your Honor, the... the opinion of the Court in that case refers to it has having elements of majesty as well as elements of violence."
2002.01-1118,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3538.451,3540.559,--No majesty with Carry Nation.

2002.01-1118,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3554.349,3557.004,I think both sides agree on Carry Nation.

2002.01-1118,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3611.313,3613.542,Can I ask you one question about that?
2002.01-1118,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3616.803,3619.198,Only the clinics for extraordinary security costs.
2002.01-1118,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3619.198,3619.941,Okay.
