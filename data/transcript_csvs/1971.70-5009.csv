1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,41.948,"We'll hear arguments next in No. 5009, Jackson against Indiana."
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,44.96,50.246,Mr. Justice and may it please the court.
1971.70-5009,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,115.014,116.845,He is a deaf child?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,116.845,120.147,"Yes Sir, I say he is deaf, he is unable to speak."
1971.70-5009,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,120.147,123.528,I thought he was a mental age with 3 or 4-year-old deaf child.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,123.528,140.181,The witness at that instance emphasized that and I appreciate your calling that to my attention and he will be confined unless this Court sees fit to do something about it for the rest of his life.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,164.285,170.992,"Mr. Spencer, if he had been civilly committed, where would he be confined today?"
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,170.992,173.25,He would be at Muscatatuck your honor.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,186.312,190.757,Is this conceded by your opposition that he definitely would be there?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,190.757,191.219,I don't.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,256.149,264.522,"Didn't your Supreme Court say however that irrespective of the root, he would be at the same place?"
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,264.522,268.009,"They didn't say he would be, they said he could and --"
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,268.009,272.038,You are asking us to not accept to that statement?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,272.038,278.021,"For practical purposes, I think there is a world of difference and it does not answer the problem Your Honor."
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,325.545,328.915,"Now, I have to subordinate questions here."
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,340.856,350.272,"Well, under the statute and I dispute the position of the Indiana Court in this regard."
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,454.394,459.2,There is my second question and then I will let you proceed.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,472.387,473.022,Yes Sir.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,473.022,475.72,I find this unmentioned in either brief.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,475.72,476.526,That is correct.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,476.526,481.603,And this is because it is of no significance here?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,481.603,503.851,"I do not think it is of any significance, except to render questionable or at least indicate question in regard to the state's position that insanity, in the statute for commitment has reference to the same insanity, the same concept of insanity in the provision, in the criminal proceedings."
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.997,742.397,"Well, would you say that, let's suppose the state had proceeded to commit your client as a feeble-minded person under the Section 1907?"
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,742.397,743.765,Yes sir.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,743.765,756.69,"And that committed him in courts with the procedure outlined for the statute and putting in the institution Muscatatuck or whatever it is, and he was there."
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,766.045,772.795,"Well, and to conclusion of your question you used the word which the state has used, which I dispute."
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.336,798.368,"Well, I just want to know whether your contention is that before a state may restrain a person, for as long as this young man has been restrained or will be restrained, there must be some finding that in the proceeding somewhere that he is dangerous to himself or others?"
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,798.368,802.018,"No, that is not a necessity and that's not my contention."
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,803.316,811.774,"You say that the state may take custody of the feeble-minded person, even though he's not dangerous to himself or others and keep him?"
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,811.774,815.282,Whether or not he's dangerous is not a sole determination.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,816.618,821.424,So you are saying that without that kind of interpreting they may take custody of the feeble-minded person and keep him?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,821.424,822.248,Yes sir.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,829.753,834.726,"Right and if he needs treatment, the state may keep in custody while they give him."
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,834.726,836.189,Absolutely.
1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,837.481,844.132,"What if it's just custodial care, not treatment?"
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,844.132,854.101,"Well, I'm not going to take the position that the care offered by the State of Indiana at Muscatatuck is merely custodial."
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.301,901.394,Does existence of the criminal bar now prevent a commitment under the feeble-minded in the statute?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,901.394,906.33,"No sir, but it is a moot question because he is in fact in the custody of the state."
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.33,909.987,Would you resist such a procedure?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,909.987,910.426,No sir.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,917.746,918.911,Why is that?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,918.911,929.083,Because he can not be released under any circumstances as long as the present commitment stands based upon the existence of the two criminal charges.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,932.366,934.754,Why not?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,934.754,937.553,Something that he never lost except in terms of comprehension.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.553,957.758,"I sort of thought you were claiming that if they reverse the charges back, he can't stand trial because he is incompetent to understand proceeding, that the state while they may keep the criminal charges pending can't just put him in the jail --"
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,957.758,958.986,No sir.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,963.308,967.853,It cannot be ineffective because you say the criminal charges must be dismissed.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,967.853,970.19,No.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1002.971,1008.003,The department of mental health apparently can transfer him right now to Muscatatuck or whatever.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1008.003,1009.805,That's what the Supreme Court says.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1010.307,1018.526,It seems to me like the State Court has addressed himself to many of the state law issues that we are bringing.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1018.526,1028.363,"If the Court please, the State Court did not address itself to the basic issue involved as to the applicability of the statute and the result."
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.82,1034.079,In any event isn't that a State Court question?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1034.079,1034.489,No sir.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.684,1050.387,"I know, but concededly he can be placed in the institution you want him to be placed in."
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1050.387,1052.411,And can never get out.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1061.205,1078.034,Well you are claiming that the state may not charge a person with crime and then keep him in jail forever just because he is incompetent to stand trial?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1078.034,1080.779,"No, I think this case is broader than that."
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1084.596,1090.479,"But you need to go anyway, whatever your broad claim is, it includes that."
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1090.479,1091.525,That is a part of it.
1971.70-5009,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1122.237,1131.0,What would happen if you instituted feeble-minded commitment proceedings and he were still committed today?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1135.336,1145.075,There is nothing that the state can do at this point as far as I concede because the commitment unless you do something about it is a final judgment.
1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1166.763,1171.144,Mr. Spencer let me try one hypothetical -- purely hypothetical.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1207.409,1209.601,Well it certainly be a better help.
1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1209.601,1212.503,Well what more would be problem than that?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1212.503,1216.616,As far as I am concerned the judgment of the Lower Court should be reversed.
1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1216.616,1219.442,Well just take the things I pose.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1244.077,1244.77,No.
1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1244.77,1245.818,What else do you want?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1245.818,1249.467,The man has already been in there Your Honor for --
1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1249.467,1256.79,"But he is going out in 90 days unless, on this hypothetical, unless civil proceedings are commenced."
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1256.79,1267.499,"Well, if this Court would determine that has of the time of your decision that the state must take such action."
1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1272.454,1274.574,"No, 90 days I have said."
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1283.226,1287.302,"If I understand you correctly,yes."
1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1301.895,1306.089,"There is no judgment in hypothetical, I have given you."
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1306.089,1306.577,Yes sir.
1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1306.577,1317.013,"It merely is a proceeding and if they can't sustain the burden of proving that he must be committed civilly, then he would not be confined."
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1331.273,1336.039,If there was nothing further done on the criminal charges and if he were civilly committed.
1971.70-5009,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1528.979,1530.484,That he being who the judge or --?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1530.484,1547.656,"The judge, the judge was very much disturbed by what appeared to be the necessary result in the application of this statute and I respectfully submit that on its face, this statute was designed for an entirely different circumstance."
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1578.353,1585.841,"Let us come back to your Indiana procedure, may only the state institute a proceeding for commitment to feeble-mindedness?"
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1585.841,1587.507,Yes Your Honor.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1587.507,1588.953,Be relative to adopting.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1589.86,1593.337,Differentiating in between the Court and the State.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.227,1615.333,"Precisely in other words, you could do it, if you wanted to by a petition."
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1615.333,1617.103,Under civil commitment.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1617.103,1618.887,You are talking about under the criminal statute.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.887,1622.776,"Under civil commitment for feeble-mindedness, who may institute that proceeding?"
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1622.776,1624.676,Any resident in the county.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.676,1625.221,Any record of the citizen?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1627.611,1629.339,Rapidly yes sir.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.339,1636.872,"What's the barrier to doing this, and thereby unraveling this procedural somatic difficulty in your state?"
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1636.872,1640.016,Because of the outstanding commitment from which we are dealing.
1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1640.016,1640.801,How do you know that?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1645.789,1663.701,"Judge, Your Honor I know of no precedent anywhere in the law that the persons involved in litigation as against whom a final judgment has been rendered, particularly coerce in commitment, can at any given point merely ignore it."
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.761,1694.501,Well isn't that part of your application for relief and your feeble-mindedness procedure to ask that the other judgment be set aside?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1694.501,1699.395,"That could not be done, no that would be a collateral attack on a judgment in an entirely separate case"
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1699.395,1700.852,Isn't that in the same court?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1700.852,1701.268,I beg your pardon.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1701.268,1702.66,Isn't it in the same court?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1702.66,1709.634,"No sir, no sir, the court in which these proceedings were had has criminal jurisdictional."
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1739.297,1743.406,"Well what about that State Habeas, do you have Habeas Corpus in Indiana?"
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1743.406,1744.509,Yes sir.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1744.509,1754.95,Does it lie to a relieve -- they claimed illegal custody pursuant to a criminal proceeding?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1754.95,1761.34,"Well whether or not it would in some instance where no appeal had been pursued, I don't know."
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1769.909,1773.32,Did you raise in that court all grounds you are raising here?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1773.32,1774.273,Yes sir.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.273,1779.767,Well how about Federal Habeas?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1779.767,1782.771,If you had denied certiorari I would try it.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1787.121,1791.129,There it seems to me that there are compatible --
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1794.535,1799.409,The state contends that I see none.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.387,1802.917,There are major differences between the two of them.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1802.917,1803.864,Yes sir.
1971.70-5009,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1803.864,1816.599,"For example, of whether or not that this person was committed as an insane person whether this person is a feeble-minded person, whether commitment under the 1907 is available to this particular person under the Indiana law."
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1824.279,1836.619,"Well major in the nature of the conclusion not major in nature of the basis, I submit that it's a veil of words as far as the Attorney General is concerned."
1971.70-5009,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1849.505,1860.268,Your basic constitutional argument that closely parallels the dissenting opinion of Justice DeBruler absolutely in court.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1871.825,1877.8,"Yes sir, as are we, proper counsel all the way."
1971.70-5009,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1877.8,1879.966,What explains the change in counsel?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1879.966,1883.008,"No change, we are proper counsel."
1971.70-5009,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1883.008,1884.293,But you sad you didn't represent him.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1884.293,1901.769,"Oh I am sorry I misunderstood, as a matter of procedure with which I certainly approve that it's been a custom for sometime, our two criminal courts in Marion County do not appoint the same attorney to proceed on appeal as was in the trail."
1971.70-5009,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1923.795,1930.073,That leaves counsel on appeal free to make the claim that there was ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1930.073,1930.752,Occasionally.
1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1930.752,1932.496,Do they get paid in the state system?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1932.496,1933.522,Yes sir.
1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1933.522,1937.786,Under a state counterpart of the Criminal Justice Act?
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1937.786,1940.095,Pretty much case law Your Honor.
1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1941.993,1943.779,But it's paid by the state.
1971.70-5009,0,24561,frank_e_spencer,,1943.779,1950.938,"The county treasure yes sir, but it is not a statutory procedure setup."
1971.70-5009,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1951.245,1953.832,Very well.
1971.70-5009,1,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,1961.571,1975.906,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court, may I present my associates at the counsel table with me Professor James Weavers of the Indiana University Law School and Assistant Attorney General Robert Colder(ph)."
1971.70-5009,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2114.145,2115.722,Is that civil commitment?
1971.70-5009,1,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2115.722,2116.424,I beg your pardon Your Honor.
1971.70-5009,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2116.424,2118.42,Is that civil commitments?
1971.70-5009,1,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2118.42,2126.342,Your Honor the state's position is essentially this and it was the position of Judge Arterburn in the Supreme Court of Indiana decision.
1971.70-5009,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2133.321,2135.083,Do you call this a civil commitment?
1971.70-5009,1,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2135.083,2136.911,"I do Your Honor, I do."
1971.70-5009,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2136.911,2138.649,"Well, civil commitment for life."
1971.70-5009,1,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2138.649,2144.829,"It is not, it would be for life, if he were committed under any statute Your Honor if he is not going to recover."
1971.70-5009,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2144.829,2147.349,Rent standards.
1971.70-5009,1,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2147.349,2161.375,"It's non-comprehension in the case of 1917 06A Your Honor, non-comprehension in the case of the commitments statute to which petitioner would have a commit."
1971.70-5009,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2165.531,2168.678,I am not interested in standard of commitment.
1971.70-5009,2,24561,frank_e_spencer,,2172.474,2175.795,The discharge provisions are essentially the same Your Honor.
1971.70-5009,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2188.605,2190.905,In each instance?
1971.70-5009,2,24561,frank_e_spencer,,2190.905,2193.087,The superintendent of the institution Your Honor.
1971.70-5009,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2193.087,2194.14,In each one.
1971.70-5009,3,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2194.14,2200.757,In each instance and the superintendent of the -- and the institution Your Honor is determined on the basis of where the mental health --
1971.70-5009,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2200.757,2212.0,"That man, if he were picked up without these criminal charges and was civilly committed, right?"
1971.70-5009,3,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2212.0,2212.896,Yes sir.
1971.70-5009,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2212.896,2215.022,How long would he stay?
1971.70-5009,3,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2215.022,2217.369,He would stay until he had sufficient --
1971.70-5009,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2217.369,2222.065,You said that he was no longer unnecessarily to be confined.
1971.70-5009,3,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2222.065,2233.804,"Until – if the test is Your Honor when he had sufficient mental and physical capacity to the satisfaction of superintendent that's a paraphrase, that he'll be released."
1971.70-5009,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2233.804,2239.141,"Now what has to be determined that he is competent to stand for him, am I right or wrong?"
1971.70-5009,3,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2239.141,2247.707,"No sir, that he have a sufficient comprehension to understand the nature of a criminal proceeding, to understand the charges and assistant --"
1971.70-5009,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2247.707,2248.886,What did I just say?
1971.70-5009,4,24561,frank_e_spencer,,2251.243,2253.699,Your Honor let me submit to you that --
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2256.365,2261.392,Your Honor let me submit to you that Jackson --
1971.70-5009,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2261.392,2269.532,"If Jackson was sane, how long would he possibly be put into penitentiary?"
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2269.532,2276.437,"If Jackson was sane and tried for robbery, robbery carries 10 to 25 years sentence in Indiana."
1971.70-5009,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2281.27,2289.069,Well under any statute do you mean tell me in America they put jail for 25 years for stealing four bucks?
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2289.069,2294.001,By force and violence or by fear Your Honor which makes it robbery.
1971.70-5009,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2297.015,2303.239,"I can understand why instead of putting him in for 50 years, you put him in in for life."
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2303.239,2318.523,"Your Honor in Indiana, if a man by force and violence takes $0.25 by force and violence, robbery being with crime against the person, not against the property."
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2401.353,2410.757,"I take it one of your – as I read your brief, you suggest that under Indiana law he cannot then be committed under 1907?"
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2410.757,2413.292,"No, Your Honor, it's an alternative argument."
1971.70-5009,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.758,2443.367,Do you argue that's what your Supreme Court decided in this case?
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2443.367,2447.268,"No Sir, no sir our Supreme Court said, quite the opposite."
1971.70-5009,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2453.501,2456.364,"Well, he could be placed there by the department?"
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2456.364,2469.969,"By the department and the vehicle by which he gets there is precisely what Mr. Justice Blackmun was pointing out to the counsel for the petitioner, that some responsible citizen in the county in which Jackson resides files a petition for civil commitment."
1971.70-5009,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.969,2471.132,Could that be done now?
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2471.132,2471.717,Yes Your Honor.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.611,2491.501,"That is to say if we have a civil, and where what do you called this place?"
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2492.018,2492.908,Muscatatuck.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2492.908,2501.979,"Muscatatuck, and he was committed there, that the authority of the commission of the transfer, would have committed the commission of transfer right where he is now?"
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2501.979,2504.196,"Yes Sir, absolutely."
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2526.935,2538.362,"How can there be a proceeding initiated, whether it's under this commitment or under the civil commitment to get the Due Process hearing that he now can comprehend the thing?"
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2539.48,2543.624,"It comes, if I understand your question Mr. Justice."
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2543.624,2559.459,"No, I thought you said earlier that under either this commitment or a civil commitment, it's possible to have a Due Process hearing and which it shall be determined whether he is to remain committed or to be released or ?"
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2559.459,2561.246,"Yes, that's true."
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2561.246,2561.931,How is that initiated?
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2561.931,2569.6,Let me give you -- there are two separate proceedings and the case of a non-comprehension commitment as we have in the instant case.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2596.825,2605.488,"My question goes to, how now can there be a hearing to determine whether he ought to be released to understand trial, that's what I meant?"
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2605.488,2608.193,"Well, first of all, how can there be a hearing?"
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2619.572,2629.584,"Suppose there have never been any criminal charges here, but someone had initiated a civil judgment and he were now at either place under civil commitment and he want it out."
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2632.331,2634.048,He could file a habeas corpus.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2634.048,2635.485,Only by habeas?
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2635.485,2637.334,He could file a habeas corpus.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2646.722,2648.661,"But right now, you just say you assume that."
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2648.661,2659.618,"Yes, but he could do it better because he attacks the discretion of the superintendent in saying that he is not and therefore he is being illegally detained by habeas corpus, Your Honor."
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2661.342,2664.602,Jackson's remedy is only habeas corpus.
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2664.602,2668.05,Jackson's remedy is habeas corpus.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2670.847,2672.916,"That is, he can comprehend."
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2672.916,2673.63,Yes.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2673.63,2674.723,Yeah.
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2680.928,2683.027,"Yes, he would Your Honor, both in state court and in federal."
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2683.027,2687.084,"Well, Jackson is not eligible now for any follow ups."
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2687.084,2688.146,"Let me say this, Your Honor."
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2688.146,2688.937,"Well, his theory is this --"
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2688.937,2690.143,Yes.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2690.143,2691.299,At this place?
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2691.299,2691.842,No.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2692.241,2693.311,"Alright, that's what I want to know."
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2695.469,2696.555,That is right Your Honor.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2696.555,2705.981,If he had been committed civilly as a feeble-minded person and had been placed in this particular prison --
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2705.981,2707.183,Not where he is now.
1971.70-5009,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2707.183,2710.706,"Let’s assume he had been placed, you say that he could have have."
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2710.706,2713.808,"He could not have been placed in Central State Hospital, Your Honor."
1971.70-5009,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2716.216,2729.818,"When you told me just a while ago, I know I told Justice Brennan that if this man, if Jackson had been committed as the feeble-minded person, the Department of Mental Health, could still have placed him in the very institution where he is now."
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2729.818,2730.622,Yes.
1971.70-5009,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2730.622,2734.317,So he had that placement then.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2734.317,2740.851,"After the commitment of feeble-minded, would he be then be eligible for furlough?"
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2740.851,2745.802,No probably not because it isn’t the institution that carries a furlough proposition.
1971.70-5009,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2745.802,2746.719,Alright.
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2754.678,2755.924,Yes.
1971.70-5009,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.924,2759.654,Until he is placed there and (Inaudible)
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2759.654,2762.137,"Yes, that's precisely right."
1971.70-5009,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2766.594,2771.287,But why no furlough at the Central State Hospital?
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2771.287,2772.094,I don't know.
1971.70-5009,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2779.154,2789.145,"Well, have you ever known a feeble person admitted under the re is feeble-minded Section 1907 where two have been placed in the facilities of Jackson."
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2789.145,2791.572,No.
1971.70-5009,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.433,2841.218,"But even so as I understand it other than the differences to furlough, no matter where Jackson is confined, if he has to have any release, he has to initiate a habeas proceeding under your practice to get it."
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2841.218,2847.994,"That would be my understanding, together with I have to equivocate Your Honor."
1971.70-5009,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2897.174,2904.47,"Well, now in this instance, I guess it is a practical platform, this being a non-comprehension commitment."
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2906.953,2911.451,"He must be about 39 Your Honor, he was 27 at the time of -- ."
1971.70-5009,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2911.451,2919.728,He is there for the rest of his life unless he can establish the comprehension.
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2919.728,2920.306,Yes.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2947.327,2964.315,I gather are those offenses (Inaudible) So that means if he will be there at least 50 years before he would serve -- the possible term he could serve.
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2964.315,2964.796,Yes sir.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2983.539,2986.779,"Well, we don't even have that much of the statute?"
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,2986.779,2988.643,"We have more, Your Honor."
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2994.688,3000.422,"But my point would be -- comprehension, you lose all those application."
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,3000.422,3001.108,Yeah.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3001.108,3004.409,But so he stays there for the rest of his life.
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,3004.409,3005.864,But he would anyway.
1971.70-5009,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3013.148,3019.205,"Okay, he spent first 27 years this way apparently with his mother."
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,3064.722,3073.513,"Yes, Your Honor, but I might point out that it only became -- it came to the attention of the government, of the state government by these criminal charges."
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3075.408,3082.798,"I was addressing my question only to your statement that he very clearly could never be released, if he were civilly committed."
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,3082.798,3084.161,"Very possible, very possible."
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3084.161,3086.193,I just wondered how inevitable that was --
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,3086.193,3092.016,He says that in his own case that his condition is such that he will never recover.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3092.016,3094.306,It doesn't require that a person recovers.
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,3095.946,3107.936,"Your Honor, it requires that he at least be able to communicate with the superintendent or someway give the superintendent reason to know that he has this sufficient mental and physical ability that he can be released."
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3107.936,3113.309,Let me point out to you that for 27 years he was not in an institution.

1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3113.603,3115.391,And he had two jobs.
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,3115.391,3118.646,But that is to say that he should not have been Your Honor.
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3124.019,3127.122,Well not most three and four year children are not in institutions.
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,3128.932,3130.53,He has the intellect of --
1971.70-5009,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3141.696,3142.94,His mother is still living?
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,3142.94,3144.05,Yes I assume so.
1971.70-5009,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.398,3172.197,"But the Indiana, I don't think, there have never been any criminal charges here it means to me that (Inaudible)"
1971.70-5009,5,40966,sheldon_a_breskow,,3172.197,3172.543,No sir Your Honor.
1971.70-5009,6,24561,frank_e_spencer,,3606.555,3607.161,No matter what --
1971.70-5009,6,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3607.161,3611.113,"Feeble-minded person, I thought you said feeble-minded didn’t go there."
1971.70-5009,6,24561,frank_e_spencer,,3611.113,3613.53,"Yes sir, and after the --"
1971.70-5009,6,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3613.53,3619.209,What for the two charges he would have been found to be feeble-minded and would be in the civil place?
1971.70-5009,6,24561,frank_e_spencer,,3619.209,3626.128,"After the Jackson decision in this case, by the Indiana Court, he could have very well gone to Central State."
1971.70-5009,6,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3626.128,3640.352,"Well, he wouldn't have had the Jackson decision in this case if they weren’t for the charges solely because of the charges he ends up in the hospital, suddenly insane, solely because of the charges."
1971.70-5009,6,24561,frank_e_spencer,,3640.352,3653.124,I submit to you Mr. Justice Marshall that we are not saying here that Jackson had to go Central State because he was insane under 9-1706 A and then therefore not feeble-minded under the other statute.
1971.70-5009,6,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3653.124,3659.509,In contrary (Inaudible) criminal charges were pending against him.
1971.70-5009,6,24561,frank_e_spencer,,3659.509,3669.599,"I don’t take that position; I say he was sent there because the mental heath commissioner decided that was the best place for him, who had the alternative to send him to Muscatatuck."
1971.70-5009,6,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3669.599,3676.616,"That’s not what you have just said, you have told me that feeble-minded people didn’t go to Central, you said that."
1971.70-5009,6,24561,frank_e_spencer,,3676.616,3688.153,"I said, I didn’t know of any case where feeble-minded were sent to Muscatatuck when I asked why, I said because that’s to Central State because historically Central State that has been for more serious."
1971.70-5009,6,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3688.153,3689.623,Criminally --
1971.70-5009,6,24561,frank_e_spencer,,3689.623,3690.167,Serious.
1971.70-5009,6,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3690.167,3692.552,Wouldn't it be criminally insane?
1971.70-5009,6,24561,frank_e_spencer,,3692.552,3694.77,That isn’t necessary for the Central State.
1971.70-5009,6,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3694.77,3695.596,For the act.
1971.70-5009,6,24561,frank_e_spencer,,3695.596,3700.901,We don’t make the distinction in Indiana Your Honor between criminally insane and civilly insane.
1971.70-5009,6,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3700.901,3719.761,"But all my -- my one question I guess facts will bear it out, that if he didn’t have these two charges anything else had been filed against it, he would have ended up with civil?"
1971.70-5009,6,24561,frank_e_spencer,,3719.761,3721.088,That is not the case.
1971.70-5009,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3744.867,3745.38,Very well.
