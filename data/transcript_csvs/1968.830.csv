1968.830,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,31.155,"Number 830, Dale E. Noyd, petitioner versus Charles R. Bond Jr., et al."
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,38.059,42.838,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,469.594,474.881,"Who or what was the convening authority, was that the commanding general or?"
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,474.881,476.128,It depends on the --
1968.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,476.128,476.308,In this case?
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,476.308,478.111,"-- special line of the level of command, Your Honor."
1968.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,479.674,479.779,In this case?
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,479.779,490.395,"-- but it was the first commander who had court -- in general court-martial convening authority; the Commander of 12 Air Force, General Bond."
1968.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,665.143,673.934,But wouldn't that be true whether or not he had been in confinement under the provisions of 57 (b)?
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,682.884,685.565,"Mr. Justice Stewart, the sentence doesn't indeed begin to run."
1968.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,685.565,688.185,Whether or not he is confined?
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,688.185,701.672,"Yes, but apparently it took a special ruling from the Judge Advocate General in this case to decide that Captain Noyd was entitled to the time credit and I believe the Government so states in its brief."
1968.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,701.672,702.566,"Well, --"
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,702.566,703.18,We contend of course --
1968.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,703.18,704.529,"-- so yes, there is yes?"
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,704.529,704.774,"Yes, of course."
1968.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,704.774,705.394,Yes.
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,713.471,715.591,I don't know what position the Government would take on that.
1968.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,717.485,722.328,"Oh, I understand the Government in the brief is not only to take that position or concede that position but urged that position."
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,722.328,724.418,"Yes, sir."
1968.830,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,724.418,730.267,Everybody confine so it's -- the fact he was confined has nothing to do with the computation of his good time.
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,730.267,739.825,All that I can say to that Your Honor is that they appears to be nothing specific in Air Force regulations on that point and it required a specific rulings form the Judge Advocate General.
1968.830,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,890.984,908.464,"Well, I'm sorry but I don't quite get your answer to the Solicitor General's principle argument on mootness as I understand it which is -- that sounds has expired and terminated and the show is over, isn't that right?"
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,908.464,909.584,That's what the Solicitor General argued.
1968.830,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,909.584,912.129,"Now, what is your reply to that?"
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,912.129,917.554,That first the sentence has -- the reply is twofold.
1968.830,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,930.122,935.047,And you say that just as Mr. Justice Douglas' order did that?
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,935.047,935.477,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.830,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,935.477,937.274,How?
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,937.274,941.641,By ordering that the petitioner be released from confinement.
1968.830,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,941.641,955.275,"But under the rule, criminal justice I understand it that the computation of the amount of time that the man has served does not depend on whether he is or he's not in confinement."
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,960.872,960.92,"Yes, Your Honor."
1968.830,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,960.92,963.343,57 (b).
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,963.343,972.744,"57 (b), Your Honor, Article 57 (b) does however provide that time shall not be credited where the sentence is suspended."
1968.830,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,975.015,982.041,"Well, now what suspended the senate as to -- that's not the same thing as releasing a man from confinement, is it?"
1968.830,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,982.041,985.643,It says the sentence to confinement.
1968.830,0,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,985.643,1002.357,The Article 97 -- paragraph 97 (c) of the manual for court-martial which appears in our brief sets forth a series of circumstances where a sentence is considered suspended.
1968.830,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1641.699,1643.863,Mr. Springer.
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1643.863,1647.579,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.830,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1743.006,1753.751,Are there differences -- any difference is made by the Uniform Code of Military Justice in this area between officers and enlisted men?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1753.751,1755.204,I believe not in the Code.
1968.830,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1777.673,1783.205,But these provisions we're dealing with here primarily are applicable throughout the --
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1783.205,1784.067,The general applicability.
1968.830,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1784.067,1784.691,-- Air Force?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1784.691,1791.105,"Yes, throughout the Air Force and of course throughout all the services because it is a Uniform Code."
1968.830,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1831.846,1854.43,"Before you leave that question counsel, does it not turn on the last, a part of Article 57 (b) but the periods during which the sentence to confinement is suspended shall be excluded in computing the service?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1854.43,1861.798,I think certainly if the sentence were in fact suspended Mr. Justice Douglas by your order.
1968.830,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1861.798,1863.647,"Yes, the sentence to confinement?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1863.647,1872.115,"Yes, if that have been the effect I think it would certainly follow that the case is not moot and there are two days remaining."
1968.830,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1932.127,1937.639,What do you introduce from that with respect to this case?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1937.639,1955.209,"That that the release from confinement is not tantamount to a suspension within the meaning of Article 57 (b) as it reads effective August 1, 1969 or effective in Noyd's case."
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1955.209,1965.034,"Mr. Springer, what's the reason for serving his sentence while this case is on appeal?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1965.034,1968.879,"Is the question, why should the man be in confinement while he is --"
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1968.879,1975.041,Why should he be serving his sentence which is on appeal?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1975.041,1976.656,"Well, perhaps I have to break that down."
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1986.808,1992.459,I don't know of any provision in the civilian court that requires that he stay in prison.
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1992.459,1997.225,No and of course we're not suggesting that the army is required to keep him in prison.
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1997.393,1998.766,They did in this case?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1998.766,1999.0,Yes.
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.965,2003.586,But why?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2006.037,2017.742,"Well, there are number of elements that could go in to the commanding officer's exercise to this discretion, one that has been suggested and conceded by Mr. Karpatkin is the desire to avoid flight."
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2029.223,2035.096,And then what's danger of fleeing a military installation?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2038.814,2045.4,That certainly is what -- would be a factor to go into the military commanding officer's discretion.
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2049.056,2066.061,"My final question is, this case it's now in the Court of Military Appeals if the petitioner wins he just lost a year or is that a present, am I right?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2066.061,2071.405,"Well, of course, he has at the most two days Mr. Justice left to serve on his sentence."
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2075.531,2083.356,"No, I said if the they find that he was not convicted legally under the Military Code?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2083.356,2093.665,It is certainly true that in a sense it's then retroactively no reason for him to have been confined while his appeal was pending.
1968.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.882,2107.037,I thought your instruction of the Military Code was at the sentence run whether he was confined or not?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2107.037,2108.467,"Yes, that's correct Mr. Justice White."
1968.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2108.467,2112.223,Unless there is some foremost suspension of sentence?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2112.223,2113.166,Yes.
1968.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2116.248,2127.945,"Well, I know but Mr. Justice Marshall asked you what is the reason for the provision that saying that sentence runs whether you're confined or not."
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2140.194,2147.862,"There are number of reasons perhaps there are peculiar rules about the computation of sentences within the service, pretend there are no concurrence sentences."
1968.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.862,2153.471,This is one peculiar rule I think that you're saying and that law seems to say that it just runs --
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2153.471,2153.561,Yes.
1968.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.561,2159.638,-- at the time it's imposed period whether it's -- whether he is confined or not.
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2159.638,2159.87,Yes.
1968.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2160.255,2162.134,"Well, why is that?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2162.134,2164.782,This maybe an element of equity that there are no concurrent sentences.
1968.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2189.644,2197.546,"Are you really assuming, are you really -- what you're really suggesting that is the sentence runs when he's confined but it doesn't run on the other?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2197.546,2202.946,"No, it runs one way or another and of course there are these technical problems as to what is confinement and what is not."
1968.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.295,2211.788,"Well, what difference does it make for purposes of your mootness argument?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2213.681,2224.897,Whether he was in fact confined or that is true and I think there's no question in whatever that that whatever the reason maybe Article 57 (b) does make a sentence run.
1968.830,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2226.595,2231.255,"(Voice Overlap) Well, if 57 (b), why not earlier?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2247.758,2257.43,"Yes, but we say certainly in the ordinary case the fact of the matter is not in restraint, does not, is clearly not amount to a suspension."
1968.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.013,2261.31,His confinement which he was sentenced here.
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2265.355,2266.181,"Yes, he was."
1968.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2266.181,2274.281,"Now that sentence to confinement couldn't -- it couldn't be executed so called, could it?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2274.281,2276.715,"Yes, could not be executed until after the military of that review was --"
1968.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2276.715,2281.469,"Now, that means he couldn't be confined?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2281.469,2283.941,He could not be confined at hard labor.
1968.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2283.941,2289.15,"Yes, and he couldn't be confined at hard labor until there has been an affirmance?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2289.15,2289.725,Yes.
1968.830,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.867,2296.726,"But, nevertheless until there's affirmance it's assumed that he is serving it?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2296.726,2303.285,Serving at only in the technical sense that he receives credit for it not serving in any -- in the sense of what he is compelled to do.
1968.830,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2305.614,2317.631,"Well, my order however it may be viewed at this time seems on the face to address itself to the problem of confinement?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2317.631,2332.402,"Yes, and of course that is the basis of our mootness argument that confinement and service are in this peculiar code we're dealing with different things."
1968.830,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2466.332,2469.97,It wasn't restored after the District Court order was vacated?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2469.97,2470.736,"No, Mr. Justice."
1968.830,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2489.795,2494.345,Didn't the convening authority withdraw that order then there is something here?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2494.345,2497.024,"No, I believe not as technical matter Mr. Justice Douglas."
1968.830,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2501.035,2503.118,That one has never actually withdrawn by the original (Voice Overlap).
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2503.118,2508.076,"No, it's simply by operation of the Court's Order."
1968.830,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2946.869,2953.607,"Then isn't it entirely total logical, they are repetitious if it was just being held for trial or trial --"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2953.607,2966.831,I suppose result of trial could mean while the jury is out when the trial proceeding itself is over and you're waiting for the decision that will result from that trial proceeding.
1968.830,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2972.499,2976.152,I see.
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,2976.152,2985.744,"In any event, we suggest that the rule for which petitioner contends in this interpretation is a startling one."
1968.830,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3018.95,3024.4,Is that the crucial question in your (Inaudible)?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3024.4,3034.352,"Well, I was going to say I don't think it is but that is a question, a question is what -- the question at this point is what are the legal standards that should be applied --"
1968.830,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3034.352,3040.07,What would you consider is the crucial saying the question?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3040.07,3062.007,"Apart from mootness and apart from exhaustion, I think the question is whether and assuming we have to reach the merits, the question is whether there has been or petitioner's claim is really that there has been an abuse of discretion in determining what kind of restraint is appropriate."
1968.830,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3062.007,3067.156,(Inaudible)
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3067.156,3068.758,Yes.
1968.830,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3068.758,3076.833,And your position is -- the Government's position is he is not entitled to bail or be released as a matter of right?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3076.833,3081.474,"No, but he is entitled to a reasonable exercise of the discretion of the commanding officers."
1968.830,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3081.474,3085.436,And what is that difference today?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3085.436,3095.036,"On this point Mr. Justice Black, I confess I don't see a difference except they say the standard is different, the standard is the Article 13 standard which is whether this a risk of flight."
1968.830,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3095.036,3101.149,Beyond there's difference in between years whether the exercise of person's right.
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3101.149,3121.813,I would certainly say that is what the case when you boil that down the last time that is what it boils down to and on that of course we would say that it's not appropriate for civilian court at least on the facts of this case a case of this kind to review that discretion of the military officers.
1968.830,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3121.813,3137.382,Your position is that the Government has a right if it chooses to do so in his discretion to keep the man in prison while his appeal is waiting action by the higher authorities?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3137.382,3141.249,"Yes, but I should add one further thing and this gets me into the exhaustion point."
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3194.851,3200.866,"Approximately, how long does it take to process the case through the Military Court of Appeals?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3200.866,3213.257,"Well, in this case -- well, for the remedy that we are suggesting here habeas corpus, it takes no longer than habeas corpus in the civilian court and the fact that is what happened in Levy's case."
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3213.257,3215.016,"Well, how does the regular one take?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3215.016,3215.686,Regular review --
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3215.686,3217.054,"Over a year, isn't it?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3217.054,3218.456,I would say yes certainly it's --
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3218.456,3222.675,So that anybody with one year sentence he might just well forget about it.
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3222.675,3228.175,"Well, except Mr. Justice Marshall and this is the military remedy to which we really point."
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3235.62,3242.314,Is the military lawyer for the military prisoner required to go for habeas corpus?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3242.314,3243.767,This is an uncharted area.
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3257.396,3268.25,"I'm not talking -- well, I would suggest that the military lawyer for the military prisoner would really be an outstanding one if he did go for habeas corpus."
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3268.25,3273.939,"Well, I think perhaps depending on as in any case, the applications of a lawyer depend upon how the law --"
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3273.939,3278.394,But approximately how many writs of habeas corpus are filed a year?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3278.394,3279.34,In the Court of Military Appeals?
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3279.34,3280.304,"Yes, sir."
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3280.304,3283.149,I think there have been relatively few this far.
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3283.149,3283.551,"Well, --"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3283.551,3285.746,Because that's not of course a -- the petition --
1968.830,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3285.746,3288.122,That could be right.
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3288.122,3297.912,But I suggest that there is no reason why Captain Noyd could not have file such a petition or why if the case is not moot he could not file such a petition now.
1968.830,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3338.541,3341.811,How long has he been confined in that?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3341.811,3351.679,It was -- of the order of nine months that he was in this restrain state arrest in quarters.
1968.830,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3365.252,3388.005,What is a Government's position with respect to the power of a district judge let us say federal district judge to direct that prisoner held on the court-martial to be released pending further procedures?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3388.005,3392.163,"Well, I think that would depend upon the nature of the question that he raises."
1968.830,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3403.346,3406.063,I understand that but suppose it's not that?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3406.063,3409.593,If it's not a question of jurisdictional power --
1968.830,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3409.593,3420.002,Suppose it's a question of alleged misapplication of statutory remedy or statutory right denial of statutory right.
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3420.002,3421.583,"Well, if this and of course be --"
1968.830,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3421.583,3423.886,(Voice Overlap) -- the allegation here?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3423.886,3431.6,In a military trial or in here has not in the trial but in one of the incidental areas related to trial.
1968.830,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3437.928,3465.746,"You mean that the district judge, suppose he says comes in to District Court and says, my court-martial proceeding has been concluded, have been found guilty, I've gone to the Court of Military Justice and ask to be released pending their review, the have denied it, I come here ask to be released pending completion of the administrative process."
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3465.746,3484.408,"Certainly Mr. Justice, the civilian court would have jurisdiction to entertain that claim as to whether or not it should give relief we would suggest that the old standard in Burns and Wilson is still the standard under the law of this Court that should apply."
1968.830,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3492.59,3496.317,But you would say that the power does exist?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3496.317,3509.848,"Certainly, the power once there has -- well, the power exists I think in any event, I think the case should not be entertained as a matter of some kind of judicial discretion and there has not been exhaustion when there has been exhaustion clearly there is power and let it just (Voice Overlap) --"
1968.830,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3509.848,3523.692,"Now, you and I understand that we're talking about the case like this one where the allegation is that there has been a denial of statutory right."
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3532.127,3532.291,Yes.
1968.830,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3532.291,3535.195,-- in the District Court even though I understand what you say about the --
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3535.195,3535.942,I find it difficult.
1968.830,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3535.942,3537.943,-- that's right they have exercised.
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3537.943,3549.869,I find it difficult to concede that in this case with the nature of the claims to be candid that there would be any room left for civilian court to do any thing after assuming that the Court of Military Appeals.
1968.830,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3549.869,3579.817,"But if you assume, if you start off would be with an order shipping him to Leavenworth and then you read the Article 13 which says that the confinement after the jury or after the trial presumably appending exhaustion shall be no more rigorous than the circumstances required to ensure his presence beginning to deep water, don't you?"
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3579.817,3580.061,"Well, of course --"
1968.830,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3580.061,3588.924,Because sending him to Leavenworth is certainly more rigorous than what is needed to require his presence.
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3588.924,3598.41,"Well, of course the first -- in the first place Mr. Justice Douglas, we do say that Article 13 does not apply to the post-conviction period pending appeal."
1968.830,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3598.41,3605.041,But it says while being held for trial or the result of trial.
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3605.041,3614.25,"Yes, but for one thing looking at the heading of that section where it says no punishment before trial."
1968.830,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3628.265,3639.885,I never think what the discretion is abused whether the standard to ensure his presence was abused if 13 apply?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3639.885,3645.77,Yes but I say it's a matter of discretion with the appropriate commander to determine a matter reviewable discretion.
1968.830,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3670.949,3676.969,But do you suggest that 13 (b) read as if it did not include the words or the result of trial?
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3676.969,3677.049,Oh!
1968.830,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3697.172,3703.391,(Voice Overlap) it's a strain reading for me to eliminate or from Article 13 the result of trial.
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3703.391,3721.564,"Yes, and I -- there one other point I would make in this regard again is that -- it's a strange result if the military in fact is more restricted than the restraint it can impose pending appeal than other civilian authorities while civilian appeals are pending because --"
1968.830,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3721.564,3732.571,"Well, to insure his presence has the flavor of our bond provision, release on bond and recognizance and all that to insure his presence."
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3732.571,3752.005,"Yes, but my point here is that where in the civilian system whereas I believe it's correct to say that before trial the only reason for keeping a man in custody is to assure his presence following a conviction and pending an appeal there are other applicable standards in the statute for example danger to the community and things like that."
1968.830,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3752.005,3756.848,But curiously 13 combines both.
1968.830,1,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3756.848,3766.428,"Yes, if it applies but I suggest that that perhaps startling result is one reason why 13 should not be so read."
1968.830,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3766.428,3767.924,Mr. Karpatkin.
1968.830,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3767.924,3769.926,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1968.830,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3800.032,3803.163,And that's what his counsel says technically it's still in effect.
1968.830,2,36111,marvin_m_karpatkin,,3803.163,3813.11,"Yes, the -- I'm surprised that the Solicitor General's recent statement because it seems to be in direct conflict with words in his brief."
