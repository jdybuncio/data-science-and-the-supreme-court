2019.18-1116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.08,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1116, Intel Corporation Investment Policy Committee versus Sulyma. Mr. Verrilli."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,10.08,23.2,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 1113(2) of ERISA requires that claims for breach of fiduciary duty be brought within three years of when the plaintiff first had actual knowledge of the breach."
2019.18-1116,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,205.04,207.16,Most people don't read them.
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,207.16,208.52,"You know, I -- I -- I --"
2019.18-1116,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,208.52,209.4,Or many.
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,214.12,217.08,"So I -- you know, Your Honor, I don't know that that's correct."
2019.18-1116,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,218.92,219.28,"Well, suppose --"
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,219.28,219.92,-- kinds of documents --
2019.18-1116,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,219.92,226.36,"-- for the group of people who don't read them, how can you say that they have actual knowledge if they haven't read something?"
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,226.36,242.4,"So I -- I think the reason is because the -- the phrase ""actual knowledge"" in this context in particular, but, frankly, in any context, isn't limited to subjective awareness in the way that the Ninth Circuit limited it, and I think that the willful blindness doctrine demonstrates that."
2019.18-1116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,242.88,253.68,"But, Mr. Verrilli, we do have the six-year outer limit, and then there's a special shorter limit if you have actual knowledge."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,276.2,300.08,"So I think, with respect to what ""actual knowledge"" means in this statute, it's important to think about it in context, and it's really -- the idea of taking the phrase ""actual knowledge"" and treating it in this context as though it means the same thing in the other contexts in which it's used is a mistake. This is really a unicorn when it comes to statutes of limitations."
2019.18-1116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,314.04,320.44,"Mr. Verrilli, I -- I think you were about to push back on -- on Justice Kavanaugh's assertion that people don't read these."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,328.52,329.48,So I -- look -- (Laughter.)
2019.18-1116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,329.48,334.44,"I won't -- I won't ask for a show of hands, but -- (Laughter.)"
2019.18-1116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,334.44,338.12,-- do you have any reason to suppose that many people or --
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,338.12,339.56,Yes.
2019.18-1116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,340.96,341.96,What -- what is that?
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,341.96,346.36,"It's -- well, I -- I do think that this is important information."
2019.18-1116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,354.48,355.4,"Well, I'm sure -- I'm sure -- I mean --"
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,355.4,356.4,-- economic security depends on this.
2019.18-1116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,356.4,372.04,"-- the -- the fact is important, but whether people think the information is important, I think -- I'm just not -- well, I'd be surprised. I mean, it's one of those things, the more and more disclosures that are required, the less and less likely it is that people are going to look at them."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,389.4,392.72,I don't think I -- I don't think our argument does depend on that assumption.
2019.18-1116,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,516.88,528.12,"But, Mr. Verrilli, what role does willful blindness play in your argument? Are you claiming that anybody who doesn't read these documents is being willfully blind?"
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,528.12,528.36,No.
2019.18-1116,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,528.36,530.68,Or is there a different argument that you're making?
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,530.68,530.84,No.
2019.18-1116,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,588.12,589.12,Who would have thought --
2019.18-1116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,589.12,591.52,"But you say this is not -- this is not willful, though?"
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,591.52,592.48,"No, we're not saying that."
2019.18-1116,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,612.76,634.84,"I guess I would have thought about it a little bit differently, not that the willful blindness is satisfying the actual knowledge inquiry but, rather, that, because you've been willfully blind, because you've deliberately ignored some piece of evidence, we will treat it as if you actually knew. But -- but, still, the willful blindness is a -- is a different thing."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,639.08,665.6,"Well, but I think the -- the way I would -- the way I would give that a little bit of a different nuance, Your Honor, is that I think with respect to willful blindness, what you're saying is, even a situation where it's not possible to prove that a defendant -- and it's usually a criminal defendant or a defendant in some kind of enforcement action -- has the subjective awareness necessary to satisfy an actual knowledge standard, you're going to impute that subjective awareness to the defendant."
2019.18-1116,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,666.68,669.8,"Correct, because of their bad intent, shall we say."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,669.8,670.08,Right.
2019.18-1116,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,670.56,674.12,Because of their saying I'm purposefully not going to know this.
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,674.12,674.28,Right.
2019.18-1116,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,674.28,676.44,"But, here, you're saying not everybody --"
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,676.44,676.68,But --
2019.18-1116,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,676.68,677.84,-- who has actual knowledge --
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,677.84,678.0,-- I think this gets --
2019.18-1116,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,678.0,679.72,-- is willfully blind in that way.
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,679.72,709.8,"That's -- that's correct, but I think that -- but we're not -- what we're saying is that by analogy, once you think here about the context, because what's happened with this actual knowledge standard, as I said, this is the only statute of limitations we can find in which it exists. It's -- the overwhelming number of situations in which it exists are the ones that we've been talking about here, situations in which you're trying to ascertain the level of culpability in a criminal action or an enforcement action. So you're transplanting it into a totally different environment here."
2019.18-1116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,768.4,785.04,"If the statute had said ""should have had knowledge,"" you would plainly prevail, but it doesn't say ""should have had knowledge."" It says ""actual knowledge."" And you're reading the word ""actual"" out of the statute."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,785.04,787.28,I disagree with that characterization.
2019.18-1116,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,824.04,835.76,Does an entity like your client have the ability to determine whether someone to whom one of these emails with the link is sent has opened up the link?
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,835.76,841.28,"So we -- with respect to this, you know, in this case, no."
2019.18-1116,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,842.64,847.0,"But you could do that, certainly Intel would have the ability to do that, wouldn't it?"
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,847.0,850.92,"It could, I think, yes. I think it would be very difficult and time-consuming."
2019.18-1116,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,905.4,905.96,Why isn't the --
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,905.96,906.92,And --
2019.18-1116,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,906.92,939.4,"-- way -- sorry -- why isn't the way to think about this that, as you say, this is an unusual provision, and you make a lot of strong policy arguments, but, for whatever reason, in the amendment of the statute, it just came out in -- as actual knowledge, and it's an unusual statute, but we stick to the words of the statute, and Congress can, of course, fix it to bring it in line with the other constructive knowledge statutes if Congress so chooses, but we shouldn't rewrite it ourselves. What -- what's wrong with thinking about this that way?"
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,939.4,950.24,"Well, Your Honor, in -- in Yates, the Court concluded that Fish was not a tangible object, even though, in ordinary English, it's obviously a tangible object."
2019.18-1116,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,962.76,963.72,But if we start rewriting --
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,963.72,964.96,-- obviously be a drug.
2019.18-1116,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,964.96,965.04,-- if --
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,965.04,969.28,And so I -- what I guess I would say is that I don't think it's rewriting the statute at all.
2019.18-1116,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1016.96,1036.72,"But, if we -- if we were to say what you want us to say here, actual knowledge is, in effect, a form of constructive knowledge, that could open up all sorts of problems in other statutes down the road that we can't even foresee here where the argument would be the constructive knowledge is enough to satisfy a knowledge requirement at this point."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1036.72,1038.28,"I don't -- I don't think so for two reasons, Your Honor."
2019.18-1116,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1051.04,1051.68,That sounds like --
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1051.68,1052.2,-- its disclosures.
2019.18-1116,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1052.2,1053.28,-- constructive knowledge to me.
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1053.28,1058.28,"I don't think so, Your Honor, in the same way that you -- you might say the same thing about willful blindness being constructive knowledge."
2019.18-1116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1094.68,1111.84,"Are you -- are you relying on court -- other court of appeals decisions that says ""actual knowledge"" means you had access to the information, the information was available to you? Have -- what courts have held that?"
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1111.84,1122.64,"So the -- the -- the -- the Eighth Circuit decision that created the conflict and -- and -- and that this case created the conflict with, held that when you've received the information, you have actual -- you have it."
2019.18-1116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1125.08,1128.88,But are there other -- so we have the Eighth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit.
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1128.88,1133.72,"And the -- the Second Circuit interpreted the language ""had actual knowledge"" in a different context."
2019.18-1116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1158.12,1159.76,How -- how many district courts?
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1159.76,1191.16,"So I think there are -- I don't know the exact number off the top of my head, but I think it's at least a half a dozen or so, maybe more than that, that have grappled with it and they've all come to that conclusion. And so -- and I think there's a reason for that, because it's -- it's an understanding that the way this system is supposed to work is that plan par -- plan participants are supposed to be apprised of the information they need to, in the words of the Senate report of 1974, police their rights. And the way -- and they're given an express private right of action in ERISA to police their rights."
2019.18-1116,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1191.36,1223.12,"It is difficult to imagine a half dozen out of 98, 99 district courts as establishing a firm pattern, but put that aside. You were -- not you, but I think whoever handled this case below -- was asked whether a comatose person who received an email with this plan disclosure, would that person have actual knowledge? Could you answer that question? And let's put aside the comatose person."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1227.72,1230.44,There's no legal obligation to do that.
2019.18-1116,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1231.88,1240.92,So how -- I know plenty of people who never open emails or only open emails from certain individuals or in certain situations.
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1251.36,1263.12,"So let me take the comatose person first, that I think in extreme cases like that, the way the law would handle it is the way the law always handles it, through the doctrine of equitable tolling."
2019.18-1116,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1270.64,1277.52,"How about -- how about handling it through the language of the statute, actual knowledge? That person doesn't have actual knowledge."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1277.52,1292.16,"Well, I think but then the -- the problem with reading it that way is you create a situation in which there can never be summary judgment in one of these cases with respect to the three-year statute of limitations, and so you're imposing very substantial burdens on --"
2019.18-1116,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1292.16,1292.56,"No, no, no --"
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1292.56,1292.96,-- virtually everyone else.
2019.18-1116,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1292.96,1299.88,-- there's -- there's plenty of emails that I get that require me to say that I've read the terms and conditions.
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1299.88,1313.4,"Yes, Your Honor, but I think that what the -- what the plaintiff -- Your Honor wouldn't do this, but what a plaintiff would do in that situation, I think, would say yes, I clicked on the box, but I didn't actually read them, so I didn't actually have knowledge. And I do think that points up something about the argument my friends on the other side make."
2019.18-1116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1324.08,1327.84,"Well, there's always a possibility that a plaintiff under oath will tell the truth."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1327.84,1328.8,Of course.
2019.18-1116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1330.48,1332.12,"And so he'll say, I read it."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1336.56,1337.52,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2019.18-1116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1337.52,1337.88,All right.
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1338.52,1348.36,"But even in the best of circumstances, the -- the -- people's ability to recollect whether they read things four or five and six years earlier, I think, is going to be, you know, quite --"
2019.18-1116,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1348.36,1351.72,"Well, if they didn't read it -- I mean, you've been -- you've heard the argument."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1366.28,1371.32,"Well, I think it's a problem for -- for -- I can think of at least three reasons why it's a problem."
2019.18-1116,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1443.4,1444.56,"Mr. Verrilli, you seem to --"
2019.18-1116,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1444.56,1447.08,What would the circumstantial evidence be?
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1447.08,1467.24,"Well, I -- you know, I suppose it would be evidence like we had in this case, that -- that -- that the plaintiff visited the website 68 times and clicked on 1,000 links and -- and clicked on -- in particular on a link that said that he was going to attend a seminar explaining the investment options, which he then said he didn't attend."
2019.18-1116,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1476.28,1478.48,"Mr. Verrilli, we have -- we have consistent application."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1511.0,1511.4,"Well, I would --"
2019.18-1116,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1511.4,1512.84,-- that could come up with a scheme that would require --
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1512.84,1513.68,May I answer?
2019.18-1116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1513.68,1513.96,Yes.
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1513.96,1525.24,"Thank you. So, Justice Gorsuch, what I -- with respect to that, I think that you have to impart the rationality to Congress also with respect to the three years, that it's in there for a reason."
2019.18-1116,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1525.24,1525.48,Uh-huh.
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1525.48,1528.24,The reason is to protect plans when they have --
2019.18-1116,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1528.24,1529.88,"Well, both sides agree that there's a reason for it."
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1531.68,1535.16,"Well, I -- but I think -- respectfully, what I would suggest is --"
2019.18-1116,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1535.16,1536.16,All right.
2019.18-1116,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1536.16,1539.56,-- we're -- we're suggesting a real reason that makes sense in light of the disclosure obligations.
2019.18-1116,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1543.52,1549.4,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wessler."
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1549.4,1560.64,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress said that a plaintiff must have actual knowledge, it meant what we all understand that phrase to mean, that the plaintiff himself must have real awareness."
2019.18-1116,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1686.48,1687.84,"Well, what would --"
2019.18-1116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1687.84,1694.16,But the problem is how easy one can say I didn't read it.
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1710.84,1712.84,"Well, I -- I think that there are a number of ways."
2019.18-1116,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1742.72,1745.52,What -- what would the -- what would the circumstantial evidence be?

2019.18-1116,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1771.44,1779.56,"But your position is, even with all that evidence, your client would not be subject to summary judgment, right?"
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1779.56,1786.04,"I -- I think there would be a disputed issue of fact at that point that would reach -- would have to go to a fact finder, that's correct."
2019.18-1116,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1792.04,1833.56,"Well, you make -- everything that you've said makes a good policy argument for saying let's just have a six-year period because people don't read these things and they're -- they're hard to understand. But why would Congress add to the six-year statute of repose this requirement of actual knowledge, which is very unusual in -- in statutes of limitations and will almost always prevent summary judgment? It will almost always raise a difficult factual question that requires the district court to make a credibility determination."
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1833.56,1833.92,Sure.
2019.18-1116,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1833.92,1834.6,Why would that be --
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1834.6,1834.76,Sure.
2019.18-1116,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1834.76,1836.36,-- why would Congress think that's worthwhile?
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1836.36,1842.12,"So, of course, we don't know because there is no relevant legislative history that cuts one way or the other on this question."

2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1907.48,1907.68,Well --
2019.18-1116,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1907.68,1910.08,You wouldn't need to require actual knowledge.
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1910.08,1939.56,"-- yeah, I mean, I think that -- that is entirely possible that Congress could have drafted this statute in a different way, but it chose to draft this -- this statute in this way, and I think that deliberate choice deserves and is entitled to -- to respect and it must be honored by -- by -- by this Court because it used the plain text actual knowledge, which I think, as we all sort of understand, is -- is defined in contradistinction to a -- a rule that would allow a court to imply or impute knowledge to a person who does not themselves personally --"
2019.18-1116,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1939.56,1940.0,Mr. Wessler --

2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1945.32,1946.36,Yes.
2019.18-1116,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1947.2,1948.04,-- past summary judgment?
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1948.04,1971.64,"-- don't think reading is sufficient to establish knowledge. Now, as this case comes to the Court, though, the Petitioners have asked the Court to assume that, had one just read all the relevant disclosures in this case, that reading would have imparted the necessary knowledge to know that there was a breach. And so I don't think that the Court needs to reach this question of how much did you need to read or how much did you need to understand."
2019.18-1116,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1971.64,1975.64,But your view is if -- if somebody said just I -- I didn't -- I didn't get it?
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,1975.64,1984.2,I -- I -- I think that's -- that's insufficient to meet this high bar. So I don't think that if -- if -- I don't think that you could come in and say I just read it and that would be enough.
2019.18-1116,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2000.84,2000.88,Do you --

2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2011.68,2013.2,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2019.18-1116,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2014.72,2017.92,"So then this is meaningless, the actual knowledge is meaningless?"
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2017.92,2023.76,"Oh -- oh, not at all. It -- it absolutely depends on the nature of the -- of the kind of breach claim that is at issue in the case."

2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2070.96,2071.64,-- what's going on.

2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2086.48,2086.96,Right.

2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2241.08,2241.2,Sure.

2019.18-1116,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2342.12,2354.92,"Well, what about Mr. Verrilli's argument that that would have seemed -- in the original version, would have seemed a bit insane, right? If -- if -- if the secretary knows, you can't sue, but if you have gotten the disclosure --"
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2354.92,2355.48,Right.
2019.18-1116,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2355.48,2356.32,-- then you -- then --
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2356.32,2356.6,Right.
2019.18-1116,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2357.88,2358.68,"No, go ahead."
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2358.84,2465.04,"So I think that is a nice and perhaps clever theory, but it's demonstrably wrong, and here's why: If you look at the original version of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. 1021 of the 1974 act, and it's this provision that governed those disclosures that needed to be sent to participants and those disclosures that needed to be sent to the Department of Labor, it was in effect all the way up through the 1987 amendments, those documents that were required to be sent to participants, including the SPD and a statement of the plan's assets and liabilities, were among -- were all among the documents that were also being sent to the Department of Labor. So, under the pre-amendment version, even if you kind of think maybe Congress was doing something funky with actual knowledge, participants were, in fact, charged with constructive knowledge of all the documents that ERISA required fiduciaries to send to them in exactly the same way as the Department of Labor was -- had constructive knowledge of the documents that were being provided to it. So there's no gap between the constructive knowledge trigger for those documents provided to participants and those that are provided to the Department of Labor. And I think, you know, what we can see, given that, is that, you know, although there's no legislative history, we do have this D.C. Circuit opinion called Fink, which the court issued about a year before the 1987 amendments, and -- and what they said -- what the court said in Fink is, look, these documents that are being filed with the Department of Labor, they're complex, they're complicated, it's even hard for the Department to -- to -- to get on top of everything that's going on here. To have the clock running on this three-year exception based just on the filing of these documents doesn't seem to us to make very good sense. And shortly after that opinion, what happens? Congress amends the statute to take out that constructive knowledge trigger."
2019.18-1116,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2465.04,2470.36,Everything that was -- everything that was sent to the Department of Labor was also sent to the participants.
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2474.72,2486.04,"Yes, the universe of documents that went to the Department of Labor was broader than those documents that were being sent to participants, but what the participants were getting was also being sent to the Department of Labor."
2019.18-1116,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2486.04,2497.72,"Well, if -- if what was sent to the Department of Labor was broader, then I don't know what's left of your argument, because the participants would be out of court based on things that were sent to the Department of Labor but never sent to them."
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2497.72,2498.6,I -- I agree.

2019.18-1116,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2631.92,2632.64,Tell me what --
2019.18-1116,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2632.64,2634.88,So that person still has the six-year statute?
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2634.88,2641.28,"I mean, willful blindness has never been imported into ERISA, and -- and I don't think there's any statutory basis to do so here, Justice Kagan."

2019.18-1116,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2657.68,2658.6,-- of actual knowledge.

2019.18-1116,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2659.0,2681.0,"Right? That if someone protests too much that they have failed -- that they don't know anything about it, I was -- I had my head stuck in the sand over here, a reasonable juror can say I just don't believe that and I want to -- that's actually evidence that you knew what was going on. And -- and you're not suggesting that that kind of use of willful blindness is impermissible here, are you?"
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2681.0,2687.2,"I -- I -- I think that -- just -- just to back up, since we're in ERISA, you know, you're -- you wouldn't be in front of a jury."
2019.18-1116,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2687.2,2687.8,Of course.
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2687.8,2688.44,You would have --
2019.18-1116,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2688.44,2688.6,Of course.
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2688.6,2712.96,"-- a judge making this fact-finding decision, and I think absolutely, at that stage, credibility plays an enormous role and -- and likely will play an enormous role in whether somebody was -- was either not being accurate when they said they didn't read something or that they didn't understand it. And I think that's precisely the way that these statutes of limitations issues get resolved when they pass through the summary judgment stage to -- to reach a fact finder."
2019.18-1116,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2712.96,2723.84,"But I guess what I'd -- my fault for not expressing the question clearly enough, but does one get past the summary judgment stage if it's clear that one was being willfully blind?"
2019.18-1116,1,36939,matthew_wh_wessler,,2723.84,2733.08,"I -- I still think that there's a -- yes, because I still think there's a credibility issue in play, and willful blindness itself is a fact-finding tool."

Now, as Mr. Wessler alluded to earlier, there is a distinct question not presented here, which is, you know, what do you need to have actual knowledge of, what does it mean to have actual knowledge of the breach or violation? But at least with respect to the question here, I mean, the statute requires actual knowledge."
2019.18-1116,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2945.88,2951.48,I -- I'd like to follow through on the Justice -- the Chief Justice's question.

Now, stepping back, as a general matter, with respect to that separate question that I alluded to earlier, what is the breach or violation, you know, what is it that you have to have actual knowledge of, in -- every court to examine that has concluded that you do not need to have knowledge that it is a legal violation of ERISA."
2019.18-1116,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3019.8,3020.2,That's a --
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3020.2,3021.08,-- you -- you have not met --

2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3021.88,3022.96,-- the actual knowledge standard.
2019.18-1116,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3022.96,3025.28,I'm having -- that line is what I don't understand.
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3025.28,3040.36,"But, in any event, the conclusive legal presumption of actual knowledge that Petitioners are seeking in this case is nothing like that. The rule that Petitioners are advocating here would impute to every plan participant actual knowledge of the contents of all of the mandatory ERISA disclosures that the -- that the plaintiff receives."
2019.18-1116,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3040.36,3051.76,"Mr. Guarnieri, I mean, if we're going to be a textualist, it's -- it's actual knowledge of the breach or the violation. It's not actual knowledge of the contents of the disclosure statement."
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3067.36,3070.08,"Well, I -- I don't think that that's correct, Justice Kagan."
2019.18-1116,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3084.2,3085.04,So that makes sense.
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3085.04,3085.48,So it's generally --
2019.18-1116,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3085.48,3092.92,"I guess I'm just pointing out that that's not -- I mean, if you're really taking the text seriously, I think you would come out in a different place."
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3092.92,3126.0,"Well, we are trying to take the text quite seriously and we do think Congress used precise language in -- in this particular limitations provision, which requires actual knowledge as opposed to simply knowledge. But, you know, to know that there's a breach, I think, in this context, for example, in a -- in a duty of prudence, if the -- if the claim is that the fiduciary violated the duty of prudence, then the plaintiff would need to know that what the fiduciary did was imprudent but not necessarily that what the fiduciary did violated ERISA. And the same would be true for claims sounding in the duty of loyalty or prohibited transactions."
2019.18-1116,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3130.2,3132.36,"But, look, you have a strong textual argument."
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3167.2,3170.68,"Well, Justice Alito, I think the statute reflects the following intuition."
2019.18-1116,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3190.08,3190.64,"Yeah, I under --"
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3190.64,3191.88,"So, basically, the information is --"
2019.18-1116,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3191.88,3211.04,"-- I understand that. But -- but, you know, putting aside the -- the -- the super honest plaintiff who is an expert on investments and actually did read it and actually did understand it and testifies, yeah, okay, you got me, I did it, what else is this going to achieve?"
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3211.04,3223.76,The idea is that the plaintiff who does happen to acquire actual knowledge of the relevant information within those first three years can be expected to bring suit within three years and does not need the full six-year period in which to bring suit. And --
2019.18-1116,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3223.76,3225.84,I think Mr. -- keep going.
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3225.84,3230.0,There are -- there are reasons that Congress would not have wanted a plaintiff in those circumstances.
2019.18-1116,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3247.84,3248.28,I think --
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3248.28,3251.08,That's the basic logic of having the two standards in the statute.
2019.18-1116,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3251.08,3275.72,"I think Mr. Verrilli's point, though, is that it's impossible to prove actual knowledge under the answers that have been given here, and, therefore, you end up with a de facto six-year statute of limitations, which is very unusual, a long period of time, going to cause a lot of negative consequences, he says, and, therefore, that context means that we must be reading actual knowledge wrong."
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3276.44,3276.64,Well --
2019.18-1116,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3276.64,3277.44,-- how do you respond to that?
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3277.44,3297.84,"-- of course, we -- we disagree with Mr. Verrilli's articulation of the policy balance that's at issue here. But just to take the question on directly, there are many reported decisions applying the actual knowledge standard to find a suit is time barred even under the correct understanding of the statute, meaning the knowledge must, in fact, be actual and not merely imputed to the plaintiff as a matter of law. Now --"
2019.18-1116,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3297.84,3306.8,"Well, give me an example where that could be done on summary judgment, a real-world, realistic example of where that could be done on summary judgment."
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3306.8,3327.76,"Well, for example, I mean, a common fact pattern is that a plan participant will consult with another financial professional who will explain to the plan participant, you know, the investments that are in your retirement fund are imprudent for someone in your circumstances. A conversation like that would give that plaintiff actual knowledge of the breach or violation if the claim is that the investment was imprudent."
2019.18-1116,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3349.04,3353.36,Can you -- can you make sure to address Justice Ginsburg's class certification question before you finish?
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3353.36,3353.76,Sure.
2019.18-1116,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3375.68,3376.8,"Well, except --"
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3376.8,3378.04,The fact that there are --
2019.18-1116,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3378.04,3386.48,"-- if you think that the actual knowledge issue would be satisfied, or requirement, in most cases."
2019.18-1116,2,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3394.0,3409.4,"Well, I -- I think in general, the Rule 23 question would be whether the -- the -- the injuries asserted by the plaintiffs are amenable to class-wide treatment. And the fact that there is a defense that might be applicable to some but not other members of their class would not necessarily preclude class certification."
2019.18-1116,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3409.4,3411.2,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Verrilli, five minutes."
2019.18-1116,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3411.2,3431.44,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Three points: First, I'd like to return to the 1974 version of the statute and I -- and in particular to the question that Justice Gorsuch asked me at -- at the end of my opening argument. I think what we heard from my friends on the other side here is that -- there's two things."
2019.18-1116,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3451.8,3452.2,"I'm sorry, Mr. --"
2019.18-1116,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3452.2,3453.08,-- provided to you.
2019.18-1116,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3453.08,3470.56,"-- Verrilli, I went back to that statute, and what it says: ""On which a report from which he could reasonably be expected to have obtained knowledge of such brief."" I read that as potentially excluding those documents that only the secretary has."
2019.18-1116,3,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3485.2,3567.16,"So, Justice Sotomayor, I -- I understood my friend on the other side to say the opposite, which is to say that it would -- it wouldn't -- there was no need to have any -- any knowledge provision triggered by the disclosures that went to the individual because everything that went to the DOL was going to trigger the three years anyway. And I think, if you think about that for a minute, that blows up their whole theory of the statute, because what they're saying is in 1974 Congress enacted a statute that was actually quite harsh, that the default was going to be a three-year statute of limitations if the information sufficient to show breach was sent to DOL whether you got it or not. It would actually be the odd case that was the six years under that theory, not the normal case. And -- and, of course, when Congress amended the statute in 1987, it did not change the words ""had actual knowledge."" So the meaning you're trying to ascertain is the meaning that those words had in 1974. And so I -- I just think that their whole -- the whole theory, nobody reads as a -- you know, that's all blown up by their -- what they said about what happened in 1974. Now the second point, if I could, with respect to the -- the -- Justice Breyer, you asked about consequences and there was a robust discussion about the class action impact here. I -- I do think what my friends on the other side are saying essentially is that -- they didn't put it exactly this way, they spoke at a higher level of abstraction -- but, basically, what they're saying is here's what will happen in class actions."
2019.18-1116,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3696.16,3697.08,"Thank you, counsel."
