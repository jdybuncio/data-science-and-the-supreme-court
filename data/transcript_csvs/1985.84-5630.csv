1985.84-5630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.769,We will hear arguments first this morning in Thomas against the Superintendent of the Ohio Reformatory for Women.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,14.97,23.615,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, if it please the Court, ladies and gentlemen of the audience, it is an honor to appear before the Court."
1985.84-5630,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,370.902,374.405,"Mr. Stanley, did you receive notice of the waiver rule?"
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,374.405,375.967,Yes.
1985.84-5630,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,377.317,381.16,Did you request to file objections within ten days?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,381.16,392.658,"--In the printed portion cf the magistrate's report, at the very end, contained what I now recognize to be notice that if I don't file objections, there would be a waiver."
1985.84-5630,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,392.658,396.692,Did the District Court give you an extension of time within which to file objections?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,396.692,397.042,"Yes, they did."
1985.84-5630,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,397.042,398.282,Did you file any?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,398.282,399.313,"No, I did not."
1985.84-5630,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,399.313,402.507,How much additional time did he give you?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,402.507,404.609,I--
1985.84-5630,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,404.609,405.868,Two or three months?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,405.868,407.761,--Two or three... whatever the time.
1985.84-5630,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,408.91,416.356,How would the District Court ever know that you objected if you failed to file any objections?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,416.356,422.149,"First of all, if I may say, the issues were fully briefed."
1985.84-5630,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,441.681,443.103,On its own... on its own initiative.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,443.103,448.188,"No, on the initiative... what is included in 626(b)(1)(B)."
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,475.245,478.526,"Mr. Stanley, if you had filed objections, would you be here now?"
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,478.526,484.76,"--Well, probably not, but hopefully I would have won down there and you would have accepted it anyway."
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,484.76,488.143,All of this is brought about by your failure to file a piece of paper.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,488.143,489.094,That's correct.
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,489.094,492.477,And that is what we are using our time up for.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,492.477,493.566,Pardon?
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,493.566,496.869,That is what we are using our time up for.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,496.869,499.851,"Well, Your Honor, I believe it is a much more serious matter than that."
1985.84-5630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,522.617,543.141,"Mr. Stanley, if you are right that Raddatz and the other case stand for the proposition that the District Court is an independent adjudicator, the adoption of your view would really allow counsel losing before the magistrate to simply go directly to the Court of Appeals without even paying any attention to the District Court."
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,543.141,545.261,"Well, I disagree with you, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.84-5630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,571.948,579.723,But the District Court would surely be even more focused if it had the benefit cf objections to the magistrate's report from the losing party.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,579.723,582.116,"--I am not going to disagree with you, Your Honor."
1985.84-5630,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,619.851,633.579,"Well, in this instance, how was Article 3 violated, because by your own statement the District Court did give review to the magistrate's finding here, and the finding became the District Court finding."
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,654.392,665.88,"Well, Justice O'Connor, if one reads the opinions in the circuits, there is only one circuit, the Fourth, which discusses this issue in terms of procedural default."
1985.84-5630,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,682.402,683.704,The effect is the same.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,687.435,693.749,"--That's correct, but it seems to me in a situation like this it is a question of form over substance."
1985.84-5630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,724.882,738.189,"Well, Mr. Stanley, did I understand you to say that the recommendation of the magistrate to which you did not object was nevertheless the subject of de novo review by the District Judge?"
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,738.189,739.01,--That's correct.
1985.84-5630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,739.01,748.316,And does the judgment that the District Judge entered reflect that determination on that issue?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,748.316,753.529,The judgment of the District Court reflects that there was a--
1985.84-5630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,753.529,762.185,"No, did it reflect the determination of the issue, the subject cf a recommendation by the magistrate to which you did not object?"
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,762.185,763.126,--That's correct.
1985.84-5630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,763.126,768.549,And you didn't agree with that... the judgment in that respect?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,768.549,769.218,On the District Court?
1985.84-5630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,769.979,772.76,Is that what you wanted to have reviewed in the Court of Appeals?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,772.76,773.141,That is correct.
1985.84-5630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.203,795.267,"Whether the District Court purported to review the report de novo or not, the only time that you get an appealable judgment is when the District Judge enters an order."
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,795.267,796.256,That's correct.
1985.84-5630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,796.256,801.22,"In any case, it is going to be a District Court judgment."
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,801.22,802.21,That's correct.
1985.84-5630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.21,808.845,And what do you say... why does that raise a problem under Article 3?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,808.845,815.088,"Well, to be honest with you, Judge, as you pointed out in your dissent in Northern Pipeline, I am not convinced that I know what--"
1985.84-5630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,815.088,818.621,You are taking a lot of your time on this Article 3 issue.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,819.921,820.862,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-5630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,830.199,831.15,"Well, it always is."
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,831.15,845.49,"That's correct, and since the District Court must review the magistrate's report, whether objections are filed or not, it seems to me that the Walters policy and the other circuits are wrong when they say that there is a waiver of the right to appeal, because--"
1985.84-5630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,845.49,848.202,You have consumed 17 minutes now on this point.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,861.808,863.23,--I would agree with you.
1985.84-5630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,867.673,869.345,May I ask one question before you go to your second point?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,869.345,869.654,--Certainly.
1985.84-5630,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.654,879.731,"Do you understand the Sixth Circuit rule to be that they think the statute compels a waiver, or that as a matter of practice in the Sixth Circuit we will enforce the waiver rule?"
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,879.731,894.28,"Well, their writing, the language that they said was, although you may file... objections is something that you may or may not do, we feel they felt that under the supervisor power they could force this issue by making it a rule in the Sixth Circuit."
1985.84-5630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,939.82,944.825,"Well, there may not be a difference after this case is decided."
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,944.825,946.254,Hopefully not.
1985.84-5630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1028.0,1032.675,"Well, you say you do not get one, but do you argue that the judge may nevertheless give one?"
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1032.675,1037.928,"No, I believe the judge may give... in fact, if the court... the court can do whatever it decides to do."
1985.84-5630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1055.439,1060.003,Did Judge Conti hear oral argument in this case after the magistrate's report?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1060.003,1061.282,"No, he did not--"
1985.84-5630,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1061.282,1071.66,So the thing was never set down on the District Court's docket in the sense of being kind cf a petition to review the magistrate's order.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1074.973,1079.344,"--Well, I will agree with you as far as the timetable is concerned."
1985.84-5630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1091.482,1094.074,Was this the same brief you gave the magistrate?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1094.074,1097.797,"Yes, so I mean when I file it it goes to Judge Conti."
1985.84-5630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1129.648,1134.66,"Aren't you going to argue that the statute forbids this, for heaven's sake?"
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1134.66,1138.353,"I thought I had, Your Honor, in the Article... in interpreting--"
1985.84-5630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.353,1141.325,"Well, Article 3 would make the statute irrelevant."
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1141.325,1154.584,"--Well, in my opinion the statute says, and right in conjunction, that you may file... the magistrate is to file a report and recommendations for final decision by the Judge, is what the statute says."
1985.84-5630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.584,1158.867,Isn't one of your arguments that the statute on its face and its legislative history forbids this result?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1158.867,1159.488,Yes.
1985.84-5630,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.488,1160.728,All right.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1178.95,1179.841,That's correct.
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1218.617,1220.419,One point.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1227.192,1231.466,"Let me make it clear, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1231.466,1233.028,That is what I am trying to do.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1233.028,1237.01,I would dearly have loved to file the objection because then I wouldn't be here having to argue--
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1237.01,1239.151,"Well, that is the only point that is here, isn't it?"
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1239.491,1239.801,--Yes.
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1240.883,1245.315,You want us to say that the rule of the circuit is wrong.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1245.315,1246.196,--That's correct.
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1246.196,1248.009,Unconstitutional.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1248.009,1250.961,"In my opinion, yes, based upon the decisions--"
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1250.961,1253.344,"Well, what part of the constitution does it violate?"
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1253.344,1263.062,"--It violates due process, and it violates Article 3 by practice of the policy, which is that you do not have... the District Court--"
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1263.062,1265.713,You mean Five?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1269.694,1271.246,"--Amendment Five and Fourteen, Your Honor."
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1271.246,1273.066,Five and Fourteen.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1276.329,1278.299,"In my opinion, a magistrate... not having a judge--"
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1278.299,1287.326,"Now, what else would you have filed with the Court under an objection more than the 20 pages that you filed?"
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1287.326,1287.836,--Nothing.
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1289.068,1295.611,"So, what are we complaining about other than that you just don't like filing a piece of paper?"
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1295.611,1299.334,"--Well, like I said, if I had to do it over again, I would."
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1314.734,1317.004,You say that you wouldn't file it again?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1317.004,1319.145,I said if I had to do it over again I would file them.
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1319.145,1321.388,Suppose we send it back.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1323.64,1325.249,"You tell me to file them, I will file them."
1985.84-5630,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1330.074,1332.295,I am still trying to find out what is here.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1332.295,1340.15,What is here is the question of whether or not the Sixth Circuit's determination in my case that I could not appeal from the District Court order is viable.
1985.84-5630,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1354.488,1359.994,"Mr. Stanley, was your failure to file objections intentional or an oversight?"
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1359.994,1365.047,"You have to understand, Justice Blackmun, I am an assault practitioner."
1985.84-5630,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1396.936,1398.567,So it was not an oversight.
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1398.567,1407.483,"No, it was simply a matter where I didn't feel that it would add anything to the controversy before Judge Conti by filing objections."
1985.84-5630,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1411.396,1426.968,"Mr. Stanley, how is conditioning an appeal in these cases on filing of objections any different than conditioning an appeal on the timely filing of a brief or payment of a filing fee or something of that kind?"
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1426.968,1433.181,"Well, I think it is different because, Number One, Congress has given a petitioner for a writ of habeas corpus the right to appeal."
1985.84-5630,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1435.072,1444.148,"Well, even so, can't the courts enforce a requirement filing memos and briefs on timely basis and so forth?"
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1444.148,1445.73,--Certainly.
1985.84-5630,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1445.73,1447.781,So why not this?
1985.84-5630,0,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,1447.781,1456.146,"Well, because this is where a Circuit Court is saying, we are not going to let you appeal because you didn't do something in the District Court, namely, file objections."
1985.84-5630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1506.978,1509.88,Very well.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1512.722,1528.812,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether a Federal Circuit Court may condition appellate review upon the filing of objections to the report and recommendation of a federal magistrate."
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1528.812,1531.974,"Mr. Drake, the way you state the question interests me."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1536.609,1537.159,No.
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1537.159,1540.62,You are saying it is a matter... each circuit can adopt its own rule.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1540.62,1545.134,"Yes, and I am saying the Sixth Circuit has adopted it under its supervisory powers."
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1546.256,1548.376,A permissible rule that is not required by statute.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1548.376,1550.287,"--A rule which is not only permissible, but--"
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.287,1551.198,Makes a lot of sense.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1551.198,1552.47,--Fosters Congressional intent.
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.434,1564.378,"And therefore it also follows, I guess, that it is not a jurisdictional rule."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1564.378,1566.241,It is definitely not a jurisdictional rule.
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1566.241,1569.753,"Because they didn't make it retroactive, so obviously they thought they had jurisdiction to go either way."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1569.753,1576.306,They made it prospective only to accommodate what I feel they perceive to be potential due process difficulties.
1985.84-5630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1576.306,1587.224,Do you think that... is their rule limited to the cases where the defendant gets notice?
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1587.224,1588.476,Absolutely.
1985.84-5630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1588.476,1591.631,And is that your position also?
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1591.631,1591.748,Yes.
1985.84-5630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1591.748,1594.332,"That if he doesn't get notice, there can be no waiver?"
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1594.332,1598.554,"The rule was promulgated in a case, United States versus Waltars, which is cited in the brief."
1985.84-5630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1604.208,1609.173,Then it is... you don't push for any wider waiver rule.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1609.173,1609.434,No.
1985.84-5630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1613.265,1619.129,So you... I take it the answer to Justice Stevens that other circuits could have just the contrary rule.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1619.129,1636.13,"The circuits could in their wisdom, I believe, though, if you look to the Congressional intent underlying the Magistrates Act, a circuit who declines to adopt the Sixth Circuit rule is essentially for reasons unknown to me fostering upon itself review de novo."
1985.84-5630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1636.13,1637.1,"But it would be permissible, you are saying."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1637.1,1638.181,It would be permissible.
1985.84-5630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1638.181,1644.275,You don't urge us then to try to make the rule uniform or not?
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1644.275,1651.101,"I think that if affirmance is given in this case, we might have more circuits adopting this rule in their own self-interest."
1985.84-5630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.293,1673.076,At least there is a question as to whether this was a proper exercise of the supervisory power.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1673.076,1674.826,I believe that is the only question before the Court.
1985.84-5630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1674.826,1680.81,"And Congress did indicate what a penalty for failure to file was, or is."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1680.81,1683.064,"As to the District Court, yes."
1985.84-5630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1683.064,1689.747,Why should a court impose a further penalty for failure to file?
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1689.747,1694.541,Because the purpose underlying the Magistrates Act... and it had had a checkered history.
1985.84-5630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1787.451,1798.088,"Suppose the 20-page paper that he filed, suppose the first page of it said I object for the following reasons."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1798.088,1804.472,"In other words, you are saying, suppose the objections would have been filed, Your Honor?"
1985.84-5630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1804.472,1807.034,"Suppose he said,"
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1820.662,1823.256,"You mean initially, when he initiated this litigation, Your Honor?"
1985.84-5630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1823.256,1824.325,Yes.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1824.325,1826.148,"No, Your Honor, I don't."
1985.84-5630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.148,1827.918,Didn't he file something with the District Court?
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1827.918,1830.71,"Your Honor, I think there is a misstatement or misunderstanding here."
1985.84-5630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1839.876,1842.267,What is this 20-page thing he is talking about?
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1842.267,1855.297,"--When he essentially filled out the form, the habeas corpus form, which is provided for in the rules, and he also attached thereto a brief reiterating the claims he has made in the state courts--"
1985.84-5630,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1855.297,1857.176,"You mean, that was a filing before the magistrate."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1857.176,1859.577,"--That was referred to the magistrate, yes."
1985.84-5630,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1859.577,1861.19,That was referred to the magistrate.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1861.19,1867.665,"Yes, and considered by the magistrate in conjunction with briefs filed by the state of Ohio and a very voluminous transcript."
1985.84-5630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1867.665,1871.636,What did he file with the District Court?
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1871.636,1874.768,"With the clerk's office, when he initiated this action--"
1985.84-5630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1874.768,1877.991,"Well, I... the District Court means clerk's office."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1877.991,1882.932,"--Right, he filed the petition and a brief in conjunction therewith."
1985.84-5630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1886.465,1891.55,"And after the magistrate ruled, he didn't file anything else."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1891.55,1894.553,"--Except for a motion for extension of time, he filed nothing."
1985.84-5630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1894.553,1895.601,He filed nothing.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1895.601,1896.182,Nothing.
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1910.272,1911.904,"Why wouldn't it be too late, then?"
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1914.826,1917.209,--The Sixth Circuit has never really addressed the issue.
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1917.209,1920.73,"--As far as we know, the Sixth Circuit rule seems to be an inflexible rule."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1921.972,1922.553,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1941.994,1946.068,--Let me just go back for a second to Justice Marshall's... I'm sorry... question.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1959.426,1962.929,The Sixth Circuit has never addressed it.
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.607,1978.84,"Well, that wouldn't even be pro forma, because they would have filed... you would have spelled out his argument."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,1980.152,1983.114,"--I think that in the case of a pro se applicant, that would be sufficient."
1985.84-5630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2046.765,2071.332,"Mr. Drake, what about a situation when the District Court sui sponte alters the finding or recommendation of the magistrate on, for example, a point of law, and no objections had been filled in a timely basis, but the District Court on its own reaches some legal conclusion different from the magistrate's recommendation."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2076.525,2080.789,"For instance, Your Honor, you are indicating perhaps Judge Conti would have granted the writ as to one of these claims?"
1985.84-5630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2080.789,2081.598,Yes.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2081.598,2107.225,"Had Judge Conti granted the writ as to one of these claims, and I here have to speculate to some degree, because it has never really arisen in the Sixth Circuit, but it would be my judgment the state of Ohio could appeal, that Mr. Stanely could appeal raising as the sole ground for affirmance that relied upon in the District Court, and could neither file cross appeal nor could he rely upon the other three grounds that were not considered by Judge Conti."
1985.84-5630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2112.378,2123.154,"And if a circuit nevertheless tried to apply the waiver rule, would there be anything in the statutory scheme or the Constitution to prevent it?"
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2123.154,2126.747,If the Sixth Circuit in the case where the writ is granted--
1985.84-5630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2126.747,2127.538,Yes.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2127.538,2128.38,--tried to--
1985.84-5630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2128.38,2130.23,Enforce a waiver.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2130.23,2134.802,"--I can't imagine myself ever making that argument, and I don't think the Sixth Circuit could do that."
1985.84-5630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2134.802,2143.24,"Well, is there anything in the statutes or the Constitution that would prohibit a circuit from having so stringent a rule of waiver?"
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2143.24,2146.261,Would prohibit it?
1985.84-5630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2158.468,2161.89,How specific do you think the notice must be?
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2161.89,2162.341,I think it--
1985.84-5630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2162.341,2164.271,Here it was quite specific--
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2164.271,2164.942,--I think the notice--
1985.84-5630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2164.942,2165.864,--but what if it weren't?
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2168.135,2169.276,--I think that--
1985.84-5630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2169.276,2173.708,That you might lose your right to appeal?
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2173.708,2186.686,"--Some Circuit Courts have had difficulty with this, and I think that the Sixth Circuit has taken the wiser course and mandated the notice be so specific that any child who really can read or write at all could understand that notice."
1985.84-5630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2208.261,2218.818,"Well, if there were no notice, or if the rule did not allow an appeal in the other circumstance, I suggest, does that raise due process concerns then, in your view?"
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2218.818,2220.219,If there were no notice?
1985.84-5630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.221,2251.701,"So far as notice, do you think that each individual attorney has to be advised by the government or by somebody, by the Court of their right to appeal from a judgment of the District Court to the Court of Appeals?"
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2251.701,2252.36,"No, Your Honor."
1985.84-5630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2275.237,2278.199,I thought you were saying it was constitutionally--
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2278.199,2284.132,"--I think notice is constitutionally mandated, the fact that you actually put it in every pleading, which is what happens in the Sixth Circuit."
1985.84-5630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.324,2291.849,"--Yes, but I thought your answer to Justice O'Connor's question was, if there weren't that sort of notice, there would be real constitutional implications."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2301.973,2314.673,"--Your Honor, I meant that for instance if a Circuit Court came up with some supervisory rule that took litigants by surprise and made it retroactive to appeals which were pending, I would have some difficulty--"
1985.84-5630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2314.673,2316.233,You are talking about kind of a judge-made rule.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2316.233,2325.441,"--Right, which is what we have here, is essentially a rule which the Sixth Circuit perceives, and I agree, is very congruent with the intents underlying the Magistrates Act."
1985.84-5630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2343.921,2349.405,But of course Judge Conti doesn't seem to have taken advantage of the latitude which you say Congress gave him.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2349.405,2353.138,He did not take full advantage of the latitude which Congress gave him.
1985.84-5630,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2359.672,2362.133,Maybe he enjoys reviewing magistrates' decisions.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2362.133,2365.065,"I honestly do not know, obviously, Your Honor, why he did what he did."
1985.84-5630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2365.065,2374.732,"Well, you certainly wouldn't need to reach any constitutional argument if notice weren't provided by the court rule."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2384.57,2385.709,I would agree.
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2516.785,2518.838,May I ask... may I interrupt for just a second?
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2518.838,2519.187,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2519.187,2534.066,Is it your view or the view in the Sixth Circuit that a District Judge acts improperly if when there are nc objections to the magistrate's report or file the District Judge decides on his own initiative to review the whole report and decide whether he agrees or disagrees with it?
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2534.066,2537.078,"I don't know what the Sixth Circuit view on that would be, Your Honor."
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2541.662,2547.376,"The force, the effect of the rule as I understand it, though, really doesn't have anything to do with what the District Judge may do."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2550.248,2550.538,Yes.
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2550.538,2552.989,Which is what Congress seemed to be thinking about mostly.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2557.053,2557.792,That's right.
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2557.792,2564.376,"--as I understand it from reviewing cases where there was a procedural default before the magistrate, and it is irrelevant what the District Court does."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2564.376,2565.247,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2565.247,2571.021,"Even if the District Court writes a great long opinion, they will say we won't bother reading the opinion because of the failure at the magistrate level."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2571.021,2574.143,I don't believe that they would say in each and every instance some inflexible--
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2574.143,2576.084,"Well, the general rule would be--"
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2576.084,2576.615,--Yes.
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2576.615,2580.508,"--But this rule does nothing to protect the District Judge, as I understand it."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2580.508,2587.081,The District Judge is... in point of fact what really happens is the District Judge ordinarily does not do what Judge Conti did here.
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2590.704,2595.677,"But the judge is free to do it if he has a new magistrate, he is not confident, or something, he could--"
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2595.677,2606.204,"If the Judge, for instance, got a new group of law clerks and wants to let them practice, he wants to review these magistrate reports, he certainly is privileged to do so, and I would have great problems if the Circuit Court told him he couldn't do that."
1985.84-5630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2606.204,2613.347,--The only time the judge is really required to give de novo review is if there is an objection.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2613.347,2613.787,Yes.
1985.84-5630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.787,2619.822,"And if the objection only runs... goes to part of the report, that is all he has to give de novo review of."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2619.822,2621.404,"Which... and this is a classic case, Your Honor."
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2647.801,2650.132,May I interrupt once more?
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2660.19,2660.879,Yes.
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2660.879,2662.811,But the Court of Appeals would not.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2671.447,2675.789,"Once again, Your Honor, I don't believe it has been erected as an inflexible jurisdiction."
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2675.789,2680.424,"I understand, but as a general rule, the Court of Appeals said, we don't have to look at this appeal because there is this failure here."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2684.457,2687.897,"You might well have a proffer here that Mr. Stanley was in the hospital, that he was ill."
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2687.897,2699.165,"The District Judge just might have been extremely conscientious and decided he wants to take a good, hard look at it, but the Court of Appeals would just say we don't have jurisdiction because they didn't follow this rule."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2699.165,2709.591,"Absent at least a proffer of cause and an indication of... you might even have, at last in the judgment of one of the judges below, some indication of manifest injustice, because he thought there was some merit."
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.367,2728.753,"No, but there was a proffer in the Court of Appeals, because in the Court of Appeals they said, look, there is a meritorious point here, and the Court of Appeals said, we are not going to listen to your argument because you have failed to object before the magistrate."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2728.753,2732.325,--But there was... Mr. Stanley never gave a proffer as to why he failed to do this.
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2732.325,2734.566,"Well, he didn't explain his failure to object."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2735.388,2738.41,"In a motion for rehearing, Your Honor, he said, ant I am quoting,"
1985.84-5630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2765.998,2767.54,Nobody is suggesting it is.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2777.277,2782.731,"--I don't think that the Court of Appeals is saying that the District Court can't look at it, Your Honor, if I understand your question."
1985.84-5630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2832.363,2850.945,"Well, Mr. Drake, the Sixth Circuit, as I understood it, acknowledged that it had jurisdiction of an appeal, but it dismissed it for failure to make the objection below, just as it might refuse to entertain an appeal on other issues that aren't raised below."
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2850.945,2853.007,"Your Honor, procedural default seems to--"
1985.84-5630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2853.007,2853.327,Isn't that right?
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2853.327,2853.527,--Yes.
1985.84-5630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2902.531,2903.222,Very well.
1985.84-5630,1,39112,richard_david_drake,,2903.222,2904.143,Thank you.
1985.84-5630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2904.143,2905.653,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Stanley?"
1985.84-5630,2,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,2905.653,2906.624,Very briefly.
1985.84-5630,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.72,2946.66,"But you don't say it is a jurisdictional rule, do you?"
1985.84-5630,2,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,2946.66,2950.312,"In my opinion, form over substance, it is a jurisdictional rule."
1985.84-5630,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3022.141,3025.364,"Mr. Stanley, did you address the waiver issue before the Court of Appeals?"
1985.84-5630,2,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,3025.364,3036.681,"No, it was never addressed, and I might say that I was ill on the day of oral argument, and after consultation with his predecessor from the Attorney General has agreed that we could waive oral argument."
1985.84-5630,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3036.681,3041.335,"Well, you did not raise the... issue in your brief."
1985.84-5630,2,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,3041.335,3042.206,I didn't.
1985.84-5630,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3044.588,3045.937,You filed no reply brief.
1985.84-5630,2,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,3045.937,3046.257,No.
1985.84-5630,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3046.257,3049.129,And you agreed not to argue the case orally.
1985.84-5630,2,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,3049.129,3050.799,Because I was sick on that day.
1985.84-5630,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3050.799,3051.96,CA Six never heard this argument.
1985.84-5630,2,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,3051.96,3052.411,Pardon?
1985.84-5630,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3052.411,3054.612,The Court of Appeals never heard this argument.
1985.84-5630,2,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,3054.612,3060.376,"I filed the petition then for rehearing making this argument, and they denied it, and that is what bring us to this Court."
1985.84-5630,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3060.376,3061.418,The petition for rehearing?
1985.84-5630,2,20074,christopher_danahy_stanley,,3061.418,3063.708,"Yes, petition for rehearing from their denial."
1985.84-5630,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3065.931,3066.792,"Thank you, gentlemen."
