1992.92-102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.088,"We'll hear argument now in Number 92-102, William Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.--"
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,10.949,13.751,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.92-102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,338.445,352.333,"Do you say that even under the Frye test this evidence would be admissible, or as we take the case it's either Frye applies or it doesn't?"
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,352.333,367.294,"Well, it was the contention below, the Ninth Circuit having already adopted the Frye case before this case, the petitioners were obliged to argue to the Ninth Circuit that this evidence is admissible even under the general acceptance test of Frye's--"
1992.92-102,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,367.294,368.756,What base... is that issue here?
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,368.756,393.162,"--It is here only in the sense that the sole reason the Ninth Circuit gave for saying that this was not generally accepted was its conclusion, again not drawn from the record, that scientists will not accept the opinions of experts and their methodologies unless those experts have published and had peer review of the opinions that they proffer."
1992.92-102,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,484.814,504.278,"In making that argument, Mr. Gottesman, I hope you will address whether under Rule 702 the words, ""scientific knowledge"", tell us anything about what's required."
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,538.259,544.994,"--Well, let me jump ahead to that, Your Honor, although I do want to ultimately get back to laying a firmer foundation."
1992.92-102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,637.765,638.647,"Yes, but you--"
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,654.087,657.05,--Yes.
1992.92-102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,680.915,683.529,And that's a preliminary decision to be made by the trial judge.
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,683.529,705.455,"Absolutely, and in this case the record shows without contradiction that the facts and data upon which these experts relied are indeed precisely the facts and data upon which all experts rely in making determinations of whether it is likelier than not that a particular toxin is causing--"
1992.92-102,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,705.455,717.272,"So it's your position that once a witness is qualified as an expert, he can testify to anything within the area of his expertise."
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,717.272,723.506,--He... assuming that what he's testifying to is what the court needs help on.
1992.92-102,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,727.1,731.664,"Well, I, you know, assume we weren't interested in weather conditions in this case."
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,731.664,731.914,--Right.
1992.92-102,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,732.98,755.629,"So it's a matter of relevance, but within the area of causation with respect to birth defects, once any of these experts were qualified as a witness, they could testify as to matters of causation without reference to the methodology of the studies they relied upon."
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,755.629,758.731,"--I think the answer is yes and no, Your Honor."
1992.92-102,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,829.031,832.531,Are there any other rules of evidence that qualify?
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,833.633,833.813,Right.
1992.92-102,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,833.813,836.044,"--That you'd have to look at, and the second is?"
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,836.044,838.815,"The other, and I think the more important safeguard, is not in the rules of evidence."
1992.92-102,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,870.227,891.172,"Well, but before we get to that point, I notice that section 702 that Justice O'Connor inquired about is not part of your calculus, so that once the expert is qualified, subject to the other two sections you mention, he can testify to any area within his expertise whether or not it is based on studies."
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,891.172,898.556,"Well, Your Honor, no... 703, we suggest, is... 703 is the provision in the Federal rules--"
1992.92-102,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,898.556,901.346,But you give no effect to 702 in this calculus.
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,901.346,901.957,"--We do, Your Honor."
1992.92-102,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,951.655,955.436,"Yes, but both refer to scientific knowledge, in effect."
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,994.575,1009.325,"Your Honor, there is, I think, a confusion of two interfaces that I would like to suggest will explain the role of the arguments that Your Honor has just referred to about things have to be tested and validated and the like."
1992.92-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.298,1130.904,And maybe the issue is whether the judge can review the expert's determination about the probabilities in this area of uncertainty.
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1136.84,1137.131,--Indeed.
1992.92-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.131,1158.125,"The data, you acknowledge, by reason of 703 has to be of a sort that the community would normally rely upon, but there remains the last step, and that is the expert's applying these data to the scientific problem that is relevant to the case and coming up with his conclusion."
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1173.185,1188.476,"Your Honor, yes, subject to Rule 403 and subject to the power that a judge always exercises as a matter of substantive law to say that no reasonable juror could possibly be persuaded in light of the imbalance of the others--"
1992.92-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1188.476,1194.279,"Well but, no, that just goes to whether his testimony is refuted by a lot of other testimony."
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1194.279,1194.45,--That's right.
1992.92-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1194.45,1198.463,"I mean, if his is the only testimony, presumably the jury could accept it."
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1200.152,1208.217,Section 401 defines relevance as anything that makes... that tends to show... I don't... I forget the exact word.
1992.92-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1208.217,1210.651,It means evidence having any tendency--
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1210.651,1211.042,"Any tendency, right."
1992.92-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.042,1217.737,--To make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it--
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1217.737,1218.037,That's right.
1992.92-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1218.037,1219.049,--Would be without the evidence.
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1219.049,1220.309,"Now, let me suggest what we have--"
1992.92-102,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1220.309,1235.509,"Now, can't... on the basis of that, can't the court make a judgment that even though the data is of the sort the scientific community would accept, and even though this individual has wonderful credentials, it really just doesn't parse?"
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1235.509,1238.611,"--Well, Your Honor, I could imagine that there would be a case such as that."
1992.92-102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1361.796,1367.291,"Did the court of appeals, Mr. Gottesman, actually say that you had to prove to a 95-per-cent certainty?"
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1367.291,1368.572,"--It's not quite clear, Your Honor."
1992.92-102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.854,1371.076,I thought you said a minute ago that it did.
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1372.658,1373.019,"Well, I'm sorry."
1992.92-102,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1451.034,1493.953,"Mr. Gottesman, is it fair to say that what you are telling us is that once an expert has been qualified as an expert in the field, and once the expert has at least made a showing or a showing is at least possible that the expert has based some opinion on the kind of facts and data that 703 refer to, that the testimony of the expert himself, that he is competent to express an opinion on probability... i.e., the 51 percent or better chance... is sufficient to satisfy the foundation or knowledge requirement of 702?"
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1493.953,1495.082,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-102,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1495.543,1505.591,"So that any expert who says, I can testify to a probability, necessarily qualifies as competent to... or as having satisfied the foundational requirement of 702."
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1506.593,1517.853,"--Yes, subject to the back... again, assuming that he has satisfied 703 and subject to the back-ups of 403 and the power of the court to direct a verdict in appropriate cases."
1992.92-102,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1517.853,1533.54,"So, Mr. Gottesman, you in essence reject the view of, let's say, the Third Circuit in the Downing case and the view expressed here by the Solicitor General that there are certain foundation requirements the court would look at?"
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1533.54,1536.453,"I would say that we believe that Congress rejected it, Your Honor."
1992.92-102,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1553.99,1572.512,"It seems to me, counsel, that 703 simply says that underlying background facts and data are admissible if the expert reasonably relied upon them, but that does not go to the question of the qualification of the expert to speak to the subject under 702."
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1572.512,1576.155,"Well, the qualifications in this case have not been challenged, Your Honor."
1992.92-102,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1591.928,1596.111,But... maybe I'll just modify Justice Kennedy's question slightly.
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1629.043,1630.505,"That's correct, Your Honor, and we think the--"
1992.92-102,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1630.505,1644.565,"Every expert basically is guaranteed qualification at least, or is guaranteed success on foundation, so long as it is his own opinion that he does have a foundation."
1992.92-102,0,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1644.565,1648.409,"--And it is within the area of his expertise, that's correct, subject again to 403."
1992.92-102,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1650.682,1652.993,"Very well, Mr. Gottesman."
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,1654.774,1660.239,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-102,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1813.574,1818.678,Is that formulation that you've just given us a modification of the Frye rule?
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,1818.678,1829.063,"--Your Honor, it is a specification, an explication of the approach which the Frye rule exemplifies."
1992.92-102,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1829.744,1832.556,That sounds to me like a modification.
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,1833.577,1836.139,"--Well, if you will, it's a modification."
1992.92-102,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1836.139,1853.33,"And I think it's important because one reading of the Ninth Circuit is that it... opinion, not the only reading, but I think one reading of the Ninth Circuit is that it relied on the Frye rule per se, without this modification or explication that we're discussing."
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,1853.33,1861.895,"Well, as to the opinion of the Ninth Circuit, I think that is virtually... that opinion is virtually a summary affirmance."
1992.92-102,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2057.649,2060.493,Who was the author of the Frye opinion?
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2060.493,2065.288,"You had me there, Mr. Justice... Justice Blackmun."
1992.92-102,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2070.293,2071.813,So should I.
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2074.655,2085.013,"May I return to the publication and peer review factor, because a factor is all that it is."
1992.92-102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2155.398,2162.453,"Well, that... Mr. Fried, that's fine if you're trying to get a Ph.D., but how do the rules of evidence justify that requirement?"
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2162.453,2170.809,"The rules of evidence, Mr. Chief Justice, require that the testimony be to scientific knowledge."
1992.92-102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2190.723,2194.106,How can we know that on this record?
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2194.106,2216.33,"I think that is a matter of which judicial notice may be taken, that replication, that the community of science is the test of what is science is one of the most elementary facts of which educated men and women are aware, that science is not personal opinion."
1992.92-102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2219.772,2224.855,"Mr. Fried, could I ask you a question about the studies in this case, the animal studies as an example?"
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2240.696,2248.32,"These animal studies, if properly conducted, and some of them were, are scientific knowledge, without doubt."
1992.92-102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.894,2301.177,Just a little more... just stick with the animal studies for a moment.
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2311.714,2335.291,--Animal data are not reasonably relied on by experts in the field to reach a conclusion about human teratogenicity at least in the face of an overwhelming burden of human data which points in the opposite direction.
1992.92-102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2355.898,2360.391,"Mr. Fried, again, how are we supposed to know this?"
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2385.309,2409.314,"--Well, there were introduced among other things a number of learned treatises on exactly this point about he importance of human studies in this... in the birth defects area, and how human studies trump animal studies, so there were... learned treatises were introduced."
1992.92-102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2409.314,2410.115,This was introduced in this case?
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2410.115,2411.516,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2411.516,2412.637,In the trial court.
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2412.637,2421.543,And they were also introduced in a number of the other case whose records were submitted in this case.
1992.92-102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2472.869,2476.281,"Well, what does Rule 104(a) say?"
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2476.281,2501.718,"Rule 104(a) allows the trial court, indeed, requires the trial court to make a preliminary foundational inquiry whether a proper foundation has been laid for any testimony, whether it's opinion testimony based on personal observation, or scientific testimony."
1992.92-102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2508.202,2510.376,Did the court of appeals rely on 104(a)?
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2510.376,2516.069,"I believe it cited 104(a), but I can't say that with certainty."
1992.92-102,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2526.878,2542.428,"Mr. Fried, I take it that your answer to the questions of the Chief Justice and Justice Stevens are that you place principally reliance on Rule 703, and you say that this was not evidence on which an expert could reasonably rely."
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2550.953,2554.294,--It allows... Rule 703--
1992.92-102,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2554.294,2557.997,And that gives no really necessary play to Rule 702 at all.
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2557.997,2566.295,"--Well, it is our position, elaborated in the brief, that 703 confirms and works along with 702."
1992.92-102,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2604.69,2614.864,"Mr. Fried, may I inquire what the standard of appellate review is of decisions to exclude scientific evidence testimony?"
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2619.158,2625.192,--The general criteria which were stated in the courts here are criteria of law.
1992.92-102,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2665.32,2666.031,I'm a little lost.
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2668.705,2672.708,--It's an abuse of discretion standard in a particular case.
1992.92-102,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2690.769,2701.117,"Can you also tell me whether the so-called Frye principle was followed in civil cases generally, or was it just in the criminal field?"
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2701.117,2721.98,"I am informed... actually, I'm informed by petitioners' counsel... that there are no instances of Frye being cited in civil cases prior to the Federal rules, but it is also the case that expert testimony had not become an important problem at that point."
1992.92-102,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2738.681,2739.362,Mr.--
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2755.051,2764.739,"In our view, the standard offered by the Solicitor General does not differ from the standard we offer."
1992.92-102,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2822.457,2836.257,"Mr. Fried, there is, I take it, a difference between the SG's and Judge Becker's view on the Frye test on the admissibility of an opinion based upon what the Solicitor General called a significant minority view."
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2838.57,2843.853,"Yes, and I think that the Solicitor General is correct there."
1992.92-102,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2958.612,2966.096,"So the significance of the minority view is in part a function of circumstantial evidence, in a way."
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2974.374,2977.376,"Well, I don't believe Your Honor--"
1992.92-102,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2977.376,2981.67,"I.e., has the person stepped up to the plate and subjected this to scrutiny or has the person not?"
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,2981.67,2984.882,"--Well, it's not a comment on the behavior of the witness."
1992.92-102,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3022.538,3024.338,Let me ask you a nuts-and-bolts question.
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3039.618,3051.596,"Oh, I think quite clearly that in this case there was a judgment, and that judgment was well-based, and the decision should be affirmed."
1992.92-102,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3051.596,3071.29,"Should we adopt the Solicitor General's... let's... and I'm not suggesting that I'm about to do it, but if I were, should I take this opportunity to urge adoption of the Solicitor General's standards, or should I send this case... affirm this case with a view that the Solicitor General's standard is open for development in the lower Federal courts?"
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3071.29,3088.451,"Well, the most striking thing is the Solicitor General in applying his standard concludes that the decision should be affirmed and that the Solicitor General's standards clearly lead to the denial of admissibility in this case."
1992.92-102,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3132.149,3137.292,But those cases weren't parsing the... based on the Solicitor General's standards.
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3137.292,3141.666,The Brock case is very revealing in this.
1992.92-102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3161.693,3166.216,"Mr. Fried, is it not true that in Brock they didn't hold the testimony inadmissible, they held it insufficient?"
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3166.216,3170.846,They held it insufficient because they were acting on JNOV.
1992.92-102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3174.66,3177.992,"Under Brock, then, we would have to assume this testimony was admissible."
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3177.992,3180.904,--I don't believe that that assumption is--
1992.92-102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3180.904,3182.086,"At last, that's what the Ninth Circuit said about Brock."
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3182.086,3187.569,--Brock was a sufficiency rather than an admissibility case.
1992.92-102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3214.117,3231.518,"Well, that may be, but I suppose one possible disposition in this very case, if we weren't sure about the admissibility but we thought they'd applied the wrong standard, would be to send it back and either say, review the admissibility issue again, or, the evidence is admissible but you may still grant your summary judgment for the defendants, as they did in Brock."
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3231.518,3242.124,"--Well, it's striking that the Brock court as well as the Ninth Circuit treated those two standards as really interchangeable."
1992.92-102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3261.648,3268.563,But are you taking the position that if we held the testimony to be admissible we must necessarily say the motion for summary judgment should be denied?
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3268.563,3272.707,"Well, I would certainly hesitate a while before I said that."
1992.92-102,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3272.707,3273.817,"I would think you would, yes."
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3275.99,3287.687,"I would say that the Ninth Circuit and the Fifth Circuit were treating those as interchangeable issues, as was the Turpin decision in the Sixth Circuit on summary judgment."
1992.92-102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3291.0,3304.777,"Well, was it a submission on summary judgment that summary judgment should be granted because the plaintiff could not come up with admissible testimony?"
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3304.777,3307.319,That was the decision in this case.
1992.92-102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.319,3307.499,Yes.
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3307.499,3309.61,That was the decision in the Lynch case.
1992.92-102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3309.61,3309.791,Yes.
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3309.791,3325.643,"That was the decision in the Richardson case, and those cases also were incorporated by reference by the Ninth Circuit quite explicitly, and they did not... and they were not summary judgment, they were indeed admissibility cases."
1992.92-102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3325.643,3331.857,"Well, do you think those cases... all of those cases spoke your language?"
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3333.489,3344.535,"Well, I don't know whether they would speak my language in another case, but what they said was to emphasize a factor which is dispositive here."
1992.92-102,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3368.161,3370.805,Why do you think this factor is determinative in this case?
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3370.805,3380.903,"It is determinative because the petitioners seek to overcome and, indeed, use published peer review material."
1992.92-102,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3382.285,3386.466,"Professor Fried, there are Harvard Law School professors on both sides of this case, aren't there?"
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3386.466,3390.19,Yes.
1992.92-102,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3394.483,3398.606,I thought you could lead us out of the wilderness and get together up there.
1992.92-102,1,18942,charles_fried,,3398.606,3400.237,"I hoped I had, Your Honor."
1992.92-102,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3400.858,3402.357,"Thank you, Mr. Fried."
1992.92-102,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3404.55,3405.309,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.92-102,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3471.099,3472.3,"Thank you, Mr. Gottesman."
1992.92-102,2,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,3472.3,3472.48,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.92-102,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3472.48,3474.042,The case is submitted.
