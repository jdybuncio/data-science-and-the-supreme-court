2017.16-1519,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.28,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 16-1519, Lagos versus the United States. Mr. Geyser."
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,7.28,33.8,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act covers the cost of lost income and necessary child care, transportation, and other expenses, while participating in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attending proceedings related to that offense. That language does not cover the cost of hiring four law firms, a consulting firm, and forensic experts for a private investigation in bankruptcy litigation."
2017.16-1519,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,71.92,87.52,"If we -- if we accept your view, wouldn't there be a perverse incentive? We would be telling creditors don't -- don't investigate immediately."
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,87.52,88.16,"No, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,123.64,125.68,Is there a difference -- excuse me.
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,137.88,144.12,I -- I think Section 523 of Title 11 may make a civil order non-dischargeable.
2017.16-1519,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,147.32,156.72,Do you -- do you know if the costs incurred in this case would be also -- also non-dischargeable in a civil action filed by the employer?
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,156.72,161.32,"I think under Section 523 of -- of the Bankruptcy Code, it may not be dischargeable."
2017.16-1519,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,168.24,183.68,"What -- what if the government approached GE and said, look, this is a very complicated financial fraud, we're busy with some other stuff, we'd like you to go ahead and investigate it to the extent you can, and they'd used the results of their investigation in their prosecution?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,183.68,192.24,"That's still not covered, Mr. Chief Justice, because, if you look at the specific enumeration of expenses, Congress here invoked the classic ejusdem generis formulation."
2017.16-1519,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,208.76,224.24,"It's a pretty open phrase, ""other expenses incurred during participation in the investigation."" I don't know why, if the government's essentially delegating its responsibility, that those expenses wouldn't be covered."
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,224.24,225.52,"Well, two reasons, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,239.68,243.48,How would you define the common denominator of those expenses?
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,243.48,247.16,I think the common denominator is clear from both the context and the terms used.
2017.16-1519,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,268.68,275.96,"Well, what about hiring a lawyer to be a witness in a governmental investigation? Would that be covered in your view?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,275.96,283.72,"We don't think it is under our broader argument, Justice Gorsuch, because, again, hiring a lawyer is not like child care, transportation."
2017.16-1519,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,289.68,306.68,"Well, maybe this is the same question as Justice Gorsuch had, but suppose the FBI -- they're a federal investigating agency -- say we're coming in and we want statements from all of your officers and we're going to be questioning all of your officers; and the company then hires an attorney to assist."
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,308.36,310.6,"Again, Your Honor, under our broad --"
2017.16-1519,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,310.6,317.8,"I mean, it -- it sounds to me like this is another expense incurred during participation in the investigation."
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,317.8,322.08,"Again, under our broader theory, no, because it's not the kind of expense that Congress had in mind."
2017.16-1519,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,349.16,353.4,"Well, does it -- that's the -- I think it's difficult."
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,381.48,382.04,Sure.
2017.16-1519,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,382.04,382.92,Okay.
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,414.36,416.68,I -- I believe Congress did because --
2017.16-1519,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,416.68,417.12,Why?
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,417.12,420.72,"Well, they -- they didn't just stumble across the language in subsection (4)."
2017.16-1519,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,420.76,442.16,"No, no, no, but I'm asking you why would someone, taking a statute that previously allowed restitution to Sam for Sam's expense, want to stop that in a statutory change, by the way, that was meant to expand the scope of restitution?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,442.16,443.36,"A -- a few points, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,464.44,478.68,"Is there anything -- since I'm interested in history, is there anything in the legislative history that suggests that this change of language was intended to diminish the scope of the restitution?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,478.68,501.8,"The -- I don't think there's anything either way on that particular point, but what there is, and I do think this is important, Congress specifically raised concerns about things like attorneys' fees that would end up leading to protracted, complicated, fact-intensive disputes that would slow the efficiency of sentencing proceedings. This statute, because it's mandatory, applies in tens of thousands of proceedings every year."
2017.16-1519,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,570.16,592.24,"Suppose the -- suppose the statute did not refer to lost income and necessary child care, transportation expenses, and simply authorized restitution for ""other expenses incurred during participation in the investigation."" Would you still have this -- would you still win?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,592.24,603.4,"We -- in this case, we would, Your Honor, because GE Capital's expenses predated the government investigation. So any expenses were not incurred during participation in the government's investigation."
2017.16-1519,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,603.4,608.32,"Well, how -- you're reading a word into that text, in the government's investigation."
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,608.32,610.88,"I think that that word is apparent by the context, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,623.28,636.68,"You seem to suggest that there's a very sharp line where you can tell the precise point at which the government is beginning investigation and the prior -- prior times when they hadn't. I mean, it's more of a fluid situation, right? The government gets a report."
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,650.48,650.8,I --
2017.16-1519,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,650.8,653.4,"I mean, does it begin when they get a complaint?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,653.4,662.04,"Well, again, Your Honor, under our broader theory, I think that actually would avoid those problems because it wouldn't include things like private investigation and private investigatory work."
2017.16-1519,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,667.68,667.88,Right.
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,669.68,670.12,Sure.
2017.16-1519,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,670.12,672.96,-- which is it has to be during the government investigation.
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,672.96,677.64,"Well, it -- it still has to be during the -- at a minimum, you think an investigation has to be opened."
2017.16-1519,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,681.96,682.32,"Well, they --"
2017.16-1519,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,682.32,702.16,"Well, why does it have to be the government -- the federal government? What if the offense is initially investigated by state authorities and then, at a later point, it's determined that it will be prosecuted by the federal government? Would you say that the expenses incurred during the participation in the state investigation are not covered?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,702.16,703.4,"We would say that, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,727.4,732.04,"The investigation. But you're -- I mean, you're reading a lot out of this statute and you're reading a lot into it."
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,732.04,733.08,Well --
2017.16-1519,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,733.08,742.24,-- the investigation. What -- what -- suppose it's initially investigated by one U.S. Attorney's office and then it's taken over by another U.S. Attorney's office.
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,746.0,747.44,"In -- in that case, I don't think so, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,763.56,764.04,But did --
2017.16-1519,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,764.04,764.84,"State, federal."
2017.16-1519,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,764.84,782.96,"-- did I understand your response correctly that, if this were a case where the government did request an internal investigation, if it came -- it was done at the government's request, then the attorneys' fees would be included?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,782.96,798.08,"No, Your Honor, because, again, under ejusdem generis, we don't think that Congress meant for attorneys' fees to be included in this provision. If you reject that proposition, then, in this case, at least it would be closer to an expense incurred during participation in the government's investigation."
2017.16-1519,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,855.68,878.52,"Suppose the federal -- the -- the -- the federal investigators request the company to bring officers or employees who are located in other parts of the country to a particular office to be questioned, or suppose they ask them to go through the company's records to find certain documents, and the company does that and incurs expenses. Are -- is that covered?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,878.52,879.92,The -- the former would be covered.
2017.16-1519,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,910.48,925.96,"I -- I don't quite understand that answer, that if someone at the request of the FBI goes through company records and incurs perhaps quite an expense in doing that, that is not participation in the government's investigation?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,925.96,930.44,"Well, again, Your Honor, there it would be participation during the government's investigation."
2017.16-1519,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,981.04,986.24,"Why not? Meaning, it is a proceeding, bankruptcy."
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1002.6,1009.76,"Well, I -- I have two responses to that, Your Honor. The -- the first is that the fees here were not just for attending hearings, attending the proceedings."
2017.16-1519,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1044.4,1045.04,Is there something --
2017.16-1519,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1045.04,1061.68,"What about the government's alternative theory that -- that is, that the professional fees fit under the 3663A(b)(1) category, property lost as a result of the offense?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1061.68,1063.4,"A -- a -- a few responses there, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1180.36,1191.48,Are the expenses for bankruptcy here related to the work of the attorneys or the attendance of corporate officers at the hearing?
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1191.48,1217.16,"Oh, Your Honor, if you look at pages 28 and 29 of the Joint Appendix, you'll see that these are the professional fees, including pretty hefty charges, in the millions, for providing consulting advice on whether they think Dry Van, the company that was the -- the subject of the fraud -- whether they could survive as a going concern. This is trying to decide how to litigate and recover the case in bankruptcy. It's not even clear that there were hearings that people attended."
2017.16-1519,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1221.2,1230.04,"Well, what about that small subset of fees, if there were any like that, the fees that we charge because we sat in a -- a courtroom during a proceeding?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1230.04,1238.24,"That -- that would at least satisfy the term ""attendance,"" but I was -- my second reason that -- that I didn't get to is that it's still attendance, we think, at criminal proceedings."
2017.16-1519,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1241.0,1249.92,"But why isn't a bankruptcy related to the criminal -- I mean, it's -- it's -- it's related to the offense, right? So why is it related to the offense?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1249.92,1263.16,"Well, I -- I think if you read the statute as a whole and you look at (b)(4) with all of its terms -- and this is a point that Judge Higginson made below under noscitur a sociis -- all the terms here are talking about proceedings related to the criminal action."
2017.16-1519,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1341.76,1352.36,"What are -- what are proceedings related to the offense, other than proceedings in the prosecution of the offense?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1352.36,1361.04,"I think, Your Honor, that the proceedings could be things like a grand jury hearing before they've, say, had -- issued an indictment."
2017.16-1519,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1364.88,1368.12,"Well, those -- those would be proceedings in the prosecution."
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1368.12,1376.64,"Well, it -- it could be in the prosecution, but I think Congress there was trying to make sure that any proceeding related to the criminal prosecution would be covered."
2017.16-1519,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1376.96,1390.8,"Well, they used the term ""prosecution"" earlier in the provision. If they wanted to limit it to proceedings in the prosecution, why wouldn't they use the same term again? Why would they use this broader formulation, ""related to the offense""?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1390.8,1403.76,"Well, again, Your Honor, I -- I could see someone thinking there's a distinction between a hearing that is determining if there's sufficient evidence to issue an indictment, so the prosecution hasn't yet commenced, and proceedings after the indictment, where it has commenced."
2017.16-1519,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1403.76,1404.0,Okay.
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1409.52,1428.88,"There -- there could be, depending on the offense, other types of proceedings, but, again, I think this is Congress trying to make sure that if a witness has to show up and testify to advance the government's work, then their expenses are covered when they're those incidental out-of-pocket expenses. If Congress wanted to, again, cover things like attorneys' fees or provide a full amount of restitution, they knew exactly how to do it."
2017.16-1519,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1429.24,1436.84,"At the outset, you said that there are -- I forget if you said tens of thousands or thousands of these proceedings a year?"
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1436.84,1451.2,"If you look to page 17 of the government's brief, they say there are tens of thousands of proceedings under the MVRA every year, which is exactly a reason that Congress would not want to burden district judges and burden the sentencing process with these fact-intensive disputes."
2017.16-1519,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1451.2,1455.4,The -- one of the items that you're entitled to recover as the victim is lost income.
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1462.04,1468.32,"In that, I think it would depend on the situation and what exactly the corporation is doing in the proceeding."
2017.16-1519,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1482.24,1502.32,"Can you say participation includes participation where the government investigation doesn't start until after you've finished, but they incorporate everything you've done? Sam Spade puts on his resume: I participated in their -- in their investigation, the government's."
2017.16-1519,0,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,1516.52,1521.0,I don't think that's -- I don't think that's an expense incurred during participation.
2017.16-1519,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1537.84,1541.88,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Huston."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1541.88,1561.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act enables the victim of a crime to recover for its participation in the investigation of the defendant's offense."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1567.4,1574.16,"You have to read the investigation or prosecution -- you have to read them together, not singularly."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1574.16,1583.32,"Well, I think, Your Honor, the statute reflects the fact that from the standpoint of a victim, it encompasses the ordinary chronology of events in which a victim would be expected to participate."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1588.32,1591.36,"Actually, that does happen the reverse way."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1597.04,1597.16,I --
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1597.16,1613.4,"I think it's a closer call on whether in that situation -- and if they ask the company to look into something it wasn't aware of, whether that's participation. Putting that aside, it doesn't necessarily follow that an investigation by a company always precedes the prosecution."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1613.4,1614.52,It doesn't always precede.
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1619.6,1622.4,The typical way is the government prosecutes -- investigates.
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1622.4,1625.72,"I think -- well, I -- it's true, but it's not always true, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1639.76,1645.64,"That's why I don't understand the statute, because you have a big problem, I think, with the language of the statute."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1670.8,1681.92,"Your Honor, I think that what the statute reflects, again, is the fact that victims routinely incur expenses in internal investigations that uncover invaluable evidence of crimes."
2017.16-1519,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1698.16,1698.48,Is it --
2017.16-1519,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1698.48,1699.0,Mr. Huston --
2017.16-1519,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1699.0,1709.44,-- is it your contention that all of the $4 million spent on this internal investigation was necessary for the prosecution of the case or just part of it?
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1709.44,1714.96,"Well, necessary for the investigation or prosecution or proceedings related to the offense, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1720.4,1723.44,"Well, if that's so, what -- what's there to limit extreme expenditures?"
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1723.44,1723.96,The word --
2017.16-1519,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1723.96,1728.0,"You want to say, well, let's -- let's -- let's -- hire two law firms, this is a big case."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1728.0,1732.88,"Certainly, Your Honor. The word ""necessary"" is also in the statute. The expenses have to be necessary."
2017.16-1519,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1742.16,1778.8,"Counsel, you say that the bankruptcy was a proceeding related to the offense because fraud was at issue there too. And -- and maybe this is a clearer-cut case, but there are going to be plenty where the reasons for the bankruptcy are going to be in dispute, and we're going to invite district judges to engage in long collateral proceedings over whether something is or isn't related enough to the offense. What do we do about that? And, relatedly, you know, this statute covers a lot of different kinds of crimes, including violent crimes."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1796.12,1807.6,"Justice Gorsuch, I think that we expect the proceedings related to the offense clause of this statute to be narrow, outside the context of criminal proceedings. That is certainly the mine-run placeholder --"
2017.16-1519,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1807.6,1809.6,"Well, I mean, this is a civil bankruptcy proceeding."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1814.6,1820.68,"It's -- it's different in this respect, Your Honor: GE Capital was really dragged into these bankruptcy proceedings."
2017.16-1519,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1823.96,1836.8,"What if they initiated involuntary bankruptcy proceedings for the very same reason? Same result, I assume, in the government's view because you -- you take such a purposivist account of the statute, you know, and let's make sure everybody gets everything."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1836.8,1840.84,"Well, I -- I -- Your Honor, I think the statute reflects that that is its purpose."
2017.16-1519,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1845.12,1865.52,"I understand that. But I was kind of surprised to see a brief from the government of the United States go on for so many pages about purpose in very generic terms before actually getting to the terms of the statute, the language. And I -- I -- I -- again, why -- why wouldn't my divorce case or the involuntary bankruptcy meet the same purpose test you've articulated here?"
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1865.52,1867.92,"I don't think the test is strictly purposivist, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1878.72,1895.92,"So what do I do with the fact that statutes of restitution passed at an identical time to this statute used your words, used the words: The victim's entitled to the damages proximately caused by the offense."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1935.92,1937.08,"Your Honor, I want to be very --"
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1937.08,1944.84,I have -- I think I have to give different meaning to different statutory terms that were passed at the identical time.
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1944.84,1945.76,"We agree, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1982.84,1984.48,That's what those other statutes said.
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,1984.48,2012.68,"They -- well, that's -- they say that, Your Honor, but in the MVRA, Congress incorporated the exact same text, Section 3664(f)(1)(A), which is incorporated into this statute, the MVRA, by Section 3663A(d). Those -- that -- that provision of Section 3664 is what expresses that in each case of restitution, restitution is to be awarded for the full amount of the victim's losses. Now, again, it's not the case that it's the full amount, full stop."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2015.36,2015.88,All right.
2017.16-1519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2016.88,2048.8,"But what about the -- the general premise of our system that expenses doesn't include attorneys' fees, that people who incur attorneys' fees, that's their expense, that doesn't get shifted away? There is the general presumption that if Congress wants attorneys' fees to be awarded, it will not say something like expenses; it will be specific that attorneys' fees are covered."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2048.8,2061.88,"If I might make two points about that, Your Honor. The first is that I don't really think the American rule of attorneys' fees has much bearing on this case because that's a rule about structuring correct incentives in civil litigation."
2017.16-1519,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2113.48,2120.52,You're also going to get all of the child care and transportation. Is that your opinion?
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2120.52,2121.24,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2126.4,2148.8,"Well, it seems odd that this investigation could go on for quite a while, and during that time, it's the company's investigation, it goes on for several months, child care -- child care for, I guess, anybody called up, and transportation."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2150.28,2150.96,"It is, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2167.68,2169.48,Lunches?
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2169.48,2171.76,"I think, Your Honor, perhaps, yes, absolutely."
2017.16-1519,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2175.24,2190.6,"Mr. Huston, one of the things that strikes me about the statute, and it's -- it's -- it's, I think, the thing that is giving you problems on several dimensions, is that this statute is pretty clearly written with an individual victim in mind. And I don't know exactly how that cuts."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2221.36,2231.68,"Well, I think I would say this, Your Honor: It's clear -- there's no dispute that a company that's a victim of a fraud, as in this case, can be a victim for purposes of the MVRA."
2017.16-1519,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2251.28,2269.56,"Well, if -- if that's the case, if you agree that the purpose here is all about individual victims, doesn't that really pose a serious problem for you? Because it seems that the government's effort here is really to externalize the costs of its own investigations in corporate -- in corporate situations."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2269.56,2289.72,"Your Honor, I -- I respectfully disagree for this reason: Again, Congress would have been aware of the many, many cases that illustrate the principle that we -- that we discuss in our brief, which is it is very common in fraud cases against corporations for the fraud to be discovered through an internal investigation. So this is really the heartland of an investigation."
2017.16-1519,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2291.56,2299.64,"I understand that. You -- you conceded, I believe, to Justice Kagan that Congress's purpose here had to do with individual victims."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2308.48,2308.68,Your Honor --
2017.16-1519,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2308.68,2309.28,"-- cases, right?"
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2309.28,2311.4,"Your Honor, I did not mean to suggest that only --"
2017.16-1519,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2311.4,2311.56,Ah.
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2311.56,2312.92,-- individual victims are covered.
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2328.2,2328.68,Let -- let's say we --
2017.16-1519,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2328.68,2329.68,We have talked --
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2329.68,2330.64,I'm sorry.
2017.16-1519,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2330.96,2336.68,We have talked about two investigations: GE's investigation and the government's investigation.
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2345.88,2374.96,"I respectfully disagree, Your Honor, for this reason: I think that if you were to describe all of GE Capital's efforts in this case, the hiring of forensic experts that preserved crucial evidence to the prosecution, the time that they spent with financial consultants unraveling Petitioner's two years of fraudulent accounting practices, if you went to a person on the street and described everything that GE Capital did in this case and then asked did GE Capital participate in the investigation of this offense, we think the answer would absolutely be yes. And that --"
2017.16-1519,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2374.96,2380.2,"I think we wouldn't use the word ""participate,"" would we? We would say GE conducted the investigation."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2380.2,2393.04,"Well, I think that the -- that ""participation"" is a very sensible term here because it reflects the fact that the amount -- the victim's participation is going to vary at various times. The investigation of a crime happens ordinarily in phases."
2017.16-1519,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2416.6,2427.68,"That's all true, but what I'm thinking is, I look back, now this is expenses related to participation."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2491.68,2493.8,"Your Honor, we do."
2017.16-1519,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2539.96,2553.96,"If the -- if Congress intended to cover an investigation conducted by a company, wouldn't it -- wouldn't it use a term like ""reasonable,"" reasonable expenses incurred?"
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2553.96,2559.76,"Your Honor, I think that the word ""necessary"" in this statute functions in -- in a -- in -- in a similar way."
2017.16-1519,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2559.76,2574.76,"Well, there's a big difference between necessary -- well, how would you determine whether the scope of an internal investigation is necessary? What does that mean? It would make much more sense to ask whether it was reasonable in scope."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2574.76,2590.84,"I think, Your Honor, that ""necessary"" in this statute plays a function similar to the word ""necessary"" in the statute that the Court recently considered in Ayestas. It means ordinary, reasonable, expected. And I want to stress that district courts make those sort of determinations all the time."
2017.16-1519,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2628.0,2637.08,"Well, I'm not sure that GE took steps to limit its expenses. I mean, it -- it hired very expensive law firms to conduct the investigation."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2656.48,2665.4,"So -- so two -- Your -- Your Honor, I think that the statute equips district courts to make exactly those type of determinations in Section 3664(f)."
2017.16-1519,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2692.52,2697.92,"Well, here's another tricky one, for me, along the lines of what the Chief Justice was just asking."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2741.44,2746.2,"Your Honor, you're absolutely right that companies conduct those sort of investigations all the time."
2017.16-1519,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2753.84,2766.24,"You're not answering my question, counsel. How is -- how is a district judge, the poor district judge, supposed to make a determination which one's necessary for the government's investigation and which one's not? I don't doubt they help the government."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2779.0,2785.44,"Well, Your Honor, we don't think that the investigation of the offense in this statute refers to the government's work."
2017.16-1519,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2804.48,2833.64,"What do you do with the argument that the -- in the end, all that this does is to assure that the wrongdoer's life will be miserable after he finishes his prison sentence because he will never be able to pay these huge attorney fee restitution awards and you're not going to help the victim because the award will be uncollectible?"
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2833.64,2841.2,"Your Honor, to the extent that the restitution award in this case is large, it is large because Petitioner conducted a massive fraud."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2867.44,2867.96,I'm sorry --
2017.16-1519,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2867.96,2868.12,But he --
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2868.12,2878.44,-- the fraud here was $25 million? And how much was spent that was awarded by the court below in restitution? Was it 10 or $15 million?
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2878.44,2883.48,Eleven million dollars was the amount of restitution that was remaining that GE Capital was not able to collect.
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2886.04,2889.8,"But the full amount was, to collect 25, they spent 15."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2889.8,2890.04,No --
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2890.04,2892.8,Does the judge decide what's necessary at what point?
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2892.8,2893.52,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2903.76,2904.48,"I see, okay."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2904.48,2908.32,What -- what we're talking about here this morning are the investigation and bankruptcy expenses.
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2908.32,2908.84,Which were how much?
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2908.84,2911.72,"That was a little less than $5 million, $4.9 million."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2911.72,2912.08,Together --
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2912.08,2912.52,Combined.
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2912.52,2914.48,-- it's more than that.
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2915.4,2918.84,"The total restitution award is -- is just a shade under $16 million, Your Honor --"
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2918.84,2919.56,That's what I thought.
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2919.56,2921.4,"-- but, again, $11 million of that is not disputed."
2017.16-1519,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2924.04,2933.84,"And it seems pretty clear the government would never have done that on its own, try to figure out whether the restitution ought to be $4 million or $8 million from a guy who's never going to pay any of it."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,2960.44,2979.76,"Congress was aware, Your Honor, and what the legislative history of the MVRA says is that it recognizes that frauds like this one impose costs on victims that are more than just the property that's taken. Although the award in this case is substantial, again, that's just a function of the complexity of the -- the investigation that was necessary."
2017.16-1519,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3006.12,3007.04,"Well, I'm not sure if that --"
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3007.04,3008.72,Is the criminal -- I'm sorry.
2017.16-1519,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3008.72,3009.92,I'm not sure if that helps you.
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,3028.32,3060.88,"Your -- Your -- Your Honor, that is because Congress made a very deliberate choice in the MVRA to say that restitution should be focused exclusively on the amount of loss that the victim incurred. And even in a case where everyone realizes that the defendant is never going to be able to pay it back, which I think, to be fair, is not this case, Petitioner was quite a wealthy man before this -- before his crime, and there's reason to believe that, you know, the government is -- believes that he has assets that we'll -- that we will attempt to collect afterwards. So it's not the case that nothing will ever be collected."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3078.28,3088.68,May I ask you a question about the criminal conviction? Can it be used to prove liability in the -- in a civil suit?
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,3088.68,3089.12,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3092.36,3092.92,All right.
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,3112.2,3113.8,"That's basically correct, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3113.8,3126.56,So tell me why Congress would have been worried about that when it seemed more worried about the individual expenses that people are unlikely to go to civil court for.
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,3126.56,3132.08,"Well, again, there's really no dispute at all that corporations are victims of frauds and that they are entitled to recover."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3132.08,3138.12,"They're entitled to their losses, but you're asking for something more than what's specified here, according to your adversary."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,3138.12,3146.44,"Well -- well, I think what we're asking for -- they are a victim, and the statute says that victims who incur expenses during the investigation or prosecution of the offense are entitled to recover."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3146.64,3160.52,"Yes, except that Congress, unlike other provisions that specified attorneys' fees, putting the victim whole, proximate causation, Congress in -- instead chose very specific categories here."
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,3160.52,3163.32,"And we -- I think we fit into this category, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3190.64,3194.84,This company you told me earlier got $15 million back without the government.
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,3194.84,3198.52,"In the bankruptcy -- well, they got -- in the bankruptcy proceeding, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3198.52,3200.08,It wasn't the government who helped them do that.
2017.16-1519,1,62974,michael_r_huston,,3200.8,3207.24,"That's right, Your Honor, but I think that only illustrates Congress's wisdom in allowing these -- these restitution expenses."
2017.16-1519,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3258.4,3261.16,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, Mr. Geyser."
2017.16-1519,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3261.16,3262.64,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2017.16-1519,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3392.16,3395.6,Did your client point that out to the district court judge here?
2017.16-1519,2,62794,daniel_l_geyser,,3395.6,3396.32,"No, Your Honor."
2017.16-1519,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3472.64,3473.84,"Thank you, counsel."
