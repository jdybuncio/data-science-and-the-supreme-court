1979.79-381,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,62.452,Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Insurance Company.
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,66.331,72.434,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1979.79-381,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,372.25,376.216,Did Congress do anything in response to that report?
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,376.216,396.212,"Justice Rehnquist, I think that this report took place in February of 1979 and to my knowledge, and what I have is from the amicus curiae brief, Congress has not passed any law at this time."
1979.79-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,598.557,601.713,"Mr. Reid, do you think the Missouri statute discriminates against men or against women?"
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,601.713,603.825,"I think it discriminates against both, Justice Stevens."
1979.79-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,631.288,635.746,"It doesn't deny any women the benefits in this case, does it?"
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,635.746,637.961,It does deny her family benefits.
1979.79-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,657.764,665.542,"We are talking members of the family other than the spouse, aren't they treated alike, aren't the children treated as dependents in both cases?"
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,665.542,666.274,Yes.
1979.79-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.274,670.301,"There isn't any discrimination against anybody except the opposite spouse, is there?"
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,670.301,680.816,Other than the fact that the opposite spouse could use the money that would be entitled -- that he would be entitled to to help raise the family.
1979.79-381,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,680.816,690.929,Do you have any difficulty at all with the claim that this system is unconstitutional because it discriminates against both men and women?
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,690.929,694.55,"No, Your Honor."
1979.79-381,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,694.55,698.981,I must say I do.
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,698.981,700.775,You mean it would have to discriminate --
1979.79-381,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.775,707.045,"I mean how could something discriminate against both, let us say aliens and non-aliens?"
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,707.045,718.114,"It would discriminate against -- in this case it would discriminate against the man, the male the way the statutes are written in this particular set of facts."
1979.79-381,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,718.114,722.154,You mean in some cases it might discriminate against women and in other cases it might --
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,722.154,728.136,"I see what Justice Stevens is saying, that in this case because the wife is the one that is deceased she is never going to receive --"
1979.79-381,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.136,733.415,The point is that in some cases discrimination might be against women and in other cases it might be against men.
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,734.726,735.785,It --
1979.79-381,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.785,740.043,That is it's against women if you think of them as wage earners.
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,740.043,740.389,Right.
1979.79-381,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,740.389,743.869,And against men if you think of them as beneficiaries.
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,743.869,744.333,Right.
1979.79-381,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,744.333,744.778,Is that it?
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,744.778,746.736,Right.
1979.79-381,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.736,756.307,So it would depend in each case upon whether the male or the female were the wage earner and which spouse was the beneficiary.
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,756.307,758.085,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,758.085,763.658,Does the wage earner in this case contribute to the fund that provides the benefit?
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,763.658,768.798,"Your Honor, I think indirectly he does, or she does in this particular case."
1979.79-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.903,791.227,But until there is an injury I take it there is no discriminations as between wage earners of different sexes.
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,795.766,807.042,"No, Your Honor, there would be no deduction from the salary other than the fact I think when you think about the total amount of labor that the employer would take this into consideration, how much he is paying in for the workmen compensation benefits."
1979.79-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.042,809.525,Well but he pays in the same amount for a female worker as he does a male worker.
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,809.525,811.186,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,811.186,818.524,"And if the female and male workers are single and have no dependents at all, so they only would get benefits for disability, they are treated alike."
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,818.524,820.096,That is correct.
1979.79-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,820.096,824.631,I don't see any discrimination against anybody except a male in this case.
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,827.483,837.281,"Well, it has been advanced I think in the American Civil Liberties brief and pointed out in some other cases that it does discriminate against against the working woman for her family."
1979.79-381,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.005,850.267,"You mean because the husband is the wife of a woman -- is the spouse of a woman he is discriminated against, so that is a discrimination against the woman."
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,850.267,857.585,The woman would be discriminated because of her ability to support her family in the event that she had passed away.
1979.79-381,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,861.064,864.928,That her employment is worth less than the man's.
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,864.928,867.121,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-381,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1096.092,1102.552,"The scrutiny test, so-called, in every case simply is shorthand for saying you are going to invalidate the statute, isn't it?"
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,1102.552,1104.432,I think that didn't happen in the --
1979.79-381,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1104.432,1107.579,"I mean that is a way of telegraphing the result, isn't it?"
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,1107.579,1107.819,Yes.
1979.79-381,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1126.859,1131.762,"Well, then isn't what I asked in my question basically correct?"
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,1131.762,1132.065,Yes.
1979.79-381,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1132.065,1143.534,Do you know of a single case in which any court has ever applied the so-called strict scrutiny test that it has not ended up by invalidating the statute before it? it.
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,1143.534,1155.513,"I would say that the Webster case would be a close one, the pro curiam opinion of this Court."
1979.79-381,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1155.513,1163.412,"Mr. Reid, you rely a good bit on the fact that the statute is an old one, it dates back to the year --"
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,1163.412,1164.878,"1925, Your Honor."
1979.79-381,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.878,1186.409,Suppose there was a distinct legislative record to the effect that the legislature wanted to compensate widows for deprivations of the past.
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,1188.026,1195.472,"I think I would if the Court would apply the strict scrutiny standard; yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-381,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.472,1205.777,I repeat Mr. Justice Stewart's question: Doesn't the strict scrutiny standard really speak to the result.
1979.79-381,0,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,1210.888,1213.807,"Yes, Your Honor, I would say that it would be."
1979.79-381,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.807,1215.84,It is like a compelling State interest.
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1319.037,1325.761,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1979.79-381,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1606.594,1608.081,If a man dies.
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1608.081,1608.812,Beg pardon?
1979.79-381,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1608.812,1614.982,"If a man dies you don't have to show it, do you; you don't have to show economic loss, do you?"
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1614.982,1615.666,No.
1979.79-381,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1619.743,1628.787,"Well, I mean suppose the man is making $5,000 a year and his wife is making $50,000, if he dies she collects."
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1628.787,1631.873,There is no question about that.
1979.79-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.873,1636.609,"Mr. Kleinschmidt, I didn't understand that there was a stipulation that there was no economic loss."
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1641.424,1643.757,I equated the two because under the scheme --
1979.79-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1643.757,1647.87,"They are not equivalent, are they?"
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1647.87,1650.225,-- under the scheme in Missouri statute they are.
1979.79-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1650.225,1652.565,"Well, let us assume we did not have a Missouri statute."
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1663.142,1668.338,Well economic losses would be the final balance sheet.
1979.79-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1677.321,1686.248,"Do you think if a family is supported by both parents and one of them dies and that income is taken away from the family there is no economic loss suffered by the family, as a matter of tort law or any other --"
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1686.248,1691.07,Certainly if we are going to extend this to a family I --
1979.79-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.07,1695.463,"Well, just the two, do you think -- you don't think there is economic loss?"
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1700.098,1711.496,"I think maybe this can be in the mind of the beholder and as I behold it, I visualize two people in a family making $5,000 apiece, each of them have to spend $5,000 to live."
1979.79-381,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1712.62,1715.879,"Well, in any event the stipulation is not that there is no economic loss."
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1717.686,1721.797,"You are certainly correct; yes, sir."
1979.79-381,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1721.797,1725.006,This statute creates a conclusive presumption --
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1725.006,1725.626,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-381,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1725.626,1732.526,-- so it precludes any inquiry under the economic realities.
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1732.526,1735.724,"Yes, sir; it does indeed."
1979.79-381,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1830.693,1836.369,Why does it fit in to treat women in one way and men in another?
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1836.369,1856.859,"Well, by designation if you are going to justify a gender classification on the basis of a legitimate governmental purpose in reducing past disparity, to that extent that you are reducing past disparity, then you are not treating by definition females equal with the males."
1979.79-381,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.654,1861.539,I know but you are doing it by classification.
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1876.933,1885.324,Another recognized governmental purpose is administrative convenience.
1979.79-381,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.154,1934.137,"Well, if you give one remedy rather than the other, if you didn't require proof of dependency for either sex, that would be administratively more efficient than the present scheme, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,1934.137,1940.613,"Yes, but as the Missouri Supreme Court pointed out there is a delicate balance in these Acts."
1979.79-381,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2004.286,2007.502,Is increased cost to the employer something we can take into consideration?
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,2007.502,2008.512,Beg pardon?
1979.79-381,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2008.512,2019.595,"Is the increased cost to the employer something we can take into consideration, the fact that you would have to pay out more money if the statute is changed?"
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,2019.595,2022.363,"Well, I was making it in response to a question here."
1979.79-381,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2027.647,2028.806,"Well, then I misunderstood you."
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,2029.18,2029.318,No.
1979.79-381,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2034.393,2042.032,"Just as a matter of curiosity Mr. Kleinschmidt, under the new bill will they require proof of dependency in all cases or in no cases?"
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,2042.032,2051.424,Under the new bill as I understand it -- I read it briefly on the airplane coming up -- apparently there is going to be a conclusive presumption for both genders.
1979.79-381,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.424,2051.98,I see.
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,2055.228,2062.797,"Yes, yes."
1979.79-381,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2126.863,2132.65,What standard do you think Boren suggest?
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,2132.65,2136.359,I am not prepared to respond.
1979.79-381,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.359,2147.346,Do you think there is some standard between -- in our cases between just rationality and strict scrutiny?
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,2148.415,2153.449,"It is very difficult to say, Your Honor, it is in the mind of the beholder, really."
1979.79-381,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2192.376,2200.768,Is there anything in the record to show that there was never a nickel put --
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,2200.768,2204.584,It stipulated that there was just absolutely no dependency.
1979.79-381,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2204.584,2205.297,Yes.
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,2205.297,2208.016,And that is the economic loss rule in Missouri.
1979.79-381,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2208.016,2211.351,And that is the harm.
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,2211.351,2213.914,"I haven't been talking in terms of harm, Your Honor."
1979.79-381,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2223.314,2224.946,I know you are talking about economic loss.
1979.79-381,1,39651,ralph_c_kleinschmidt,,2236.04,2251.606,"Well, in any event it seems to us that if this Court were to reverse the Missouri court in this case it would be sending out a signal itself that it has been prepared to move, to sound this clarion call that ACLU looks for."
1979.79-381,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2278.643,2280.764,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Reid?"
1979.79-381,2,32554,john_w_reid_ii,,2280.764,2281.846,Yes.
1979.79-381,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2324.867,2325.578,"Thank you, gentlemen."
