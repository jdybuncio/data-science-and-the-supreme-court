2012.11-770,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.837,"We'll hear argument next in Case 11-770, Chunon Bailey v. United States."
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,7.887,8.47,"Thank you,--"
2012.11-770,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,56.265,67.739,"Counsel, the two tests, yours seem to be the immediate vicinity test, and the Second Circuit is as soon as practical test."
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,92.79,103.395,"Well, let me explain, Justice Sotomayor, first, the sort of theoretical basis for why we're offering this line, and, second, say a word about the comparative merits of the two tests."
2012.11-770,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,144.406,145.758,And what is the immediate vicinity?
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,146.741,160.434,"Well, ordinarily, the immediate vicinity will be the physical bounds of the property; but, there may be circumstances in which an individual who is just outside the physical bounds of the property should nevertheless be detained, so to provide--"
2012.11-770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,160.434,160.768,May be?
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,162.751,173.842,"--Well, in Summers itself, the individual was on the premises just outside the house that was going to be searched, and the officers were, in the government's words in that case, approaching the property."
2012.11-770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,173.842,174.359,Yes.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,177.528,185.549,"Well, he was actually on -- he was on the property because he was on a sidewalk that connected the front steps to the public sidewalk in front of the house."
2012.11-770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,189.87,191.787,He was in the curtilage of the house.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,191.787,195.172,"He was pretty clearly within the curtilage, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-770,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,195.172,200.076,You say the difference is there's no immediate threat to the officers here.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,236.649,248.826,"If anything, it's the government's approach that requires a greater number of officers at the site because, under the government's approach, you have the two officers who conduct the detention while a separate group of officers execute the search."
2012.11-770,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,250.326,254.461,"Well, it requires more unless they want the guy to get away, I guess, right?"
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,254.461,259.182,"--Well, let me say something about this prospect that the individual will return."
2012.11-770,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,292.069,299.092,"Well, what if he were aware, or what if there was reason to think he might be aware, would you then allow the police to do what the police did here?"
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,299.092,300.475,"Well, we wouldn't."
2012.11-770,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,314.901,330.044,"If -- if you think that leaving the scene -- in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that he's leaving the scene with incriminating evidence, at that point you have -- you have a Terry stop?"
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,335.515,344.12,"--Well, the analysis under Terry is whether there is reasonable suspicion, a reasonable basis to believe that the individual is engaged in criminal activity--"
2012.11-770,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,344.12,345.754,What would you think generally in my hypothetical?
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,347.739,354.326,"--Well, ordinarily, when an individual is seen leaving the scene -- and suppose -- let me provide--"
2012.11-770,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,354.326,355.845,"--Just -- just before the search, yes."
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,355.845,361.915,"--Well, of course, the individual who is leaving the scene doesn't necessarily know that the search is about to take place."
2012.11-770,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,361.915,362.249,Right.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,362.249,376.092,"And so, to provide a hypothetical that will hopefully put some meat on the bones of this issue, suppose that an individual leaves a house, and he actually sees police officers sitting in a car, whether marked or unmarked, outside the house."
2012.11-770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,411.598,414.55,But Terry -- Terry is an open question in this case.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,433.861,436.213,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-770,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,478.473,480.242,"Well, what would you think of this situation?"
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,534.06,550.137,"The justifications articulated by this Court in Summers, Justice Alito, and in particular what we really believe are the primary justifications, first, minimizing the risk of harm to officers executing the warrant; and, second, facilitating the orderly completion of the search."
2012.11-770,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,551.022,563.329,"Well, without interrupting -- in that situation, officer safety is undermined by your rule because it requires them to stop the person on the premises and, therefore, tip off those inside, potentially, about their presence."
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,563.329,566.864,--But they also have the choice not to engage in a detention at all.
2012.11-770,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,605.056,612.579,"Mr. Shanmugam, when you talk about the justifications in your brief and just now, you talk about two; but, there were, in fact, three, and the third was flight."
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,618.899,624.553,"Well, we simply think, Justice Kagan, that that justification is insufficient standing on its own."
2012.11-770,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,671.951,680.223,"Counsel, can I come back to the facts that my colleagues have raised and break it down implicating the Terry question?"
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,704.005,704.889,Under Terry?
2012.11-770,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,704.889,705.722,Under Terry.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,705.722,706.472,Sure.
2012.11-770,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,716.08,716.63,But the court below did.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,716.63,718.764,So that would be an issue that would be open on remand.
2012.11-770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,721.131,721.8,Excuse me.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,725.635,726.035,"--Well, that's right."
2012.11-770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.618,727.704,--they handcuffed them.
2012.11-770,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,727.704,747.166,"Well, it goes back to if a police officer saw an individual leaving the house and was concerned about them tipping someone off, et cetera, what would be the problem with the officer stopping the person around the corner, holding them, making sure people got in and then letting them go."
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,747.166,749.951,"--And just to be clear, because there are the two separate issues."
2012.11-770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,808.989,834.89,"If they did do -- if they did do a Terry stop, and in the process of that stop the police officer got a call that said, we found lots of contraband, guns in this house, at that point they could have turned the Terry stop into an arrest, couldn't they?"
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,834.89,855.637,"They could very well, with one caveat, and that caveat is simply that the circumstances under which the contraband is found might be relevant to the analysis of whether or not there is probable cause, because the question would be whether or not there is probable cause to believe that the individual constructively possessed the contraband at issue."
2012.11-770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,855.637,857.287,"Mr. Shanmugam, please help me."
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,885.239,899.666,"Well, that would be the additional question, whether the detention in this case, which did involve taking my client and the other individual, putting them in handcuffs, putting them in the patrol car, and then taking them back to the scene, was permissible within the scope of a Terry stop."
2012.11-770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.607,920.746,"Well, I guess -- I guess, I didn't realize that it's an open question whether you can do that much in -- in a mere Terry stop."
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,920.746,938.957,"--Well, under Terry officers may detain an individual for the period of time it takes for them to confirm or dispel the suspicion, and I think that there would be an open question as to whether or not when officers are executing a search warrant, for the duration of the execution of the search warrant, that falls within the scope of that Terry test."
2012.11-770,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,938.957,942.743,Could you explain what you mean by the immediate vicinity?
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,956.586,960.305,I think ordinarily it will be within the physical bounds of the property.
2012.11-770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,976.147,978.166,"Well, physical bounds of the property is -- is too much."
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,982.57,984.203,"Well, and the point of--"
2012.11-770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,984.203,989.224,"I think you are much better off, I think your submissions sometimes say immediate vicinity."
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,989.224,999.846,"--Well, we -- we proposed to this Court the immediate vicinity standard in large part because it really is comparable to similar limits this Court has adopted for other Fourth Amendment--"
2012.11-770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,999.846,1002.365,I like that much better than boundaries of the property.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1002.365,1022.827,"--Well -- and to provide a couple of examples, under Maryland v. Buie, the case that permits officers to conduct a protective sweep incident to an arrest, the Court permits officers to search the area immediately adjoining the place where the arrest occurs and that has not proven to be a difficult standard to apply in practice."
2012.11-770,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1022.827,1023.711,What is the actual difference?
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1122.608,1123.477,"Well -- well, let me--"
2012.11-770,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1123.477,1124.327,So what am I missing?
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1124.327,1126.26,--Let me address each of those three.
2012.11-770,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1126.26,1128.096,You already said the first one's identical.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1131.064,1133.166,"Well, I actually don't think that even the first one is identical."
2012.11-770,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1148.692,1149.025,How do you know that?
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1149.809,1157.465,The Government has not identified a single example of an individual who is seen leaving the scene who has returned to disrupt the search in that fashion.
2012.11-770,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1158.9,1172.208,I thought your better answer was the risk of somebody coming back to a house exists whether the person just left it or left it an hour after or before or 2 hours or 24.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1172.208,1172.741,"--Well, and that was going to be--"
2012.11-770,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1172.741,1174.993,"When the police walk in, they always have to guard against reentry."
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1174.993,1180.897,"--Well, and that was going to be my next point, Justice Sotomayor; and the Government really tries to make a broader and more ambitious argument."
2012.11-770,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1207.964,1208.264,It's not just that.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1237.483,1240.518,"--I haven't personally conducted any searches, Justice Breyer."
2012.11-770,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1251.826,1254.309,We talked about -- we talked about officer safety.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1273.339,1277.958,--Officers will naturally take precautions in situations like that.
2012.11-770,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1278.81,1283.945,"Yes, the precaution is let's wait until he's a block down the street because it will be a lot safer."
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1286.297,1299.39,"--They cannot be covered by Summers, but what they can do is either follow the individual for the period of time during which they are executing the warrant, or they can detain that individual if he returns to the scene."
2012.11-770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1334.397,1351.406,"So if he came back -- I mean, the scenario here is he was supposed to be driving his friend home, and he would have come back while the search was ongoing, but the police could apprehend anyone while the search -- if that's what you're saying, while the search is ongoing--"
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1351.406,1360.964,"--Well, if he were to return to the scene while the search is ongoing, we believe that he could be detained pursuant to Summers, and we cite a number of court of appeals cases that have so held."
2012.11-770,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1383.311,1394.685,"Well, what if the person comes out the door and walks -- and has walked 50 feet down the block within sight of the entrance at the time when the police are entering to make the arrest?"
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1397.553,1412.397,"Well, I think that the natural limit on the immediate vicinity rule is imposed by the underlying justification, namely, that officers should have the authority to encounter individuals -- to detain individuals they encounter while they are in the course of executing the warrant."
2012.11-770,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1438.98,1447.67,"Well, does that mean that if the person is within sight of the entrance to the premises at the time when the police enter, then that person can be searched--"
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1447.67,1448.353,"Well, we don't think--"
2012.11-770,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1448.353,1448.753,--and be detained.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1448.753,1451.205,--We don't think that that's necessarily a line of sight rule.
2012.11-770,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1463.263,1463.68,But that's the problem.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1463.68,1464.615,--so the issue--
2012.11-770,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1464.615,1465.765,That's the problem.
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1498.853,1499.536,--You're missing the--
2012.11-770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1499.536,1501.288,You're not saying that they can't stop them from leaving.
2012.11-770,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1503.49,1506.375,"--They can't stop them from leaving if, blank."
2012.11-770,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1506.375,1514.113,"--They -- they could always proceed to execute the warrant when they see an individual leaving; and, if they are in the course of executing the warrant, a detention is permissible."
2012.11-770,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1601.986,1603.105,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1604.621,1609.925,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-770,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1609.925,1623.067,"Mr. Wall, would you answer -- direct your first response to that last issue because, as I read your brief, you seem not to be accepting the Second Circuit's rule at all."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1685.573,1686.925,"--No, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-770,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1772.661,1775.197,"Well, we don't have anything like that in this case."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1780.034,1785.755,"Well, we do have, though, the officers seeing him departing the residence as they're executing the warrant."
2012.11-770,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1792.074,1799.597,"As they're executing the warrant, I don't remember, was the -- did the individual know that they were executing the warrant in this case?"
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1799.597,1800.13,--No.
2012.11-770,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1800.13,1800.614,"Oh, okay."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1800.614,1801.397,They had obtained the warrant.
2012.11-770,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1802.966,1809.87,So the danger to them is not at all like the situation with the dog and the armed guy just off of the property.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1809.87,1811.905,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I respectfully disagree."
2012.11-770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1838.055,1840.172,And then Mr. Shanmugam says they could stop him.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1846.911,1859.719,"--But think how formalistic and odd that is, Justice Ginsburg, that the police see someone leaving, but, if they can't catch up to them on the bounds of the property, which has no reasonable relationship to the warrant here, which was for the premises, not for the -- for that property--"
2012.11-770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1859.719,1860.019,But--
2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1860.019,1863.771,"--from anybody coming back to the house, not just the person who just left."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1863.771,1864.288,"--Oh, assuming--"
2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.288,1871.293,"And surely the police, when they're conducting a search, post guards to prevent people from coming in."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1871.293,1873.226,"--They often do, Justice Scalia, but--"
2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.226,1874.795,I assume they always do.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1883.168,1886.036,"--Justice Scalia, certainly in urban areas they do."
2012.11-770,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1901.38,1915.072,"You're missing the point, which is that's going to happen regardless, meaning that risk exists whether the person left the minute you got there or a minute before or an hour before or two hours before."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1919.007,1924.495,"--Justice Sotomayor, there is no question that executing a warrant is dangerous, and people can come onto the scene at any time."
2012.11-770,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1930.732,1941.457,"But you didn't know -- you don't know that in any search, meaning any time you do a search you have no idea when the -- whether the occupant -- sometimes you know whether the occupant is inside."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1949.777,1952.845,"Justice Sotomayor, I completely agree, although I think that--"
2012.11-770,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1952.845,1955.966,So why is seeing someone leaving increasing that risk?
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1955.966,1959.251,--Because we know that some percentage of those people will come back.
2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.726,1988.854,"If -- if you have a large enough force that you can afford to send two of them in a car chasing this fellow for a mile, why can't you just post those two outside the house, just in case somebody, whether it's this person who's just left or anybody else, comes back?"
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2005.963,2015.754,"--Justice Scalia, first, that isn't even arguably going to serve two of the three Summers interests, preventing people from fleeing or garnering their assistance in the orderly completion of the search."
2012.11-770,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2016.621,2026.61,"Can you tell me what constitutional right entitles you to stop someone from, using the word, “ fleeing ”?"
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2041.302,2042.718,"--Justice Sotomayor, I think your question fills in the answer."
2012.11-770,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2062.049,2070.47,"Well, Mr. Wall, you have that, too, about the person in her workplace, and you said that your argument didn't apply to the person in her workplace."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2117.117,2119.633,"Well, Justice Kagan, let me break that up into both parts."
2012.11-770,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2147.552,2149.588,But is it in the process?
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2157.342,2158.444,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
2012.11-770,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2166.614,2190.915,"If -- if the police executing the valid search warrant walked through the gate and at that moment the individual emerging from the house had not yet passed through the gate, then under Summers the police would have the right to detain him."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2205.139,2206.256,"--Justice Breyer, that is absolutely right."
2012.11-770,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2207.424,2208.324,--I know you'd say that was right.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2208.324,2214.328,"--I mean, I -- the Government's central contention is there's nothing magical about the gate for Fourth Amendment purposes."
2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.332,2226.069,There is something magical about the gate or at least about the immediate facility of the house.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2243.014,2244.947,As soon as reasonably practicable.
2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.947,2247.683,--As soon as reasonably practicable.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2268.831,2273.7,"Justice Scalia, it is an absolute rule and it tells you who, it gives you a who, who is detainable."
2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2274.818,2275.852,It doesn't give you a where.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2277.937,2280.22,"--Well, the who is categorical."
2012.11-770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2297.149,2302.885,"--Mr. Wall, the Summers case was an exception."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2357.12,2375.851,"Justice Ginsburg, I think the reason Summers carved out the rule is it said, look, for -- for current and recent occupants as a class, we -- officers see, they find or see them at a residence where there's probable cause to believe a crime is committed, so across the board we've got reasonable suspicion, and that's why we draw a rule so that we're not going to rebalance every time."
2012.11-770,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2375.851,2376.368,Right.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2405.637,2409.072,"Justice Kagan, as far as we know, George Summers was going to work."
2012.11-770,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2423.432,2426.05,"I mean, something meaningful very -- very much changes."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2439.96,2456.653,"Justice Kagan, I don't think that explains why you couldn't let George Summers go on his way, and it doesn't explain why the Court in Summers didn't say, look, rather than roam the house, if it really is true that once we let you outside the front door or the front gate, you are no longer a danger and are likely only to be a hindrance, why not give you the option to leave."
2012.11-770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2464.925,2466.076,You have to draw a line someplace.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2504.799,2505.416,I think--
2012.11-770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2505.416,2508.168,He couldn't point out anything in drawers because they'd found it all.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2508.168,2515.155,"--I mean, I think at that point they had probable cause; they could have arrested him and I think they could have taken him down to the station house."
2012.11-770,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2534.652,2535.018,Counsel--
2012.11-770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2535.018,2550.328,"I think -- I think we have to take the case on the assumption -- I agree with you there probably was probable cause -- but I think you have to take the case on the assumption that there was no probable cause to arrest, because they didn't -- they did not rely on that authority."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2550.328,2559.368,"Justice Kennedy, in that -- assuming that's true, then they took him back to the scene to complete the search, by which time they had found the drugs and the guns, and then they did arrest him."
2012.11-770,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2565.855,2575.395,"--Counsel, the problem with absolute rules like we did in Summers is that they're an exception, and they're absolute."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2596.559,2597.209,--Of course.
2012.11-770,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2605.332,2608.117,I'm -- I'm litigating for you.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2608.117,2608.684,--Sure.
2012.11-770,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2609.867,2621.674,"So I could very easily imagine that what the fight's going to be like below is, we stopped them because we saw them coming out of the house, and all we want to do is make sure that they don't return."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2635.518,2647.259,"--Well, I take one of the differences between Terry and Summers to be that in Terry the seizure is tied to the officer's brief investigation, and in Summers it's tied to the execution of the warrant."
2012.11-770,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2654.563,2656.081,"Well, we don't know, but why don't we let that develop."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2656.081,2661.751,"Well, because I think the danger is that courts will apply Terry the way that they have, and we don't want to dilute one doctrine with another."
2012.11-770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2669.072,2677.928,"Explain -- explain to me -- the police, they have the informant's tip, and they see them coming out of the house."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2694.557,2697.341,"Justice Ginsburg, that's certainly true here."
2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2717.255,2718.088,So what?
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2737.134,2737.585,"Well, that is--"
2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2737.585,2739.068,--that is so implausible.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2740.787,2741.52,--Justice Scalia--
2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.52,2744.239,--what threat to the policemen can possibly exist?
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2744.239,2754.761,"--I think the Texas officers in the Valdez case, which we cite in our briefs, would find it surprising, where they did let someone go from the scene, and she came back with an individual and started fighting with police."
2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2756.713,2757.347,Very unusual.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2757.347,2758.665,--Justice Scalia--
2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.665,2759.465,Very unusual.

2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2767.021,2771.973,You don't adopt absolute rules to cover foolhardy people.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2784.18,2785.482,"That's absolutely right, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-770,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2817.518,2820.47,That's an argument in Summers I just don't understand.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2829.226,2830.626,--Well--
2012.11-770,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2830.626,2838.914,"It seems odd, you know, we're going to tie -- we're not going to tie you up -- we're going to keep you here, you can't leave because we think you might tell us where the drugs are."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2838.914,2851.239,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, I think it is one of three legitimate law enforcement interests where you have someone for whom there is articulable and individualized suspicion to believe that they are connected to criminal activity."
2012.11-770,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2865.999,2868.201,"If they want to do that, they can."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2872.604,2873.272,"Well, and--"
2012.11-770,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2873.272,2874.255,--to give you the key to the cabinet.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2874.255,2877.973,--and the argument in Summers is you can detain them because you've got reasonable suspicion.
2012.11-770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2907.243,2913.499,"Justice Kagan had the hypothetical of the person leaving to go to work, the 9:00 to 5:00 person."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2929.174,2931.34,"Justice Kennedy, no, not under Summers."
2012.11-770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2932.376,2933.992,"No, under the rule you're proposing."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2933.992,2934.909,--I don't think so.
2012.11-770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2936.878,2939.03,"I don't know -- I don't know why not, under the rule that's proposed."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2939.03,2944.684,"--when that case comes to the Court, the Court will have to decide whether to recognize a doctrine analogous to Summers and Terry."
2012.11-770,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2963.061,2973.167,"Counsel, my -- I remain with my question, which is, we have a circumstance-driven power of Terry."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3018.648,3022.517,"Justice Sotomayor, to be clear, that's not the government's rationale."
2012.11-770,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3032.089,3044.549,So your -- your view is that Summers gave you -- entitled you to hold people merely for purposes of investigation--
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3044.549,3045.099,--I--
2012.11-770,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3045.099,3047.251,--without any reasonable suspicion?
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3049.051,3050.101,--My view is with the Court's on Summers.
2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3092.03,3095.565,"The -- the procedure has to be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, right?"
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3157.472,3162.542,"Justice Scalia, we're not here asking for the Court to extend Summers."
2012.11-770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3212.007,3216.111,"In this case, you couldn't think of a reason why they took him back to the scene."
2012.11-770,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3216.111,3224.181,"Maybe he had a key to the -- to the place where they keep the drugs, the basement or something."
2012.11-770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3224.181,3226.617,He might have wanted to help in the search.
2012.11-770,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3226.617,3229.735,Is that fanciful?
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3233.388,3235.555,--It's far from being fanciful.
2012.11-770,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3244.827,3250.481,"Yes, but the question is whether you have to detain them to do something you're saying they'd want to do."
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3250.481,3256.634,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we're not here saying that every time somebody could be helpful in a search you could go out and detain them."
2012.11-770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3372.777,3373.627,They could follow him.
2012.11-770,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3373.627,3378.58,"They can, but, Justice Ginsburg, tailing is a risky proposition, particularly in an urban area."

2012.11-770,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3563.385,3566.337,What -- would you say the same thing about the exact situation in Summers?
2012.11-770,2,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,3566.337,3568.687,"No, we wouldn't, Justice Alito."
