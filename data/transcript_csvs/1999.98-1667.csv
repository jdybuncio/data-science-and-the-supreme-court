1999.98-1667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.674,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 98-1667, David Baral v. the United States."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,11.192,17.371,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1667,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,80.451,83.654,4 months here?
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,83.654,85.746,"4 months in this case, yes."
1999.98-1667,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.544,217.764,But the statute reads as though estimated tax payments are prepaid income taxes.
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,222.411,226.127,"No, I don't think the... I don't think the section says that, Justice O'Connor."
1999.98-1667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,236.926,239.647,"Where will we find that, Mr. Rockler, in the brief?"
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,239.647,241.32,It's at the end of both briefs.
1999.98-1667,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,312.847,315.963,"May... may I interrupt you, Mr. Rockler, for just a second?"
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,327.939,328.756,"--No, no."
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,399.971,401.659,But that language--
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,401.659,405.322,--and to... and to limit the payment of interest to that date.
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,405.322,410.998,"--Mr. Rockler, you... you recognize, Mr. Rockler, that that language was dropped."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,441.349,451.508,"As to the caption, first, I think that is a... a secondary or tertiary form of reading the... the statute."
1999.98-1667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,481.282,485.17,"And where will we find this, Mr. Rockler?"
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,485.17,490.55,--I think it's cited in the Government's brief.
1999.98-1667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.745,501.832,"If you were going to rely on it, I would have thought it would be a good idea to reproduce it."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,501.832,506.624,"I regret, Your Honor... Mr. Chief Justice, that I don't think it is in the briefs."
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,613.398,623.233,"Mr. Rockler, the Habig case was about, was... was it not, filing a false tax return?"
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,629.17,633.049,"Oh, it is not... it is not directly on point for this case."
1999.98-1667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,725.699,734.277,"But... but Rosenman too, Mr. Rockler, involved a rather express agreement by the Government, did it not, to kind of hold this in escrow?"
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,734.277,734.726,No.
1999.98-1667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,734.726,736.665,Certainly the Court said that in its opinion.
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,736.665,739.511,"No, I don't think the Court said it was an express agreement."
1999.98-1667,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,789.447,805.862,"Mr. Rockler, before you... before you get off Rosenman, there was... there was another feature in that case which... which no longer exists and is... is not a factor in the present case, and that is the Government there was... was trying to have its cake and eat it too."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,857.695,859.208,"No, no."
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,871.448,878.329,"Well, that's to encourage you to file your return on time to say if you don't file it on time, then you won't get interest."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,878.329,878.785,Yes.
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,878.785,879.688,Isn't that the purpose?
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,879.688,881.522,I... I think that is correct.
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,892.347,894.093,What was it--
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,894.093,899.345,"If they've overpaid, they are losing interest for whatever period of late filing they're engaged in."
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,920.374,929.736,"--Mr. Rockler, I'm concerned that the argument that you... you are making would be detrimental to many taxpayers, and let me give you this example."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,974.622,975.876,No.
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,992.03,992.974,But they were not paid.
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,992.974,996.898,"--If there were no payment whatever in any form, then you're right."
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,996.898,1000.132,"Well, you say it's payment for some purposes and not others?"
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1000.132,1000.49,"No, no."
1999.98-1667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1024.086,1032.04,"But what... you say that quite confidently, but what statutory provision is it that says interest will run or not run in that situation?"
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1032.04,1034.167,Section 6611.
1999.98-1667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1034.167,1035.733,Which you don't cite in your brief.
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1035.733,1042.623,"That... that is a section which neither the Government nor the taxpayer here attached to the briefs, I regret to say."
1999.98-1667,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.765,1046.323,Let... let me come back to... to Rosenman.
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1101.102,1108.363,"--I... I think you're quite correct, Justice Scalia, in your observations with respect to what the case says."
1999.98-1667,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1117.04,1118.226,And we don't have that problem here.
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1118.226,1124.968,But the holding of that case is more basic than that observation.
1999.98-1667,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1156.0,1158.137,"No, but the charges have been run up here."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1170.045,1174.966,--You could say exactly the same thing for the estate taxes in the Rosenman case.
1999.98-1667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1181.101,1181.751,But in Rosenman--
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1181.751,1183.79,--the position this Court took then.
1999.98-1667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1206.189,1207.993,--Is... was there at the time of Rosenman--
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1207.993,1208.521,--Pardon me?
1999.98-1667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1208.521,1219.913,"--At the time, did the statute specifically say... the language that we have... that an amount paid as an estimated tax shall be deemed to have been paid on such and such a date?"
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1219.913,1220.981,"No, no."
1999.98-1667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1220.981,1221.86,"No, it didn't."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1221.86,1223.428,That... that section was not applicable.
1999.98-1667,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1223.428,1229.24,"Well, so we have a new section and we have also the point Justice Scalia made."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1269.563,1279.583,"Justice Breyer, I think the answer is that the transmittal letter of the taxpayer, according to the Court, said it was an estimate on Federal estate tax."
1999.98-1667,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1288.704,1314.709,"But... but as Justice Breyer's questions suggest, we're living in a post-Rosenman world, and after Rosenman, the Government made express provision in its revenue procedures so that if you paid a remittance as a deposit, you had to expressly say it was a deposit."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1331.377,1354.545,"Justice Kennedy, if I may say so, both withholding taxes and an estimate do nothing but give rise to credits, and there are regulations in effect which say these credits are to be applied... future tense... when the return is filed, and they are set up against the income tax then known to be due."
1999.98-1667,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1354.545,1363.333,"Well... well, then you're saying that the revenue procedure adopted in the wake of Rosenman was absolutely to no effect."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1363.333,1368.233,"No, I'm not saying it's to no effect to taxpayers who are aware of it."
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1419.41,1440.766,"But, Mr. Rockler, the... the taxpayer, instead of filing this under the form for a deposit, signed a voucher that went along with his estimated tax payment that said he was tendering so much as an income tax payment."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1445.451,1449.077,--The... the voucher is a voucher for an estimated tax payment.
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1451.066,1456.19,"Yes, but the words were I tender this as an income tax payment."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1456.19,1461.693,The... the taxpayer as such is not the ultimate in sophistication on tax matters.
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1498.877,1501.444,"Well, that was not... that was no fault of the Government, was it, Mr. Rockler, that he didn't retain--"
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1501.444,1502.083,"No, no."
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1502.083,1502.728,--his return?
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1502.728,1503.013,No.
1999.98-1667,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1523.538,1524.143,Mr. Rockler--
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1524.143,1528.911,I think what's involved here is a... is a serious misreading of 6513(b).
1999.98-1667,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1528.911,1547.273,"--Mr. Rockler, you seem to be making a sort of a... I don't know... a philosophical argument that it is impossible to make a prepayment on a debt unless the precise amount of the debt is... is known, and... and that doesn't seem to me true."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1592.999,1593.308,No.
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1674.079,1677.751,"Mr. Rockler, what... I'm not familiar with that case."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1681.463,1687.165,"Since the case was decided in '54, it must have been the '39 code."
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1687.165,1687.707,Right.
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1688.326,1688.834,Now--
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1688.834,1694.153,"--but we have... we have a different code, and we have a different Government practice."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1708.742,1709.073,--No.
1999.98-1667,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1716.914,1721.627,"Yes, but the statute read may not shall in... in '39."
1999.98-1667,0,45950,walter_j_rockler,,1721.627,1734.684,"--The... the... that is correct, but in the '54 code, in the legislative committee reports that accompany it, there was no intent really to change anything except the deemed due date of returns."
1999.98-1667,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.616,1800.372,"Thank you, Mr. Rockler."
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1803.923,1812.091,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1667,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.627,1883.527,"That isn't quite the way the... the... at least the version of 6513(b)(2) that I have before me reads, where it says... would you... would you read the exact language again?"
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1883.527,1891.771,"--Well, the language that I was emphasizing is up there after prepaid income tax where it says, for purposes of section 6511."
1999.98-1667,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1891.771,1893.94,"Ah, or 6512."
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1893.94,1897.75,"Right, and 6512 is the statute of limitations in Tax Court cases."
1999.98-1667,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1897.75,1902.209,"Okay, and then... then... so, from there you dropped down to the text of--"
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1902.209,1903.914,Then I was summarizing the rest of the text.
1999.98-1667,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1920.469,1924.477,"--So, (1) and (2) distinguish between two different situations."
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1924.477,1934.03,"Both of which are involved in this case because we have in this case both withholding and estimated taxes, and so both (b)(1) and (b)(2) apply here."
1999.98-1667,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1946.06,1948.466,"Now, you also said 6511--"
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1948.466,1948.927,"Yes, sir."
1999.98-1667,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1948.927,1950.882,--in your 1-minute summary.
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1950.882,1951.548,That's right.
1999.98-1667,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1952.892,1955.895,"Now, what... what part of section 6511?"
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1955.895,1965.554,"The... the particular part involved here is 6511(b)(2)(A), which begins to be quoted on appendix A-11 of the blue brief."
1999.98-1667,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1965.554,1969.634,"Okay, and what... point to the specific language--"
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1969.634,1986.226,"The specific language would be in the... if the claim was filed by the taxpayer during the 3-year period following the filing of the return, and that references us back up to 6511(a)."
1999.98-1667,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2050.033,2057.623,"--Mr. Jones, Mr. Rockler referred to regulations that he thought were supportive of his position."
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2060.157,2068.092,"Well, the only thing that he... he cites in the regulations are simply provisions that direct taxpayers as a general matter to make their refund claim on their return."
1999.98-1667,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2076.293,2086.98,"Well, Mr. Rockler wasn't overly impressed with your revenue procedure, and he says there's a glaring omission because the regs don't pick this up."
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2089.463,2095.688,"--Well, this is a procedural rule, so I mean, it is a regulation in the... in the broad sense of the term."
1999.98-1667,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2141.052,2147.952,"How... how is it supposed to work if some taxpayer doesn't know that much about it, is in some complicated situation?"
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2171.637,2176.651,"Well, if he... oh, you mean that he didn't even owe the 10,000 dollars."
1999.98-1667,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2176.651,2177.008,"Yes, right."
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2177.008,2181.063,"Well, that would certainly be an unfortunate situation."
1999.98-1667,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2186.121,2187.553,"Well, I don't know."
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2187.92,2195.089,"--To try to parse through the... the hypothetical, if... if he made it as a payment, which I assume he did because he didn't--"
1999.98-1667,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2195.089,2197.557,"He just... you know, he gets his tax... a very honest person."
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2211.113,2211.763,--I can answer your question.
1999.98-1667,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2222.617,2225.713,"Yes, but he didn't because he never heard from anybody for 5 years."
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2225.713,2228.53,"Well, I'm not sure what it was he needed to hear from us because--"
1999.98-1667,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2228.53,2230.829,"Well, in other words, suppose 5 years goes by."
1999.98-1667,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,2237.207,2240.53,"--All taxpayers are on notice of the law, and the law in this respect says--"
1999.98-1667,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2240.53,2241.704,He's out of luck.
