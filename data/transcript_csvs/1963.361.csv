1963.361,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,10.0,Number 361 et al. Jackson with et al petitioners versus United States.
1963.361,0,37744,paul_burks,,12.099,20.353,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, counsel for respondent."
1963.361,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,322.349,325.914,And that it not be a terminable interest or have you already mentioned that?
1963.361,0,37744,paul_burks,,325.914,327.478,I haven't come to that sir.
1963.361,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,327.478,329.213,But that is one of the provisions.
1963.361,0,37744,paul_burks,,329.213,341.199,"That is one of the provisions of Section 812 (b), yes sir."
1963.361,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,400.061,400.93,I am not sure I follow.
1963.361,0,37744,paul_burks,,411.267,412.582,No sir.
1963.361,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,412.582,414.567,But it is taxable I heard.
1963.361,0,37744,paul_burks,,414.567,415.946,It's taxable in the decedent's estate.
1963.361,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,415.946,416.966,In decedent's estate.
1963.361,0,37744,paul_burks,,416.966,418.381,"Yeah, that's right."
1963.361,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,424.295,425.04,I see.
1963.361,2,37744,paul_burks,,2927.126,2933.354,"The court mentioned, the counsel correspondent mentioned the six months provision."
1963.361,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3112.328,3116.918,"Is the government, there talking about this Connecticut Rule in (Inaudible) to the California Rule?"
1963.361,2,37744,paul_burks,,3116.918,3141.941,"The Connecticut Rule Your Honor was passed in 1961, and I submit that after reading Second National Bank of New Haven against the United States, which appears in 222 Federal Supplement at Page 446, the court will come to no conclusion except that the Connecticut Law was designed solely to take advantage of this lump sum payment doctrine."
1963.361,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3141.941,3150.49,"So be it, I can remember when before the marital deduction when states were considering by statute, turning themselves into community property estates for the same kind of a purpose?"
1963.361,2,37744,paul_burks,,3150.49,3164.446,"Yes, Your Honor, but then I think it stops to be a family allowance payment, the need becomes more of a body for being married rather than a support payment, because it doesn't make any difference, whether it goes to the widow or her estate under Connecticut Law."
1963.361,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3164.446,3170.879,(Inaudible)
1963.361,2,37744,paul_burks,,3170.879,3177.35,"I am arguing for both Your Honor, and I sincerely believe that they should both be allowed under the marital deduction provisions."
1963.361,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3185.433,3188.993,(Inaudible)
1963.361,2,37744,paul_burks,,3188.993,3202.097,"Well, I think the time of payment as in the respondent's brief, the time of payment should relate back to the date of death, but once paid in cash, there is no terminable interest."
1963.361,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3211.996,3219.363,(Inaudible)
1963.361,2,37744,paul_burks,,3219.363,3252.131,"They have Your Honor, but I have also mentioned these cases on Page 15 in the respondent's brief which elect to statute, a statutory right and a statutory right in all reality has much greater value to a widow, because it's referred to other claims than an interstate right, and it's for the property passing to another."
1963.361,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3259.56,3269.832,(Inaudible)
1963.361,2,37744,paul_burks,,3269.832,3274.375,"No, I don't, Your Honor."
1963.361,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3316.993,3320.729,(Inaudible)
1963.361,2,37744,paul_burks,,3320.729,3332.724,"Certainly or if it would paid in the life estate, I would say it didn't qualify because it wouldn't, it wouldn't go to the surviving spouse then in such a way as to be taxed in the estate of the surviving spouse."
1963.361,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3332.724,3338.375,"No such claim is widow's allowance, (Inaudible) in any state?"
1963.361,2,37744,paul_burks,,3338.375,3342.07,Conceivably it could be payment from an annuity for life.
1963.361,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3347.501,3362.288,(Inaudible)
1963.361,2,37744,paul_burks,,3362.288,3372.139,"I would say here in effect the court said, on the date of the order, you're entitled of $42,000 plus $3000 a month for 10 months."
1963.361,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3372.139,3373.122,(Inaudible)
1963.361,2,37744,paul_burks,,3373.122,3375.195,"Yes sir, $30,000."
1963.361,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3375.195,3385.264,(Inaudible)
1963.361,2,37744,paul_burks,,3385.264,3388.43,I don't think I would because â€“-
1963.361,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3388.43,3389.353,(Inaudible)
1963.361,2,37744,paul_burks,,3389.353,3401.574,"I think I would go back to the language of Section 812 (b) (5), which says amounts reasonably required and actually expended for the support of the decedent during the administration of the estate."
1963.361,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3427.618,3434.453,(Inaudible)
1963.361,2,37744,paul_burks,,3434.453,3435.542,"I would, Your Honor."
