1997.97-29,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.028,"We'll hear argument now in Number 97-29, Texas v. The United States."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,9.647,11.848,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,80.593,84.025,"If all that is true, Mr. Aguilar, then you have no problem."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,84.025,85.528,We... I--
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,85.528,87.979,"Just go ahead and do it, and--"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,87.979,88.898,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,90.1,91.402,--So why are you here?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,91.402,102.159,"--We're here because in fact, when this legislation was passed, we submitted all of the amendments to the Education Code, both those that affected voting and those that didn't."
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,114.637,116.767,That they were?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,116.767,117.519,That they--
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,117.519,118.297,"Were always, or could be?"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,118.297,119.549,"--Well, that they believed that--"
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,119.549,120.05,Might be.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,120.05,120.57,--Might be.
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,120.57,121.041,Might be.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,121.041,121.96,More appropriately stated.
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.365,142.386,They're unwilling to say that none of these... none of these might not be?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,142.386,158.317,"--Their unwillingness... well, I guess what they're saying is that they believe, since they precleared them as enabling legislation, that they... once we actually put them into effect in those situations when we need them, to utilize them, that they will result in--"
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,158.317,158.888,"Well, is that what it means?"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,176.211,177.301,"--Well, Your Honor, we--"
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,177.301,180.152,"We would probably do the same thing, when a case is brought before us."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,187.548,193.251,--But we didn't ask them to... we went ahead and provided them with the information they requested.
1997.97-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,203.81,206.141,"Well, Mr. Aguilar, I share Justice Scalia's concerns."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,217.498,218.73,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1997.97-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.73,220.781,And it isn't even ripe.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,251.381,264.431,"We're here, Your Honor, because we believe that the statute as written, and as limited by provision (e) on page 91a, in essence passes that bright line test that this Court established in Presley."
1997.97-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,264.431,265.719,Well--
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,265.719,267.751,"There is no way... there's no... I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy."
1997.97-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,267.751,270.762,--You began by reciting many of the things the trustees can do.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,281.782,282.73,That is true.
1997.97-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,282.73,288.464,The master can appoint a board of managers composed of residents that exercises all the powers and duties of the board of trustees.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,288.464,290.998,"That's not correct, Justice Kennedy."
1997.97-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,293.589,294.28,That's not--
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,294.28,301.005,"--The commissioner, under subdivision (9), is the one that can appoint a board of managers, and we did not challenge provisions (9) and (10)."
1997.97-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,312.322,320.208,--So you would submit to the Attorney General for preclearance any proposal to invoke the powers under (9) and (10)?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,320.208,321.959,Under (9) and (10) we would submit them.
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,362.946,363.806,Could you help me just a little bit--
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,363.806,364.547,"--Yes, Justice Stevens."
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,364.547,366.386,--on why (7) and (8) don't raise the same problem?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,366.386,367.989,There is--
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,367.989,374.772,"Because if you read (7) and (8) against the (e) over on 91a about all the things the management team and the master can do, they can direct any action to be taken, can't they?"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,374.772,379.577,"--They can direct any action to be taken... the reason... let me back up and start at the beginning, Justice Stevens."
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,387.952,388.774,"Yes, but that's also true of (9) and (10)."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,388.774,391.044,"--That's correct, but we're not arguing (9) and (10)."
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,391.044,396.037,I'm really trying to ask you to explain why you take one position on (9) and (10) and another position on (7) and (8).
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,396.037,398.617,"Because... (10) is easy, I think."
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,435.045,442.318,"No, I understand that, but Number 1 under (e) is may direct an action to be taken by the principal of a campus, the superintendent of the district, or the board of trustees of the dist--"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,442.318,442.788,--Well--
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,442.788,443.81,--They tell the board of trustees what to do.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,443.81,449.704,"--Well, they can tell the board of trustees what to do with regard to solving the problem in issue."
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,451.233,452.105,Why is that different from (9)?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,453.276,465.017,"--Because of the limitations they cannot... if we conceive of the authority of the elected board members as being a pie, we're not taking the entire pie away from them the way we are in (a)(9)."
1997.97-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,478.224,484.958,"I just don't read the statute that way when it says you may direct under (7), may direct an action to be taken by the board of trustees."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,489.009,493.774,"--Well, that is... you're right with regard to the allocation of the total amount of the budget."
1997.97-29,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,545.406,552.913,But he... but the manager or master could require that the budget items be reallocated?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,552.913,554.823,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,580.87,583.212,Could they order one school to bus children to another school?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,583.212,583.933,I beg your pardon?
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,583.933,585.845,Could they order busing from one school to another--
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,585.845,586.503,"No, they cannot."
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.124,587.705,--spending money?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,588.226,590.197,"Well, because that would be... if they're under a court order to bus--"
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,590.197,590.978,"No, no, no--"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,590.978,593.59,--they cannot in any way... they cannot in any way interfere with that.
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.59,598.762,"--I mean, just voluntarily adopt a program, we want to reallocate the students between two schools, say."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,604.295,604.866,"Well, I--"
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,604.866,605.947,"--You know, sometimes they're--"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,605.947,606.879,--I guess--
1997.97-29,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,606.879,610.569,--Boards do concern themselves with where the children will go to school.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,610.569,611.17,--Right.
1997.97-29,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,626.01,628.391,"But that's... it's fairly speculative, some of these answers."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,631.885,633.504,"No, they have not, Your Honor."
1997.97-29,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,633.504,644.524,So that just what the law does permit the masters to do is really not clearly established.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,644.524,657.71,"Well, I think that what they can do is limited by the problem at hand and how they go about solving it, the creativity of trying to solve that problem, but that's not where we... that's not the argument we're relying on."
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,658.861,660.093,Why wouldn't raising more money be?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,661.744,676.493,"--That is excluded under (e)(6), may not adopt a budget for the district... that's on page 92a--that provides for spending a different amount, exclusive of required debt service, from that previously adopted by the board of trustees."
1997.97-29,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,707.863,712.628,"Mr. Aguilar, this is a rather novel procedure as far as I know."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,727.925,730.168,"--No, Your Honor, and I think there's a good reason for that."
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,771.236,779.792,"Mr. Aguilar, what... this taking over the operations of the board is sort of a... in extremis remedy."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,781.914,784.635,"--(9) and (10) are the last steps, yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.635,787.316,"Well... oh, I'm sorry."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,808.451,809.002,That is correct.
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.002,810.411,There's six or seven of them?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,810.411,813.583,"There's six of them listed on page 90a, a public notice of the deficiency--"
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,813.583,814.134,Yes.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,814.134,814.664,--is the first one.
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,816.094,816.735,Right.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,816.735,817.626,--conducted by the board.
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,823.721,830.096,"Right, draconian is the word, and you would hope, I expect, never have... never to have to use that, wouldn't you?"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,830.096,842.024,"We would hope that the school boards, and we believe that the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of elected school board members of all 1,056 school boards in Texas are dedicated to making sure that their school districts--"
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,842.024,842.902,Right.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,844.034,844.735,--meet the standards that the State has--
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,844.735,845.515,"Well, I guess you have used it."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,852.839,853.46,--Well--
1997.97-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,853.46,854.931,Texas has in one case.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,854.931,856.112,--We have in one case.
1997.97-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,856.112,857.264,We have some evidence of that.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,857.264,862.156,"The... we made mention of the fact of the Wilmer Hutchins Independent School District, where we--"
1997.97-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,862.156,868.26,"Well, can you tell us, what were the powers that the master was directed to exercise in this Dallas district?"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,868.26,872.622,"--Well, if I may go outside the record, I certainly can answer that question."
1997.97-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,883.571,888.804,"Well, was the master directed to exercise powers (1) through (7), or (1) through (9), or was it that specific?"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,900.551,901.141,--Correct.
1997.97-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,901.141,913.989,"--or in Dallas County, and I want to know, was the master appointed and was he specifically directed to exercise statutory powers that were specifically listed under (a)(1) through (10)?"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,913.989,917.104,"No, Justice Kennedy, that's not the way it works."
1997.97-29,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,935.904,938.466,"Well, was he specifically appointed under (a)(7) and not under (a)(8)?"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,938.466,941.407,"--That is my recollection, yes."
1997.97-29,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,952.016,956.587,"Could you, before you finish, explain how you got into this Court?"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,993.692,994.733,"Yes, Justice--"
1997.97-29,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,994.733,996.506,How do you get into the Court on that kind of a theory?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,996.506,997.904,--Let me explain.
1997.97-29,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1023.752,1024.542,Why?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1047.358,1048.578,Your Honor--
1997.97-29,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1048.578,1050.25,Is there any authority or anything that a State--
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1050.25,1050.871,"--Well, no."
1997.97-29,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1072.315,1073.087,--All right.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1080.673,1081.555,--We're invoking the Court's--
1997.97-29,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1081.555,1083.555,"So you say, judge, I want you... to tell you something."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1087.158,1088.007,--Well--
1997.97-29,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1088.007,1093.962,"I mean, how... on those circumstances why wouldn't the judge say, the person who's invoked our jurisdiction concedes we don't have it?"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1093.962,1094.983,--The--
1997.97-29,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1094.983,1095.684,So we don't have to go further.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1095.684,1102.338,"--The... what we did with the court below was, we said that this is a section 5 issue with regard to the coverage question."
1997.97-29,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1109.912,1111.003,How do we get around the statute's language?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1111.003,1112.083,--I beg your--
1997.97-29,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1112.083,1114.196,How do... my problem is how to get around the statute's language.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1114.196,1116.807,"--Well, I think we're relying on this Court's decision in Allen."
1997.97-29,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1146.637,1172.874,"Mr. Aguilar, I think when I asked you the question, has a pure coverage action ever been brought before, you were candid and said no, but hasn't the coverage issue been tied to a routine section 5 case where the District says, we don't think this racially discriminates and, moreover, we don't even think it affects voting?"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1175.366,1176.327,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1997.97-29,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1241.229,1243.061,"Why couldn't you have waited till, say, the first case?"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1266.349,1268.191,"--Well, let me explain it this way, Your Honor."
1997.97-29,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1295.8,1298.08,"Well, let me interject, because there's one thing you could have done."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1311.55,1312.83,"--Oh, I see."
1997.97-29,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1313.571,1318.525,And take advantage of the expedited whatever that both the district court said it had and the Attorney General.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1318.525,1333.797,"--Well, if you're saying that back at the time when we presented the entire Education Code and then identified those areas that were election related for preclearance that we should have taken this issue and gone to the District of Columbia... is that--"
1997.97-29,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1333.797,1334.414,No.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1336.156,1337.477,--Actually--
1997.97-29,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1337.477,1339.91,--had whatever you had in that district near Dallas.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1339.91,1340.619,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1997.97-29,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1352.028,1355.761,"And there... it didn't take a year or two, did it, in the case that we have?"
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1357.651,1360.914,--With regard to preclearance of the--
1997.97-29,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1360.914,1361.495,Yes.
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1361.495,1362.096,--Wilmer Hutchins?
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1386.119,1387.761,"Mr. Aguilar, the law moves slowly."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1402.461,1403.112,"--Well, let me--"
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1403.112,1413.878,"What is it that you were compelled to do by having to wait until one of these horribles actually happened in order to litigate it now, something like in Abbott Labs."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1437.033,1442.859,"--Well, federalism is ultimately our greatest concern, Justice Scalia."
1997.97-29,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1447.071,1448.021,Do you think it's truly not an individual freedom?
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1461.429,1465.542,"--Well, we're also concerned about... well, our concern is with federalism."
1997.97-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1476.109,1479.421,"But there's a time and place to decide that, and this isn't the time."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1501.656,1505.097,"--Well, Your Honor, if we were to do that... that's what I was trying to explain earlier."
1997.97-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1537.08,1545.085,"Well, but when you did... when you did apparently submit something to preclearance in the Dallas district it took essentially a couple of months."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1548.788,1550.057,"--It took them 90 days, Your Honor."
1997.97-29,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1640.93,1646.264,"Well, I don't think... I don't see how waiving the magic word federalism alters the ripeness analysis."
1997.97-29,0,28791,javier_aguilar,,1646.264,1650.456,"I'm not suggesting that it magically alters it, Your Honor."
1997.97-29,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1687.66,1689.883,"Thank you, Mr. Aguilar."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1691.473,1696.037,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.97-29,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1730.749,1742.928,"Mr. Wolfson, before you do, I don't see that they're truly separate, because if you're right about ripeness, then there can never be this kind of action, because when it's ripe there will always be the actual--"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1742.928,1744.059,Right.
1997.97-29,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1761.031,1762.77,--Isn't that extremely hypothetical?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1774.268,1775.549,--I don't--
1997.97-29,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1775.549,1776.351,--hypothetical exercise?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1776.351,1788.58,"--I don't think you... I mean, the only reason why I think you might is if there were evidence of discriminatory intent and you wanted to come outside of section 5 by saying that you didn't have to... it wasn't covered at all, but I--"
1997.97-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1788.58,1792.323,The reason you'd want to do it is you don't want to play this game every time.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1811.035,1812.415,--They can raise the--
1997.97-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1812.415,1814.208,Because nothing under this statute is a change in voting.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1814.208,1818.78,"--They can raise... I think that if they invoke the jurisdiction... well, they can raise that in the courts in two ways."
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1851.02,1852.853,What about Allen?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1861.478,1862.72,I think that's true.
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.467,1878.189,"But how... what's that got to do with jurisdiction, the fact that there's no other way that a private party could do it?"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1878.189,1885.135,"--Well, in that case Allen really was sort of an implied cause of action case, I think, where the... the Court might not decide it on that way today."
1997.97-29,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1905.427,1921.109,"Well, Mr. Wolfson, the Attorney General encouraged Texas to submit this new law to it, to the Attorney General for preclearance, and the Attorney General looked at the first six categories of sanctions and said, fine, that's not the problem."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1938.059,1938.63,--Right.
1997.97-29,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1939.451,1942.3,Would that have... would the court have had jurisdiction to do that?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1942.3,1944.133,--I think it might.
1997.97-29,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1948.524,1951.008,But that's what they're arguing for sections (7) and (8).
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1951.008,1951.847,--I think--
1997.97-29,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1951.847,1955.45,"I mean, I have trouble with your juris... your no subject matter jurisdiction argument."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1955.45,1956.021,--I think as to (7)--
1997.97-29,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1956.021,1958.101,"Why can't the court just say it isn't ripe, and that's the end of it?"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1958.101,1961.984,"--I think... well, the court did say it isn't ripe, and our view is that this Court can--"
1997.97-29,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1961.984,1962.806,"Well, why can't we?"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1963.413,1964.004,--You can.
1997.97-29,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1964.004,1967.557,--I just... I think your subject matter jurisdiction argument is very troublesome.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1967.557,1970.769,I'm certainly happy for the Court to resolve the issue on ripeness.
1997.97-29,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1990.132,1991.815,But you can understand the State's concern.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2015.472,2028.119,"--I mean, there are many occasions... there are many occasions on which, of course, parties want to have their rights adjudicated definitively, and there are even occasions on which the other side wouldn't mind having that done, determined by the courts."
1997.97-29,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2028.119,2036.247,"Yes, but the Attorney General would be right in there opposing it, because it's I'm assuming a situation where the Attorney General is taking a very unrealistic view of it."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2036.247,2046.261,"Right, but the fact is that in our... in a system of the Federal courts that we have the courts can't resolve a controversy in advance of... can't resolve a dispute like that in advance of a--"
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.261,2047.093,Well--
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2047.093,2048.081,--Of a concrete case of controversy.
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2048.081,2049.954,"--But you know, in Allen the court found some way."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2054.114,2055.708,And that's not the case here.
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2055.708,2057.398,Why isn't it the case here?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2057.398,2066.313,"Well, there are... well, if the State really... if the State implements... if the State finds it necessary to go so far--"
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2066.313,2067.726,On Justice O'Connor's hypothesis.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2067.726,2068.126,--Okay.
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2073.56,2079.224,"Yes, but let's assume that the doctrine of ripeness would prevent many of this kinds of suits from being brought."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2087.567,2093.342,"--Well, again, I think that in terms of the district court's jurisdiction there are a number of factors that one has to take into account."
1997.97-29,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2103.269,2111.544,"Mr. Wolfson, can you explain that to me, because I had thought that in 702 the United States was waiving immunity for nonmonetary claims en masse."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2111.544,2120.631,"But this is not... I think Morris v. Gressette really resolves that this is not an Administrative Procedure Act type claim, and it has to fall within--"
1997.97-29,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2120.631,2125.383,"But I can see that the way... although 702 is in the APA, I didn't think it was limited to the APA."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2125.383,2136.591,"--I think our view is that the... that this case has to be resolved only within the confines... the jurisdiction is only within the confines of section 5 itself, and that it's really an exclusive... exclusive mechanism."
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2136.591,2137.751,But that wasn't what was done in Allen.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2137.751,2140.563,"Well, in Allen... in Allen--"
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2140.563,2143.104,In Allen the Court went into 1343.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2143.104,2155.563,"--That's right, but again that was... I mean, at that time I think the Court did not view actions against the States as raising the same sovereign immunity concerns that... as it might now or as it does against suits against the United States."
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2166.57,2190.996,"No, but Mr. Wolfson, as I understand it, even on your own argument, if they had gone into the D.C. court and said, we want preclearance, it's quite true we asked for preclearance from the Attorney General and we got it only, as it were, 90 percent of the way, we're coming in here and we're asking for preclearance 100 percent of the way... i.e. with no such condition as this enabling legislation, condition 9."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2202.063,2204.407,"Well, if they were... I think if they sought that--"
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2204.407,2205.045,Is... am I right?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2205.045,2206.497,"--Well, once they're implementing--"
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2206.497,2216.761,"Because you said, you know, if they come in and they ask for preclearance and then they say, as it were, as an afterthought, by the way, we don't think we're covered at all, this declaratory issue may be taken out."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2224.438,2237.828,"--I think if they were doing that before the statute had ever been implemented, or before there was ever any... in a situation where there was no expectation it would be implemented in the future, there would be a serious prudential ripeness concern there."
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2238.92,2240.42,"No, but I'm talking about jurisdiction."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2240.42,2240.96,--Right.
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2241.651,2242.342,"I mean, the statutory jurisdiction."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2242.342,2242.783,--Right.
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2244.743,2249.497,"Well then, why isn't the statutory jurisdictional argument here, then, one of pure formality?"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2262.007,2279.299,"--I think... well, I think that what it reflects is that they didn't preclear it... they didn't ask for preclearance because... and I can't speak for the State, obviously, why they didn't request preclearance, but that they knew that they weren't going to... they knew that it wasn't going to be done immediately, and so there was nothing to pre... there was no implementation of it to preclear."
1997.97-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2279.299,2281.17,They didn't ask for it because it might have been granted.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2284.052,2284.543,"Well, right, but--"
1997.97-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2284.543,2286.433,--is the same as Allen in this respect.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2295.359,2296.431,"--Right, but I don't think--"
1997.97-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.431,2304.335,"Because if they ask for preclearance, if I were a district judge I would say, why should I bother my brains about this, at least in this instance it's okay."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2321.786,2338.659,"--That may be, but I don't think... I mean, but the section is designed principally for preclearance, for preclearance actions, and I don't think... this is really somewhat hypothetical, but if the State did bring such an action and got preclearance, I don't think the State could complain about that."
1997.97-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2341.571,2342.32,No.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2342.32,2344.232,"--Preclearing legislation, and indeed--"
1997.97-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2344.232,2344.873,"No, that's the worst part of it."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2344.873,2345.201,"--No, but--"
1997.97-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.201,2347.384,Then they'll have to preclear every other one after that.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2348.093,2354.287,"--It wouldn't be the worst part of it, because then they would have a defense to any action brought by a private party in a local three... in a local district court, but that--"
1997.97-29,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2354.287,2357.77,--How can they make a judge advert to the issue that they want to bring--
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2357.77,2358.481,--I don't think they can.
1997.97-29,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2358.481,2359.262,--There's no way they can.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2359.262,2359.881,I don't think they can.
1997.97-29,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2360.812,2362.345,Just before... one quick second.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2378.484,2379.205,--I don't think so.
1997.97-29,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2380.084,2380.615,Why not?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2380.615,2399.477,"--It's... I think that section 5 is... well... I mean... well, I think that section 5 is really exclusive, and that they can't just proceed to a... I mean, I don't think they could proceed to a single district judge in a... in district court under the Declaratory Judgment Act, because I think that section... really the only way the issues--"
1997.97-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2399.477,2400.138,But section 5--
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2400.138,2401.217,--of coverage can be raised are those--
1997.97-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2401.217,2405.442,--The jurisdiction of section 5 is to grant preclearance of changes in affecting voting.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2410.714,2414.017,"--Well, I think that our view is that section 5 really is exclusive."
1997.97-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2414.017,2422.042,"--It's exclusive as to changes, but is it exclusive as to claims that there are no change... by the district itself that no change has taken place?"

1997.97-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2431.588,2432.349,--for that kind of action.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2432.349,2433.959,"--I mean, it can be raised--"
1997.97-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2433.959,2436.721,Only if they allege they're making a change.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2436.721,2450.101,"--It can be raised if they bring preclearance... I mean, a similar case is probably City of Lockhart, where I believe the city argued... they both argued for preclearance, and they also said, it's not a change."
1997.97-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2460.016,2460.717,Is that a case that was initiated by the city?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2461.328,2461.929,Yes.
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2485.113,2501.123,"Well, are you saying, then, that under Lockhart if the... if the three judge court in a section 5 action can examine whether or not there was, in fact, a change, can it also examine whether or not in fact the change affected voting?"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2501.123,2506.679,"The three judge court can, yes, and the similar cases, the other Texas case that was--"
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2506.679,2509.22,"So, then, there isn't any jurisdictional barrier here."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2509.22,2513.271,"--No, but in both of those cases there was an actual preclearance action brought."
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2525.84,2531.994,"Well, what if the State simply wants... and this question has been asked before, but I'm not sure I know your answer."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2538.729,2543.642,--I don't think that that... that there is jurisdiction for just that.
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2543.642,2553.599,"Well, under the declaratory... if section 5 doesn't afford it, and then why can't you go into a single judge district court and--"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2553.599,2557.269,"Well, first of all that's definitely not... I mean, that's definitely not what was done in this case, and so--"
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2557.269,2557.73,--No.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2557.73,2571.67,"--And so the question in this case is whether the three judge court had jurisdiction, and that would bring it to this Court under the mandatory direct appeal procedure, but whether or not it could have been brought in a three judge--"
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2571.67,2576.113,"Well, the Government never made the argument in the district court that it's making here, did it?"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2576.113,2576.623,--That's correct.
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2577.234,2579.104,So your whole argument's kind of novel.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2579.104,2593.113,"--We did... we did... but the district court did itself raise doubts as to whether it properly had statutory jurisdiction, and this Court has, on other occasions, itself examined whether there was a statutory basis for jurisdiction."
1997.97-29,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2593.113,2614.668,"But it's just so unlikely that we'd end up with a situation where a State wants a declaration that the law it passed does not affect voting, and to be told there is no forum in which to get that resolved, that is a very odd position to take."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2614.668,2626.416,"I guess our position is, the State can get that resolved when it is... when it is... it can actually implement the change and require somebody to come in, in effect, and challenge that."
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2626.416,2630.159,"Well, that was the law before they had declaratory judgments about lots of things--"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2630.159,2630.63,Right.
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2630.63,2634.61,"--that you just had to wait, but since the declaratory judgment action, that's no longer true."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2634.61,2641.485,"But I do want to... I just want to say that, I mean, it's not the case that the State has no forum in which its argument can be tested."
1997.97-29,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2641.485,2647.179,Are you saying that the district is well advised to just go ahead and appoint its master and wait to be sued?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2647.179,2649.112,I think that is an option that's--
1997.97-29,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2649.112,2651.933,"They're liable for attorney's fees if they're wrong, I take it?"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2651.933,2652.845,--We might... yes.
1997.97-29,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2653.234,2654.055,Are they liable for attorney's fees if they're wrong?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2654.055,2656.365,"--I believe under... yes, they are, if a private--"
1997.97-29,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2656.365,2665.843,Are the contracts and the decisions and the directions that the special master has given to the district before the litigation is terminated now at risk?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2668.813,2671.354,--I'm not sure.
1997.97-29,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2671.354,2676.898,You're advising this district to go ahead and implement a section 7 provision without getting preclearance?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2676.898,2684.074,"Well, they can also... they can also ask for preclearance, and we did preclear both in the City of New York case--"
1997.97-29,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2684.074,2684.585,Yes.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2685.804,2692.76,"--And City of New York... and once we asked the questions... well, once we asked questions, then we expeditiously precleared it."
1997.97-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2707.078,2709.06,You don't think the district court can act any faster?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2713.322,2715.453,--I--
1997.97-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2715.453,2717.476,You're certainly not going to just lie down in this one forum and--
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2717.476,2722.809,"--I mean, I do think that the Attorney General's review is viewed as more expeditious, and... but I don't think that... I mean, I don't think--"
1997.97-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2722.809,2723.47,--But it is a significant burden.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2730.734,2731.405,--Right.
1997.97-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2731.405,2734.056,"--and if they have an emergency situation, they really have a difficult problem--"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2734.056,2735.987,"Well, the City of New York case was done in 22 days."
1997.97-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2754.829,2756.261,--May I ask you a jurisprudential question?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2764.657,2764.978,--I do.
1997.97-29,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2845.914,2864.677,"Mr. Wolfson, does the Attorney General have any provision for taking immediate action to allow partial implementation of a law like this pending its decision on the preclearance request?"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2889.133,2894.449,I'm not aware that the Attorney General's guidelines have anything directly on that point.
1997.97-29,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2924.678,2950.435,"It seems to me rather puzzling and somewhat ironic that you are urging that the State of Texas can proceed, without any preclearance at all, to implement a section 7 plan when you have gone through the preclearance procedure in the Wilmer Hutchins district, and you say, well just go right ahead and take your chances, but you can't go into the United States District Court."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2959.22,2968.026,"Well, I mean, I think that if there is... if they're actually implementing it, then that is by far the preferred procedure, to go into the three judge district court."
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3026.845,3030.826,"Mr. Wolfson, you're working in the direction of ripeness, and your time is--"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3030.826,3031.427,Finally.
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3031.427,3032.068,--fleeting.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3033.847,3034.388,Yes.
1997.97-29,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3071.685,3072.963,But we know it happened once--
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3072.963,3073.655,--We know it happened--
1997.97-29,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3073.655,3080.69,"--so why can't they just amend the thing and say, look, it happened to us once, and we want assurance that it will never happen again?"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3080.69,3093.436,"--I think that Renne v. Geary is actually fairly clear that that does not... fact does not change either the analysis or the result, that that... that controversy was moot before this complaint was filed."
1997.97-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3093.436,3097.441,May I ask you one question that kind of troubles me about the... your position?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3122.815,3135.896,"I think... well, one thing is that under the Texas law when the Commissioner of Education appoints a master or a management team he is supposed to delineate the powers of the master or the management team."
1997.97-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3148.414,3151.387,"But they're all going to be the totality set forth in the statute, I think."
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3151.387,3156.779,"--Right, but I think the... I mean, that point we may have, we and the district court may have questions."
1997.97-29,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3168.807,3169.607,Right.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3169.607,3174.19,"--by the school board, but it also says that the master or the management team may direct the trustees to take any action."
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3188.841,3190.373,Can you be more specific?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3205.583,3206.024,--I... right.
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3206.024,3206.584,Because your brother--
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3206.584,3207.085,Right.
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3207.496,3207.996,--in effect is saying there's no such thing.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3207.996,3208.487,--Right.
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3222.106,3224.246,Not authority that would go so far as 9 and 10.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3224.246,3224.707,--Right.
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3224.707,3225.137,Right.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3225.137,3233.893,"But still, you might have... still... I mean, the... well, under 9, for example, the board of managers can just say, I'm going to do a new budget, you know."
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3248.843,3249.544,"Well, how does it work?"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3250.693,3251.294,--Right.
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3251.294,3253.515,Can you give me a budget hypothesis that would--
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3253.515,3255.237,The State... the school district--
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3255.237,3255.967,--That would not go so far as 9 and 10?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3255.967,3262.962,"--The school district has a budget, and the master or the management team takes a look at it and says, you know, I don't like this budget."
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3288.728,3295.834,Is it any way that it would be a de facto replacement in a way that would implicate the discriminatory concerns of the section 5?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3295.834,3296.335,--It could.
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3298.835,3299.256,How?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3299.256,3302.498,"--Well, I do want to say just because it's a de facto replacement doesn't mean it does."
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3303.099,3303.468,That's right.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3303.468,3305.411,--It may be perfectly okay.
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3339.865,3345.999,"So you're saying the choice of educational policy, reflected in a budget, can also be a reflection of--"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3345.999,3346.918,--Of school--
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3346.918,3350.109,"--Of racial composition, and if you affect that, then it is a voting--"
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3350.109,3351.291,--I think it--
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3351.291,3352.741,--It is a de facto replacement that would be covered by 5.
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3352.741,3353.372,--I think that the--
1997.97-29,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3353.372,3353.993,That's your argument?
1997.97-29,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,3353.993,3360.357,"--I think that the budget reflects... you know, among other things reflects the entire policy that the school board, the elected school board wants."
1997.97-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3372.647,3373.658,"Thank you, Mr. Wolfson."
