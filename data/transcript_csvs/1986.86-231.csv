1986.86-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,20.829,"We will hear argument next in No. 86-231, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation versus Yahn and McDonnell, Inc., et al, and related case."
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,48.564,50.933,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,72.012,79.5,"The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit not too long ago sat en banc all the time, didn't it?"
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,79.5,83.32,"--I understand this was the second time... well, that is true, Your Honor."
1986.86-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,86.856,88.724,They got all four judges in one room?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,88.724,91.76,Right.
1986.86-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,172.295,175.58,"What is the bill supposed to represent, Mr. Ford?"
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,175.58,181.068,--It represents an initial claim of the pension plan for liability for the employer's withdrawal.
1986.86-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,181.068,184.769,And how is that measured?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,184.769,212.103,"The statute starts out with the amount of benefits that the plan is legally bound to pay but which are unfunded as of a date before the employer's withdrawal and then the statute has four detailed rules which the plan may choose among for dividing up that unfunded vested benefit amount based generally, Mr. Chief Justice, on the level of the employer's prior participation in the plan."
1986.86-231,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,220.859,224.779,xxx facial challenge?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,224.779,226.029,This is a facial challenge.
1986.86-231,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,227.548,232.35,I think that is important for both sides in the argument.
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,232.933,234.035,"Yes, sir."
1986.86-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,234.352,237.487,How come it is ripe?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,246.676,246.976,--That's right.
1986.86-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,246.976,251.664,"Had he gone through them, he might have come up with something that was totally satisfactory."
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,251.664,257.233,It is possible that he could have had this case mooted had he gone through the procedures.
1986.86-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,271.91,274.862,"Oh, that's nice."
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,276.495,312.635,"This Court in Thomas against Union Carbide held that where the procedures themselves are objected to is fundamentally unconstitutional, that ripeness is a prudential matter in essence, and here the Third Circuit having struck down a provision of law enacted by Congress, the appeal being mandatory to this Court, and there being considerable uncertainty among the courts and the arbitrators who are dealing with these disputes, we would suggest to the Court that it exercise its prudential judgment to decide this matter."
1986.86-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.635,315.07,It is only prudential?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,317.272,327.295,"Because there is an objection to the fundamental fairness on the part of the appellees and perhaps counsel would address that as well, as to the procedures that they are being asked to go through."
1986.86-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.847,339.887,Was that the same situation as you have here where the only thing being objected to is not the taking of any property but the procedure?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,343.356,366.455,"--I am hesitant to characterize the appellees' position on that, but I think it would be as follows, that the procedures themselves inculcate or perpetuate a bias that predated the arbitration hearing, so they are being asked to go through a biased proceeding, and the Court has held in other contexts... another would be Gibson against Berryhill... that a party need not do that."
1986.86-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,368.438,373.376,"Well they are claiming a biased decisionmaker, in effect."
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,373.376,375.31,"--That's correct, and again--"
1986.86-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,375.31,383.064,"And they argue that in every case the decisionmaker, as structured here, is inherently biased."
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,383.064,384.666,--That is how I understand the argument.
1986.86-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,539.166,554.009,"Under 1401(a)(3)(A), which is the section dealing with things like determination when the withdrawal takes place and whether it falls within an exception and so forth."
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,567.853,568.419,"Yes, it is."
1986.86-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,568.419,573.59,"Which one, and why is it phrased that way, do you think?"
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,573.59,579.66,"Justice O'Connor, let me state at the outset my agreement that the language is at least curious."
1986.86-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,677.74,686.43,How does that differ from simply having to prove by the preponderance of the evidence that your own view of the matter is correct?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,686.43,690.215,"That is essentially what it stands for, or that the plan was unreasonable."
1986.86-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,692.0,708.526,"The things that are covered under 1401(a)(3)(A) are not simply policy determinations, are they, like the decisions under (a)(3)(B)?"
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,708.526,710.845,"No, Your Honor, they are not."
1986.86-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,716.365,718.084,They might be matters of historical fact.
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,718.084,718.484,Right.
1986.86-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,779.123,787.295,Is that any different from saying the burden shall be upon the party who brings the action in the District Court to prove his case?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,787.295,789.913,--It suggests... I think that is correct.
1986.86-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,904.488,907.09,xxx you say achieves that now?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,907.09,923.1,The presumption in the arbitration that assigns the burden of proof to the employer discourages the arbitrator from essentially allowing an employer to slip a marginal case by and discourages employers from feeling they can succumb to that temptation.
1986.86-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,944.78,956.838,"Mr. Ford, it seems to me that you are pointing out that their competitors, that the trustees may be employed by competitors of the withdrawing employer makes the bias argument greater rather than lesser."
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,956.838,988.875,"Let me note at the outset, Justice Stevens, that normal civil litigants to whom burdens of proof are assigned, both defendants and plaintiffs... for example, fraud is provable by defendants by clear and convincing evidence... are by their nature biased in their own interests, so even if one accepted the argument of the appellees here that trustees are biased doesn't change our conclusion about how fairly this statute works, but... and we don't accept that argument, but--"
1986.86-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,988.875,996.831,"Well, if one did, why should there be a presumption of correctness for their factual determinations?"
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,996.831,1021.597,"--Simply to accomplish the several important practical policy goals that I have enumerated, preventing abuse, making the party with the evidence come forward, encouraging uniformity, and second, looking at the same factors that courts look at when they order the burden and weight of evidence, order and weight of evidence in judicial proceedings at common law, who is changing the status quo?"
1986.86-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1058.556,1075.433,"Well, it just looks like there are different categories of things, though, under the statute, and as to things like the actuarial assumptions and which method of allocation is going to be used, that perhaps that isn't even an adjudicative decision."
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1090.777,1097.514,We don't believe that they are biased or that they are decisionmakers in the constitutional sense.
1986.86-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1100.766,1112.79,"No, but aren't they for some historical facts on questions of when the withdrawal took place and whether the exceptions are called into play, and so forth?"
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1112.79,1126.616,"--They do make decisions about the application of the law to specific facts, but we would submit, Your Honor, that it proves far too much to say that any time a party in a proceeding makes those kinds of decisions he becomes an adjudicator."
1986.86-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1133.604,1141.21,But a plaintiff in an ordinary civil case doesn't get any burden of proof assigned to him just because he made a particular choice.
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1141.21,1142.41,"It may depend, Your Honor."
1986.86-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1164.191,1165.375,After the fact?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1179.518,1183.22,"--This employer withdrew after this law was passed, over a year later."
1986.86-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.22,1183.92,Withdrew--
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1183.92,1184.37,That's correct.
1986.86-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1184.37,1185.972,--but had he joined after it was passed?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1185.972,1187.121,He joined well before that.
1986.86-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1194.51,1203.383,"Well, that is just like saying, you know, the government can change the attributes of insurance policies and say it is fair enough so long as you die after the law is passed."
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1208.27,1230.433,"--I think, Justice Scalia, that the Court has grappled with already the question of an even more... an overt form of retroactivity in its decision in the R.A. Gray case, and upheld the original version of the statute which imposed liability for withdrawal events that occurred before September 26th, 1980, when the statute was enacted."
1986.86-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.837,1241.908,Would you tell me again how do you want us to read 1401(a)(3)(A)?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1253.083,1270.944,"We would suggest that the Court read it to assign to the employer the burden of proof of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that a determination was unreasonable or erroneous or read the words ""clearly erroneous"" to be satisfied where he preponderance of the evidence establishes it, and I would--"
1986.86-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1270.944,1273.296,"Now, that still gives me some problem."
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1292.591,1298.995,"--The unreasonable standard, I would note that the language is disjunctive, going back to Justice O'Connor's earlier question."
1986.86-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1307.101,1320.075,"Okay, but then the... to say that the burden is on the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the determination was clearly erroneous, I mean, that isn't the easiest thing when you start parsing it down."
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1326.681,1330.883,--I think it is not.
1986.86-231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1372.21,1378.447,"You are saying the word ""clearly"" is just... less than superfluous, you are just saying it doesn't mean what it says."
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1378.447,1408.133,"Justice Scalia, I think that in reading this language and rationalizing it, one must either deemphasize preponderance of the evidence which would be inconsistent with the legislative history, with 1401(c) on the next page, and would present the Court with a more difficult question, or it must deemphasize the word 1401(c)."
1986.86-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1408.133,1409.418,"Mr. Ford, can I ask you a question?"
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1421.393,1422.409,No dispute here.
1986.86-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1422.409,1426.278,So that really is a question that may not have to be faced up to?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1426.278,1427.197,That's correct.
1986.86-231,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1429.831,1432.199,Or whether an exception applies?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1432.199,1440.537,"There was raised, prior to arbitration, claims by the company for treatment under certain exception provisions."
1986.86-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1463.736,1467.422,Does the statute contain a definition of when a withdrawal occurs?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1467.422,1478.329,"Yes, it does, and the definition of a withdrawal is an employer's permanent cessation either of the obligation to contribute or of covered operations under the plan."
1986.86-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1481.431,1483.049,What section is that definition in?
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1483.049,1486.501,--That is in 29 USC 1383.
1986.86-231,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.501,1490.286,Thank you.
1986.86-231,0,25299,gary_m_ford,,1490.286,1512.532,"Now, the conclusion that... the importance of the whole entire discussion of the operation of the presumption is that the Third Circuit concluded that it insulates the decision of the trustees made in formulating a claim, a civil claim from effective review by the arbitrator."
1986.86-231,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1566.953,1568.836,"Thank you, Mr. Ford."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,1575.642,1589.533,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like first to address the question why is this case ripe, because it seems to me that should be addressed at the outset."
1986.86-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1624.206,1635.179,"xxx writing it down facially, but it is not a justification for allowing a challenge where there has not yet been any harm from the process."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,1635.179,1648.421,"What I read that as saying, Your Honor, is that the... how the statute works in one particular case cannot inform us when we are looking at a constitutionally defective evidentiary standard."
1986.86-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1726.856,1733.343,"Hadn't the license been denied or suspended then, and the proceeding was whether to reinstate it?"
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,1735.379,1737.762,"I don't recall that that was the case, Your honor."
1986.86-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1793.966,1800.487,"Well, of course... but you can only challenge facially things that apply to your clients."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,1800.487,1811.61,"--Your Honor, I suggest that again under the standard in the Santosky case that that... that restricts this Court too much."
1986.86-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1811.61,1823.251,"Well, the Santosky case certainly didn't purport to restate settled principles as I understood them that outside of the area of the First Amendment there is no such thing as overbreadth."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,1829.222,1833.459,Perhaps the Court misunderstood me or I misunderstood the Court.
1986.86-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1841.814,1842.664,--But as to what?
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,1846.983,1850.135,"--Under both (a)(3)(A) and (a)(3)(B), Your Honor."
1986.86-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1850.135,1856.741,"Well, it doesn't look like there's anything that your client has raised under (a)(3)(A), is there?"
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,1856.741,1858.358,Our client did in fact raise--
1986.86-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1858.358,1861.026,Is there a dispute about the date of withdrawal?
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,1861.026,1879.337,"--Our client did in fact raise a contest under 1405 of the statute, 29 US Code 1405, as to whether as a liquidating employer it was entitled to a reduction."
1986.86-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1988.976,1993.963,What are the kinds of things that the trustees decide in your client's case?
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,1997.332,2005.004,"The trustees would decide, first of all, the facts producing the liability."
1986.86-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2005.004,2008.289,Are those disputed here?
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2008.289,2009.789,"Yes, they are."
1986.86-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2064.458,2069.76,"Are either of those disputed here, when and whether there has been withdrawal?"
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2069.76,2072.262,"Not that I am aware of, Your Honor."
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2167.943,2168.626,But Mr. Taylor--
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2168.626,2168.993,"--Yes, sir."
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2168.993,2171.328,--is it clear the presumption applies to those issues?
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2171.328,2172.162,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2172.162,2174.43,"I know courts have held that, but I don't think the statutory language is all that clear."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2174.43,2176.716,"Yes, Your Honor, in 1401."
1986.86-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2193.808,2197.462,You cite to 1401(a)(3)(A).
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2201.747,2208.335,"It is the... I was citing the statute, Your Honor, the US Code section."
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2208.335,2209.52,It is 65A.
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2209.52,2215.007,In the jurisdictional statement.
1986.86-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2215.007,2215.707,Where it reads
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2219.459,2220.026,"That's it, Your Honor."
1986.86-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2221.078,2223.128,Okay.
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2227.649,2230.283,(3)(B) is a particular subset.
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2230.283,2234.068,I don't understand why you needed (3)(B) if you read (3)(A) correctly.
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2234.068,2242.658,"Well, I think that decisions under (3)(A), because they deal with historical facts, are either correct or not correct."
1986.86-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.418,2272.027,"No, but it seems to me still true that if your broad reading of (3)(A) is correct everything in (3)(B) would already have been included within (3)(A) because the actuarial assumptions and the rest are determinations made by the plan sponsor."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2272.027,2274.379,"--I think the difference is the word ""reasonable in the aggregate""."
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2279.181,2280.616,"Where are the words ""reasonable in the aggregate""?"
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2280.616,2287.853,--In (3)(B).
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.853,2292.305,I must say I dismiss them.
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2292.305,2294.09,It's a difference--
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2294.09,2296.709,"Oh, I see, reasonable... all right."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2296.709,2297.809,"--It's a difference, not--"
1986.86-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2297.809,2308.682,And you don't really quarrel with the approach then in (3)(B) for actuarial assumptions?
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2319.222,2325.209,"--No, Your Honor, I would distinguish between the words ""reasonable in the aggregate"" and who has the burden of proving that."
1986.86-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2333.215,2336.334,--But that is so different from an historical fact.
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2346.19,2347.475,"--The only difference, Your Honor--"
1986.86-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2347.475,2352.443,--to determine whether the actuarial assumptions are valid other than--
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2352.443,2368.471,"--The only difference, Your Honor, would be that the plan must prove that the assumptions are reasonable in the aggregate rather than the employer having to prove that they are unreasonable in the aggregate because 29 US Code Section 1393 independently says that the assumptions must be reasonable in the aggregate."
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2422.773,2436.865,"--Yes, but in these matters isn't it a fact that if the actuary makes an interest assumption for purposes of computing unfunded liability and the rest they are going to make the same assumptions for purposes of filing their reports and for purposes of making claims like this and all the rest."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2439.234,2456.529,"If the Court would turn to Page 9A of the appellee's brief, we have set forth in the appendix the actual assessment made by this plan to this employer."
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.917,2527.875,"Well, do you think that in a withdrawal proceeding they could come up with one interest assumption and then use entirely different assumptions in running the plan and computing their annual unfunded liability and the like?"
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2527.875,2534.129,"If the circumstances call for a difference, Your Honor, then the law requires a difference."
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2534.129,2537.265,I am glad I am not a trustee of one of those plans.
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2540.267,2564.882,"Now, there is an issue in the brief as to... by the way, before I leave that, we do concede, we agree with the PGBC that the allocation method, the presumptive or one of the other three or four methods for determining how the unfunded vested liability is going to be allocated is not an arbitrable matter."
1986.86-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2567.167,2568.469,That doesn't go to arbitration at all?
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2568.469,2571.488,That doesn't go to arbitration at all.
1986.86-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2733.843,2757.173,"Mr. Taylor, even if you are right on the bias question, explain to me again if you would why it is unconstitutional for Congress under 1401(a)(3)(B) to place the burden of proof on the withdrawing employer on the unreasonableness of actuarial assumptions--"
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2757.173,2759.075,Precisely because--
1986.86-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2759.075,2759.792,--before the arbitrators.
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2759.792,2770.1,"--Precisely because, Your Honor, the determination of those assumptions is made ex parte by individuals who lack impartiality."
1986.86-231,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2770.1,2778.122,"Yes, but I don't understand why Congress couldn't place the burden of proof of unreasonableness on the withdrawing employer."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2793.049,2799.785,"Your Honor, I will agree with the Court's suggestion that the harm under B is less than the harm under A."
1986.86-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2816.129,2817.497,"May I ask this, Mr. Taylor?"
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2817.497,2818.981,Yes.
1986.86-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2818.981,2832.607,"Would you still be complaining if you had entered this plan after the statute was passed so that you knew, every employer knew when he went in if I am the first one out this is what is going to happen?"
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2846.266,2848.283,"Your Honor, I think that analysis applies."
1986.86-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2891.712,2895.264,I don't know what you mean when you say you are not trying to get the benefits of it.
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2895.264,2901.235,We are not trying to get... no employer is trying to get the benefits of this statute.
1986.86-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2915.161,2919.362,"Well, but you know, people always enter contracts for reasons of economic necessity."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2922.498,2926.383,"--Yes, but what I am suggesting, Your Honor, is that this is not a contractual liability."
1986.86-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2928.652,2953.018,"It is a statutory description of what happens if you enter a certain kind of contract, and if you choose to enter that kind of contract, it seems to me it is no worse having what you consider unjust procedures attached to your departure than it would be to have, let's say, a penalty attached to your departure, and when you go into the contract you say, well, that is bad for me if I am the first out, but it is good for me if I am the last out, and you know, I will take it."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2953.018,2960.088,"I think what the Court is suggesting is either a consent or a waiver argument, and I would invite--"
1986.86-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2960.088,2961.473,"Well, this pertains to your facial challenge."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2974.014,2984.655,"--This Court's opinions, Overmeyer v. Freckam and others, say that a waiver of procedural due process rights must be clear and unmistakable."
1986.86-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2996.63,2997.313,Oh.
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,2997.313,2999.332,It is not a knowingly--
1986.86-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2999.332,3004.866,All provisions you enter into under coercion of strike threat are adhesion contracts?
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,3004.866,3005.918,--Exactly.
1986.86-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3006.485,3007.018,Wow.
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,3007.018,3007.485,Exactly.
1986.86-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3044.61,3045.993,"No, but it is a contract."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,3055.918,3061.572,I would respectfully suggest the clear and unmistakable waiver analogy ought to apply here.
1986.86-231,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3061.572,3062.789,Clear and unmistakable.
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,3062.789,3070.528,"Yes, and also the contract of adhesion is important in Fuentes and in Overmeyer v. Shick."
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3166.222,3173.412,Is it unconstitutional for the Revenue Code to give the government a presumption that assessments are valid?
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,3173.412,3176.447,"Your Honor, that is a different case."
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3191.54,3194.908,"No, but their client has the same interest as the trustee's client has here."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,3198.377,3203.681,"--Well, Your Honor, the IRS is one agency."
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3226.761,3232.581,"Yes, out supposing you had a statue that said in big stores like?"
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,3242.589,3243.473,I think it would.
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3243.473,3245.675,You do?
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,3245.675,3246.341,I certainly think it would.
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3246.341,3251.412,You think the burden must fall... the Constitution requires in all civil litigation the burden must be on the plaintiff?
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,3251.412,3259.934,"Unless Congress adjudicatively determines some particular presumption, such as in Usery v. Turner Elkhorn--"
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3259.934,3260.85,Or in here they say--
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,3260.85,3263.969,--where Fact A can be presumed from Fact B.
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3303.627,3306.096,--But if it didn't have that would it be unconstitutional?
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,3306.096,3306.748,If they didn't have that?
1986.86-231,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3306.748,3307.398,Yes.
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,3309.031,3322.691,"In order to finish going through a couple more points I would like to say that since they have it and since that reg itself points out, I think maybe the best answer is the reg itself."
1986.86-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3347.39,3348.075,Touche.
1986.86-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3348.892,3349.325,"Thank you, Mr. Taylor."
1986.86-231,1,20174,carl_l_taylor,,3350.408,3350.944,Thank you.
1986.86-231,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3350.944,3354.562,"Mr. Ford, you have four minutes remaining."
1986.86-231,2,25299,gary_m_ford,,3354.562,3356.112,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.86-231,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3580.992,3581.844,Thank you.
