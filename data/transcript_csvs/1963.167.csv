1963.167,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.068,"-- versus Hon. Joseph A. Sarafite, Judge."
1963.167,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,8.068,11.316,May I please the Court.
1963.167,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,11.316,12.368,Mr. â€“
1963.167,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,12.368,13.076,Mr. Fraenkel.
1963.167,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,13.076,14.131,-- Redfield.
1963.167,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,14.131,14.949,No Mr. Fraenkel.
1963.167,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,14.949,15.599,"Oh, Mr. Fraenkel."
1963.167,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,15.599,16.299,Yes sir.
1963.167,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,16.299,18.584,Of course Fraenkel.
1963.167,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,18.584,30.762,Mr. Redfield is going to deal with the legal questions primarily and I will relate the circumstances under which the case arose.
1963.167,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,176.85,179.013,May I ask what (Inaudible) eye witness?
1963.167,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,179.013,182.314,"He claims he was not, the Judge ruled that he was --"
1963.167,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,182.314,187.386,And he refused -- and he refused to testify that actually he was given immunity?
1963.167,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,187.386,192.598,He had originally asked for immunity.
1963.167,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,199.439,202.339,"That wouldn't indicate that he was very friendly, would it?"
1963.167,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,202.339,210.097,"No and of course he was, he admittedly believed that the defendant was innocent."
1963.167,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,211.275,215.702,Which in itself -- which in itself might name that he was a defendant witness?
1963.167,0,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,223.436,240.455,"Well, I am taking from the record of course there is a statement to that effect of whether in fact he was or was not, may not really be relevant to this case now before Your Honors, difficulties arose."
1963.167,1,23029,emanuel_redfield,,2513.022,2515.71,May it please the Court.
1963.167,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2621.077,2626.163,"Well apart from the fact that the, facts were quite different in the Panico case."
1963.167,1,23029,emanuel_redfield,,2626.163,2627.328,Not totally different --
1963.167,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2627.328,2638.688,"But I believe that could be argued, he was in an institution Mr. Panico, but at the hindsight, the point is that of due process at all that was in the Federal Court."
1963.167,1,23029,emanuel_redfield,,2638.688,2638.905,Right.
1963.167,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2638.905,2642.769,"And involved the supervisory power of this Court, it wasn't a due process case."
1963.167,1,23029,emanuel_redfield,,2642.769,2648.145,I'm translating it into due process in this state case.
1963.167,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2715.71,2788.336,(Inaudible)
1963.167,1,23029,emanuel_redfield,,2788.336,2810.027,"As tradition goes, it has been held that that could be done, but you still might have the same question raised by the defendant at that time, was he of emotional state at the time so that an intent could be spelled out, but that is not the case here."
1963.167,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2810.027,2836.283,(Inaudible)
1963.167,1,23029,emanuel_redfield,,2836.283,2857.711,"It may have in his discretion and in that respect I cannot ignore, but the occasion however of the contempt having evaporated after the trial had ended days later, I don't see what necessity there was for any summary proceeding."
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3181.12,3184.102,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1963.167,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3453.551,3455.708,He shouted what?
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3455.708,3458.215,"He shouted the phrase which has been read here, Your Honor."
1963.167,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3588.869,3602.3,"(Inaudible) keep the Court from being interrupted, that basis, provided that is the basis for disappearance right after the trial was over."
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3602.3,3619.172,"It certainly would Mr. Justice Black and I think that if that were the only purpose, if that were the only justification for the brief or procedure of a summary contempt, then it would be extremely difficult to argue that the power remained after the purpose of disappear."
1963.167,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3644.154,3661.746,"(Inaudible) time to time, have from time to time, have they not if the judge waited until the trial was over, looked to see if the attack was so personal that judge should not sit on it and remanded it for trial by different judge."
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3661.746,3680.035,"Yes, certainly if the attack is such, if the -- record itself indicates that the Court has lost that appearance of impartiality which is so vital to a trial and to justice then I should think a better procedure would be for the judge to refer to another judge."
1963.167,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3680.035,3694.429,"Well I suppose you would agree that this man had told him an unspeakable name and he waited until the case was over, that they ought to (Inaudible)"
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3694.429,3698.231,"No I wouldn't go that far Mr. Justice, for this reason."
1963.167,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3708.378,3710.597,In the record (Inaudible)
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3710.597,3718.591,The record -- I think the record in case shows if I may Mr. Justice Black that this judge exercised super human self control.
1963.167,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3738.697,3745.903,"The outstanding rule in that Court that not effective, it should leave the court (Inaudible)"
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3745.903,3747.714,"There is no such standing rule, no Your Honor."
1963.167,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3747.714,3749.65,Was that a rule enforced by this judge?
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3749.65,3759.453,"This particular judge is very strict about that, and during certain proceedings he will not allow spectators to leave, this apparently was one of them."
1963.167,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3773.529,3777.904,Although that rule -- there was no such general rule in the other courtrooms?
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3777.904,3786.281,"There is no such general rule that I know of Your Honor, but I must say that occurrences such as this are extremely rare in that Court."
1963.167,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3786.506,3788.172,"For what, for spectators to leave?"
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3788.172,3790.507,No for a court to adjudicate a man in contempt.
1963.167,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3790.507,3812.911,(Inaudible)
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3812.911,3813.833,Yes.
1963.167,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3813.833,3827.173,(Inaudible)
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3827.173,3857.366,"No Your Honor I would say that the basis of this contempt was both aspects of the statute, but the statute does not talk about an actual disruption of the proceedings of the Court, but rather actions tending to disrupt, and if it were not for the fact that the Court advanced the recess, the luncheon recess, at that point it might very well actually disrupted, and I think it certainly could be labeled conduct tending to disrupt, when a witness has flatly stated in the middle of his testimony that he will not go on."
1963.167,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3862.068,3884.928,(Inaudible)
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3884.928,3887.497,Well actually I have not quiet completed that thought.
1963.167,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3913.452,3914.689,What is the second?
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3914.689,3929.596,"The second I believe is this that the court, the sitting court has knowledge of all the facts necessary to make the adjudication and hence there is no trial of an issue in the conventional sense."
1963.167,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3966.024,3994.114,"I thought that in one or two cases, may be I am wrong, that we had referred to the first case that ever held of the judge, five men punished with contempt of court, summarily and explained that as (Inaudible) according to the language in that first case, that if it only do that when it would interrupt the proceedings of the Court if it didn't act at once."
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3994.114,4010.354,I think I know the doctrine that Your Honor is referring to and it certainly has been stated by many justices of this Court throughout the history of these proceedings that only the least power necessary to the proposed end is justified.
1963.167,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4056.619,4071.094,"I thought it had been held one or two cases if that were not true, unless the -- what the man did was necessarily to do that at the time to prevent further interruption of the court (Inaudible)"
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4071.094,4083.148,"Well, Your Honor all I can refer to is the Sacher case in the first instance in which that was held and secondly to something which is perhaps not as explicit as it might be in Panico case."
1963.167,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4116.207,4185.374,(Inaudible)
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4185.374,4190.702,Yes Your Honor I should say he is and for this reason.
1963.167,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4225.757,4249.134,(Inaudible)
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4249.134,4253.531,"No, not at all, I don't and I don't think the Judge ignored it here."
1963.167,2,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4308.503,4310.227,(Inaudible)
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4310.227,4317.302,"Only from the court itself Your Honor, I think you will find that the court said as to apology if this is something which --"
1963.167,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4317.302,4333.007,"On page 105 and on page 107, on page 105 in the paragraph at about the middle of the page --"
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4333.007,4337.602,Yes at no time was there any intent on my part to do or say anything to affront the dignity of the Court.
1963.167,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4337.602,4348.819,"It's not -- technically it's not an apology, but a quote as to that which -- and on page 104 the, next to last paragraph on the page, I'm satisfied in my own mind --"
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4348.819,4349.414,I never intended.
1963.167,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4349.414,4350.906,I never intended to commit a contempt of court.
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4350.906,4352.967,Over and over again he says this and quite clear --
1963.167,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4352.967,4360.115,And I suppose that to which the court referred in speaking of an apology in the last paragraph on page 107 --
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4360.115,4361.417,I think he did that gave it a more --
1963.167,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4361.417,4362.616,Although it was not technically an apology.
1963.167,2,28282,h_richard_uviller,,4362.616,4363.967,Technically it was not at all.
1963.167,3,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,6727.886,6728.448,No Rebuttal.
1963.167,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6728.448,6729.632,No rebuttal?
1963.167,3,37445,osmond_k_fraenkel,,6729.632,6732.196,No Your Honor.
