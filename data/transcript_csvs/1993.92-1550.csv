1993.92-1550,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.2,"We'll hear argument next in Number 92-1550, ABF Freight System v. National Labor Relations Board."
1993.92-1550,0,31207,john_v_jansonius,,65.863,73.059,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-1550,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,184.672,189.053,Do Federal courts deny people relief because of perjured testimony?
1993.92-1550,0,31207,john_v_jansonius,,189.053,191.446,"They have that discretion, Your Honor."
1993.92-1550,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,199.812,201.132,They have that discretion?
1993.92-1550,0,31207,john_v_jansonius,,211.18,214.752,In a particular context a Federal judge might be able to do that.
1993.92-1550,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,216.993,217.724,You think he might be.
1993.92-1550,0,31207,john_v_jansonius,,217.724,218.435,--Might be.
1993.92-1550,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,218.435,219.314,"But he might not be, too."
1993.92-1550,0,31207,john_v_jansonius,,219.314,220.015,"Might not be, Your Honor."
1993.92-1550,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,220.015,220.917,"So you don't know, in other words."
1993.92-1550,0,31207,john_v_jansonius,,220.917,222.367,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-1550,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1490.868,1499.123,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1550,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1581.298,1582.77,"Where are you reading, please?"
1993.92-1550,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1582.77,1586.603,I am about ten lines down on page C-5.
1993.92-1550,2,31207,john_v_jansonius,,3159.129,3173.078,"Just a quick comment on Chevron, and I realize I'm speaking to the author of the opinion and a justice who has written Law Review articles on it, so I'll try to be quick."
1993.92-1550,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3173.078,3174.149,And one who has reversed on it.
1993.92-1550,2,31207,john_v_jansonius,,3174.149,3176.089,"And that, too."
1993.92-1550,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3176.089,3179.653,"And the three don't agree with one another as to what it means, so--"
1993.92-1550,2,31207,john_v_jansonius,,3179.653,3186.888,My point on Chevron is that I'm not sure that... at least I wouldn't want to take for granted that Chevron analysis applies.
1993.92-1550,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3199.955,3204.199,--Don't you think the Board is supposed to have some technical expertise on how the labor market works?
1993.92-1550,2,31207,john_v_jansonius,,3204.199,3205.97,--On how the labor market works.
1993.92-1550,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3275.459,3276.969,May I just ask one question on that?
1993.92-1550,2,31207,john_v_jansonius,,3276.969,3277.68,--Yes.
1993.92-1550,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3277.68,3283.547,"When you were before the Labor Board as opposed to the ALJ, did you ask the Labor Board to adopt the rule you're asking this Court to adopt?"
1993.92-1550,2,31207,john_v_jansonius,,3283.547,3285.456,Ask the ALJ?
1993.92-1550,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3285.456,3289.879,"No, no... before the Labor Board, in review of the ALJ's proceeding."
1993.92-1550,2,31207,john_v_jansonius,,3289.879,3290.52,"Yes, we did."
1993.92-1550,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3290.52,3291.692,You asked the Labor Board--
1993.92-1550,2,31207,john_v_jansonius,,3291.692,3303.099,"We most certainly did, and put it in our brief... but Congress did assign to the Federal courts the responsibility to enforce or not to enforce decisions by the National Labor Relations Board."
1993.92-1550,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3317.427,3321.06,"--We have to apply the same rule to a district court, then, you say."
1993.92-1550,2,31207,john_v_jansonius,,3321.06,3321.761,--Exactly.
1993.92-1550,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3321.761,3331.578,Anybody who doesn't tell the truth under oath is not entitled to monetary remedy?
1993.92-1550,2,31207,john_v_jansonius,,3331.578,3333.101,"No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
1993.92-1550,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3340.074,3343.455,"In other words, it's more serious to lie to an ALJ than to a district judge."
1993.92-1550,2,31207,john_v_jansonius,,3343.455,3351.302,"No, I think it's equally serious as to both, but I think the importance of having a rule enforcing the oath is particularly important in this context."
1993.92-1550,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3352.182,3357.545,"You would say it for district judges, I assume, if district judges had discretion in whether to give relief or not."
1993.92-1550,2,31207,john_v_jansonius,,3357.545,3359.187,"--Well, I think that's true."
1993.92-1550,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3360.138,3363.308,And what's different about the Board here is that the relief is discretionary.
1993.92-1550,2,31207,john_v_jansonius,,3364.7,3365.651,--The--
1993.92-1550,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3365.651,3371.055,"They could find the employer guilty and give some other kind of relief or, indeed, no relief at all, I suppose."
1993.92-1550,2,31207,john_v_jansonius,,3371.055,3372.036,--Certainly.
1993.92-1550,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3391.397,3392.677,"Thank you, Mr. Jansonius."
