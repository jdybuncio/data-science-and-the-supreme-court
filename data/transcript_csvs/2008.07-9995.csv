2008.07-9995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.654,"We will hear argument next in Case 07-9995, Rivera v. Illinois."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,7.404,16.51,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Petitioner lawfully exercised a peremptory challenge on juror Delores Gomez."
2008.07-9995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,47.877,51.662,Are you putting -- are you equating this with a biased judge?
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,99.16,106.166,"--Well, our unlawful adjudicator claim is not dependent on a finding or showing of bias."
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,128.93,129.38,Okay.
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,163.784,169.638,"Well, Your Honor, there are State law and Federal law components to this issue."
2008.07-9995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,177.243,183.564,"But no -- no constitutional right, no constitutional right to the peremptory challenge."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,183.564,187.932,"Well, there is a constitutional right to due process involved that--"
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,187.932,201.626,"But you -- you in effect are saying that any violation of State law with respect, let's say, to criminal trial procedure becomes, if not remedied, a due process violation under Federal law."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,204.811,205.561,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.07-9995,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,225.307,231.228,There could be a thousand reasons why under State law a particular jury is improperly constituted.
2008.07-9995,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,241.401,251.959,"Just as an example, to follow up on Justice Breyer's question -- and then can you answer his question -- many States have rules that you have to be a resident of the county to serve on that jury."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,277.776,286.982,"Well, with respect to jury qualifications such as age and citizenship, there is a very delicate screening process that goes into effect."
2008.07-9995,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,307.128,313.615,"Well, you are -- you are avoiding the question by saying, oh, don't worry, there are not going to be many violations of this sort, and then you pick out age."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,324.055,326.123,"--Well, I think--"
2008.07-9995,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,326.123,339.449,"What you are giving us is a sweeping proposition, A, for the constitutional principles that you are setting forth; B, for the supervision and intrusion it would cause Federal courts on the State system."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,339.449,354.959,"--Well, if we take the juror's qualifications that were discussed in the State's brief, it would appear that all the qualifications that are discussed there would -- as I said, it would be a very rare situation, indeed, for a--"
2008.07-9995,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,354.959,355.659,"Well, why?"
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,397.619,409.26,"--Well, Gomez v. United States set forth the principle equating the right to an adjudicator with lawful authority to preside at every critical stage of the proceeding--"
2008.07-9995,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,409.26,419.234,So that means that held -- we have held in that case -- I had better look at it -- that in any instance where excusing a juror violates State law that that is a violation of the Federal Constitution?
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,421.434,431.042,"--Well, that -- that case did not involve jurors, Your Honor, but it did involve a magistrate who lacked the authority to preside over voir dire."
2008.07-9995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,450.837,469.667,"But you are not -- you're not suggesting, because you conceded there was no basis for a for-cause challenge, you are not -- you are not saying that Gomez was unqualified or that she was biased."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,474.385,484.058,"--Well, there is a reasonable possibility of bias with respect to Gomez because of her extensive contacts with gunshot victims at Cook County Hospital--"
2008.07-9995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,484.058,485.527,But she was an administrator.
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,490.414,498.567,"--Well, the Illinois Supreme Court held that defense counsel's strike of Gomez was a valid reason to have her removed from the jury."
2008.07-9995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,506.923,509.458,You don't need a good reason for a peremptory challenge.
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,509.458,514.029,--The peremptory -- if I understand.
2008.07-9995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.029,517.231,That's the whole fun of a peremptory challenge: You don't need a good reason.
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,517.231,524.052,"Well, the purpose of the peremptory challenge is to help to create a fair and impartial jury."
2008.07-9995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.052,524.502,Exactly.
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,535.859,538.061,That's right.
2008.07-9995,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,543.965,558.641,"Well, but our footnote in our later case authored by Justice Scalia indicates considerable doubt as to the viability and to the -- to the correctness of that formulation in Swain."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,558.641,560.608,"Well, with--"
2008.07-9995,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,560.608,562.443,"Salazar, I think, is the--"
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,562.443,576.602,"--Yes, Martinez-Salazar in its footnote 4 determined that the automatic reversal rule in Swain was subject to reconsideration due to the advent of harmless error analysis."
2008.07-9995,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,587.208,587.66,--No.
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,609.174,611.61,"--I wasn't citing it for that proposition, Your Honor."
2008.07-9995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,652.437,660.44,"But the -- well, first, how many peremptories does Illinois law allow?"
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,660.44,665.41,"For non-capital cases, it's seven, Your Honor."
2008.07-9995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,665.41,670.731,"Well, suppose a State allowed only three peremptory challenges."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,675.266,682.956,"Well, under Ross v. Oklahoma, the State has the authority to regulate peremptory challenges."
2008.07-9995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,682.956,685.408,"This was number four, was it?"
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,685.408,686.491,I'm sorry?
2008.07-9995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,686.491,694.014,The challenge to Gomez was the number four peremptory?
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,694.014,694.947,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-9995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,694.947,709.356,"And so if the State had only three which it could do, there would be -- would be no basis for removing Gomez from the array."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,726.501,739.208,"Well, as to our unlawful adjudicator claim that would be correct, because if the defense did not have a peremptory challenge to exercise in order to strike Gomez if the peremptories had run out--"
2008.07-9995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,739.208,754.718,"But there's just something unseemly about saying because the State is generous in its peremptories, you have a grand constitutional argument to make, even though there is no constitutional right to any peremptory challenge?"
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,754.718,761.472,"--Well, the State is obligated, consistent with due process, to provide that which it promised."
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,762.758,776.75,That goes back to the point which you rejected when I suggested -- I suggested earlier that you were in effect arguing that every violation of a State statute in this criminal context amounted to a due process violation.
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,782.654,789.575,"--Well, what makes the peremptory challenge unique is its venerable tradition since the time--"
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,789.575,795.545,"Well, we were talking about peremptory challenges before and we are talking about peremptory challenges now."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,801.049,807.52,"--Well, if I understand correctly, Your Honor, the case involves peremptory challenges."
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,807.52,830.802,"Look, the question that I thought I was asking and I thought you were answering was this: Do you claim that every violation of State law in the -- we'll say in the selection of jurors -- is -- is automatically, if not remedied by the State, a Federal due process violation?"
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,843.443,844.143,Yes.
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,844.143,855.518,"So -- so, do you stand by the answer you gave me or is it in fact now your position that every violation of State law that goes unremedied becomes a Federal due process violation?"
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,855.518,859.321,"No, I'm not saying that every violation of State law, if unremedied--"
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,859.321,859.821,All right.
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,864.206,870.26,--Because this one involves a State violation that resulted in an unlawful adjudicator.
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,870.71,873.997,"No, but that -- that then goes back to an earlier question."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,900.03,905.866,"--Well, the State disagreed with our position as to the Federal automatic reversal law."
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,909.42,915.222,"No, but the court -- the Supreme Court of Illinois did not find anything unlawful about the juror sitting."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,934.452,950.128,"--I would read the Illinois Supreme Court opinion -- specifically what they did state is that the trial court was incorrect in denying the peremptory challenge, therefore that juror should not have sat on the jury, that juror was wrongfully on the jury."
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,950.128,951.044,"No, no."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,974.909,980.48,"Well, the Illinois Supreme Court made one statement, that the peremptory was wrongfully denied."
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,982.849,992.121,"Well, if they thought that tainted everything that happened afterwards, it seems to me they would have said, therefore, the verdict is no good."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,992.121,998.942,"--No, because the court misapplied this Court's precedent in Neder and Martinez-Salazar."
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1004.446,1008.715,"Yes, but it had everything to do, it seems to me, with the issue of State law."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1028.628,1038.686,"--The Illinois Supreme Court found that the verdict was valid because they thought that the error was subject to harmless error review, in relying on Neder and Martinez-Salazar."
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1038.686,1043.388,"So ultimately, there was -- there was no error under State law that needed to be corrected?"
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1043.388,1059.515,"Well, there is an error in terms of the adjudicator, Ms. Gomez, being seated on the jury and under Rule 434 Petitioner had the right to a juror that -- that was not subject to a peremptory challenge."
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1061.765,1074.173,"But so far as the ultimate jury verdict was concerned, the Illinois Supreme Court, I understand it to have said, was there is no error that needs to be corrected under State law."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1074.173,1076.106,I don't read the opinion that way.
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1076.608,1077.691,Then why didn't they correct it?
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1077.691,1082.762,--Because they thought that the error was subject to harmless error review under Federal law.
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1086.797,1130.576,"You mean -- in other words, you read the -- the -- the Illinois Supreme Court as to say, this is a violation of our statutes and constitution, a violation that would -- would entitle this person to have the -- the verdict set aside and a new trial, but because the Federal practice, applying Federal constitutional law, is to engage in harmless error analysis, we won't correct our State law error as a matter of State law, and -- and we will in fact apply a harmless error analysis that otherwise wouldn't apply because it's Federal, and on that ground we will let the verdict stand."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1132.778,1133.595,No.
2008.07-9995,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1157.293,1164.631,But -- but how -- how could it do that if there were not some underlying Federal constitutional right?
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1178.506,1188.781,"--Well, the court did not specify why it did so, but it did rely on Neder and Martinez-Salazar."
2008.07-9995,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1189.848,1197.72,But we are asking you what the analytic justification for that course of reasoning is if that is indeed its course of reasoning.
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1197.72,1203.458,"--Well, it's hard for me to speculate on the thinking of the Illinois Supreme Court."
2008.07-9995,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1204.191,1211.878,"Well, but you have to give us a sustainable analytic framework if -- if we are going to reverse their decision."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1211.878,1232.441,"--Well, we argued at the Illinois Supreme Court level that due process was violated; but the Illinois Supreme Court declined to consider whether a constitutional right had been violated and moved accordingly to the question of whether or not automatic reversal would apply or whether the error would be subject to harmless error review."
2008.07-9995,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1272.518,1279.422,"Of course, the Illinois Supreme Court was assuming a Federal violation when it decided what the reversal rule would be."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1305.156,1318.583,"--Yes, it would appear so if it -- if a State law stated that a juror qualification requirement is that the juror who presides in Cook County must be a resident of the county."
2008.07-9995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1318.583,1320.083,"Well, if you -- I'm sorry."
2008.07-9995,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1320.083,1321.033,I just have one more thought.
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1325.487,1328.455,"Yes, because it would implicate the due process clause."
2008.07-9995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1328.455,1330.391,But would it have to be -- would it have to be structural error?
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1358.708,1371.266,"Well, Your Honor, the -- the State under Chapman would be required to prove harmlessness, and I think it would be impossible to determine whether this -- this error would be harmful--"
2008.07-9995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1371.266,1372.634,"Well, maybe that's true."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1382.572,1401.784,"--Well, under harmless error review, the appellate court envisions the actual jury that rendered the verdict, whether or not the error would have rendered the verdict different had it been -- had it not occurred."
2008.07-9995,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1427.651,1431.053,But we had an actual jury.
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1468.278,1477.884,"--Well, in this case I don't think we can look at it from the perspective that the Court normally looks at it from when it reviews -- adopts harmless error review."
2008.07-9995,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1497.781,1509.755,Do you think the Constitution prohibits the State from going further than Batson to protect against the use of peremptory challenges for discriminatory purposes?
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1530.418,1541.941,"Well, that's our position, Your Honor, because what the trial judge did in this case is asked for a reason without having established any prima facie case."
2008.07-9995,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1541.941,1546.262,"Yes, well, that's what Batson says has to be done in order to justify the strike."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1554.701,1562.604,"I apologize, Your Honor; I'm not sure I understand about going further than."
2008.07-9995,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1591.541,1605.3,"Yes, but Justice Alito's question is could the State say as a matter of State law whenever the trial judge has a hunch that there might have been discriminatory purpose involved, may he refuse to allow the preemptory challenge?"
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1605.3,1610.454,"Well, we argue that the judge doesn't have sua sponte authority to--"
2008.07-9995,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1610.454,1616.691,"No, but I -- if the State explicitly gave the trial judge that authority, would that be constitutional?"
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1616.691,1625.13,"--Well, the -- the State has the authority to have some regulation of preemptory challenge rights."
2008.07-9995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.13,1629.432,"It has the authority to abolish peremptory challenge rights entirely, right?"
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1629.432,1630.382,Yes.
2008.07-9995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1630.382,1632.201,So this is not a hard question.
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1632.201,1636.938,"Yes, the State can abolish peremptory challenges if it wishes."
2008.07-9995,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1636.938,1647.376,"And, therefore, it could take the much lesser step of allowing the trial judge, if he has any suspicion that a peremptory-challenge right is being used in violation of Batson, to disallow it."
2008.07-9995,0,31510,james_k_leven,,1648.426,1651.947,"In this case, though, we do have peremptory challenges created by the State."
2008.07-9995,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1655.732,1656.499,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1661.903,1672.075,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is no due process violation here and that takes care of this case at the threshold."
2008.07-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1672.075,1673.194,"Well, does it really?"
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1726.725,1733.379,"Justice Scalia, the briefs before the Illinois Supreme Court raise two independent grounds for automatic reversal by Petitioner."
2008.07-9995,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1785.312,1788.014,So your answer to Justice Scalia's question is what?
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1788.014,1810.979,"The answer, Your Honor, is that if the court had said, we are going to lockstep our Federal -- or, rather, our State harmless error analysis with the Federal question, Federal analysis, and whatever they say goes, then I would agree that under those circumstances this Court could review that and say, you got that wrong."
2008.07-9995,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1810.979,1813.164,What -- what case would you cite for that proposition?
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1815.097,1816.449,I can't say Michigan v. Long.
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1822.103,1823.72,Why did they get it wrong?
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1823.72,1825.739,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1825.739,1827.005,Why do you say they got it wrong?
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1827.005,1828.374,"Oh, I don't think they did."
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1829.124,1830.459,Does that mean even if it were Federal?
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1832.995,1837.28,"--We think they analyzed it absolutely correctly, as a matter of fact, Your Honor."
2008.07-9995,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1837.28,1840.315,Isn't this Johnson v. Standard Oil and that -- that sort of thing?
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1840.315,1840.882,Right.
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1856.408,1858.043,Is that clear as a matter -- I don't know.
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1885.811,1886.463,That is not--
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1886.463,1887.68,--I don't know the answer.
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1887.68,1888.73,"--It is not clear, Your Honor."
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1904.591,1909.911,"I am not talking about magistrates, and I'm not talking about due process."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1909.911,1910.428,--Correct.
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1910.428,1913.63,"I am asking the question, just what I asked."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1915.732,1916.282,Right.
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1916.282,1916.865,All right.
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1917.782,1920.184,It is not -- that is not a due process violation.
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1920.184,1920.734,I know.
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1952.572,1954.44,I don't believe--
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1954.44,1954.907,Yes or no?
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1954.907,1955.724,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1955.724,1957.559,"You think the answer is no, okay."
2008.07-9995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1957.559,1976.953,"Going back to Justice Scalia's question, do you think we would have jurisdiction of this certiorari petition if we were convinced there was no Federal constitutional error; they were merely trying to decide whether the State court applied the correct constitutional standard in correcting what it thought was a Federal constitutional error?"
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1976.953,1977.953,"I don't, Your Honor."
2008.07-9995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1982.671,1990.427,"And if there is none there, we don't have jurisdiction to answer and give an advisory opinion on how the Illinois Supreme Court should run its shop."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,1990.427,1991.394,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.394,2001.918,"So the Illinois Supreme Court can happily go along blaming everything on us, so when it stands for reelection it can say, well, we are just applying Federal law."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2002.684,2006.972,"Your Honor, I think in this case what the Illinois Supreme Court did is they concluded--"
2008.07-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.972,2010.34,"No, but that's the consequence of your answer to that question."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2029.719,2031.588,"--Your Honor, let me be clear."
2008.07-9995,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2042.728,2046.93,"You -- they did make that assumption, but you think the assumption is wrong."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2056.303,2064.457,"--Obviously, Your Honor, I think that if the Court were to conclude there is no due process violation, it would be an artificial exercise to then embark on an analysis of a proper harmless errors."
2008.07-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2078.733,2097.111,"I would certainly agree that if the only reason the Illinois Supreme Court used the Federal harmless error rule was because it was assuming a Federal constitutional violation, once we reject that assumption, the whole thing drops out."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2099.23,2099.863,--I--
2008.07-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.863,2105.617,Is it clear that the Illinois Supreme Court wouldn't have used the same test under simply Illinois law?
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2105.617,2106.819,"--Well, two points, Your Honor."
2008.07-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2166.524,2187.521,"The problem is the -- the only reason the Illinois Supreme Court found that there was no error of constitutional dimension, meaning Federal constitutional dimension, the only reason it -- it found that is because it found that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2187.521,2191.14,"Your Honor, I think that what they have done is they've just put the statement--"
2008.07-9995,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.14,2192.925,It is the cart before the horse.
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2192.925,2200.012,"--They have run the analysis, and what they have done, Your Honor, is said, look, any error here of constitutional dimension would be harmless."
2008.07-9995,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2237.037,2246.559,"Then -- then you would have no objection to a remand that says, Illinois Supreme Court, you can't blame it on Federal law."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2262.938,2282.15,"Your Honor, we would have no objection to that procedure, but I would caution that it seems unnecessary in light of the fact that the parties so clearly sought relief under both State and Federal law and the fact that the supreme court -- the Illinois Supreme Court concludes it doesn't need to reach, the way it analyzes the -- the constitutional question."
2008.07-9995,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2293.207,2301.211,"For the reasons that have been discussed, it may be that we won't get to the merits of the Petitioner's argument."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2331.748,2333.115,Well--
2008.07-9995,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2333.115,2342.723,"And this would -- this would be a little different than the juror who might be biased or might not be biased, because this goes to a hard qualification."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2347.925,2366.137,"--I should begin by saying that the Gomez and Wingo and Nguyen decisions and others they cite in that line for the non-Article III judge proposition are themselves not due process decisions, but are conclusions as a matter of State -- of Federal law, rather, the idea being that Congress simply hadn't delegated the authority properly in those cases."
2008.07-9995,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2396.025,2401.679,Well -- but the hypothetical is it doesn't -- the juror doesn't satisfy the requirement because he or she is from the wrong county.
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2401.679,2415.986,"--Again, Your Honor, the fundamental -- the lodestar analysis here in the due process -- in Butte v. Illinois, the Court said they've not defined it with precision, but it has always been fundamental fairness, a community sense of fair play and decency."
2008.07-9995,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2444.922,2447.707,Well -- but how do you -- there is no way to tell.
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2472.073,2492.819,"--This is true, Your Honor, but in those contexts, the very State law that has created those divisions, for whatever reason they have seen fit to do so, is the proper authority to conclude whether or not the error is so profound by having that person sit that it ought not be a violation of due process -- that it ought not be -- that it oughtn't be a void judgment."
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2495.354,2498.323,Did -- that's exactly what I can't figure out.
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2534.079,2536.948,"--If the juror is biased, yes, but not if the juror is unbiased."
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2536.948,2538.8,"If the juror is biased, yes."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2573.14,2576.858,It's my understanding -- I don't believe -- I don't have cases to cite on this.
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2584.746,2599.006,"So, at least in the case of where he failed to get a peremptory, whether it's Federal or whether it's State, the Federal law and most State law is: You lost your right to a peremptory, one of them."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2610.746,2619.5,"Your Honor, I thought you were asking what happens if a particular juror the defendant wanted did not sit, and under those circumstances I would say that because this Court has held--"
2008.07-9995,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2619.5,2621.018,"Well, what about the last situation?"
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2621.018,2626.736,"--If your question -- that indicates really the split in this case, Your Honor, and the indirect split that was -- all of which was laid out in the cert petition."
2008.07-9995,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2665.897,2667.83,What was that case?
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2667.83,2671.365,"This is not cited in the briefs, so I'm only citing it in response to a question."
2008.07-9995,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2673.817,2674.767,"Oh, an Illinois case."
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2674.767,2675.95,--in 1886.
2008.07-9995,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2675.95,2683.606,"And it's a case in which an alien sat on the jury, and there was, I believe, as part of the court's analysis a failure to make contemporaneous objection."
2008.07-9995,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2737.605,2746.728,"If the judge who sat on a State trial was not authorized under State law to hear that particular matter, would that be a due process violation?"
2008.07-9995,1,36643,michael_a_scodro,,2746.728,2752.382,"--I think the answer to that is no, Your Honor."
2008.07-9995,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2792.775,2793.809,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2799.363,2812.355,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Federal law does not require automatic reversal of Petitioner's conviction because the denial of a peremptory challenge at most violated only his State law rights."
2008.07-9995,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2873.744,2875.346,What if it's not a single challenge?
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2893.557,2906.382,"We'd still think that that would not be a Federal constitutional violation and, even if it were some kind of a Federal violation, that it would be subject to review for harmlessness."
2008.07-9995,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2927.045,2932.597,But supposing -- supposing Illinois had a statute that said the prosecution gets ten peremptories and the defendants get one.
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2934.965,2940.436,--The question there would be whether that so skews -- the test that I said before.
2008.07-9995,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2942.555,2944.923,Isn't the answer pretty clear that that would be unfair?
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2944.923,2947.959,--I don't -- I don't think that the answer is clear at all.
2008.07-9995,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2967.687,2972.49,"I will use that as an examination question, but let's hope that it doesn't come up."
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2972.49,2974.19,"--It's unlikely to, but--"
2008.07-9995,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2974.19,2976.359,But what about the--
2008.07-9995,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2976.359,2978.494,The reason it's unlikely is it's so clearly unconstitutional.
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2978.494,2987.834,"--Well, we don't think that it's unconstitutional at all, Your Honor, but it is contrary to what the common practice and the way things have been approached in both Federal and State courts."
2008.07-9995,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2987.834,2997.023,"--Mr. Roberts, if you do get to harmless error, how do you deal with the question that was raised by the Chief Justice?"
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3016.186,3029.411,"Well, I think that rests on the mistaken premise that harmless error analysis turns on the predilections of the particular decisionmaker or on speculation about what one juror, what one particular juror would have done differently than another."
2008.07-9995,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3040.152,3046.623,"No, but maybe -- maybe you have an -- you know, the irrational juror, you know, the holdout is not going to convict for any reason."
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3046.623,3056.911,"--But -- but that is not an appropriate part of -- of harmless error analysis, just like the fact that the jury might engage in nullification isn't an appropriate part of the harmless error analysis."
2008.07-9995,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3083.312,3090.151,"Well, I mean, you get -- well, even assuming your -- your premise, isn't it pretty difficult to know what a rational juror would have done?"
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3090.151,3100.94,"Well, we think that the correct inquiry in this circumstance, given the nature of the right, is to ask whether the error resulted in the seating of a juror that was not impartial."
2008.07-9995,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3117.719,3125.408,"But that is almost the same, at least in some States, as getting a new trial anyway."
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3135.43,3139.215,"That -- that -- that could be, but--"
2008.07-9995,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3139.215,3141.85,The point is you are not giving much substance to the rule.
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3141.85,3150.79,"--Well, I think we are respecting its fundamental -- its fundamental purpose, Your Honor, which is to assist to help achieve the goal of selecting an impartial juror."
2008.07-9995,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3150.79,3151.975,What is the law there?
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3173.071,3201.658,"Generally for errors like the error you described before, where the judge erroneously -- mistakenly excuses a juror in the belief that the juror is disqualified for cause, where the judge mistakenly substitutes a qualified alternate for one of the jurors, or the judge places one alternate on the jury instead of another, the courts have generally looked at that for harmlessness and not required automatic reversal."
2008.07-9995,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3206.193,3206.81,But -- all right.
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3210.931,3211.431,--Yes.
2008.07-9995,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3211.431,3212.18,Okay.
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3212.18,3212.68,Yes.
2008.07-9995,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3223.904,3232.777,"But don't some of those courts, rather than focusing on the qualifications of the particular juror, look to the -- how close the case was?"
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3232.777,3244.652,"The harmless error analysis, there are sort of a lot of different scenarios of types of violations, and the standard that they use is not clear in all of them."
2008.07-9995,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3268.35,3270.385,"Well, that's because there is no way to tell."
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3270.385,3284.193,"--Well, I -- I think that -- that even if you had a standard that said to look to whether there was an effect on the verdict, you could tell precisely the way the Illinois Supreme Court applied Neder here."
2008.07-9995,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3299.904,3306.725,"But a jury is a fundamental protection of individual liberty, and in your analysis you are having a judge decide what the jury would do."
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3306.725,3307.208,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-9995,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3325.42,3332.673,The judge is making the determination that a juror that should have been seated would act like the juror who was seated instead.
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3332.673,3333.173,That is true.
2008.07-9995,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3376.416,3383.856,There are any number of alternatives that we can adopt in ruling for your position.
2008.07-9995,2,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,3390.01,3409.638,"Well, I -- we would obviously like to have sort of alternative rulings that do both, but I think the most logical way to approach the case is to decide whether there was a violation of the Constitution here and, because there wasn't one, to say that State law governs the harmless error analysis."
