1986.85-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.908,"The first case for argument this morning is Number 85-129, Linda Wimberly, Petitioner, versus Labor and Industrial Relations Commission of Missouri."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,15.426,18.228,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-129,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,230.464,231.847,"May I ask, Ms. Levin--"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,231.847,232.416,Yes.
1986.85-129,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,232.416,240.903,--I gather the State Supreme Court said that this disability was treated by Penney no differently than it treated any other disability that the woman suffered?
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,240.903,242.605,"There is no ruling on that, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,257.298,259.317,"Well, what was the State Court's rationale, then?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,259.317,278.528,"The State Court's rationale was that the voluntary quit statute in Missouri is a neutral statute and therefore they can use that statute to disqualify benefits to Mrs. Wimberly and to women who leave their job because of pregnancy, as long as they do the same treatment to people who leave their job because of disability."
1986.85-129,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,278.528,285.801,And as far as this case was concerned the employer did treat any disability the same as it treated the pregnancy?
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,285.801,286.601,"That's not a matter of record, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.601,288.184,"We don't know otherwise, though."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,291.955,292.838,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,292.838,299.192,"And really, your challenge here is to the state's unemployment system, and is not to what J.C. Penney did?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,299.192,299.726,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,302.144,317.82,And do you dispute the... is it a fact that the Missouri Unemployment Compensation system is administered in a way so as to treat pregnancy as other similar disabilities are treated?
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,317.82,323.407,"Do we dispute that that's... do we dispute the fact, Your Honor?"
1986.85-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,323.407,325.759,"Well, is it a fact, because I'm not sure it is."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,325.759,326.443,"It is a fact, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,345.488,354.927,"Whatever might be the state rule, the federal law treats pregnancy specially and differently, is that it?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,354.927,356.363,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.648,400.975,"Ms. Levin, suppose Missouri has a provision, as I understand many states do, that you are not entitled to unemployment compensation unless you are available for work."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,410.498,411.381,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.381,424.155,"Is it your assertion here that by reason of the federal statute, Missouri nonetheless as to pay unemployment compensation to a woman who was unavailable to work because she is in the last few weeks of her pregnancy?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,424.155,425.79,"No, Your Honor, on the contrary."
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,433.196,435.046,"Well, how do you draw that line?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,457.495,461.279,"The federal statute, Your Honor, only addresses pregnancy disqualification."
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.789,477.572,I don't understand what you're saying.
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,483.443,484.228,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,499.738,502.523,"Well, what is... I mean, ""eligible"" is a very broad word."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,510.795,515.58,"No, Your Honor, you're not... you're disqualified if you voluntarily quit your prior job."
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.621,574.618,"You would say, then, that if someone is fired because of misconduct on the job which for some reason a woman could attribute to the fact of her pregnancy, all right, or termination of pregnancy, that that misconduct would have to be excused?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,574.618,584.308,--It's hard to attribute... it's hard to imagine a situation where the misconduct would be attributed to the pregnancy.
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,585.693,593.413,She claims some temporary mental condition due to post-partum depression or to the pregnancy.
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,593.413,596.615,--And therefore engages in some misconduct on the job?
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.615,596.9,That's right.
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,596.9,607.256,"Typically, if someone is pregnant and she is fired for misconduct, it's not related at all to her pregnancy and she would not be qualified."
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.256,615.545,"I understand, typically, but this woman alleges that that's the case, just as the woman in this case alleges that the reason she quit was because of her pregnancy."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,615.545,616.829,I think that if she could--
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,616.829,619.397,"You would logically have to say she couldn't be fired, wouldn't you--"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,619.397,625.901,"--I think if she could fully establish that the misconduct was directly attributable to her pregnancy, then she may be able to be qualified."
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.502,630.621,--Why is it not clear?
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,638.144,644.881,"That's correct, Your Honor, but the disqualification has to be as a result of her pregnancy."
1986.85-129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,660.474,674.65,"Well, the language of the statute appears to speak in terms of the reasons that the state itself denies the unemployment compensation."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,685.375,687.658,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,699.933,710.74,"Well, solely on the basis is... refers to the denial by the state of the benefits."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,710.74,720.279,"Yes, Your Honor, but the state denied her benefits because they deemed her leaving because of pregnancy a voluntary quit."
1986.85-129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,720.279,739.776,"Well, suppose she came in and applied for unemployment compensation benefits and the employee working for the state said, did you leave for reasons related to the job or your employer, and she says no, and that's all the state knows and they denied benefits."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,742.295,745.664,The state had no information that she left because of her pregnancy?
1986.85-129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,745.664,746.08,Yes.
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,746.08,753.435,"If the state has no information that she left because of her pregnancy, I don't think it would violate the statute."
1986.85-129,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,753.435,756.637,"Well, how can it change because of what the state knows?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,772.73,785.137,Well generally they're violating the statute by automatically presuming that when you leave your work because of pregnancy it's a voluntary quit that's not connected to the employment.
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.582,802.682,They are not deeming it that.
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,813.271,814.889,"That's correct, Your Honor, but it's also--"
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,814.889,817.091,"I mean, don't blame the state for putting it in that category."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,818.758,832.684,"--It isn't a category, but Congress did not intend for states to use neutral statutes or, quote, ""neutral"" statutes to turn around and do the same prohibited practices that Congress was abolishing."
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,845.342,854.431,"But I thought you told Justice O'Connor that it would not violate the statute simply to dismiss somebody for a voluntary quit having nothing to do with the job, if that's all you know."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,854.431,857.15,"If that's all you know, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,857.15,860.168,And step two is that this is a voluntary quit unrelated to the job.
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,889.187,891.806,"Well, Your Honor, if they never acquire the knowledge."
1986.85-129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,962.835,971.091,"So, it's not an antidiscrimination statute; it's a discrimination statute in the sense that it does single out pregnancy for special treatment?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,971.091,973.158,"Well, Your Honor, it's not--"
1986.85-129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,973.158,974.043,"It does, doesn't it?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,974.043,975.793,--It singles out--
1986.85-129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.793,976.276,In your view--
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,976.276,979.947,--It singles out pregnancy for special treatment.
1986.85-129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,979.947,986.184,--For special treatment as compared with other... as compared with other disabilities which cause a lady to leave work?
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,986.184,987.951,"That's right, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,993.171,1037.799,"Suppose the state takes your view and says, yes, we understand the federal statute to command this, and then some other woman with a disability who leaves her work for a while and then is denied workers' compensation, unemployment compensation, says that the state is violating Title 7, or a man leaves his work on a disability, because you're treating... because pregnancy is deemed to be discrimination based on sex, isn't it, in Title 7 now?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1037.799,1040.734,"--Well, it is in Title 7, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1040.734,1046.489,"So, wouldn't this require the state to treat everybody else the same as they treat pregnant women?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1046.489,1053.828,With the current... with the federal statute at issue in this case requires states to treat everybody else... is that--
1986.85-129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1053.828,1061.398,"Well, wouldn't Title 7 require it to extend its compensation law to everybody else with a disability?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1061.398,1065.184,"--No, Your Honor, because unemployment compensation is not covered by Title 7."
1986.85-129,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1067.736,1068.754,"Specifically excludes it, is that it?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1068.754,1081.728,"--Well, it's not a specific exclusion, but case law has held that it is not covered by Title 7, and Title 7 has no applicability to 3304(a)(12)."
1986.85-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1113.913,1122.167,"Your view, then, is that Title 7 would address J.C. Penney's practices, but it doesn't address the State of Missouri's administration of its unemployment compensation?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1122.167,1122.433,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.275,1237.894,"I have a question, if I may."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1237.894,1238.344,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1238.344,1253.82,"Did I correctly understand you to say that if the bill in its earlier form, which included the second clause about determinations under any provision and so forth, if that bill had been enacted, that you would have... your claim would fail?"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1253.82,1254.82,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1258.522,1267.711,"Well, if you concede that, it seems to me you're in trouble because the first clause of that bill is exactly the same as the bill that was enacted."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1267.711,1268.913,"No, it's not, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1283.422,1286.791,"Do you think the addition of the words, ""or termination of pregnancy""--"
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1286.791,1288.441,I think that Congress considered--
1986.85-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1288.441,1292.961,--To change it from a discrimination statute to a preferential statute?
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1292.961,1294.627,"--I believe that's what happened, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1295.127,1299.881,"I find that kind of hard to follow, frankly."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1341.875,1353.183,"The statute covers it, Your Honor, but as a result of the Turner case it was a disqualification based on the ineligibility."
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1389.923,1395.343,"I understand, but I'm talking about a state that establishes a new eligibility requirement, you have to be non-pregnant."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1395.343,1401.58,"That provision would violate the statute, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1401.58,1414.323,But then you have to answer my earlier question differently about why is it that a woman who can't work because she is pregnant is not entitled to get compensation.
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1434.986,1438.271,"I realize it's confusing, but--"
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.271,1440.437,It's not confusing.
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1442.139,1446.008,--The disqualification is based on the ineligibility.
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.745,1454.531,--She is not ineligible.
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1457.383,1475.961,"If the state said that, it would not only violate the Turner decision in this case but it would also violate the statute and that is because the legislative history says that any disqualification, that presumes that a woman is unable to work or unavailable for work during certain stages of her pregnancy, should be abolished."
1986.85-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1475.961,1479.598,"So, it does cover... well, I am sorry."
1986.85-129,0,31401,julie_s_levin,,1485.316,1492.572,It's phrased in terms of a disqualification but the disqualification pertains to the ineligibility and that's how it's phrased in the legislative history.
1986.85-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1496.374,1499.076,"Thank you, Ms. Levin."
1986.85-129,1,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1501.012,1510.968,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.778,1641.234,"What did the federal statute... what troubles me about your case is that I don't see much that the federal statute did, if it did no more than prevent discrimination as you say."
1986.85-129,1,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1653.976,1670.903,"During the time Congress was deliberating, Mr. Justice, the Department of Labor provided Congress with the list of 19 states which had pregnancy specific, either presumptive ineligibility requirements or presumptive disqualification requirements, written into their law."
1986.85-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1719.252,1723.304,How many of those statutes were changed after Turner and before this statute was passed?
1986.85-129,1,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1723.304,1727.256,"I don't know the precise answer to that question, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1927.737,1937.944,"Well, do you think under this provision, a state could give preference to pregnancy over other disabilities?"
1986.85-129,1,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1937.944,1945.181,"On the basis of this statute alone, it is clear that it doesn't prohibit a state from preferring pregnancy."
1986.85-129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1949.935,1953.37,"So, it really isn't totally a nondiscrimination statute?"
1986.85-129,1,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,1953.37,1955.656,"No, it's an equality of treatment statute."
1986.85-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.916,2154.785,"Makes you worry, does it?"
1986.85-129,1,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,2156.285,2159.587,"When I saw it, it made me sweat a little bit, Mr. Justice Scalia."
1986.85-129,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2224.945,2230.349,"Well, that wouldn't be hard to... it would just require treating everybody else the same?"
1986.85-129,1,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,2230.349,2243.241,"Except, Your Honor, traditionally in matters administered under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, the states are given great latitude in the manner in which they operate their programs."
1986.85-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2315.07,2317.755,May I ask you a question about the history?
1986.85-129,1,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,2325.195,2328.897,"Your Honor, I don't think it makes any difference at all."
1986.85-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.449,2337.753,"It's interesting that the Missouri Supreme Court seems to think it would have made a difference, but just the opposite difference--"
1986.85-129,1,35544,michael_l_boicourt,,2337.753,2338.536,Just the opposite difference.
1986.85-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2397.657,2398.641,"Thank you, Mr. Boicourt."
1986.85-129,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2400.826,2413.753,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-129,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2856.605,2872.182,"--legislative history that might undermine the Department's position, or do you say that a statute, ambiguous on its face, must be construed by this Court as the Department does despite the legislative history?"
1986.85-129,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2872.182,2881.055,I would imagine that there could be legislative history so plain that it might lead to a contrary conclusion.
1986.85-129,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2882.657,2890.893,"Mr. Wright, what is your understanding of the number of states in which this problem might arise, you know, the same kind of scheme that--"
1986.85-129,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2890.893,2891.512,Currently?
1986.85-129,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2891.512,2892.128,--Yes.
1986.85-129,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2892.128,2895.464,I am not absolutely sure.
1986.85-129,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2900.368,2904.086,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
1986.85-129,3,31401,julie_s_levin,,2907.971,2908.804,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3211.216,3212.918,"Well, is that quite right?"
1986.85-129,3,31401,julie_s_levin,,3216.62,3220.905,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, if there were a job available would she have been reinstated in her job?"
1986.85-129,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3223.207,3226.242,"Well, then she was not denied solely by reason of her pregnancy."
1986.85-129,3,31401,julie_s_levin,,3228.942,3238.633,"But at the time she became... that's correct... at the time she became unemployed, the time when she--"
1986.85-129,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3238.633,3239.817,When do you say she became unemployed?
1986.85-129,3,31401,julie_s_levin,,3239.817,3244.553,--I said that she became unemployed at the time she was denied reinstatement.
1986.85-129,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3249.322,3251.107,She was also no longer pregnant.
1986.85-129,3,31401,julie_s_levin,,3251.107,3252.726,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3258.796,3260.03,"Her past pregnancy, of her former pregnancy?"
1986.85-129,3,31401,julie_s_levin,,3260.03,3260.696,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3260.696,3264.348,Plus the fact there was no vacancy?
1986.85-129,3,31401,julie_s_levin,,3264.348,3280.127,"Well, she was... right, she was denied not only because of... well, there was no available position for her but that has nothing to do with the denial of the state of her unemployment compensation."
1986.85-129,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3281.56,3282.26,Is that true?
1986.85-129,3,31401,julie_s_levin,,3291.935,3296.237,--If she had been ready and able--
1986.85-129,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3296.237,3304.592,"If there had been a position available and she came back and said, I want to come back, my leave of absence is over, and they'd say, well, we're sorry, we just don't think we want to employ you."
1986.85-129,3,31401,julie_s_levin,,3307.777,3314.948,"--She would not, Your Honor, because the State of Missouri makes a distinction between a bona fide leave of absence and a regular leave of absence."
1986.85-129,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3329.041,3331.641,Even if there is a job available?
1986.85-129,3,31401,julie_s_levin,,3331.641,3332.993,"Even if there's a job available, Your Honor."
1986.85-129,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3333.609,3334.193,All right.
1986.85-129,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3334.193,3335.445,"Thank you, Ms. Levin."
