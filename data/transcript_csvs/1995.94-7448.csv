1995.94-7448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.591,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-7448, Roland J. Bailey v. United States, consolidated with Robinson v. United States."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,15.08,17.604,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-7448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,89.108,99.097,"Mr. Untereiner, was... are petitioners in either of these cases challenging the instructions on the law that were given?"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,99.097,100.756,"No, we are not, Your Honor."
1995.94-7448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.756,107.261,So in both cases it amounts to a sufficiency of the evidence question for us?
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,107.261,108.202,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1995.94-7448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,108.202,115.619,And would you tell me what you think the word carry means?
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,124.084,125.726,"Your Honor, I believe the indictments--"
1995.94-7448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,125.726,126.667,"In Bailey, did it?"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,126.667,132.95,"--I believe the indictment included uses or carries, and so did he instructions in this case."
1995.94-7448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,137.344,143.008,You don't think that under this statute that a gun could be carried in the trunk of a car--
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,143.008,144.149,"No, we don't--"
1995.94-7448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.149,145.488,--for purposes of this statute?
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,145.488,146.339,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.94-7448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,167.895,181.292,"But if we agreed with you... in the Bailey case, if we agreed with you on use, we'd have to remand, wouldn't we, because the lower court... with the exception of the one dissenting opinion, the lower court didn't get into carrying."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,181.292,184.725,"Your Honor, we think that the Court can and should reach the issue of what it means to carry--"
1995.94-7448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,184.725,186.017,"Yes, but we'd be doing it in the first instance."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,186.017,193.881,"--You would be, Your Honor, that's correct, but we think the meaning is relatively clear, of the word carries, and this Court is fully capable of deciding what that means."
1995.94-7448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,193.881,198.202,Except that this Court operates as a court of review and not first--
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,198.202,200.945,"Well, that's true, Your Honor."
1995.94-7448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,255.03,260.684,"--Well, Mr. Untereiner, what is your view as to the meaning of uses and the meaning of carries in that phrase?"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,260.684,266.478,"We suggest that the word use means, to actively employ to carry out the predicate offense."
1995.94-7448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,272.621,279.337,"Well, how about our opinion in the... wasn't it in the Smith case where we said if you... that you use a weapon if you barter it for some drugs?"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,279.337,279.978,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1995.94-7448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,299.83,320.613,"Well, how about a strategic placement of a firearm, having it right there so that the persons with whom the defendant is dealing in the case of a drug sale has some notion of the power available to the defendant at that time?"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,320.613,321.505,"Well, Your Honor, I think--"
1995.94-7448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,321.505,327.777,Some kind of... I don't know how to describe it better than a strategic placement of the weapon.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,327.777,336.425,"--I think if the weapon were placed in an open area, it would be displayed, and that would fall within the meaning of active employment as we understand it."
1995.94-7448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,336.425,338.947,It doesn't have to be held in the hand.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,338.947,339.715,That's correct.
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,364.892,381.343,"Lest there seem to be too much agreement between you and Justice O'Connor, your response was, if it's strategically placed and visible it would be use, but let's say I had it in the drawer here, so it's not visible."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,387.436,387.907,--That's right.
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.211,395.072,At least shown... it has to be at least shown.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,395.072,408.18,"That's correct, and the reason for that, if it's displayed, it's actually having an effect in carrying out the predicate offense, whereas if it's hidden somewhere, all it does is embolden the possessor, and emboldening, we submit, really doesn't add anything to possession."
1995.94-7448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,408.18,422.9,"You mean, you would say the same if this were a crack house with machine guns strategically placed, to use Justice O'Connor's phrase, at various points where they could be easily turned on anybody who was trying to get into the house?"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,422.9,426.452,"Justice Kennedy, if they were openly displayed in a crack house--"
1995.94-7448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,426.452,428.503,"No, no, they're concealed, but they're--"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,428.503,430.577,"--That would not be a use under our theory, that's correct."
1995.94-7448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,435.277,444.475,"--Well, I take it that the reason is you have to draw a line some point, and so you want to show that there was an actual, active employment, that it was being used."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,451.839,452.87,"--I'm sorry, I--"
1995.94-7448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,452.87,459.555,"That they had two or three people manning the machine guns, but... at least close by, but they were concealed."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,459.555,463.418,"--Well, it could be that they could be carried in some--"
1995.94-7448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,463.418,466.768,"No, they're not carried, they're in a fixed place."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,466.768,471.662,--And they're not being borne on that... they're not on the person's person.
1995.94-7448,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,471.662,472.431,No.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,472.431,474.975,"That would... that's correct, that would not be a use under our theory."
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.975,483.801,"And I suppose if you had agents stationed around the room, all of whom were carrying firearms, prepared to use them, you would not be using firearms."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,483.801,490.115,"There might be aiding and abetting liability under the carrying prong there, but there wouldn't be... there wouldn't be a use."
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.115,493.656,"What if your agents actually used the firearms, actually pointed--"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,493.656,495.559,There might be aiding and abetting liability for use.
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,495.559,496.618,--But you would not be using the firearm.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,496.618,497.479,"No, that's correct."
1995.94-7448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,497.479,504.524,"Well, don't you concede, or isn't it at least consistent with your theory to concede that there can be an overlap between use and carry?"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,515.332,515.912,That's correct--
1995.94-7448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,515.912,519.284,"There could be an overlap, and there could have been an overlap in Justice Scalia's example."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,519.284,524.697,"--Indeed, there is an overlap under our theory of the statute and under the Government's theory of the statute."
1995.94-7448,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,529.832,532.013,Yours is not complete and the Government's is.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,532.013,540.348,"--That's correct, and the Government does not dispute the fact that its reading of use liability would render the word carries in the statute superfluous."
1995.94-7448,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,548.593,554.129,"But you, of course... you also agree that the word use is not superfluous, that there are uses of the gun when it is not being carried."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,554.129,554.897,--Certainly.
1995.94-7448,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,554.897,558.009,"What are the... what's the best example of that, in your view?"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,558.009,562.043,"Well, displaying a firearm could be a use, would be a use--"
1995.94-7448,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,562.043,562.955,"Displaying it without carrying it, though."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,562.955,563.743,--That's correct.
1995.94-7448,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,568.709,571.5,Referring to it in the trunk of a car?
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,571.5,572.218,Possibly.
1995.94-7448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,574.491,577.343,"So in your view, use is broader than carry."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,577.343,579.224,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.94-7448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,595.245,604.342,But I thought in your... the hypothetical about the weapon being visibly displayed it wouldn't necessarily have to be on one's person.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,606.473,608.914,"In that example it would be, Your Honor."
1995.94-7448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,608.914,612.345,"So then, that example, use would be broader than carry."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,612.345,613.477,"Well, use--"
1995.94-7448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,613.477,614.566,It would include--
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,614.566,615.568,--Use will certainly cover things that carry--
1995.94-7448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,615.568,616.389,--That carry doesn't.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,616.389,617.258,--doesn't cover.
1995.94-7448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,620.18,626.545,"Your definition of carry is it's on your person, because you excluded having it in the trunk."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,630.689,640.376,"--Well, we actually have two... we have an alternative definition of carries which is slightly broader, but nonetheless would not be a basis for upholding Bailey's conviction under carry."
1995.94-7448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,640.376,655.596,"But you want to concentrate here on use, as I understand it, and from what you've been saying, am I correct in gathering that use means, as you define it, something perceivable by another human on the premises?"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,655.596,664.061,It's activity with the... it's some kind of activity with the weapon that carries out... assists in carrying out the predicate offense.
1995.94-7448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,664.061,668.092,"In other words, a concealed weapon can't be seen, so you say that's carry but not use."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,679.312,684.545,"Well, I think that use liability would require that."
1995.94-7448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,693.0,696.712,"Well, what if you blow someone's head off from behind."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,700.494,701.195,--That's correct.
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,701.195,710.18,I suppose you'd say you could use a weapon without carrying it by having some remote... remote mechanism of discharge.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,716.325,716.915,That's correct.
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,723.14,729.334,And what if you direct one of your goons to shoot the person?
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,737.068,741.83,"Well, you may be liable for aiding and abetting someone else's use, someone else's--"
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,741.83,743.703,"Might you also be, even under your theory be--"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,743.703,744.952,--It might be.
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,748.145,749.647,--If you direct its use by someone else.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,749.647,759.763,"--If you have constructive possession of a weapon by... and you have control over your accomplice, and you direct that it be used, that could be a use, I suppose."
1995.94-7448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,789.422,792.684,Where do we find section 924(d) in the papers?
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,792.684,799.61,"--924(d) is in our opening brief, the appendix, page 3a."
1995.94-7448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,799.61,800.441,Thank you.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,800.441,811.827,"Section 924(d) draws this distinction between firearms that are used, those that are involved in, and those that are merely intended to be used."
1995.94-7448,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,852.704,874.409,"Before you get to that, Mr. Untereiner, may I ask you how your definition, your active definition of use, fits in with one of the underlying crimes, and that's possession with intent to distribute, which is a passive crime, no activity involved, so how do you get an active use tied together with such an offense?"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,874.409,884.104,"Justice Ginsburg, it's quite possible, we think, that a firearm can be actively employed in a predicate offense of that kind."
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,924.901,926.233,Do you think we followed that in Smith?
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,926.233,929.344,The--
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,929.344,932.997,"Do you think we follow that rule with respect to the phrase, use a firearm?"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,935.318,942.832,--I think the majority in Smith concluded that the level of ambiguity was not sufficient to trigger the Rule of Lenity in Smith.
1995.94-7448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,950.368,951.667,"Well, I'm not sure it did."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,955.04,982.669,"--Well, I think in Smith, Your Honor, the Court was looking at the statute as a whole, and I think here again the language of section 924(d) was significant because of this distinction between... well, the fact that that made cross-reference to crimes that clearly involved trading firearms, and I think that, and I think the Court, the majority in Smith was also somewhat troubled with the possibility that bludgeoning someone with a firearm might not be a use under the dissent's theory."
1995.94-7448,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,984.451,985.63,Would it be in your view?
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,985.63,986.672,"--Yes, it would, Your Honor."
1995.94-7448,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.672,991.324,"You don't quarrel with the Smith holding at all, as I understand your brief."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,991.324,993.585,"No, Your Honor, we don't ask... no."
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,998.53,1011.357,"It may be, but with the argument you're making now, with the Rule of Lenity, was there any less ambiguity... do you think there was less ambiguity in Smith than there was here?"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,1011.357,1014.319,"We do believe there was less, yes--"
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1014.319,1015.07,You do.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,1015.07,1030.38,"--because of the presence of subsection (d), the forfeiture provision, where the word use also appeared, and where Congress was making a cross-reference to crimes where a firearm was traded, and I think that the Court relied heavily on that in Smith, and that--"
1995.94-7448,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1030.38,1035.904,"Well, as I understand your position, you agree that the trading of a firearm is an active use of the firearm."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,1035.904,1036.785,--That's correct.
1995.94-7448,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1036.785,1043.979,Sticking it in the trunk or some locked compartment where it's not used at all is not use within the meaning of the statute.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,1043.979,1044.859,That's correct.
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1044.859,1046.97,"You say use goes beyond carry, don't you?"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,1046.97,1048.443,Yes.
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1048.443,1055.665,"Yes, well then, how do you explain, let's see, 5... it's on page la of the petitioner's appendix."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,1078.953,1087.228,"We think that that, the language that, Justice Scalia, you've just read strongly supports our position, because... for a number of reasons."
1995.94-7448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1177.505,1181.959,Why should we prefer one to the other in making a decision in this case?
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,1181.959,1194.276,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that the Court should strive not to read use in 924(c) in a way that simply eradicates another provision of Federal law, namely, the two-level enhancement provision."
1995.94-7448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1194.276,1197.248,"Well, that's an argument of statutory construction."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,1211.08,1218.291,"Well, we think that the statutory construction argument is also available in that situation, and I guess that's the argument we're--"
1995.94-7448,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1218.291,1222.015,"May I ask, you commented on Justice Breyer's opinion on the First Circuit."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,1228.449,1234.474,"--I think that case is clearly distinguishable for two reasons, number 1, that was a case about carrying."
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1261.972,1274.659,"Well, if the firearm were traded, exactly as occurred in Smith, would that be use within the meaning of this statutory provision?"
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,1274.659,1275.431,Yes.
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1275.431,1276.622,It would.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,1276.622,1278.743,A firearm traded as in Smith.
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.743,1279.444,Yes.
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,1279.444,1280.062,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1280.062,1282.365,"That would be used, in your meaning."
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,1282.365,1284.306,"Yes, within the meaning of... yes."
1995.94-7448,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1286.507,1287.299,Why?
1995.94-7448,0,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,1287.299,1294.204,Because in... because you are... you... it's activity with the weapon in such a way that you carry out the predicate offense.
1995.94-7448,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.973,1311.184,"Very well, Mr. Untereiner."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1313.065,1316.757,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-7448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1339.981,1345.105,"Is that an intentional part of the crime, and that we infer that intent from all the circumstances?"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1345.105,1346.687,"That's correct, Justice Kennedy."
1995.94-7448,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1395.178,1403.793,"There was... in Robinson's case, were the drugs that were part of the transaction taken out of that foot locker?"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1403.793,1422.506,"The jury could draw that inference, yes, because there was a drug transaction within about a half-an-hour of the execution of the search warrant, and after the search warrant was executed, cocaine was found, crack cocaine was found in the trunk in the bedroom, so the jury could... and marked money from that transaction was also found in that trunk."
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1436.945,1449.153,"Mr. Dreeben, you're not... the Government's not making the argument, I take it, that having a gun in a locked trunk when the drug transaction is being completed is enough to constitute its use."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1449.153,1455.488,"Well, neither... Justice Scalia, neither of the violations in these cases involved the offense of distribution."
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.629,1458.19,All right.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1458.19,1463.755,So the crucial issue is whether the gun was available to the defendant for the purpose of protecting his possession--
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1463.755,1464.815,His possession.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1464.815,1465.345,--of the drugs.
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.716,1475.073,"Now, suppose I keep the drugs under my bed, and I have the gun in a locked trunk two rooms away, in a closet."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1476.303,1479.634,That may not be sufficient for the jury to draw the inference.
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1518.5,1538.012,"So in the case in which the drugs were kept in the locked trunk, and the trunk is in, let's say, the next room, your theory is that use is proven by the fact that at the time the drugs were put in the trunk, possessed in that sense, the handgun was handy and therefore was used."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1543.966,1546.299,"Well, I... not necessarily."
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1552.024,1554.384,"Yes, but am I continuing to use the gun?"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1563.39,1565.44,And at every time in which the defendant--
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1565.44,1565.851,"Okay, now--"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1565.851,1566.422,--goes to the trunk.
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1566.422,1573.385,"--is the gun also being used after the trunk is locked with the gun in it and the drugs in it, and the dealer goes into the next room?"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1573.385,1575.138,"Possibly, but not necessarily."
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1579.001,1580.501,You could give that away and still win.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1580.501,1588.476,"--Well, I think that the connotation of use that we're proposing at least embraces the availability of the firearm for protection--"
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1588.476,1591.808,"Well, I thought the connotation of use you were proposing would have given a yes answer."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1605.906,1607.609,--I think that's the time when it's clearest.
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1609.168,1610.32,"But your theory is broader, and you're--"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1610.32,1611.392,--That's right.
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1611.812,1612.702,--claiming that even when he's in the next room--
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1612.702,1613.152,That's right.
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1613.152,1613.733,--he's still using.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1613.733,1617.774,"That's right, Justice Souter, we are, and because the use of the gun consists of two different purposes."
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1630.934,1638.26,"Well, true, but everybody who possesses a gun constructively, I suppose, has that same... gains that same confidence."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1638.26,1638.979,--I think that that--
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1638.979,1643.102,"Why do they use use... why do they employ use, rather than possess?"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1643.102,1655.48,"--Well, the evolution of the statute I think reflects that originally the word use was put in the statute to define one branch of liability which is probably narrower than the liability that's currently in the statute."
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1683.818,1694.794,"But they still have... the statute still has the qualification that the use or the carrying must occur during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, a specific crime."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1694.794,1695.686,That's absolutely correct.
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1695.686,1697.376,Which seems... maybe I'm missing your point.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1709.565,1711.137,"No, I don't think that it does."
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1719.524,1719.955,"Well, that's broad--"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1719.955,1720.584,That's right.
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1720.584,1722.356,--but the word crime is very specific.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1722.356,1735.003,"Well, it is, and it depends on what the crime is, and if the crime is one that takes place only in a very brief span of time, such as assault on a bank teller with a deadly weapon, then indeed you have to find that the use is during that crime."
1995.94-7448,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1735.003,1736.665,"Well, let's concentrate on this crime."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1739.547,1740.438,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.94-7448,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1740.438,1754.356,"And can you explain to me what difference, if any, there is in using a firearm in relation to a possession with intent to distribute and possessing a firearm?"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1760.671,1775.73,"I think, Justice Ginsburg, that if the requirement is added, during and in relation to, then the verb possess would probably pick up the same scope of liability that we are describing, but that's... it would not by itself, of course."
1995.94-7448,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1778.772,1784.866,So when Congress said use in relation to a drug trafficking offense--
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1784.866,1785.507,That's right.
1995.94-7448,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1785.507,1798.316,"--it would have achieved the same purpose if it had said possessed, so that the word use in your view is not narrower than the word possess would be in that context."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1798.316,1803.679,"Well, it... I mean, use I think requires more in and of itself than merely possession."
1995.94-7448,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1805.442,1808.093,"Well, I'm connecting it to the words, in relation to."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1808.093,1808.503,--That's right.
1995.94-7448,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1808.692,1811.055,"In other words, your view is, Congress could have picked either word."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1812.485,1814.268,"That's pretty much correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.795,1846.706,"Mr. Dreeben, is it possible that it's... is it possible that it's impossible to use a firearm for or in connection with some of the felonies punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act?"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1846.706,1849.01,"Not that I'm aware of, Justice Scalia."
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.01,1854.202,You think every single felony punishable under those acts can be--
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1854.202,1881.39,"I do, and I further think that the specific felony that we have at issue here, possession with intent to distribute, is one that Congress singled out for inclusion, because when it added drug trafficking crime to the statute in 1986, it spoke of manufacturing, distributing, or selling, I believe, verbs that left some courts... at least it left a legal issue open to litigate about whether possession with intent to distribute was, in fact, covered."
1995.94-7448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1902.114,1926.471,"--Mr. Dreeben, under your interpretation of use, which is quite broad, as you describe it, what does the word carry add in addition, or would every offense charged under the use prong, as you would define it, pick up the word carry as well, automatically?"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1926.471,1928.06,"I think it probably would, Justice O'Connor."
1995.94-7448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1931.393,1937.367,That's one reason why I question the Government's interpretation of the word use here.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1937.367,1938.266,"Well, we have--"
1995.94-7448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1938.266,1963.834,"I would have thought that the words use and carry might refer to different things, and that use might be a word that envisions something more than mere possession, and I'm concerned that the Government is interpreting it so broadly that it swallows up the word carry, and swallows up the offense of possession of a weapon while committing a crime."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1963.834,1973.551,"--I think, Justice O'Connor, that both sides in this case are grappling with the question of whether there is a distinction between the two offenses, and what it is."
1995.94-7448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2042.296,2064.02,"Well, people do use the word that way, but perhaps that isn't how Congress used the word use, because it had a separate offense for possession, and a separate offense for transporting, and a separate term carry, and so we have to try to figure out what in the world Congress meant with this scheme."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2064.02,2078.929,I think I've tried to explain that the evolution of this statute shows why the normal presumption that the conjunction of two words must have different meanings shouldn't be rigorously applied in this case with the ultimate impact of defeating Congress' intent.
1995.94-7448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2110.119,2112.35,"But that nexus, it seems to me, is important."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2137.266,2137.987,"--Well, I think--"
1995.94-7448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2137.987,2146.493,"It seems strange to me that Congress intended to pick that up, especially when it has the extra phrase, in relation to."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2146.493,2155.659,"--Well, the in relation to, I think, Justice Kennedy, makes clear that a gun owner who has... even if he is a drug dealer, if the gun has nothing to do with the drugs, isn't violating this statute."
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2164.515,2174.742,"Well, but on your theory the gun owner who happens to have the gun in his pocket is always going to be using it in relation to as well as during the offense if he commits a drug offense--"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2174.742,2175.401,--If he commits an offense.
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2175.401,2175.802,--at that time.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2183.158,2188.17,"Well, it's going to be an issue for the jury to determine, and yes, Justice Souter, the jury could determine it."
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2188.17,2195.015,"You're always going to make the same argument and the jury is always going to be free to find, in fact, that he was comforted by having the gun there."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2195.015,2202.359,Or to reject the inference if they conclude that the gun had simply a coincidental relationship to the offense and really wasn't--
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2202.359,2204.61,Is there testimony on this stuff?
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2210.914,2211.375,--No.
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2211.375,2211.835,--is this a real--
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2211.835,2213.385,We don't think that it was necessary.
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2213.385,2213.916,--Is this a real legal issue?
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2219.59,2219.89,No.
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.124,2238.533,"Well, I can see that if you adopted your opponent's theory, whether he brandishes it, and so forth, but you're saying the mere fact that he has a gun in the house, a jury may find that that enables him to... he's using that in the possession of everything in the house."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2238.533,2241.936,"--Well, he's not charged with that, of course."
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.587,2243.145,Well--
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2243.145,2244.087,--using the gun in relation to the drugs--
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.087,2252.912,"--all he has to have is the gun and possessing drugs with intent to distribute, and the jury can find that he's using the gun in order to possess with the intent to distribute."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2252.912,2266.733,"--We don't think that it's essential that there be expert testimony, but there was expert testimony in this case that described the habits and patterns of drug dealers and the frequent association of firearms with them, and the point of Congress' enactment of this statute--"
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2266.733,2267.762,Because they often use firearms.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2267.762,2269.484,--That's because the firearms create--
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2269.484,2270.546,In the real sense of use them.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2270.546,2277.478,"--Well, I think that this Court in Smith adopted the broadest reading of use that's consistent with dictionary definitions."
1995.94-7448,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2277.478,2301.535,"It was an active use, and you have suggested that one might say the gun that's hidden in my drawer, I use the gun for protection, but one might equally say about a gun that one has bought and never fired, I bought a gun but I've never used it, or I don't use it."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2314.014,2315.663,"Well, I think for several reasons, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.94-7448,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2319.567,2322.639,I just gave you two distinct uses.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2327.632,2343.053,"Well, I think the same distinction could have been drawn in the Smith case, and this Court quite clearly recognized that the word use, as employed in section 924(c), had its natural, broad meaning without additional qualifiers that limited it, such as active use."
1995.94-7448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2343.553,2345.955,"But that was an active use, Mr. Dreeben."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2350.87,2360.764,"--It is true, Justice O'Connor, that it involved handling the firearm and trading it, but it is not the first use of a firearm that springs to mind, and I think the Court quite correctly recognized that it wasn't."
1995.94-7448,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2360.764,2361.515,"No, but--"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2368.651,2371.082,"Well, I don't disagree with that, but I think--"
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2371.082,2378.967,"So there was no ambiguity as among, or as between several active, possible active uses, but there still can be an ambiguity as between active and passive use."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2378.967,2380.927,"--Well, I think there could, but the way that the Court--"
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2380.927,2384.741,"Well, if there could, then why shouldn't the Rule of Lenity apply as Justice Ginsburg suggested?"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2384.741,2395.827,"--Because the Court resolved the issue in Smith not by saying that this was an active use, and that's a requirement of the word, but by adopting the definition of the word use that one finds if one looks to dictionaries."
1995.94-7448,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2395.827,2409.928,"Well, perhaps we were imprecise, and perhaps Smith can be preserved without any difficulty if we simply now recognize that Smith was a choice between two active uses, and what we have here is a choice between active and passive."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2409.928,2414.961,"Well, I don't think that that would be consistent with the rationale that Smith used in order to decide the case."
1995.94-7448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2445.709,2447.01,May I ask you one question?
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2484.744,2487.988,--I think that he would clearly be liable under the carrying prong.
1995.94-7448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2490.098,2491.46,He would be carrying during the commission--
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2491.46,2491.901,--That's right.
1995.94-7448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2491.901,2492.762,--of the offense back in New York.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2492.762,2499.265,"That's right, and that may be... that is the example that I'm thinking of that may differentiate carrying liability from use liability."
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.153,2541.203,"Well, Congress had a broad... but Congress didn't say, although I suppose it could have, you know, anyone who possesses drugs and who, in addition, possesses a firearm, shall be punished with an additional penalty."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2542.365,2545.797,"They could have, and the Sentencing Guidelines have a provision--"
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2545.797,2547.988,That's not much further than what you say they've said.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2547.988,2549.347,"--Well, I think it bears a--"
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2549.347,2552.32,"It can always go to the jury, right, virtually always."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2557.034,2567.399,"--I think that it won't if there isn't any evidence of a conjunction between the two, but in the cases that we would bring where the gun is found right with the drugs--"
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.399,2569.061,"There's always a... it's my gun, it's my drugs."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2570.341,2597.549,"--Well, without more facts, it's a little hard to say, but I would think that you're right, essentially most of these cases will go to the jury, and the reason they go to the jury is that the firearms are found in strategic places where they facilitate the offense, and they inject the very danger and hazards that guns have in these kinds of transactions that Congress wanted to prohibit, and that is why we have treated these cases as uses, as have all of the regional courts of appeals."
1995.94-7448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2606.094,2606.635,Well--
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2615.303,2616.042,That's correct.
1995.94-7448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2616.042,2618.543,And I think... I suppose you would say that it wouldn't have to be.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2627.52,2630.822,"Well, if that was a sentencing enhancement statute, it could be written that way, Justice Stevens."
1995.94-7448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2630.822,2631.172,Yes.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2631.172,2632.234,It's been long understood--
1995.94-7448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2632.234,2634.124,With the same breadth of coverage.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2634.124,2634.695,--That's right.
1995.94-7448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2636.366,2636.676,Yes.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2636.676,2637.707,--have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
1995.94-7448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2637.707,2637.978,Yes.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2637.978,2640.629,You have to prove that he engaged in a drug trafficking offense--
1995.94-7448,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.629,2640.9,Yes.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2640.9,2649.957,"--and you have to prove that there was a use or carry, and you have to prove that the use or carry was during and in relation to the offense, and the jury was instructed on all of those elements here."
1995.94-7448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2686.02,2697.197,"I just want you to have a chance to answer the question I had, which is, what happened in 1984 that is... I take it... the dictionary, at least to me, doesn't answer the question."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2705.413,2706.183,That's right.
1995.94-7448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2706.183,2706.794,Right?
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2706.794,2707.114,That's right.
1995.94-7448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2707.114,2709.165,And so it isn't going to tell us.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2714.369,2715.279,"Well, I would add--"
1995.94-7448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2715.279,2721.543,"And you yourself say that prior to 1984, what Congress had in mind was, you take the gun out and you pull the trigger."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2757.567,2779.362,"--Well, our position is that the word use didn't change its meaning, but the word use takes its meaning from context, and in the original version of this statute, use was embedded in the phrase, used to commit any felony, and the connotation of used in that context may require a higher linkage or more prepositive use of the gun to actually carry out the crime."
1995.94-7448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2783.864,2784.845,"They deleted it, that's right."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2804.22,2804.74,"No, I--"
1995.94-7448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2804.74,2805.482,They say no difference.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2805.482,2806.469,--I don't think that--
1995.94-7448,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2806.469,2807.51,I want to know what you... I know you don't think that.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2810.102,2816.047,"--Well, I don't think that there is any legislative history that specifically addresses the meaning of the term use and attempt to define it."
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2824.903,2828.235,"Mr. Dreeben, who addressed it in the legislative history?"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2828.235,2830.856,"--This was in a Senate report, Senate Report 225--"
1995.94-7448,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2830.856,2833.027,Why don't you say what the Senate committee addressed in the legislative history.
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2833.027,2834.059,"--I stand corrected, Justice Scalia."
1995.94-7448,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2961.213,2971.077,"Could you comment on petitioner's argument with respect to subsection (d) of the statute, which uses the term, involved in or used?"
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2971.077,2978.464,"Well, I think that the Smith opinion explained why Congress chose the broader form, involved in, in that forfeiture provision."
1995.94-7448,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2998.306,2999.618,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
1995.94-7448,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2999.618,2999.979,Thank you.
1995.94-7448,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2999.979,3003.441,"Mr. Untereiner, you have 7 minutes remaining."
1995.94-7448,2,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,3003.441,3014.547,"I think that Justice O'Connor put her finger on a critical flaw in the Government's theory in this case, and that is that its interpretation of use reads the word carries out of the statute."
1995.94-7448,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.54,3021.27,But aren't there a lot of statutes like that?
1995.94-7448,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3034.96,3036.491,There are statutes--
1995.94-7448,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3036.491,3046.659,"And so also it's, you know, it's hard to use it without carrying it, so it's just making clear that I don't only mean the big thing, kill, but even the less thing, injure."
1995.94-7448,3,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3054.603,3057.744,--Sometimes we talk that way and sometimes Congress talks that way.
1995.94-7448,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.52,3108.708,"Mr. Untereiner, you agree with the active-passive distinction, I take it, that--"
1995.94-7448,4,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,3108.708,3109.369,That's correct.
1995.94-7448,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3113.002,3123.55,"--Now, if I have a gun lying passively on the table within a few feet from me, that is an active use, right?"
1995.94-7448,4,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,3123.55,3126.102,That is a... it can--
1995.94-7448,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3126.102,3131.654,"But if I have a gun two rooms away lying passively on the table, or passively in the closet, that is inactive use."
1995.94-7448,4,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,3131.654,3142.931,"--The issue is, what is the defendant doing, if anything, with the firearm, and in your first hypothetical, I think it could be said if the firearm is visible that the defendant is displaying--"
1995.94-7448,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3142.931,3143.322,I see.
1995.94-7448,4,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,3143.322,3143.692,--the firearm.
1995.94-7448,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3143.692,3146.334,"If it was in the drawer, though, you would say that is a passive use."
1995.94-7448,4,17150,alan_edward_untereiner,,3146.334,3147.716,That's correct.
1995.94-7448,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3151.056,3152.448,"Thank you, Mr. Untereiner."
