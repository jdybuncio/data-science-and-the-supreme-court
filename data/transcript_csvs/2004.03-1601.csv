2004.03-1601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,8.795,We'll now hear argument in the City of Rancho Palos Verdes against Abrams.
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,9.371,13.086,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."
2004.03-1601,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,63.713,76.716,"Well, Mr. Lamken, it's not as comprehensive as other schemes where the Court said, on that basis, we would not find a section 1983 cause of action, is it?"
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,79.317,85.277,"--It... it is unusual in its unique focus on private enforcement, but there was a reason for the focus on private enforcement."
2004.03-1601,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,98.597,99.257,"Well, what... what--"
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,99.257,99.895,--wouldn't be able to... I'm sorry.
2004.03-1601,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,99.895,113.829,--What would you think of a case where the plaintiff alleges that the antenna zoning was the... was caused by racial discrimination against the applicant?
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,116.718,117.173,Yes.
2004.03-1601,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.377,151.807,"Well, what about... it... it... section 332 speaks of an award of all appropriate relief."
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,158.66,166.462,"--In that respect, it is indistinguishable... for example, the statute that was at issue in Smith v. Robinson, and it doesn't specify the precise forms of relief available."
2004.03-1601,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,220.665,234.412,"Mr.... Mr. Lamken, the argument has been made that 4 years before the telecommunications act we're talking about was adopted, Congress adopted the Cable TV Consumer Protection Act."
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,257.446,268.591,"Justice Ginsburg, that... that's an example where Congress, for a broad range of statutes that could be potentially used to enforce the Cable Act, chose to restrict the forms of relief available."
2004.03-1601,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,281.389,283.246,What's the... what's the source of the implication?
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,283.246,283.906,--Pardon?
2004.03-1601,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,283.906,285.847,You say by implication.
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,285.847,298.85,"The implication... Congress has provided a specific mechanism for judicial relief here, section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself, and that is a highly adapted mechanism which includes unique characteristics such as a very short limitations period."
2004.03-1601,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,298.85,305.166,"So... so the... the implication, I... I guess, is that unless it specifically provides for damages, it implicitly does not."
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,305.166,305.538,I'm sorry.
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,332.741,333.28,Excuse me.
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,335.797,342.939,"--This... that comes from this Court's decision in Franklin, that where Congress doesn't specifically identify the specific forms of relief available--"
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,342.939,343.294,All right.
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,346.405,346.86,"--No, it isn't."
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.984,399.616,And... and 1983 is not subject to that limitation.
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,399.616,407.129,"--Well, 1983 is expressly preemptive under this Court's decisions, and it is... it would preempt the State laws by its own force."
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,426.987,431.361,But are they only immune from damages action or are they immune from suit?
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,431.361,432.104,No.
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,435.698,443.333,"So, I mean, that proves too much because they... the statute obviously intends to eliminate that immunity."
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,448.262,450.12,"Oh, I think... I think you may have misunderstood."
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,463.677,468.49,"--Well, it allows suit against either municipalities or States, State or local governments."
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,468.779,469.522,--Yes.
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,469.522,472.948,And the States have immunity not just from damages but from suit.
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,472.948,475.92,"As a constitutional matter, they have an immunity from suit, but--"
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,475.92,477.035,"Unless they have chosen to waive it, which--"
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,477.035,477.49,--Right.
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.49,479.47,--one must assume in this area they haven't.
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,479.47,479.842,Right.
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,479.842,492.473,So you have to regard this provision as intentionally overriding some provisions of State law in... inasmuch as they apply to... to immunity.
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,492.473,497.924,"Well, first of all, I don't think it would be read to... to override the State's constitutional immunity to suit."
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.924,499.161,No.
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,499.904,507.128,But it would be read to... it would be read to override immunities to suit that exist under State law because otherwise it couldn't be affected.
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,507.128,508.82,"--In for a penny, in for a pound."
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,508.82,509.192,Right.
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,509.192,510.472,If they've... if they've waived--
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,510.472,511.958,But I'm not--
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,511.958,520.503,"--If... if you acknowledge that it was intended to affect their immunity from suit, why... why would we suspect that it was not intended to affect their immunity from damages?"
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,520.503,525.704,"--Well, because it would be... it would be a provision with no effect whatsoever if it didn't override immunities to suit."
2004.03-1601,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.348,610.289,Does this action have to be brought in Federal court?
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,612.889,613.178,Yes.
2004.03-1601,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,624.49,634.15,Would a State court be free to award damages or would that be preempted under the view you take of the statute?
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,634.15,642.489,"The State... because there's an express preservation of State law in this context, I think that State... States would be free to award damages under their own laws."
2004.03-1601,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,653.429,671.096,"If the State court allowed damages... if... if the State system allowed... State law allowed damages, would the Federal court, in an action under this section, be allowed to award damages under that... under the State statute?"
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,671.096,691.863,"Your Honor, I think since the... the provision, the savings clause, says that the statute should not be construed to impair State law... and there are so many municipal immunity statutes and you would only have one construction of the statute... I believe that the construction would be an across-the-boards construction, that this act does not provide damages and you would not vary from State to State."
2004.03-1601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,691.863,694.668,What if the State law authorized the recovery of attorney's fees?
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,695.699,696.459,Pardon?
2004.03-1601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.459,699.786,What if the State law authorized the recovery of attorney's fees?
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,699.786,700.34,Well--
2004.03-1601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.34,701.068,What would you do then?
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,701.068,707.505,"--If the State law provides for recovery of attorney's fees for State violations, then that would control for State violations."
2004.03-1601,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,716.133,734.049,"I'm not sure why that would be if you, in fact, see the statute as trying to impose an APA-like structure, saying to the States, you decide the substance, we'll give you minimum elements of form, which helps your position."
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,749.782,751.268,--Justice Breyer--
2004.03-1601,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,751.268,752.587,It's strongly supported in the history.
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,754.645,760.389,"--Well, in fact, California provides a municipal immunity for permitting decisions, and so my client--"
2004.03-1601,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,760.389,761.382,So then you're only--
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,761.382,762.125,--would be fine with your position.
2004.03-1601,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,780.246,780.784,--Congress didn't care.
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,780.784,781.444,--to use whatever--
2004.03-1601,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,781.444,788.231,Congress wanted to substitute a Federal judgment for the judgment of the States where it said so.
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,801.794,804.932,"--That is one of our principal contentions, Justice Breyer, which is--"
2004.03-1601,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,804.932,810.134,"And what, Mr. Lamken, would be the normal procedure in the State?"
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,822.189,827.346,--The normal procedure is either under a uniform State law or California law.
2004.03-1601,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,871.64,874.817,And the remedies being injunctive and declaratory.
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,874.817,877.23,A... a form of specific relief.
2004.03-1601,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,886.129,893.681,Are you saying that it's parallel to what APA review of an agency decision would be?
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,893.681,895.333,It's very much like that.
2004.03-1601,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,909.079,916.898,"It... it seems to me that the 30-day provision is inconsistent with the award of damages, but after I say that, I can't tell you why."
2004.03-1601,0,31508,jeffrey_a_lamken,,917.708,936.86,"Well, actually this Court's decision in Burnett v. Grattan actually tells you why, and that is that 30-day provisions, which are typical for on-the-record review of decisions below, are often insufficient to allow somebody to develop a whole new record such as their proof of damages, to make important decisions if they're going to have, for example, a jury trial, or to prepare for discovery."
2004.03-1601,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,954.982,955.891,"Yes, you may."
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,963.777,968.728,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1601,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1026.125,1031.886,"But it... the statute, though, is silent on the question of damages or attorney's fees, isn't it?"
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1031.886,1032.795,--It is.
2004.03-1601,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1037.17,1040.513,Can we infer all appropriate relief?
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1040.885,1044.851,"--As a matter of damages, I think all appropriate relief would be the standard."
2004.03-1601,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.902,1064.253,"Attorney's fees are never appropriate, in other words."
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1064.253,1067.104,Are never appropriate unless Congress specifically provides for them.
2004.03-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1067.104,1073.641,"But it has provided for them for a 1983 action, and if it's a 1983 action, it takes care of it."
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1073.641,1073.913,That's right.
2004.03-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.913,1074.989,And this is kind of circular.
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1074.989,1085.059,"I don't think it's circular because I think when Congress created the specific cause of action here in (B)(v), it didn't provide for attorney's fees and therefore intended that attorney's fees not be provided."
2004.03-1601,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1091.54,1091.996,Mr. Feldman--
2004.03-1601,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1091.996,1094.447,Suppose Congress said specifically 1983 applies.
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1097.94,1099.509,"--Yes, I... yes, I think it... I think it would."
2004.03-1601,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1136.95,1140.543,"Well, I take... you... you take the position that 1983 doesn't apply at all."
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1142.09,1142.833,--That's right.
2004.03-1601,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1169.582,1170.325,What about damages?
2004.03-1601,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1170.325,1175.405,Do you... do you think that any other provisions of the Communications Act are enforceable under 1983?
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1182.836,1195.717,"I think... I think the same rule would apply to any of the provisions where Congress has specifically provided for a cause of action for the same reason, otherwise Congress when... here, for example, just to return to attorney's fees for a second."
2004.03-1601,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.626,1223.581,"Well, this is really a more general proposition you're urging upon us then, that whenever Congress creates a cause of action that is... what... in any respect more limited than section 1983, the background action of section 1983 is not available."
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1223.581,1225.4,--That... I... I think that's correct.
2004.03-1601,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1225.4,1225.672,No.
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1252.188,1256.069,"I think in... I think the rule would be in general because, first of all, it's not just remedies."
2004.03-1601,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1278.194,1289.218,"--Then how would you ever have a statute that... 1983 provides for relief when there's a violation of Federal law, statutory or constitutional."
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1298.878,1300.985,I... I think that that's completely wrong.
2004.03-1601,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.575,1344.658,"Well, there... there are two situations."
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1371.49,1372.417,That's right.
2004.03-1601,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1400.031,1403.07,What... what about damages?
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1409.674,1411.903,We don't have a position on whether it does.
2004.03-1601,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1413.844,1416.007,You think it's unnecessary to decide this case.
2004.03-1601,1,30335,james_a_feldman,,1416.007,1425.528,"--I think it is unnecessary, and in fact, I think it shows a problem with... a reason why our view, which is if Congress creates a cause of action, that should be respected... why that should be respected."
2004.03-1601,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1538.098,1539.462,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1544.581,1552.67,"Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-1601,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1596.965,1597.541,Mr. Waxman.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1597.541,1598.655,--the background principle.
2004.03-1601,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1598.655,1619.628,"Mr. Waxman, it seems to me that the... the best argument we've heard about incompatibility is the one... or at least I think the best... is the one that Mr. Lamken touched on at the tail end of his argument, and that is, he said there's... there's a 30-day provision in there, which in effect says Congress wants this litigation conducted fast and over with fast."
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1644.352,1668.79,"Well, I think that the way this Court has interpreted incompatibility before... in the two instances in 25 years since Maine v. Thiboutot was decided, the only instances in which this Court has found incompatibility has been where use of 1983 would create an end run around limitations in the statute."
2004.03-1601,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1690.604,1694.879,"Well, the other word is inconsistent, and is it... sorry."
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1717.83,1718.202,Okay.
2004.03-1601,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1718.673,1720.409,But I see an administrative law statute.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1732.669,1732.874,--Okay.
2004.03-1601,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1779.109,1782.535,But it also requires expeditiousness on the part of the court.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1782.535,1788.973,--It requires that the court proceed expeditiously and courts can proceed expeditiously where damages are sought or are not sought.
2004.03-1601,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1791.202,1803.462,"But do you... do you agree with this much, that if... if damages, in fact, are going to be allowed, what is going to count as expeditious is going to be a lot slower than what is going to count as expeditious if damages are not allowed."
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1803.462,1804.371,--I don't think that's true.
2004.03-1601,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1819.194,1819.5,Okay.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1820.476,1820.886,--the first issue--
2004.03-1601,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1820.886,1822.91,"--that was a violation of the statute, wasn't it?"
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1822.91,1829.764,"--Well, it first issued an order saying, okay, I've construed the statute and I've determined that the statute is violated."
2004.03-1601,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1842.889,1847.801,So they turned the damage issue basically just into a separate remedial hearing at the end of the case.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1847.801,1851.888,"--It could or could not be, and there may... may be many cases when damages aren't appropriate but--"
2004.03-1601,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1851.888,1861.442,I thought that was just to decide in... in the... in the court of first instance... that tail end was not to decide whether in this specific case damages or attorney's fees were due.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1874.733,1883.095,"--What he said, Justice Ginsburg, was we'll deal with what other remedies, if any, are available and to what extent in a separate proceeding."
2004.03-1601,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1885.324,1886.605,But was not making a rule for this case only.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1888.563,1889.185,--For sure.
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1922.621,1923.94,They... they don't necessarily disagree.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1927.739,1960.061,"Well, I think... I think that... what the Government says in its papers is they may well be available and what Mr. Feldman... I don't want to misquote him, but he said that under Franklin... he agreed, I think, with what Judge Posner wrote for the Seventh Circuit, which is where no remedies... where no specific remedies are specified... and that's the case here... you apply a rule of judicial implication, announced in Bell v. Hood and applied to an implied right of action in Franklin, to apply that all appropriate relief is available."
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1961.714,1962.374,Mr. Waxman.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1962.374,1962.996,And the irony here--
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.996,1981.116,"Mr. Waxman, how do you... how do you get a reading of the 30-day limitation, which is applicable to the cause of action under the Communications Act, sucked into the cause of action under section 1983?"
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1985.946,1989.745,--I have... I have two different ways to get to that.
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2011.126,2011.309,"No, it doesn't."
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2011.309,2012.241,But more broadly--
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2012.241,2017.153,But it doesn't require you to... to establish a cause of action under some other statute either.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2017.153,2017.525,--That's right.
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2018.556,2018.928,It does not at all.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2037.011,2057.444,"--Well, I don't, but I do know that this Court... first of all, Congress has now enacted section 1658 which provides a... a 4-year Federal default statute of limitations, where... where a statute like 1983 doesn't provide it, but includes an... an introduction that says, except where otherwise provided by Federal law."
2004.03-1601,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2135.751,2136.057,"Well, that's--"
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2136.057,2136.661,--and--
2004.03-1601,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2136.661,2139.512,"--that's why I'm approaching it differently, and I... I want to get your view on it."
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2186.445,2190.531,"--Justice Breyer, this is not the APA model."
2004.03-1601,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2231.899,2240.731,"Mr. Waxman... Mr. Waxman, one of these provisions gives you an option to go to the FCC, the one having to do with emissions."
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2255.426,2258.276,--The FCC has said that it does not if you do that.
2004.03-1601,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2266.283,2270.62,"Well, isn't that an incongruity that Congress would say you have your choice?"
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2276.785,2278.893,--You can't go to the... excuse me.
2004.03-1601,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2279.386,2288.014,"So if... if you have that choice, when you're dealing with the radio emissions, to go the... why would any litigant ever do that?"
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2306.673,2320.503,"--The... the FCC alternative for a declaration by the FCC applies to only one of the five rights that are provided here, and even if it applied to all of them, I don't think you could possibly infer that--"
2004.03-1601,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2320.503,2322.732,"Well, let's take the one, that... that one."
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2328.099,2328.637,--Absolutely not.
2004.03-1601,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2351.383,2351.605,But isn't--
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2351.605,2353.257,--If I just may finish.
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2403.884,2417.242,"They... they didn't provide for the normal administrative review because they were quite aware that under the State zoning systems, there would always be State administrative review before the issue even comes up."
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2417.242,2418.811,And this--
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2418.811,2429.585,And so what this provides is what kind of judicial review there will be after the anticipated administrative review before the zoning board and whatever appeal from the zoning board exists.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2429.585,2431.321,--I... I have to respectfully disagree.
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2455.857,2456.107,Final.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2459.284,2459.738,--That's correct.
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2459.738,2461.43,--Final action or failure to.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2461.43,2471.339,"And final action, this Court has explained, does not import into it exhaustion of either State administrative or judicial remedies."
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2477.943,2480.377,You haven't been injured until you've exhausted your--
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2480.377,2481.492,--That is--
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.492,2491.623,"--You... you really think that when there is a State provision available for review of the zoning board, you can commence an action under 1983 without even going through the administrative appeals?"
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2491.623,2501.554,"--I am entirely certain of that, and in fact, the... the local ordinance... I mean, the question of what is final agency action is surely a Federal question, but--"
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2501.554,2507.127,"This is really respecting the States, which is what the... the purpose of this... of this whole provision was."
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2507.127,2530.244,"--Justice Scalia, when Congress addressed this problem in 1996, as the Government points out in the very first page of its brief and as the legislative history reflects, it was confronting a situation in which intransigent, entrenched zoning authorities were acting arbitrarily to frustrate the creation of a national wireless network."
2004.03-1601,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2542.049,2542.587,Which would be more burdensome?
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2553.073,2554.104,--I think--
2004.03-1601,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2554.104,2556.333,--and the abilities of local governments to function?
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2556.333,2558.069,"--Oh, I think the former, for sure."
2004.03-1601,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2580.11,2587.335,"Well, I'm... I'm not so sure because you're arguing that even the smallest municipality can be liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney's fees."
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2587.335,2587.791,--Well--
2004.03-1601,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2587.791,2588.738,And I--
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2588.738,2591.134,"--let me just say this, with respect to the--"
2004.03-1601,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2591.134,2593.075,--Plus other... plus other damages.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2593.075,2597.533,"--I think this case, Justice Kennedy... I have three things to say about this."
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2666.347,2676.562,"Well, cable... cable media companies may... may have Congress' ear more readily than... than... you know, than the municipality of whatever this is or any--"
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2676.562,2678.691,State and... than State and local governments?
2004.03-1601,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2681.003,2683.111,--But I... I wouldn't put a lot of money on it.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2683.515,2691.2,"--The point is that Congress... Justice Kennedy, the point is not that Congress was being inattentive to State and local budgets."
2004.03-1601,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2736.98,2737.163,But with respect to--
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2737.163,2738.837,--If I may just finish this sentence.
2004.03-1601,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2760.468,2762.326,--Mr.... Mr. Waxman.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2762.326,2762.986,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-1601,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2762.986,2776.732,There is in this legislative record a concern expressed by a Senator from California when there was a proposal on the table to make the FCC the Federal review forum.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2809.054,2820.2,"First of all, Justice Ginsburg, I... the reference to those two Senators... what those two Senators were talking about is not, as my colleague's brief suggests, this provision."

2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2906.392,2909.736,1983 is the background principle against which Congress legislates.

2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2953.082,2953.825,--To be sure.
2004.03-1601,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2953.825,2957.002,And so I... I don't know how... what the... there won't be evidence.
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2958.738,2970.914,"The... the... you... the evidence will be either in the decided cases or by local municipal governments coming to Congress and saying, this is too heavy a thumb on the scale."
2004.03-1601,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2988.293,2989.136,But I... I don't think we--
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2989.136,2990.067,--a compelling national objective.
2004.03-1601,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2990.067,2997.126,--I don't think we usually think of... of judicial review of agency decisions in the ordinary course as being a deterrent.

2004.03-1601,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2999.317,3001.667,It's an opportunity to elaborate reasons.

2004.03-1601,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3020.576,3021.774,And it's going to skew the decisions.

I can't imagine, Mr. Waxman, that Congress wanted to impose damages plus attorney's fees upon municipalities without even giving the municipalities the chance to correct their mistakes, which is what you're saying."
2004.03-1601,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3164.991,3165.484,--Well--
