1967.305,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,44.347,"Number 305, Securities and Exchange Commission versus New England Electric System et al."
1967.305,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,45.664,49.295,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,219.842,220.946,This is the gas system.
1967.305,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,220.946,223.803,"This is the gas system, the eight gas companies."
1967.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,508.554,510.216,Could it be anything else?
1967.305,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,510.216,516.672,I don’t see how it could Mr. Justice when you try to find out how much more it would cost to operate.
1967.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,516.672,525.724,"I know but if you’re going to precede this kind of -- carry this burden of proving, you either going to do it this way or you won’t do it at all, I gather."
1967.305,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,525.724,530.237,Well there might -- there might be situations Mr. Justice.
1967.305,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,583.966,606.436,"Mr. Friedman, is there any dispute as to the burden of proof that is to say, is there any contest to your submission as I’ve take it that NEES, New England Electric Services had a burden of proving that there would have been a loss of substantial economies?"
1967.305,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,606.436,616.18,"No, Mr. Justice, they can see that on page 12 of their brief that they have the affirmative duty of bringing themselves within this narrow exception."
1967.305,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,616.18,617.792,And First Circuit didn’t quarrel.
1967.305,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,617.792,618.763,"No, they did not quarrel."
1967.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,653.252,663.178,"But if they -- but if they proceed in another way, this other way would necessarily involve some inherent judgment also."
1967.305,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,663.178,664.876,It would Mr. Justice but it will --
1967.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.876,675.954,"What you’re just saying that -- if this is the defect that makes the defect, it would be pretty hard to get rid of that defect no matter how you precede."
1967.305,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,675.954,678.63,"Well, I think Mr. Justice --"
1967.305,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.63,680.111,I don’t want to -- I don’t need to argue with you.
1967.305,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,685.847,695.156,"Now, as I -- as indicated and I will come to it in a little more precision in the moment, the Commission found various defects in the study."
1967.305,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1480.472,1481.531,Yes you may.
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,1487.458,1490.6,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1695.339,1723.302,"I’m not sure I understand that Mr. Quarles, do you mean that the Commission had before it the record performance in other cases in which gas properties had been divorced from electrical properties and in which there had been a better record of performance than the Ebasco report came out with in this particular case?"
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,1723.302,1735.467,If there was a record of the performance subsequent to divestment of any companies that had been separated or it does not appear in this record and is not referred to in these findings and opinion.
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1735.467,1735.912,I thought that should –
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,1735.912,1737.457,The comparison.
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1738.12,1738.678,I beg your pardon.
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,1746.191,1746.997,No sir.
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1767.943,1770.953,I see.
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,1770.953,1794.74,"And I have the feeling that here, the Commission figured that this was controlled by the president and have a great conclusion, it thought unnecessary to examine the record and formulate its own findings and opinion with the same care that it normally exercises."
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1880.706,1890.852,Did Ebasco make some assumptions as to what would happen to the volume of gas company business after the divestiture?
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,1890.852,1899.054,I think it’s fair to say that they assume that there would be no change in the volume of business as a mere result of the divestiture.
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1900.18,1902.83,Did the Commission disagree with that?
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,1902.83,1912.144,No indication that it disagreed with that except the very vague reference to the fact that there might be benefits from separation.
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1935.416,1939.731,"Sometimes as if there’s a long stretch, isn’t it Mr. Quarles."
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,1939.731,1947.858,It can be a long stretch but there is was accumulative evidence here but it was short stretched.
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2515.524,2517.196,What is it?
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,2523.019,2524.639,A million one hundred thousand dollars.
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2524.639,2528.166,"A million and one and now, what does that relate to?"
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,2530.398,2534.039,The gross revenue is about $22 million.
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2564.754,2585.301,"What you’re saying is that if I correctly understand you that the Ebasco study yielded the conclusion that after divestiture, the amount available for the stockholders from the operations of these gas properties wouldn’t be reduced by 30%."
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,2585.301,2604.015,"Reduced by 30%, that is correct and would bring the rate of return far below any that would be such as to attract new capital and according to the testimony of the chairman of Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities would probably result in the need for rate increases."
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2604.015,2614.328,But did you said that that did not take into account the possibility of an -- of an increase business as a result of the divestiture?
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,2614.328,2615.143,That is correct.
1967.305,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2792.11,2796.682,I suppose I won’t be comparable so far as the transportation of gas --
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,2796.682,2798.039,That is correct sir.
1967.305,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2856.088,2859.653,"They did quote the returns, didn’t they?"
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,2859.653,2878.812,They -- there was reporting of the rate of return and the comparison and some indication of the rate of return going down 58 to 59 but the rate of return at a moment in time for a single year or for two years is to a measure of the successful company.
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2965.963,2967.396,Were so much what?
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,2967.396,2974.348,"So much smaller, the amount of the loss in the two cases where the Commission did base it on the amount."
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2974.348,2976.027,How about the gross revenue?
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,2977.965,2986.44,The -- I was referring to the ration of the loss to their income to the various --
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2986.44,2988.799,You mean there was less than 30?
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,2988.799,2991.253,Or it was down to about 5% or 6%.
1967.305,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2991.253,2994.282,5% or 6% of the amount available for a stockholder.
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,2994.282,3005.895,"As compared with the 30% in our case so that we, in our brief and in our Appendix for the brief, had indicated that those two cases have no particular significance."
1967.305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3007.625,3029.795,"Except that I would suppose that even if the -- even if the Commission were wrong in saying the loss ratios were comparable, the cases have some significance in the sense that there were some companies that were split off and were going to be independent and they may be of comparable size and comparable situation."
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3029.795,3033.983,There’s no where -- nothing to indicate that they are of comparable situation.
1967.305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3057.71,3082.036,"Now, if the Commission comes up and says we’re going to order this divestiture and that you met your burden of proof because here are ten companies who in our judgment are comparable enough to the company we have before us now to -- and these companies are successful, they can exist and they’re comparable enough that we think you care."
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3083.929,3084.867,I do indeed sir.
1967.305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3086.508,3090.311,Write down and say why they’re comparable and why they aren’t comparable?
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3090.311,3105.83,"No sir but I think that before the Commission can make that kind of an assumption, it must have more than appears in this record or so far as we know is in the files of the Commission even as to what is the condition of these other companies."
1967.305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.892,3121.582,And you think that -- do you think it would be fatal to the Commission’s case if there have to be a rate increase for this company does exist?
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3121.582,3122.309,No sir.
1967.305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3153.009,3161.758,Have there been any -- any evidence to this case to gas system competed with the electrical system while that was under one management?
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3161.758,3164.54,The evidence was to the contrary.
1967.305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3180.206,3183.132,Even though they were territorial overlap?
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3183.132,3190.403,Oh yes and the territorial overlap was one of the things that give us the largest amount of savings.
1967.305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3250.251,3253.056,"Well, is this case over if you win here?"
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3253.056,3254.441,No sir.
1967.305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3255.624,3268.585,You know on your approach is that they have not done a decent job of articulating the basis for their decision and some other cases where this Court is reversed on that basis or has made that kind of adjustment.
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3271.188,3276.374,May I suggest that our position is merely a question of particulation.
1967.305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3287.952,3289.267,"But again, what if you win?"
1967.305,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3294.113,3313.621,"It then goes back to the Commission for reexamination to determine whether or not within the instructions from this Court or the Circuit Court, it is possible for them to give an adequate answer, if not then further hearings or further review of the evidence."
1967.305,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3317.201,3318.779,Mr. Friedman.
1967.305,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3318.779,3321.427,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1967.305,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3564.031,3569.805,Mr. Quarles mentioned the matter of no finding about the gas companies being an integrated system.
1967.305,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3571.637,3572.043,No.
1967.305,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3575.187,3580.264,The Court of Appeals did -- the Court of Appeals must have dealt with that.
1967.305,2,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,3580.264,3580.668,No.
