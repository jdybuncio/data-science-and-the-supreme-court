2016.16-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.975,"We'll hear argument this morning first in Case 16-529, Kokesh v. The Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Unikowsky."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,9.975,24.55,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government contends it can bring sovereign enforcement actions seeking backwards-looking monetary liability based on conduct dating back forever with no statute of limitations at all."
2016.16-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,33.13,46.02,"I guess your phraseology is technically correct, but the government says there's a multifactor analysis that a court would go through to determine that maybe the government's brought its action too late."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,46.02,53.645,"Your Honor, I -- actually, the government doesn't really take that position because it contends that laches does not apply to the government at all."
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,125.885,146.385,"Counselor, before the 1970s -- and you haven't shown me anything to the contrary -- forfeiture was an in rem proceeding where the property was attached; the money, the bank account, a piece of property, a home, whatever, but it was not a personal action against an individual."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,158.96,161.26,"Well, I'd give two responses to that."
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,177.85,187.975,"A fine has -- I mean, forfeit -- disgorgement is an equitable remedy on getting back money that doesn't belong to you."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,194.395,194.86,Right.
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,195.23,196.61,That begs the question.
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,196.61,198.81,"Well, I agree with you, Justice Sotomayor."
2016.16-529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,250.045,260.695,"Mr. Unikowsky, whatever the history, certainly disgorgement was not in the days of the common law what it is today."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,278.7,291.475,"No, there hasn't, because really, the SEC's efforts to seek these -- what we view as stale disgorgements are quite new. So, for instance, the government says that in 1990, Congress implicitly ratified its position about the statute of limitations."
2016.16-529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,299.62,320.545,"Is it clear that the district court has statutory authority to do this? I -- I understand that in cases where the aggrieved party is before the court, there can be equitable remedies under State law and so forth to afford restitution, at least. Is -- is there specific statutory authority that makes it clear that the district court can entertain this remedy?"
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,320.545,322.41,There's no specific statutory authority.
2016.16-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,336.495,349.04,Do you have any idea what percentage of time -- how often a district court does direct that the disgorgement go to a victim as opposed to the government?
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,349.04,357.975,"There -- one of the amicus briefs, the American Investment Council, quotes numbers -- and I haven't personally checked their accuracy -- of something like $800 million out of 6 billion."
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,383.48,406.035,"Can we go back to the authority? 78u, which is the only authority I can imagine, says, ""A court may grant any equitable relief that may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors."" If they are not doing -- if they're not doing restitution, how could that be the basis of disgorgement?"
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,406.035,411.47,So that statute was enacted 30 years after the SEC already started seeking disgorgement.
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,419.16,426.645,"Well, I'll let your adversary tell me what the source of their power is, but I -- I -- it is unusual."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,426.645,432.42,I -- we do argue at some length in our brief that it doesn't genuinely count as an equitable form of relief.
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,434.66,437.135,Would you tell me why you think this is punitive?
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,437.135,437.64,Sure.
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,437.64,446.65,"What are your best arguments? I've read your brief, but the government responded to some of them in -- in, well, somewhat persuasive ways."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,453.155,459.87,"Well, Your Honor, first of all, I think the legal standard is that if it has components of both a penal and remedial remedy, it's considered penal."
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,481.64,488.28,"But that's every -- restitution is that way, and you don't think of restitution as punitive."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,488.28,489.18,"I agree, Your Honor."
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,501.54,511.07,"It's a question I'm going to ask your adversary, but what do you see as the difference between -- besides the statute of limitations, what's the difference between restitution and disgorgement?"
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,511.07,517.15,"Well, I think that restitution historically was a judgment requiring money to go to the victim."
2016.16-529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,541.785,560.135,"So if we had that, if we had this working only when the money goes to the victim, the government doesn't get it, would your -- then your statute of limitations argument fail if this is just a remedy for victims?"
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,560.135,562.77,I would probably be making a different argument in that case.
2016.16-529,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,575.4,577.565,What is the private statute of limitations?
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,577.565,584.92,"I -- I think it would be the two years and then five-year statute of repose, but I'm -- I'm not certain of that, but I think that that's probably what it would be."
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,598.465,599.865,What's the name of that case?
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,599.865,600.66,Rind.
2016.16-529,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,626.47,635.46,"Well, this case puts us in a rather strange position, because we have to decide whether this is a penalty or a forfeiture."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,668.175,670.8,I think that -- I agree the Court has to decide that question.
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,695.03,697.724,"Well, I don't know why that proves anything."
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,705.395,709.365,"I don't know what I was buying, but I bought something."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,716.215,720.39,"Well, but that -- what -- the example I gave is beyond cases where you just direct the money."
2016.16-529,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,745.88,762.225,"Well, why don't we take it as we find it in this particular case? So is there any difficulty in identifying the victims in this particular case and ensuring that the money that was misappropriated from them by your client goes to them and not into the government's coffers?"
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,762.225,767.0,"So I believe on the -- on the facts of this case, the disgorgement is a penalty as well as a forfeiture."
2016.16-529,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,784.24,789.97,"But, again, we don't know. How do we know that the government has the authority to direct it wherever it wants?"
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,789.97,794.41,That's the authority the government's been asserting for several decades that the lower courts have been asserting.
2016.16-529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,794.61,799.585,"I thought -- I thought the government's position was that they must give it to the victim, if feasible."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,799.585,800.05,Well --
2016.16-529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,800.05,802.475,It may or may not be possible to find the victims.
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,813.555,815.86,That is absolutely not the government's position.
2016.16-529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,841.65,850.665,"Well, we'll ask the government what their position is, whether it's totally in their discretion whether they want to give this to victims or keep it all."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,850.665,856.63,"I -- I should add, there's the -- there are certain Fair Fund rules that require, not in -- it's not applicable to -- necessarily to this case."
2016.16-529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,880.59,898.415,"The case is presented to us as if disgorgement is this category we must adopt. And correct me if it's mistaken, but it seems to me that the parties seem to order -- argue a categorical rule. It's always a penalty or it's always not a penalty."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,909.555,910.04,Yeah.
2016.16-529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,921.49,923.21,But it's not a statutory term.
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,923.21,935.34,"Well, that is true, but I -- I think that there are problems within a particular case, looking how monies are directed. But I just want to step back and say that our position is, even just looking at the facts of this case, this disgorgement is both a forfeiture and a penalty."
2016.16-529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,935.34,936.295,Because?
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,936.295,942.11,It's a forfeiture because it's an order requiring Petitioner to turn over his money as a result of wrongdoing.
2016.16-529,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1078.42,1090.875,"But that -- but that might suggest something along the lines of what Justice Ginsburg suggested, that if the government, in fact, puts this money into the hands of victims, then it is compensatory; whereas if the government keeps it, it's not."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1094.23,1101.735,"So I think that the government takes this money in the first instance, and I don't think that the way the government happens to distribute the money should affect the statute of limitations."
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1108.69,1112.11,"It gets more complicated than that, because the money goes to the court --"
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1112.11,1112.51,Yes.
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1112.51,1118.16,"-- according to the government, and it's the court that decides how the money will be paid out, correct?"
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1118.16,1126.55,"So this -- it depends. There's -- there's one statute on Fair Funds, and in some cases, you have disgorgements that go into there, and there's a Sarbanes-Oxley statute that directs the SEC to distribute that."
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1126.55,1137.22,"And then the question becomes what you answered earlier, which is, if it's being paid to the victim, is it really restitution as opposed to disgorgement."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1142.8,1143.17,Right.
2016.16-529,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1216.79,1229.16,"Well, the same thing is true in the criminal context, right? I mean, we have criminal forfeitures where the money goes to the government and sometimes it's distributed to victims, but we don't doubt that those are penal in nature."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1229.16,1230.64,"I -- I agree, Justice Gorsuch."
2016.16-529,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1260.59,1266.405,So does everything turn on whether the government labels a -- a particular disgorgement civil versus criminal?
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1266.405,1267.27,"No, Your Honor."
2016.16-529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1296.825,1307.855,Could Congress pass a statute giving the SEC the authority to bring these actions for however long a period Congress chooses?
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1307.855,1308.55,Yes.
2016.16-529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1445.91,1462.74,"I thought the government took the position that you could deduct expenses, if the measure of what is turned over is the ill-gotten gains, then money made to reduce those costs incurred in -- in making those gains, should be deducted."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1470.04,1483.96,"I think the government's position -- and they can clarify if this is incorrect -- is that disgorgement, such as this disgorgement, is a penalty for his taxes but is not a penalty for Section 2462 purposes, simultaneously. And it's also true for bankruptcy law."
2016.16-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1521.785,1522.805,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.16-529,0,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,1522.805,1528.83,Thank you.
2016.16-529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1528.83,1531.275,Ms. Goldenberg.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1531.275,1543.545,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For almost 50 years, courts have been ordering disgorgement in SEC enforcement actions to remedy unjust enrichment and put a defendant in the position he would have been in if he hadn't violated the law."
2016.16-529,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1553.59,1568.895,"Ms. Goldenberg, in those 50 years, has -- has the SEC or has the Justice Department ever set down in writing what the guidelines are for how the SEC is going to use disgorgement and what's going to happen to the monies collected?"
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1568.895,1577.77,I'm not aware that it has. It's -- the SEC's policy -- it's been stated in various court decisions -- to ask the court to distribute the money wherever that is feasible.
2016.16-529,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1588.16,1607.39,I must say I find it unusual that the SEC has not given some guidance to its enforcement department or -- or that the Department of Justice hasn't become involved in some way; that -- that everything is just sort of up to the particular person at the SEC who decides to bring such a case.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1607.39,1610.06,"Well, as I say, I think it's not up to the particular person at the SEC."
2016.16-529,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1627.77,1634.085,Can -- can you give us any indication -- can you give us any indication as in what percentage of the cases the funds go to the victims?
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1634.085,1635.1,"I can, Your Honor."
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1683.845,1702.67,"One reason we have this problem is that the SEC devised this remedy or relied on this remedy without any support from Congress. If Congress had provided, here's a disgorgement remedy, you would expect them, as they typically do, to say, here's a statute of limitations that goes with it."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1741.05,1741.64,No.
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1749.37,1750.79,"Well, it's a little circular, yeah."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1750.79,1753.045,"Well, the reasons we do a disgorgement isn't a penalty."
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1790.71,1791.48,"Well, they're sort of backing --"
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1791.48,1794.62,"-- is something that courts order, and that Congress approves of that."
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1795.07,1796.67,They're -- they're sort of backing and filling.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1813.25,1820.84,"Well, again, I think the remedy is the equitable remedy that Congress did specify when it gave that authorization to courts."
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1843.09,1844.69,Let's look at each category.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1844.69,1845.075,I'm sorry.
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1845.075,1862.72,"My question, what's worrying me -- I'd like to know your answer to which you have -- look, a city, to use a slightly farfetched example, imposes a tax on houses and boats."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1908.34,1919.405,"Both fines -- excuse me -- and forfeitures, in our view, are -- as used in this statute, so looking at what Congress would have intended when it enacted it in 1839 -- are punishments."
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1934.96,1935.85,Those are the two.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1935.85,1938.19,"And -- well, those are the things I think that distinguish it, and --"
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1938.19,1939.73,"Well, those are the things that distinguish it."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1939.73,1939.82,Yes.
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1939.82,1941.565,"Now, let's look at those. Punishment."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1970.39,1970.76,"Well, I --"
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1970.76,1972.265,-- from a serious punishment.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1972.265,1975.31,"I think that -- I mean, I think that's certainly true of depriving someone --"
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1975.31,1975.51,Yes.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1976.26,1978.37,"-- of their liberty which they're entitled to, but -- I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1978.37,1978.71,"No, no."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1980.31,1983.94,But disgorgement -- thank you -- disgorgement doesn't do that.
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1989.38,1989.66,Yes.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1989.84,1990.78,-- money that the defendant stole.
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1990.78,1997.35,"-- disgorgement might not. A punishment, you say, does take something away from you that you're rightfully entitled to."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1997.35,1998.29,"Often does, yes."
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1998.29,2000.025,"Yes, often does."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2002.69,2003.955,It can.
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2006.17,2013.15,And here -- here you take away things only that the person was not rightfully entitled to.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2013.15,2013.78,That's correct.
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2013.78,2014.72,That's a difference.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2014.72,2015.04,Yes.
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2015.04,2015.18,Okay.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2017.3,2021.47,"Well, I think they're all along the same lines, which is that this is analogous to restitution."
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2025.54,2043.395,"A thing -- neither a fine, nor a punishment -- I'm not being facetious, I'm -- I'm trying to get it in my mind. Neither a fine, nor a punishment takes from someone a thing that he was not rightfully entitled to."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2043.395,2043.97,Well --
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2043.97,2049.71,But disgorgement takes from the person a thing that he -- no.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2050.59,2050.85,Yes.
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2053.22,2063.28,"It takes away from a person something that otherwise he would be rightfully entitled to, and disgorgement takes away from a thing he would not be rightfully entitled to."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2063.28,2064.13,And I think maybe another --
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2064.13,2065.04,Have I got it now?
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2065.04,2065.31,"Yes, you do."
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2067.8,2067.93,Okay.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2067.93,2075.37,"-- fines, penalties, forfeitures, even damages, can put the defendant in a worse position than the defendant would have been in --"
2016.16-529,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2075.37,2075.69,But is it --
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2075.69,2076.57,-- if he had never --
2016.16-529,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2076.57,2081.4,-- kind of an unreality to that argument because here there was a fine.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2103.915,2104.52,$35 million.
2016.16-529,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2104.52,2105.95,$35 million.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2109.25,2113.505,"It is, and that's because the penalty was time limited under this Court's decision in Gabelli."
2016.16-529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2123.13,2123.26,Right.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2123.33,2125.315,And I think that's something that's really critical.
2016.16-529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2125.93,2129.205,So what is the difference from restitution?
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2129.205,2130.06,"Well, I think --"
2016.16-529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2130.06,2131.74,Why isn't this restitution?
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2131.74,2133.71,I think there's an analogy to restitution.
2016.16-529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2143.98,2147.515,"So if this is the houseboat, why don't we call this restitution?"
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2147.515,2153.715,"Well, it's not restitution in full, because restitution goes back to the harmed parties."
2016.16-529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2164.85,2174.6,"Now, in forfeiture, you're tracing in some metaphysical way a pot that has been wrongfully taken."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2174.6,2175.245,Yes.
2016.16-529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2175.245,2187.065,"And you are in traditional forfeiture saying, give back that pot. In this situation, we're not asking for that pot."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2234.61,2235.1,Well --
2016.16-529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2235.1,2238.105,I think making someone whole is a forfeiture.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2240.725,2245.63,"Well, that kind of forfeiture, the proceeds forfeiture, didn't come into the law until much, much later."
2016.16-529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2245.63,2246.27,Doesn't matter.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2246.75,2246.9,But --
2016.16-529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2246.9,2247.13,-- is --
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2247.13,2247.48,Understood.
2016.16-529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2247.48,2252.755,"-- if it looks like a forfeiture, why don't we treat it like a forfeiture?"
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2252.755,2256.22,"Well, as I say, I would like to talk about your -- your tracing point."
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2272.07,2272.4,Was there --
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2272.4,2274.51,"With respect to your tracing question, though --"
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2274.51,2275.46,All right.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2276.115,2276.805,Okay.
2016.16-529,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2304.78,2307.015,But it's -- it's not clear to me that you have limits.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2326.875,2329.14,"Well, I think our position is that it depends."
2016.16-529,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2329.71,2330.0,Pardon me?
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2330.0,2330.87,It depends.
2016.16-529,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2344.06,2345.54,Would you call that disgorgement?
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2345.54,2349.12,"It can be called disgorgement, but disgorgement doesn't inevitably extend to that."
2016.16-529,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2353.43,2360.61,"But in -- in my hypothetical, would you take the position that the statute of limitations does apply? 100 from one, 90 from the other."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2361.53,2370.01,"I -- I don't -- I'm not sure that disgorgement would ever work that way, actually, because there are deductions when money has been recovered."
2016.16-529,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2375.06,2375.17,My --
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2375.17,2376.28,I think I might have misunderstood the question.
2016.16-529,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2376.28,2380.32,"My understanding is that A is liable for the full 100 -- $100,000."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2380.32,2380.7,Right.
2016.16-529,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2385.66,2385.92,I agree.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2385.92,2398.34,Our position is that the Court should decide whether the disgorgement in this case falls within the scope of Section 2462 and leave for another day the question of whether disgorgement extends to situations like that.
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2406.9,2407.13,What about --
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2407.13,2408.56,-- sometime in the future and the Court would disagree.
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2408.56,2414.33,What about the many cases your client has filed in the lower courts taking the opposite position?
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2414.33,2417.81,I'm not sure that we have taken the opposite position on anything.
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2417.81,2417.91,Well --
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2417.91,2419.61,We've certainly taken the position consistently that --
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2419.61,2421.33,"Well, you've argued that you --"
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2421.33,2434.475,You've argued that disgorgement -- that they're not entitled to equitable -- I don't remember if it's tolling or not because disgorgement is -- is punitive?
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2434.475,2435.12,No --
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2435.12,2437.03,Not entitled to deductions?
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2437.03,2437.535,The brief --
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2437.535,2439.74,-- the briefs that were cited in your friend's reply --
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2439.74,2441.86,Are you talking about the tax in the bankruptcy --
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2441.86,2442.67,Yeah.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2442.67,2445.1,-- situations? Those involve different statutes.
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2446.26,2446.33,No.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2447.09,2447.65,-- positions on 2462.
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2447.65,2453.72,"Well, you haven't taken the same -- different positions under the same statute, but we're talking about disgorgement in each case."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2482.905,2483.78,"No, Your Honor."
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2499.17,2500.01,In the SEC context?
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2500.01,2500.34,I'm sorry.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2500.66,2501.72,-- in the IRS context.
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2502.37,2502.605,Yes.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2502.605,2514.93,"Sometimes can be considered a fine under tax law, and sometimes isn't considered a fine under tax law in situations, for instance, in which the money goes back to the injured investors. And so we think that it's perfectly --"
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2514.93,2518.7,"So not only is it one thing in one context, but something else in the other context."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2522.43,2534.26,"Well, we think it's legitimate to have different interpretations of different statutes that have different language, different purposes, different tools of statutory interpretation, so different legislative history, different provisions that surround them. The way this Court --"
2016.16-529,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2534.26,2534.47,But you --
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2534.47,2535.11,-- decides the case may be --
2016.16-529,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2535.11,2537.64,But you -- you have argued for a categorical rule.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2545.73,2547.49,We are arguing with respect to this statute --
2016.16-529,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2547.49,2549.72,"Your answers to the questions, you're saying, well, it depends."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2549.72,2550.37,"No, no, Your Honor."
2016.16-529,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2574.43,2574.66,-- because the --
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2574.66,2576.68,-- government may adjust its positions accordingly.
2016.16-529,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2576.68,2591.285,What is your answer to the -- to the deduction there? Your friend said that the government takes the position that you have to turn over everything that you got and you can't have any deduction for what it cost to -- to produce that.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2591.285,2593.8,For whether expenses can be deducted?
2016.16-529,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2593.8,2594.28,Yes.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2594.28,2598.04,"Again, I think this is an issue of the scope of disgorgement that's not before the Court now."
2016.16-529,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2632.37,2649.09,"Ms. Goldenberg, when we get to the criminal context, this very same remedy of disgorgement of everything is often called a forfeiture, and it is a penalty; right? So why does it make a difference that we just happen to be in the civil context?"
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2649.09,2654.94,"Well, there are forfeitures and there is restitution in the criminal context. That's certainly true."
2016.16-529,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2654.94,2655.74,The very same remedy.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2655.74,2657.94,"In circumstances -- well, I don't think it's exactly the same."
2016.16-529,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2667.44,2667.53,Right.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2667.53,2668.57,But what I think makes a difference --
2016.16-529,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2668.57,2671.75,"So why does the form, whether this is civil versus criminal, make all the difference?"
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2671.75,2672.7,"Well, this Court's decision --"
2016.16-529,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2672.7,2678.84,"And how do we ever know? I mean, goodness gracious, the difference between civil and criminal has vexed this Court for many years."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2678.84,2688.81,"This Court's decision in Kelly, I think, points out that the criminal context really is somewhat different, and that this Court's decision in Pasquantino, I think, suggests that the same thing is true."
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2691.51,2696.42,"Wait, let's be more specific about the question that Justice Gorsuch is asking."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2741.265,2742.47,"Well, I think that --"
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2742.47,2743.6,You said it was a fine.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2743.6,2744.35,"Yes, that would be --"
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2744.35,2745.375,That would be a fine.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2745.375,2746.07,You could do something --
2016.16-529,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2746.07,2748.5,And I think that's the question that's being asked.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2765.15,2768.815,"Well, just to be clear, I think what you're talking about now is proceeds forfeiture."
2016.16-529,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2784.53,2787.525,And sometimes the money goes to the victim and sometimes it doesn't.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2788.585,2793.2,"Well, as I say, that's in the government's discretion, and that is not like here. Here, it's --"
2016.16-529,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2793.2,2795.62,"Well, here we don't know, because there's no statute governing it."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2796.89,2798.14,"Well, I wouldn't say that, Your Honor."
2016.16-529,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2802.32,2802.96,Not in this Court.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2802.96,2811.575,"-- is clear. It's true that this Court doesn't have precedent about disgorgement in the SEC context, but as I pointed out earlier, the Court does have precedent in other contexts --"
2016.16-529,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2811.575,2816.55,"Are there any time -- are there any time limits, and if so, where do they come from?"
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2816.55,2831.38,"The courts that have ruled that there's no statute of limitations for disgorgement have said that the district court can take into account, as part of this exercise of equitable discretion that I'm describing, the passage of time, and how much time has passed and -- in deciding whether to order disgorgement."
2016.16-529,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2832.33,2845.13,"Well, I -- the courts say that, but where -- what is the basis for it? Is this by analogy to some traditional equitable remedy? Where -- where does that come from? Is it like laches? But laches, you say, doesn't apply to the government?"
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2845.13,2847.18,"That's true, laches doesn't apply to the government."
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2868.68,2874.545,"But that's only with respect to -- that's only with respect to the amount of the remedy, not with respect to liability."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2887.86,2889.11,"Yes, that's true."
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2898.96,2906.25,"Well, if we -- if we think that's inappropriate and bad, we're not going to come out the other way because we trust the government not to bring an action like that."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2906.25,2908.0,I'm not suggesting that Your Honor should trust the government.
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2913.25,2916.14,"No, no, this has changed a lot after the Gabelli decision."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,2936.37,2941.49,"I understand, Your Honor, but Gabelli is actually an incentive for the SEC to move faster, so that it gets the civil penalties."
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3006.86,3015.975,"If -- if the -- if it's beyond the statutory limitation, I suspect that an injunction would be kind of irrelevant unless the conduct has continued that long."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3015.975,3030.84,"Well, it's true that in that such circumstance, you would show that there was some danger of bad conduct in the future, but you would use the existence of the bad conduct in the past as part of that evidence. So I think that there is not a danger that -- that things are going to go awry here."
2016.16-529,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3053.41,3061.4,"We don't apply the canon in criminal cases, so why should we apply it in a case where the penalty is identical to what might be a criminal penalty?"
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3061.4,3067.325,"Well, it's true that it's not applied in criminal cases, where there are other canons that are at play, like the canon --"
2016.16-529,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3067.325,3067.64,Like lenity.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3067.64,3068.34,"Well, right."
2016.16-529,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3079.785,3089.05,"Do you agree or disagree -- I'm a little -- left a little bit unclear. Mr. Unikowsky's standard is that if something is not solely remedial, then it's a penalty."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3089.99,3095.005,"I don't disagree that if something has a punitive aspect, then it can be a punishment."
2016.16-529,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3095.005,3097.39,And you disagree with any punitive aspect.
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3097.39,3097.56,Well --
2016.16-529,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3097.56,3100.775,"So if something is not solely remedial, it is a penalty."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3100.775,3125.4,"I disagree with the principle that just because something has some deterrent effect or deterrent purpose, that that makes it a punishment, and that's a proposition that this Court has rejected a number of times, in its decision in Hudson, in its decision in Smith v. Doe, which is an ex post facto case, and it has overruled a decision on that -- some of the decisions that Petitioner cites' relied on. So the mere fact that something is deterrent isn't enough to make it punitive."
2016.16-529,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3129.12,3141.27,"Because I look at this and -- and it seems to be a commonsensical kind of way of looking at the way this remedy works, the way the SEC has used it, is that it's trying to do a lot of things. It's trying to compensate."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3161.25,3168.24,"Well -- excuse me -- I disagree that disgorgement is in any way intended to punish, for the reasons that I was explaining to Justice Breyer."
2016.16-529,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3168.24,3171.96,"Yeah, but I guess -- I guess when I said ""punish,"" I don't mean to make that sound as a conclusion."
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3181.475,3187.575,"It is, but that's because that's the conduct that gave rise to the unjust enrichment that needs to be remedied."
2016.16-529,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3269.92,3271.82,Narrow -- narrow construction of what?
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3271.82,3283.97,"Narrow construction of Section 2462, to say that the words ""penalty"" and ""forfeiture"" should be understood narrowly, rather than as Petitioner would have it, extremely broadly to cover, basically, any payment that ever goes to the government in any way."
2016.16-529,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3330.48,3333.835,"Just -- just out of curiosity, when -- I'm sorry."
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3333.835,3334.66,"No, please."
2016.16-529,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3334.66,3345.74,"When -- when the SEC uses this, is it usually going after continuing misconduct, or does it sometimes really reach back into the past for completed conduct?"
2016.16-529,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3345.74,3348.57,It's usually relating to continuing misconduct.
2016.16-529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3363.074,3367.52,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Unikowsky, five minutes."
2016.16-529,2,62644,adam_g_unikowsky,,3367.52,3369.94,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.16-529,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3661.07,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
