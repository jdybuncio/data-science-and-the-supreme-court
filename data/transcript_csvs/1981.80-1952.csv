1981.80-1952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.371,"We will hear arguments first in Barbara Plum, Commissioner of New York State Department of Social Services, v. Yaretsky."
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,16.026,19.009,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1981.80-1952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,194.905,201.247,How much time do these physicians spend in this process as compared with the time they spend taking care of the patients?
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,201.247,221.318,"Well, Your Honor, if you look at 42 CFR 456.330 following which describes these various utilization review procedures in quite tedious detail, I think you would have to conclude that he spends a great deal of time."
1981.80-1952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,264.863,269.219,But there was a case or controversy of some kind at the time the case began?
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,269.219,270.281,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,273.045,276.748,About some other kinds of movements.
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,276.748,277.123,--Exactly.
1981.80-1952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,295.693,297.24,And that dispute was settled?
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,297.24,320.746,"--That dispute was the initial predicate in this case, it was initially decided by a preliminary injunction back in January of 1978, it went up to the court of appeals in the first court of appeals in this case and it was ultimately resolved as you indicate on October 17, 1979 by the first partial final judgment in this case, which was entered--"
1981.80-1952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,320.746,322.653,In the district court?
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,322.653,325.729,"--Yes, it was resolved in the district court."
1981.80-1952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,325.729,326.962,Then why didn't the case end there?
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,326.962,329.68,"That is exactly my question, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,329.68,331.242,Did you ask the court to end it then?
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,331.242,332.008,Pardon me?
1981.80-1952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,332.008,334.648,Did you ask the court to end the case then?
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,334.648,336.6,"No, Your Honor, the assistants then--"
1981.80-1952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,336.6,339.036,And you went right ahead and litigated these other issues?
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,339.036,340.036,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,348.266,352.375,And you are raising a case or controversy here for the first time?
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,352.375,353.31,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,353.31,356.919,But you submitted these issues in the court of appeals.
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,363.01,372.023,"The issues, the merits of the issues were indeed litigated without objection in the court of appeals, and I would add one point to that, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,421.051,445.43,"Counsel, if the question were properly before the lower courts, dealing with the transfer to a higher level of care, would New York have stipulated eventually to the procedures for handling them as was done on transfers to lower level of care?"
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,445.43,448.414,"That is a very interesting point, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,574.956,577.595,"All right, so your answer is no from advice of the federal government."
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,577.595,577.861,Right.
1981.80-1952,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,586.514,602.976,"You have, I think, taken the position in your brief that private transfer decisions for patients in nursing homes are medical decisions unaffected by the state."
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,613.346,619.689,"Well, it can be or it cannot be depending on how... what the facts are."
1981.80-1952,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,756.819,760.615,Let me ask you one more question while you are interrupted.
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,772.438,794.413,"The state prescribes the use of what respondents have called and what are, in fact, a DMS-1 form and a DMS-9 form."
1981.80-1952,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,886.422,890.218,Can a patient be transferred who does not meet the state's criteria?
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,890.218,894.607,"Now, respondents say that those forms determine the choice."
1981.80-1952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,947.915,955.582,"Mrs. Gordon, we have granted certiorari on just two questions here, relatively narrow, and about half of your time is gone."
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,955.582,958.393,"--Very well, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,958.8,959.534,If you would focus on those two questions.
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,959.534,988.367,"--I would just like to point out one other factor with respect to the DMS-1 forms because in the entire array of federal and state laws which the respondents bring to bear on their argument... which is not the court of appeals' argument... that state action is somehow found in these transfers because the state forces them, the only point that needs clarification is, in fact, the use of these DMS-1 forms."
1981.80-1952,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1322.716,1326.308,"Well, do they purport to be transfers of named parties to the action?"
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1326.308,1336.381,"Two of the letters, Your Honor, dated December 18th, 1980, are to nursing homes and do identify two individuals."
1981.80-1952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1419.441,1442.714,"Before you get too deeply in the state action argument because it is hard for me to keep these proceedings clearly in mind, in the prior proceeding that is not now before us which involved, as I understand, downward decisions by a URC and which might result I guess in the discharge of a patient from a nursing home, was it decided that there was state action involved there?"
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1442.714,1443.307,"--No, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1460.332,1463.19,"In other words, the hearing requirement was imposed by federal regulation."
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1463.19,1463.378,--Exactly.
1981.80-1952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.321,1487.851,Now may I ask just one more question.
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1507.469,1514.996,Those are the same regulations which the federal government told us to apply in the downward URC transfers.
1981.80-1952,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1582.312,1599.79,"Let me just get this one question out and then I will... why, if there is a URC decision to increase the level of care which would require moving patient from one place to another and which might give rise to this phenomenon of transfer trauma, why wouldn't the regulation apply to that?"
1981.80-1952,0,30409,judith_a_gordon,,1604.368,1614.768,"--As the federal government used the regulations, a transfer to a higher level of care normally results in an increase in assistance, all right, not a reduction or termination of assistance."
1981.80-1952,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1701.0,1707.529,Mr. Kirklin?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,1707.529,1710.793,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1981.80-1952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1788.324,1794.743,What are the sanctions which the state attaches to a violation of what you describe as its command?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,1794.743,1812.207,"Your Honor, the penalties that can ensue if a facility fails to promptly discharge a Medicaid patient are retroactive denial of reimbursement for services rendered, fines and suspension from the Medicaid program itself."
1981.80-1952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1812.207,1821.513,"But it is not a question of a public health type of regulation where they would shut down the facility if they failed to comply, I take it."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,1825.887,1830.947,I imagine that might be the case.
1981.80-1952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1837.804,1845.598,But I take it the nursing home is perfectly free to say we will go without the money and operate as we choose.
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,1845.598,1851.299,"Well, Your Honor, we assume that nursing homes, like everybody else, will comply with the law."
1981.80-1952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1851.299,1869.198,"So supposing that the state of New York is contracted for the production of 20,000 envelopes or something like that with a contract, and it has certain sanctions attaching to the contractor's failing to comply with certain production regulations."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,1878.459,1881.553,"Let me distinguish two situations, it might be helpful."
1981.80-1952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1951.29,1961.27,"And the sanction is not that the facility becomes unlicensed or goes to jail, but simply that money is cut off which it otherwise would have received."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,1961.27,1962.582,"More than that, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1987.118,1988.478,What is the fine?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,1988.478,1995.382,"The fines I believe, Your Honor, can be up to $1000 a day for violations."
1981.80-1952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1995.382,1999.27,"So it does have some aspects of a public health regulation, then?"
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,1999.27,2002.691,To that extent I guess it does.
1981.80-1952,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2009.251,2015.967,"Do those sanctions apply, counsel, to a failure to move the patient up to a higher, more expensive level of care?"
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2015.967,2016.872,"--That is right, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.166,2071.319,"Well, you still have the problem of the fact that the decision to transfer is not the state's, at least in the first instance."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2071.319,2076.239,"In some sense, it is the state's, Your Honor, for this reason."
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.465,2100.776,"Right, so that the standard is applied by the state."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2100.776,2103.118,That is right.
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2103.118,2115.676,"But the decision is made not by a state official but by a private party, and you have to, nevertheless, say that that private action is state action."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2115.676,2116.067,"That is right, Your Honor, and we--"
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2116.067,2117.785,And what is your bridge?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2119.081,2133.092,"--The bridge, Your Honor, is the argument that when the state puts its weight on the side of private conduct, even if that initiative comes from a private party, by ordering it, by compelling it, by directing it--"
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.092,2134.762,Compelling what?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2134.762,2136.027,--Compelling the facility--
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.027,2137.558,They compel the decision to be made.
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2137.558,2139.276,--More than that.
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.276,2141.587,Then they provide the standards.
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2141.587,2143.18,More than that.
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2150.521,2148.366,Not until the decision is made.
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2157.362,2165.609,Respondents contend that where... even if the initiative came from a private party--
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.609,2166.343,Initiative?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2171.263,2178.042,"--The decision, the standard is whether the person needs that level of care."
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.947,2180.65,That is the decision I am talking about.
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2183.523,2193.768,"--We submit that when the state enforces that result by requiring the facility to kick the patient out, the state is involved."
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2210.903,2225.849,So you say the enforcement mechanism is the... involves the state sufficiently to be blamed for the decision to transfer or to... to some other facility.
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2225.849,2229.442,--That is our primary argument; that when the state directs--
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.442,2232.784,"May I just inquire, is this argument limited to nursing homes?"
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2251.011,2256.447,--I think it is true that there are similar requirements for Medicaid patients.
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2256.447,2262.835,"--Would those decisions then by the doctor to say well, you are well enough to go home be a state decision, under your analysis?"
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2262.835,2264.755,Yes.
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2266.677,2275.079,Or say they had a state law that said don't prescribe a certain drug unless certain symptoms are present... don't give him too much aspirin.
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2279.673,2287.324,"--Again, Your Honor, the difference there is that the state does not tell a doctor, you cannot provide care that you think is required."
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.805,2300.553,"Well, in my hypothetical I was assuming it was a firm requirement of law."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2310.894,2313.767,"--No, it would not, because we maintain there is a difference--"
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2313.767,2314.736,--And what is the difference?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2314.736,2332.043,"--The difference is this: that if the state merely said in this case to a nursing facility, you ought not to provide inappropriate care, with the consequences that might follow, that if they did so they might not be paid, we do not insist that that is state action."
1981.80-1952,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2351.112,2352.83,"Well, Mr. Kirklin, that is the point."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2363.092,2365.387,"--It is not just that issue, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2365.387,2378.898,"As I read the briefs, the questions that we have here involved only the questions of transfers to higher levels of care, and secondly, whether there was an Article III standing problem."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2439.811,2444.059,"Your Honor, let me explain what happened below."
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.045,2600.589,But Mrs. Gordon informed us... and maybe I misunderstood her... that the injunction prohibited the nursing homes from doing Just that.
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2603.542,2607.071,--That is not a correct statement of the situation.
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.517,2630.701,"But they were no longer required to because they were freed of the compulsion, as I understood it, of the URC determination."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2632.279,2638.886,--They were free of the obligation... when the state adopts the URC's--
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2638.886,2644.869,"In other words, to put it differently, weren't they free to say we are going to keep this patient here and there is nothing the state can do to us if we do."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2644.869,2645.557,--No.
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2645.557,2646.274,They were not?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2646.274,2648.992,They were not.
1981.80-1952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2714.215,2716.261,What is the prohibitant from doing it right now?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2716.261,2727.162,"--What prohibits them now, Your Honor, is the deterrent effect of a hearing at which these plaintiffs would test the validity of--"
1981.80-1952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2727.162,2728.053,What kind of a hearing?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2728.865,2740.643,"--What the district court required after finding that there was state action and due process protection was that the state had to provide a hearing forum in which the plaintiffs, the named plaintiffs--"
1981.80-1952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2740.643,2750.2,The state had to provide a hearing forum to decide as to whether a private hospital could change its status of a patient?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2750.2,2764.913,"--To decide whether the decision upon which the facility based its transfer was, under federal and state law, correct."
1981.80-1952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2770.332,2779.579,"What federal law says that in this case, in this posture, with this injunction, cannot do it?"
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2792.621,2805.038,"--Well, Your Honor, that is the traditional barrier that is imposed by the law in the context of a review committee determination."
1981.80-1952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2805.038,2807.116,I am talking about federal law now.
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2807.116,2810.942,"Federal law requires it there, for example, if doctors--"
1981.80-1952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2810.942,2813.831,What federal law requires a private hospital to give a hearing?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2813.831,2834.338,"--The regulations... the federal regulations that Ms. Gordon discussed that state when a review committee determines a patient should be moved and that there is a Medicaid adjustment at issue, the state has to provide a so-called fair hearing."
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.338,2838.118,"Well, this was not the court of appeals' decision."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2849.614,2852.036,"Well, we maintain that it does, of course."
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2852.036,2854.737,"But you say, you now say it is the federal regulation."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2854.737,2855.47,We say both.
1981.80-1952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2858.875,2861.608,"You were trying to get a private hospital, under the Fourteenth Amendment."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2864.17,2867.747,"--Well, we are trying to do that because this case is unique."
1981.80-1952,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2867.747,2870.279,It sure is.
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2875.808,2878.307,That is correct.
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2878.307,2881.305,Did you talk about the regulations before the court of appeals?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2881.305,2882.524,"Yes, we did."
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2882.524,2887.505,And they... did they reject your view of the regulations?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2887.505,2888.503,They did not reach that issue.
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.503,2889.722,How do you know they didn't?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2891.58,2893.299,"That is true, they did not write about it."
1981.80-1952,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2893.299,2909.621,"V-11, if they were construing... deciding the case in an orthodox manner, if they reached the constitutional question they must have rejected your claim under the regulations because presumably, they do not reach a constitutional question if there is a statutory or a regulation way of disposing of the case."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2909.621,2910.808,I guess that is true.
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2912.026,2914.948,So they rejected your regulatory submission?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2914.948,2918.259,"--Impliedly, as Justice Rehnquist characterized it--"
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2918.259,2919.93,Was it briefed in the court of appeals?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2919.93,2920.227,"--Yes, Your Honor, it was."
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2920.227,2920.944,On both sides?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2920.944,2921.851,Yes.
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2921.851,2929.223,Was the department... did the federal people take any position on the matter as amicus?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2929.223,2931.955,"Not officially before the court, no."
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2931.955,2933.705,How did they construe their own regulations?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2940.11,2945.577,"There is nothing officially in the record about AHS's position, but--"
1981.80-1952,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2945.577,2953.98,"Well, insofar as transfers to higher levels of care are concerned... and I still think that is one of the issues before us, as I understand it."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2953.98,2954.324,"--Yes, it is."
1981.80-1952,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2954.324,2963.147,Is not the federal position that no hearing is required for the transfers to higher levels of care?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2963.147,2963.632,"That is right, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2963.632,2969.942,"You concede that, so you are not here making that argument to us, that it is required by federal regulation."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2969.942,2975.19,I am not here making the argument that federal and state fair hearing regulations apply to transfers up.
1981.80-1952,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2975.19,2975.565,Okay.
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2978.782,2980.124,That is right.
1981.80-1952,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2990.73,2998.554,And you and the petitioners differ on whether the consent decree covers those transfers to a lower level or out--
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,2998.554,3001.069,--We do not disagree about that at all.
1981.80-1952,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3017.327,3031.682,"--And you did argue below only on the basis of the reduction in financial benefits as the basis for holding that there was state action, is that right?"
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3031.682,3032.618,"No, we did not, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3042.613,3054.672,"You do not... I take it your submission here on the state action is not... certainly is not in defense of the court of appeals' rationale, is it?"
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3054.672,3065.308,"--We do not retreat from the court of appeals' rationale, but we believe that there is a simpler method of disposing of the state action question which is that--"
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3065.308,3067.636,The state enforces a decision.
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3067.636,3069.775,"--Requires it, orders it, that is right."
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3069.775,3092.828,"So wouldn't you say the same thing then if there was a general state law about trespass or something, and the home decides to move a patient and the patient refuses to go, so the court... so the home goes to court and gets an order, just for self-protection gets an order to move the person out."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3097.029,3098.935,"Well, no."
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3112.227,3121.269,"Well, but the trespass action would not give any hearing on the validity of the private decision; it would just say are you here without consent."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3121.269,3133.623,"--Well, the question, Your Honor, in this context is that again, if the federal and state regulations themselves say that a facility cannot move a person unless for valid medical reasons--"
1981.80-1952,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3133.623,3137.873,"Well, the general law says a person cannot stay on somebody else's property without consent."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3140.653,3162.752,"--Here it is a question of... Your Honor, we think that, for example, in the Moose Lodge case where this Court had not trouble saying that if the state liquor control board has a regulation that says we are going to enforce a bylaw of a private club, even though it is neutral in its terms, that is state action."
1981.80-1952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3179.075,3182.715,"Or to raise the standards, you said before."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3189.07,3200.471,"We maintain that we do, that it is required because there are due process protected interests there as well because the reg is again saying even if--"
1981.80-1952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3200.471,3210.561,"On that theory you would be saying that under Goldberg against Kelly, if some welfare director wants to increase the welfare payments to a recipient they would have to have a hearing, a Goldberg v. Kelly hearing."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3210.561,3219.793,"--No, we would not because there is no property interest under law that protects someone against getting more benefits."
1981.80-1952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3227.805,3233.506,What is the property interest if the transfer is to a higher level of care?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3233.506,3242.658,"Your Honor, the federal and state regulations state that a nursing facility may not transfer or discharge... that is the language--"
1981.80-1952,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3242.658,3245.861,"Well, I am asking you what the property interest is."
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3251.25,3265.494,--The property interest is the interest which is embedded in positive state and federal law that says that you should be free of having to move to a higher level of care unless there is good reason to do it.
1981.80-1952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3281.706,3285.283,How do we know that that makes them think they are dying?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3289.188,3292.061,--Not to that precise effect.
1981.80-1952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3318.426,3322.238,Do you think there is no trauma involved in an adversary hearing?
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3322.238,3343.432,"There is, of course, trauma involved, but we do not maintain that a finding of transfer trauma is necessary for the... on the narrow issues that, as Your Honor pointed out, are before the Court, which is whether there is state action, and on the standing issue as well, that this Court did not take the questions of whether there are protected property or liberty interests involved."
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3345.447,3356.443,"Well, how can the hearing... the Chief Justice's question makes me wonder, her could the pre-transfer hearing provide protection against this concern you expressed about the consequences of a transfer to a higher level?"
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3364.408,3366.048,"Because that is not the only issue, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3366.048,3367.063,But that would be in part.
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3372.17,3373.717,That would be part of the issue.
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3395.191,3397.941,"Well, is there a case at all like that in this record before us?"
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3397.941,3400.066,--There are--
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3400.066,3407.312,"I can imagine some cases with extreme facts might present a problem, but do we have to decide... is there anything in this record that requires us to decide a case of that kind?"
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3407.312,3409.249,--Of the transfers to a higher level of care?
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3409.249,3409.718,Yes.
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3414.826,3435.114,"The evidence that we have here as part of the joint pretrial order is that during the period in which this case was in litigation, and when the state did provide hearings... at one point it did... there were, the defendants state, at least 10 cases of transfers to a higher level of care; five were reversed at hearing."
1981.80-1952,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3435.114,3439.05,"Yes, but are any of those litigants that are involved in this case?"
1981.80-1952,1,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3439.05,3446.265,"Those litigants, those persons, were members of the class; none of them are named plaintiffs in this case."
1981.80-1952,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3537.213,3541.275,"Well, your time has expired, Mr. Kirklin."
1981.80-1952,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3543.834,3546.052,"Yes, Your Honor, I have just a few points."
1981.80-1952,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3546.052,3549.661,"May I ask before you start, are the Grey Panthers parties to this case?"
1981.80-1952,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3549.661,3552.628,"Not so far as I am concerned, Your Honor, because--"
1981.80-1952,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3552.628,3554.441,They are not listed as parties?
1981.80-1952,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3554.441,3564.796,"--They are listed as parties, they were apparently parties in the first half of this case which ended with the consent judgment back in 1979, the October one."
1981.80-1952,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3581.398,3583.554,"Mrs. Gordon, if you will stay on the microphone we will hear you better."
1981.80-1952,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3583.554,3584.161,--I am sorry.
1981.80-1952,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3603.889,3606.511,"Now, rules require that the parties be identified."
1981.80-1952,2,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3610.041,3611.087,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor, I could not hear you."
1981.80-1952,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3611.087,3614.946,Our rules require that parties be identified.
1981.80-1952,3,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3626.769,3629.503,"Yes, Your Honor, they are listed among the parties before this Court."
1981.80-1952,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3629.846,3632.157,"Where, what page?"
1981.80-1952,3,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3632.157,3634.548,"The petition itself,--"
1981.80-1952,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3634.548,3637.282,"That is all right, I do not want to detain you."
1981.80-1952,3,31239,john_e_kirklin,,3637.282,3638.421,--They are definitely listed among the parties.
1981.80-1952,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3638.421,3639.89,"They are, thank you."
1981.80-1952,4,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3639.89,3657.321,"Justice O'Connor, just a point of clarification, it is not only URC transfers to higher levels of care that are in issue in this case; it is also the medical decisions of the outside physician and the nursing home physician that are in issue."
1981.80-1952,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3725.168,3731.212,"Mrs. Gordon, on this matter of the Grey Panthers, this petition is yours, isn't it, the state's?"
1981.80-1952,4,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3731.212,3732.29,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3732.29,3738.99,"And it says Barabara Blum, et cetera, against... and it names a number of people... and the Grey Panthers, New York Chapter."
1981.80-1952,4,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3738.99,3739.661,Yes.
1981.80-1952,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3740.349,3743.472,"You thought... when this was filed you thought they were respondents, didn't you?"
1981.80-1952,4,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3743.472,3743.691,--Yes.
1981.80-1952,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3760.091,3763.418,"Well, the judgment of the court of appeals mentions them."
1981.80-1952,4,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3763.418,3765.308,"--Yes, they are listed--"
1981.80-1952,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3765.308,3766.885,And that is the judgment that is here.
1981.80-1952,4,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3766.885,3767.932,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3767.932,3769.243,"Well, aren't they here?"
1981.80-1952,4,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3769.243,3775.726,"Yes, Your Honor, they are parties here in terms of their technical inclusion in the caption."
1981.80-1952,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3778.568,3782.379,They are here also as technically in the judgment.
1981.80-1952,4,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3782.379,3783.205,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3783.205,3787.111,And that is not quite technical; that is the judgment.
1981.80-1952,4,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3787.111,3788.611,"Yes, Your Honor."
1981.80-1952,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3788.611,3791.985,"You haven't made any objection to that, have you?"
1981.80-1952,4,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3791.985,3798.186,I do not have an objection to their appearing in the caption.
1981.80-1952,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3810.586,3812.273,And where did you raise that objection?
1981.80-1952,4,30409,judith_a_gordon,,3812.695,3813.693,"--As I indicated earlier,--"
1981.80-1952,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3813.693,3814.584,You raised it now.
