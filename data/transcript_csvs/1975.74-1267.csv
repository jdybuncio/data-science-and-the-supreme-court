1975.74-1267,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,28.611,We will hear arguments next in Examining Board of Engineers against De Otero and others.
1975.74-1267,0,36573,miriam_naveira_de_rodon,,30.124,33.358,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1267,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,166.253,171.256,Is there also a question of whether the Fourteenth Amendment applies to Puerto Rico?
1975.74-1267,0,36573,miriam_naveira_de_rodon,,171.256,192.865,"Well, neither this Court nor the Circuit Court nor the District Court has ever found it necessary to determine whether the Due Process of the Fourteenth or the Fifth Amendment is applicable since it found that the fundamental rights of the constitution are applicable to the people of Puerto Rico and we think that that is the best way not to specify."
1975.74-1267,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,192.865,194.555,But you do?
1975.74-1267,0,36573,miriam_naveira_de_rodon,,194.555,194.996,Yes.
1975.74-1267,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,194.996,204.278,You do concede that either the Fourteenth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment is applicable to the people of Puerto Rico and that the net result is the same whichever?
1975.74-1267,0,36573,miriam_naveira_de_rodon,,204.278,204.912,Yes sir.
1975.74-1267,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,204.912,207.416,That is the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?
1975.74-1267,0,36573,miriam_naveira_de_rodon,,207.416,208.108,Yes.
1975.74-1267,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,208.108,214.08,And that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment also embraces the concept of equal protection?
1975.74-1267,0,36573,miriam_naveira_de_rodon,,214.08,216.033,Yes sir.
1975.74-1267,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,245.138,248.493,Is that different then from the 50 States of the Union?
1975.74-1267,0,36573,miriam_naveira_de_rodon,,248.493,261.938,"I believe so sir because in Puerto Rico, the civil rights actions that are being filed are not being filed, let us say like in the prisonerâ€™s cases or in racial discrimination cases or in certain definite type of cases."
1975.74-1267,1,35374,max_ramirez_de_arellano,,1230.304,1233.733,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1267,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1283.266,1287.804,"The need for burden to do with the jurisdiction, is that so?"
1975.74-1267,1,35374,max_ramirez_de_arellano,,1287.804,1290.519,That is true.
1975.74-1267,2,36573,miriam_naveira_de_rodon,,2796.362,2799.78,May it please the Court.
1975.74-1267,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2811.273,2812.858,So which is the corrected copy then?
1975.74-1267,2,36573,miriam_naveira_de_rodon,,2812.858,2820.49,I think it is the gray one because I got the one with the typographical error the white one and I was told that they were going to print it again.
1975.74-1267,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2820.49,2822.282,Thank you very much.
1975.74-1267,2,36573,miriam_naveira_de_rodon,,2822.282,2826.015,I wanted to just to clarify a few points.
1975.74-1267,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2892.33,2895.531,"What about 1331, Federal Questions Jurisdiction?"
1975.74-1267,2,36573,miriam_naveira_de_rodon,,2895.531,2902.998,I think specifically Puerto Rico is mentioning 1331 specifically as applicable and I think is.
