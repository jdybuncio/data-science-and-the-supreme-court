1970.759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,30.83,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 759, United States against Armour."
1970.759,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,36.449,40.14,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,498.393,502.74,Did that -- did that acquisition require approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission?
1970.759,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,502.74,506.418,"Yes, it did Mr. Justice."
1970.759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,602.77,608.807,"You don’t say that they did actually participate with that Armour or anybody else, do you?"
1970.759,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,608.807,625.23,"No Mr. Justice, we are not making the argument in terms of Rule 65 (d) of the Civil Rules that Greyhound is -- has been in active participation in Armour with Armour in doing something in violation of the Decree."
1970.759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,625.23,627.905,"Well, how do you escape that?"
1970.759,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,627.905,631.862,I’m not sure that we might not have charged that.
1970.759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,661.527,665.108,"That’s easier way you’ve done, but then going direct against Greyhound?"
1970.759,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,665.108,672.456,"Yes, and certainly there are I think fewer questions to be argued about in that approach and --"
1970.759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,672.456,672.755,Well --
1970.759,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,672.755,674.562,"-- under that approach and I think it is, as I say, easier on Greyhound."
1970.759,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,674.562,682.118,"I’m sure that’s easier for the Government, but doesn’t make it legal, does it?"
1970.759,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,682.118,693.604,"No Mr. Justice, though I think -- I think it if the Government could precede directly against Greyhound, I think it would follow that it could proceed indirectly in this way."
1970.759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,928.581,935.909,Is this is an auxiliary -- is any part of these activities in auxiliary service to Greyhound’s transportation service?
1970.759,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,937.727,940.727,"I think -- I think, it can be said to some extent of Post Houses --"
1970.759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,940.727,941.413,And Post Houses.
1970.759,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,941.413,944.724,-- which I believe of runs restaurants in bus stations.
1970.759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,954.659,955.711,Pre-prepared meals?
1970.759,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,955.711,956.869,Pre-prepared meals.
1970.759,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,956.869,960.122,Are they sold to airlines or what?
1970.759,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,960.122,962.779,Greyhound’s counsel could tell you a bit more about that.
1970.759,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1422.725,1432.152,"Mr. Springer, what would be the major problems in the Government's Section 7 suit against Armour and Greyhound?"
1970.759,0,33067,james_van_r_springer,,1432.152,1432.266,Oh!
1970.759,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1644.196,1645.975,Thank you Mr. Springer.
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,1650.093,1653.866,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.453,2159.949,"I gather that you think that under this Decree, if Armour went out and was in the process of purchasing the assets of a company in a forbidden line that the court would be limited to enjoining Armour from doing that."
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,2172.26,2174.477,Well in an original action --
1970.759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.477,2175.965,I didn’t ask about an original action.
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,2184.06,2184.813,That’s correct.
1970.759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2184.813,2198.461,"And if it’s in the process of acquiring one of those forbidden companies, could the court issue an order against Armour and also the possible seller?"
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,2198.461,2213.534,"Well, Your Honor, I believe in terms of what would happen in that case, Judge Hoffman discussed that and he indicated that he would certainly enter an order against Armour, if Armour’s conduct ever appeared to violate the Decree."
1970.759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.698,2231.369,"Well, I want know what your opinion was, whether the order could run against the seller too?"
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,2231.369,2231.479,Oh!
1970.759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2258.362,2265.849,"So in that sense, the Decree wouldn’t be limited only to Armour?"
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,2265.849,2271.48,"Mr. Justice, we have never contended that the Decree is simply limited to the packers."
1970.759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.312,2301.78,"But Armour, I suppose under this Decree couldn’t acquire Greyhound, could it?"
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,2301.78,2303.298,That is correct.
1970.759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.298,2309.849,"But if Armour said “Well, I can acquire you, but you can acquire me, why don’t you do that?”"
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,2314.11,2314.728,That is correct.
1970.759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2328.705,2337.889,"In that circumstance, though you would say that in order to grant against Greyhound --"
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,2337.889,2339.847,Yes.
1970.759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.847,2346.568,"But as far as long as Armour is passive and doesn’t take it up in the first place, an order may not run against Greyhound?"
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,2346.568,2349.702,"I believe Mr. Justice, that’s what Rule 65 (d) says."
1970.759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2349.702,2352.113,That’s what this case is all about?
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,2352.113,2353.65,This case is in part about that.
1970.759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.312,2572.07,Was it then appropriate as a remedy in this case if the -- for the trial court in 1920 to have said Armour shall not acquire anyone -- this forbidden lines and neither shall Armour be acquired by anybody in the -- those forbidden lines?
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,2572.07,2578.75,"Mr. Justice, it’s our view that no such order could be binding."
1970.759,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2578.75,2582.093,"Well, it wouldn’t be binding until somebody -- but let’s assume what happen."
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,2595.635,2599.734,It is our view that injunction such as that cannot run against the world.
1970.759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3286.541,3297.286,"Do we have any information in, anywhere in the record that would indicate how much of Armour’s products are used by Greyhound in its food dispensing aspects?"
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,3297.286,3298.236,"No, Your Honor."
1970.759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3298.57,3299.983,That’s because we have no record?
1970.759,1,22300,edward_l_foote,,3299.983,3303.308,We have no record.
1970.759,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3451.253,3452.334,"Mr. Foote, thank you."
1970.759,2,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3455.31,3456.497,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1970.759,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3595.779,3598.964,How about LTV --?
1970.759,2,33067,james_van_r_springer,,3598.964,3604.595,"Several things can be said about LTV. First as this Mr. Foote is admitted, there’s no element of estoppel here."
1970.759,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3700.06,3702.205,"Thank you Mr. Springer, thank you Mr. Foote."
