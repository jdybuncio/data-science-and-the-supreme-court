2003.03-218,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,35.595,"We'll hear argument next this morning in No. 03-218, John D. Ashcroft v. The American Civil Liberties Union."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,66.942,69.894,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-218,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,136.198,154.982,"Mr. Olson, part of the problem is that the pornography laws that would apply to adult viewers don't seem to be enforced very well, the obscenity laws."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,163.879,164.079,--Well--
2003.03-218,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.079,170.194,"I mean, if they were enforced, a lot of the problem would be assisted."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,170.194,190.696,"--Well, it... in the first place, Justice O'Connor, while there may have been some lapse in... diminution in obscenity prosecutions a number of years ago, the information that I'm given, and it's not in the record, is that 21 indictments have been brought in the last 2 years, 17 have involved Internet."
2003.03-218,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.148,238.21,"Well, how many sites are there available altogether on the Internet?"
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,238.21,255.954,"--Well, there are... there are a great deal more than that, Mr. Chief Justice, and I don't know the exact number, but I believe the record, with respect to the Child Online, COPA, uses... describes those numbers, but it is increasing enormously every single day, but the--"
2003.03-218,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,255.954,259.504,"Yes, even... even the 28,000 was at the time this bill was enacted."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,259.504,259.744,--That's right.
2003.03-218,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,259.744,260.625,So I'm... so I assume--
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,260.625,260.876,And so the--
2003.03-218,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,260.876,261.797,--it's much greater now.
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,261.797,271.745,"--And every evidence that's available to us, and I don't think this is disputed by respondents, is that the number of Internet sites is growing up exponentially."
2003.03-218,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,271.745,277.411,"Those figures include the obscenity violations too, I assume?"
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,285.325,288.988,"Well, I'm talking about sites that... that would be available to you--"
2003.03-218,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.988,289.539,"Other things too, right."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,289.539,290.571,--to you or me--
2003.03-218,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,290.571,290.961,Right.
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,290.961,291.462,--or to a 12-year-old--
2003.03-218,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,291.462,291.652,Right.
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,291.652,292.584,--by typing in the word--
2003.03-218,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,292.584,292.864,Exactly.
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,292.864,293.545,--free porn--
2003.03-218,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,293.545,294.166,Exactly.
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,294.166,295.455,--where there would be no screen--
2003.03-218,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,295.455,295.936,Yeah.
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,295.936,298.26,--preventing the child from getting to that information.
2003.03-218,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,298.26,302.811,"Yeah, and my first inquiry was... was such a vast array of sites."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,307.075,309.165,"Well, as I said, the number of prosecutions are increasing."
2003.03-218,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.031,320.144,"Now, you said free porn, not free obscenity."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,320.144,321.474,--That's correct.
2003.03-218,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,321.474,323.578,Presumably they still can't advertise free obscenity.
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,325.136,327.299,"That's correct, and I--"
2003.03-218,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.299,332.041,"Then I don't really understand, but there's a line there somewhere between obscenity and pornography, right?"
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,332.041,333.273,"--Well, there's a line there that this Court--"
2003.03-218,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.273,333.904,Pornography is okay?
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,333.904,347.312,"--Well, this... what we're talking about today is something that would be described as... and I'm using the term pornography as a shorthand version to describe what was described in the statute as harmful to children."
2003.03-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,372.712,378.697,You're... you're not suggesting that the free porn that you call up would not include any obscene material?
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,378.697,382.837,--I did... I didn't have time to go all the way through all those sites.
2003.03-218,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.62,388.082,I'd imagine you found some that it was obscene.
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,388.082,389.264,--And it's... I didn't.
2003.03-218,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,436.897,440.841,"General Olson, you said something that I... I would question."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,473.642,480.668,"Well, you're disclosing your identity, Justice Ginsburg, because you're standing there in public examining those--"
2003.03-218,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,480.668,487.313,"How many people are going to be in that adult store, bookstore with you, as opposed to giving your credit card number?"
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,487.313,498.231,"--What you're... what you're... what you're disclosing your identity in person, I... we would, the Government would argue that that is more invasive, but that nonetheless that there's some... this is a counterpart to those blinder racks."
2003.03-218,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,520.085,524.128,But the whole world can know about it if I've given my credit card number.
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,524.128,538.498,"--It... it is a... it is a crime under COPA for the persons providing that information pursuant to adult identification provisions, it's section, subsection d of COPA that makes it a crime to reveal that information."
2003.03-218,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,547.774,554.349,Then why is there such resistance to giving the ID and the credit card?
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,565.706,567.418,"--Well, some... some people may."
2003.03-218,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,587.615,591.648,You don't have to give your credit card to go into the nightclub or the movie.
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,591.648,596.172,"--Well, you probably... in some cases you don't, in some cases maybe you do."
2003.03-218,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,597.224,611.773,"There... there may be resistance made there not on the part of people to stand in front of blinder racks or to go into those portions of bookstores that are excluded, that exclude children because of the presence of pornography."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,623.032,626.224,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia, and Congress acknowledged that."
2003.03-218,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,627.856,637.353,"Did... I thought that at least we have some cases that... that recognize that there is... someone doesn't have to come forward and say, I want this material."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,655.717,669.637,"--In the Denver Area case, the person had to make an application to unblock the material, that that material... there's a big distinction in the Denver Area case because there wasn't a requirement of anonymity and a protection of privacy in the statute."
2003.03-218,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,754.01,763.877,"--Mr. Olson, the... the court of appeals addressed certain principal flaws that it saw in the statute, and I wish you... you could address those."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,780.709,780.89,--Yes.
2003.03-218,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,838.451,850.449,"Well, just... but... but before we leave the... the whole, what is... your position changed between the Third Circuit and here as to what we should look like, should we look at the whole... are you saying now we should look at the whole Web site?"
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,850.449,857.344,"--You may look at the whole Web site and... and... and it may be appropriate to look at the whole Web site, it may not be necessary."
2003.03-218,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,862.85,866.173,"But I mean, how... how is the purveyor or the... the broadcaster supposed to know?"
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,866.173,869.315,--The broadcast... with respect to the--
2003.03-218,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,869.315,870.477,"I mean, if we can't define what--"
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,870.477,870.657,--Well--
2003.03-218,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,870.657,870.997,--what the whole means--
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,870.997,874.691,"--Well, this Court... what... this Court has defined that."
2003.03-218,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,880.884,881.946,--But it's presented on a screen.
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,881.946,883.248,--It's presented on a screen--
2003.03-218,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.248,884.059,One... one screen at a time.
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,884.059,891.606,"--Certainly, Justice Kennedy, but one page in a book is presented at a time, one book in a library, one magazine in a bookstore."
2003.03-218,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,891.606,895.937,"Yeah, but as we all know, this... this is... a book, we know about book, but the Web site is different, and that's where we're struggling."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,895.937,902.561,"Well, that's right, and we're saying that the entire Web site may be looked at as a whole to see the context in which the material is presented."
2003.03-218,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,944.121,953.237,"But that's not obvious in the text of the statute, because it says, it says any image, any article, any image."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,957.511,957.751,--But--
2003.03-218,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,957.751,987.941,"The question that... that I have is, you... you have clarified what the statute means in this respect, you've also said that harmful to minors, the minor in view is the normal 16-year-old, but the statute doesn't say that, and since we're dealing with a content restriction, is it good enough for you to give a narrowing construction of words that are susceptible to a broader meaning?"
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,987.941,1009.746,"--The... I have submit that the... what the... with the issue of as a whole as a part of the statute, taken in the context which it is given, it... it... the... this is... this is part 6 of the definition, which is on page 189a of the appendix to the cert petition... that the... the context of that is quite clear that the material is--"
2003.03-218,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1009.746,1011.829,"Well, three... two... yeah."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1017.224,1017.965,--That's why we're here.
2003.03-218,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1063.706,1063.876,Why did you--
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1063.876,1064.537,--Those were book cases.
2003.03-218,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.537,1069.662,--pick 16-year-olds instead of 17-year-olds if you want to use the old... the oldest minors?
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1071.733,1072.932,Because this Court--
2003.03-218,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1072.932,1077.776,"And I mean, you know, maybe you... you won the battle by losing the war."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1077.776,1077.957,--Well--
2003.03-218,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1077.957,1091.295,You... you're going to allow to come in without any restriction under this statute for a 5-year-old anything that wouldn't be... wouldn't be bad for a 16-year-old.
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1091.295,1091.515,"--Well, there's two--"
2003.03-218,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1091.515,1092.487,Is that a great victory?
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1092.487,1095.067,"--There's two answers to that, Justice Scalia."
2003.03-218,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1131.343,1131.553,How do we know that?
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1142.991,1143.202,"--No, as a matter of fact--"
2003.03-218,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.202,1144.053,--to really young children.
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1144.053,1170.032,"--As a matter of fact, Congress was very clear that what it was adopting is what this Court had previously considered in the American Booksellers case and those blinder racks and the... and the definition that came out of the American Booksellers case and the subsequent Fourth Circuit definition of that term in that case, of which this Court subsequently denied cert. Those bookseller blinder rack cases are exactly cited in the legislative history."
2003.03-218,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1246.987,1259.716,"Well, but the... the doing... the this is having the whole Web site, and... and I, you know, I... I concede it'd be a very difficult task if we told the Congress you come... you come up with some definition of the commercial pornographer."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1273.955,1308.579,"Well, the answer to that, Justice Kennedy, is the... the fact that this is not any... that that definition, what the Congress adopted at the suggestion of this Court, was the same definition that this Court had approved in prior contexts with respect to obscenity, 18 U.S.C. 1466, and that definition, commercial use of obscenity, is something that prosecutors and courts have been dealt... been dealing with for a couple of... for over, well over a generation, for several decades."
2003.03-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1308.79,1312.673,"Mr. Olson, may I ask you a question about the... on the... the meaning of this very provision?"
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1324.781,1340.761,"--Yes, I believe they would, Justice Stevens, that if the idea is to sell... to use the material that fits the definition, I keep saying the word pornography because I want to use the shorthand, and that is to make commercial use of it by making money out of it, whether they sell--"
2003.03-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1340.761,1345.166,"Well, they're making money out of the sale of... of the product, which itself is not pornographic."
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1345.166,1345.644,--That's--
2003.03-218,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1345.644,1349.237,"But... but if it's regular advertising, you think that would... that would meet it?"
2003.03-218,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1349.237,1363.168,"--Yes, I... Congress would not have wanted to create that massive loophole, because the people that are... this is a multi-billion dollar business, the people that are doing it would readily adapt to that kind of a loophole."
2003.03-218,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.705,1573.557,"Very well, General Olson."
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1576.549,1589.807,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.03-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1635.501,1640.734,"Now, I thought what it said is it picks up the definition that this Court has used for obscenity."
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1659.067,1659.638,I--
2003.03-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1659.638,1670.445,"And... and so, I looked through all your stuff, or not all of it, but some of it, and I'd like you to point out for me, what is the material there that has that serious scientific value, which you have quite a lot of--"
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1670.445,1670.616,--Yes.
2003.03-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1670.616,1672.156,--but that the statute would forbid?
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1672.156,1672.286,Yes.
2003.03-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1684.228,1689.201,It has to be an image or whatever image they are that appeal to the prurient interest.
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1692.784,1693.064,Yes.
2003.03-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1693.064,1697.268,"It is material that is looking for a kind of emotional response, period."
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1718.533,1719.164,Your Honor--
2003.03-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1719.164,1721.327,So I want you to tell me which is the one that fits it.
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1721.327,1731.354,"--Yes, and, Your Honor, the question ultimately is what a speaker on the Web who communicates material like this will do, what they think is covered by the law, whether they will self-censor everything they think--"

2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1754.447,1755.188,--Sure.

2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1756.069,1758.27,"Sure, sure, Your Honor, of course."
2003.03-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1773.953,1774.283,Did you get my question?
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1776.586,1777.325,--Yes.
2003.03-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1777.325,1779.926,"I want to know, I would like some citations."
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1780.376,1780.607,Absolutely.
2003.03-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1780.607,1781.258,--hold it up.
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1781.258,1781.819,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.03-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1781.819,1791.496,"But I... I want to know what you think, in other words, are your prime examples, because I'm tempted to look at them, and if I thought that this statute didn't cover it, why not say so?"
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1802.285,1803.116,"Yes, let me do that."
2003.03-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1841.229,1843.292,"Exactly, and I don't think that that's prurient."
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1857.561,1858.77,--Your--
2003.03-218,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1858.77,1860.703,Now... now you tell me why that isn't so.
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,1860.703,1862.095,"--Your Honor, let me put this another way."
2003.03-218,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1991.976,1993.248,You're talking about self-censoring.
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2000.213,2001.295,"--No, I'm not."
2003.03-218,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2016.668,2017.43,That's the whole point of the thing.
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2017.43,2017.99,Exactly.
2003.03-218,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2042.739,2046.322,"If... if you run that self-censor, I mean, you... you could not have any laws protect."

2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2084.603,2090.519,--We think that that is one of the three First Amendment burdens that these kinds of statutes impose.
2003.03-218,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2093.261,2093.391,All right.
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2093.881,2095.544,--We think that it would be enough--
2003.03-218,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2095.544,2095.704,Okay.
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2095.704,2097.455,--but the point is under COPA--
2003.03-218,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.455,2098.206,Then all the blinder racks are bad?
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2098.206,2134.49,"--And under... under this law... under this law, Your... Your Honor, there are two additional burdens which are much greater than the online blinder rack statutes, and in fact, it's quite notable that even though some states, it's about half of the states that have display statutes as opposed to statutes like Ginsberg that make it a crime to simply sell directly to a child material that's harmful to minors, those same states that have passed and in some cases upheld offline display statutes have now struck down online display statutes because they have reached the same conclusion that the district court and the appellate court in this case found and that is that there is--"
2003.03-218,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2134.49,2134.93,"Well, their supreme courts did, their supreme courts did."
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2143.607,2164.372,"--I'm saying that there are... there were Federal courts that have struck down now seven state online harmful to minor statutes because they have recognized the distinction between those statutes in the online context and the offline context, and let me just get to that second problem, you know, self-censorship being the first problem, self-censorship of speech that under any definition is protected for adults."
2003.03-218,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2192.186,2197.071,"But there's a... there's an alternative, the ID, you... it doesn't have to be a credit card."
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2197.071,2199.753,"--Your Honor, there is an alternative in the statute."
2003.03-218,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2249.48,2256.925,"Yes, but the Government says that there's a statutory protection that they cannot... that the... the person who gets the information can't pass it on to third parties."
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2256.925,2268.784,"Your Honor, there was actually... there actually was a similar protection in the Denver Area case, which this Court found irrelevant given the remaining burden on... on adults having to identify themselves before they seek access."
2003.03-218,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2283.667,2283.807,Well--

2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2302.931,2304.843,"--protected speech anonymously, but that is not really what's at issue here."
2003.03-218,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2324.898,2329.91,"--Well, you... you say you're not relying on what you refer to as anonymity cases for this proposition?"
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2329.91,2340.068,I'm saying that I think that those cases are relevant only to the extent that they show that anonymity often deters... that the... the loss of anonymity will deter viewers.

2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2386.955,2397.572,"The... the third was the four... first point I made, Your Honor, which is that if you... the defenses don't help you at all if you take a risk and... and assume that your speech is protected and in fact the Government thinks it isn't."
2003.03-218,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2409.0,2416.035,"Well, that seems to me just really much, very much like the point that... that the statute sweeps too broadly, there's a risk of too great self-censorship."
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2417.417,2419.828,"Your Honor, I... I don't think it is the same point."

2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2571.951,2572.131,--I'm sorry.

2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2734.792,2738.375,I will argue only that it's--
2003.03-218,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2738.375,2738.555,You will demur.
2003.03-218,1,15505,ann_e_beeson,,2738.555,2739.516,--clearly narrower.
