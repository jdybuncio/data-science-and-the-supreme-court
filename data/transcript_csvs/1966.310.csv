1966.310,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,26.992,31.639,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1966.310,1,29010,justice_bernnan,,288.014,293.015,May I ask what [Inaudible]
1966.310,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,293.015,301.665,We have printed it since it's not available in the reports in the supplemental memorandum that Your Honor should have.
1966.310,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,892.042,897.955,We'll recess now.
1966.310,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,897.955,913.551,"-– substituted new review and enforcement procedures for the old and that these were prospective in their operation, they were going to govern all orders thereafter issued."
1966.310,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1104.125,1106.933,But that's what the statute do in terms?
1966.310,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1106.933,1108.946,"Yeah, in terms it does."
1966.310,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1113.707,1114.371,To say the very least.
1966.310,2,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1114.371,1118.047,Saying that this was unintended.
1966.310,3,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,1758.037,1762.965,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.310,4,29010,justice_bernnan,,2618.576,2648.956,"If they may maintain an action on the old order based on your sections and violations of the old order would they not ensue a court order of course no sanction has been proposed on the initial violation on the old proceedings, but there now would be a court order, would there not, based on the old order and on your concession of this violation will they not get a court order under the old procedure?"
1966.310,5,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2648.956,2650.308,Assume say that --
1966.310,6,29010,justice_bernnan,,2650.308,2653.812,"Isn't that what's all, isn't that what happened?"
1966.310,7,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2653.812,2655.89,If the Court of Appeals in this case --
1966.310,8,29010,justice_bernnan,,2655.89,2663.605,"Under the old procedure your concession of violation of the old pre 1959 order would result in the court order, wouldn't it?"
1966.310,9,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2663.605,2665.141,In our case it's –-
1966.310,10,29010,justice_bernnan,,2665.141,2666.346,Enjoining compliance.
1966.310,11,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2666.346,2669.435,"Not necessarily Mr. Justice Brennan, not necessarily."
1966.310,12,29010,justice_bernnan,,2669.435,2670.425,Why not?
1966.310,13,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2670.425,2681.431,"Well for one thing the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction, if it has any, under the old procedure -- under the old provision was to modify a firm or set aside the commission's order."
1966.310,14,29010,justice_bernnan,,2686.648,2704.354,"Wouldn't the, I thought what would happen in the situation as you describe is your case, would it been an order and joining enforcement that is in enforcing the issue of commission order in the form of an adjoining your compliance --"
1966.310,15,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2704.354,2710.092,"That's correct Mr. Brennan if the Court of Appeals is satisfied, that's what it ought to do but it's not a mechanical thing."
1966.310,16,29010,justice_bernnan,,2710.092,2715.597,I don't – I'm not suggesting it's mechanical but when you concede that you have violated I will suppose that would happen.
1966.310,17,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2736.866,2737.743,That's right sir.
1966.310,18,29010,justice_bernnan,,2737.743,2740.074,And you don't think that's a very different situation?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2740.074,2744.643,I think that's as Commissioner Eleanor suggests that's a better position for the government because then --
1966.310,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.643,2748.527,"Well, then why are you into it, I would think it's the only other side there?"
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2748.527,2778.437,"That's a good question Mr. Justice White and the answer is we didn't bring this case here and we didn't take it to the Court of Appeals, and our basic position is as we have never got into the Court of Appeals that on the merits whatever jurisdiction or provisions that apply this is not -- the commission should not have initiated this proceeding."
1966.310,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.437,2785.718,We really wanted to do the government's work for it in the sense that you think the government should have a more effective [Inaudible] against us than they are claiming?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2785.718,2807.672,"Well, what Jantzen is doing is simply pointing out what the acts of Congress is seem to say and furthermore we are attempting to point out that the government's parade of horribles simply they require speculation, they require a guess."
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2822.047,2841.222,May I ask you -- if your argument comes down to this that the act of Congress not merely prescribed a procedure to be followed in the future but obliterated all FTC orders that had occurred before the act of Congress?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2841.222,2846.601,My answer to that Mr. Justice Black is that it did not obliterate any old orders.
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2847.439,2859.461,"But it obliterate -- that it obliterated to the extent of requiring the commission is not a new proceeding, the court could do anything against that particular defendant?"
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2859.461,2866.037,Unless by the terms of the statute a petition had previously been filed to review or in force.
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2866.037,2869.813,That all the other were wiped out-- I mean all the --
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2869.813,2872.824,Our answer -- we accept the government's figures.
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2875.81,2886.736,And that would be the same as though the Congress come along and said on all those proceedings they have done that no value will be taken into account by the FTC?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2886.736,2890.833,"Mr. Justice Black I've just had made myself clear, it's my fault."
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2897.751,2899.278,But the order?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2899.278,2899.914,Pardon me sir.
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2899.914,2902.043,Everything with the order of enforcement?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2902.043,2907.331,Well if something that's raised res judicata is res judicata as Commissioner Eleanor points.
1966.310,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2907.331,2917.722,Because it may no longer predicate an enforcement action on those order that's one thing that -- you say that statute definitely very definitely eliminated.
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2917.722,2919.682,Those orders being those--
1966.310,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2919.682,2927.486,Well isn't that true if you do say that those orders are not – can be debated further --
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2927.486,2929.479,"Well, Commissioner Eleanor suggested that they can take –-"
1966.310,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2929.479,2932.71,Well that's your position.
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2932.71,2935.247,What I'm trying to say is that the commission will not be.
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2935.247,2935.882,[Inaudible]
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2935.882,2936.43,I'm sorry sir.
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2936.43,2939.482,"Commissioner Eleanor would then be in minority, wouldn't he?"
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2939.482,2942.693,Yes.
1966.310,19,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2967.774,2967.98,And Mr. --
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2967.98,2971.14,Even though they have to start a new proceeding and go all the way for a new trial?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2971.14,2972.972,Yes sir.
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2972.972,2985.457,Why don't you face in that effect in which you say one problem with this was to provide that none of those old orders should be included in future?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2985.457,2985.952,Well Congress--
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2985.952,2988.169,It was argued on that basis.
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2988.169,2991.029,If you take the senate committee report which the government has reproduced.
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2991.029,2995.156,"And that's what you think, isn't it?"
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,2995.156,2996.112,If I—-
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2996.112,3004.31,"What Congress did was to wipe out the effectiveness of the old order, these 400 orders?"
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3004.31,3006.86,The commission came to the Congress prior to 19--
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3006.86,3016.324,"Isn't that what they -- isn't that what you're insisting that we've done here, maybe you've tried, I am not, it seems to me like -- I guess on the basis that you are stating?"
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3016.324,3025.877,What I am resisting Mr. Justice Black is the conclusion that anything was wiped out.
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3025.877,3028.737,"Well the orders are wiped out, aren't they?"
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3034.053,3034.715,First of all they can --
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3034.715,3037.63,Can they proceed under any of those old orders?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3037.63,3038.548,Yes sir it can.
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3038.548,3039.224,How?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3039.224,3048.856,"In the Ruberoid case, National Led case, all those cases where a petition to review had been filed prior to 1959, and they are all preserved."
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3048.856,3052.213,"But all, what about all the others, can't they all be wiped out?"
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3052.213,3053.074,"Only, sure."
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3053.074,3054.829,The effectiveness of them?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3054.829,3056.318,I submit that they are not.
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3094.816,3105.985,"You mean that they start a new proceeding without any summons or notice or evidence or conclusion, facts of any kind, they can issue an order, they can just automatically issue an order?"
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3105.985,3115.075,"But they'll have to do that even if the old provisions were preserved, but let me if I may take that hypothetically, which I submit is a hypothetical."
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3115.597,3142.665,"It seems to me that you are bringing up a lot of hypothetical cases rather than facing the fact and I may be wrong with that, I may misunderstand rather than facing the fact that what you ask is that we construe this act of Congress in wiping out the effectiveness of a certain number of the old orders issued by the commission under the old proceedings?"
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3142.665,3149.595,"My answer is simply that you analyze that effectiveness, it disappears that these --"
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3149.595,3151.873,"The order disappears you mean, don't you?"
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3151.873,3152.445,Pardon me sir.
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3152.445,3154.175,You think the order disappeared?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3154.175,3171.774,"Well but if you are down to those cases you find and in contrast what the commission has to do under the provisions of law that used to apply with what we'd have to do under the new procedure I submit there isn't a great, there isn't a significant amount of difference."
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3171.774,3175.01,Except that they have just started new procedure?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3175.01,3176.339,That's correct.
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3176.339,3183.127,"In that wider procedure, isn't that quite something to be [Inaudible]"
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3183.127,3192.662,"Well if you compare it with what they had to do under the old statute that in a sense was, you concede the same document if – But I'm not, I wouldn't --"
1966.310,19,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3192.662,3198.14,The same document that's lost its stinger?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3198.14,3215.345,"Well if you take one of these cases Mr. Justice Black which they, where they say there was some fencing in or where they say there was some issue and where no review or a court presentation had been an issue."
1966.310,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3259.771,3266.242,Do you think that it really is a practical consideration in a consent order case?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3289.288,3297.049,"Well, we argued two other things in addition to this point which is a threshold one."
1966.310,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.516,3323.806,"Even though this is a, this was a consent case."
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3323.806,3325.056,Yes sir.
1966.310,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3325.056,3337.392,Now assume you are right and the commission had to start a new proceeding and it was to start with the facts which it says were established under the old proceeding in which you suggest a res judicata.
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3351.647,3357.479,"The commission couldn't, couldn't start with any more unchallenged facts one way or other in our case."
1966.310,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3357.479,3363.264,Well you just say that the previous order then stands for nothing as far as having established any facts?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3363.264,3365.177,"That's our position, yes Mr. Justice."
1966.310,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3365.177,3368.481,And so you don't agree with Commissioner Elanor?
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3368.481,3370.291,I don't agree with anything that the Commissioner Elanor --
1966.310,19,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3370.291,3372.329,Yeah and I didn't think so.
1966.310,19,23024,edwin_s_rockefeller,,3372.329,3387.036,I see my time is supposed to be up and I would like if I may just try to bring the attention back to this one question.
