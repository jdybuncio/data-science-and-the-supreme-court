1970.75,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,24.4,"Number 75, California against Byers."
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,26.717,30.033,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,418.259,431.427,Do you understand that the use restriction would include any reliance by the state on the fact that this was the man who -- this was the name of the man who caused the damage?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,431.427,437.002,"Yes Your Honor, this is our understanding of the decision."
1970.75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,611.256,638.535,"So it's your submission General Renne as I understand it that, the decision of the Supreme Court of California in this case means that if a driver damages property and stops along, leaves his name, he first of all of course is not guilty of violation of the hit and run statute and secondly he immunizes himself from any prosecution for any other offense, is that?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,638.535,640.884,That is exactly our position Your Honor.
1970.75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,640.884,658.676,And I suppose a logical extension of that might be -- it could be argued that he also immunizes himself from any subsequent tort liability if it can be shown that it resulted from his identification as a result of his stopping and leaving his name?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,658.676,660.217,"Well, I think that this we -- that is our position."
1970.75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,660.217,662.267,The way I have gotten there so far in this case.
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,662.267,669.397,"Yes, that is correct Your Honor and I think how far you can carry this, you can just perhaps go on forever."
1970.75,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,686.783,690.887,"The safe thing to do all was just to stop and leave your name and address, isn't it?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,690.887,691.795,That is correct.
1970.75,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,691.795,693.331,And you get an immunity back?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,693.331,702.342,That is correct Your Honor and the purpose of the hit and run statute is not to catch criminals.
1970.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,777.098,781.414,"Yeah, but there is more -- there is more to it than just identifying yourself."
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,795.252,796.879,"Yes, that is true Your Honor."
1970.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,796.879,799.565,Now you wouldn't -- would you say that's non-testimonial?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,799.565,802.021,We would urge that it is non-testimonial.
1970.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,803.642,809.961,"A requirement that says, I so and so have just been involved in an accident?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,809.961,816.548,"Well, although it is verbal Your Honor, we would say that it is non-testimonial to this extent."
1970.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.709,856.403,"Well, I would think here you are saying, let's assume that a statute didn't require someone to leave his name and address when he has had an accident, just requires him to leave his fingerprint at the scene, as whose ever fingerprint this is was involved in an accident."
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,866.135,870.33,"Well, the respondent has not taken issue with our contention."
1970.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.436,901.348,"Isn't that your better argument than non-testimonial nature of this, that would really doesn't pose any substantial (Inaudible)?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,901.348,908.956,"Well certainly a very clear argument in our mind, Your Honor, that this does not create a substantial hazard of self-incrimination."
1970.75,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,940.333,948.583,But let's assume for the moment that it does have overtones of the possibility.
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,960.825,980.885,"Well, that is our position Your Honor that even if there should be any overtones of self-incrimination that the requirement to stop and give your name and address and to be -- the state to be able to use that information later is a valid condition that the state may impose upon drivers."
1970.75,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1079.752,1086.113,"Yes, but I gather your Supreme Court didn't go so far as to say you did not have to leave your name and address."
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1102.432,1103.229,"Yes, they but --"
1970.75,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1103.229,1107.193,"It didn't go quite so far as we had -- we went in Marchetti, Grosso?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1107.193,1118.139,"Well, we think that the very fact that it didn't go quite that far Your Honor indicates that the State Supreme Court recognized that these statutes must be upheld insofar as --"
1970.75,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1118.139,1131.093,"Well, they recognized that the state interest could be accommodated with the privilege by simply denying the use of the criminal prosecution and yet requiring the personnel involvement in such an accident to leave his name and address."
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1131.093,1145.329,"Yes, and it's our position Your Honor that in coming to conclusion that this balance could be reached that the State was quite unrealistic in coming to that conclusion."
1970.75,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1213.439,1221.238,"Well except what -- under your State Supreme Court decision, the state does get the name and address, doesn't it?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1225.401,1226.73,Excuse me Your Honor.
1970.75,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1261.57,1265.077,But what the state want the name and address for?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1265.077,1273.177,Well the state interest in having a private exchange of information is to protect against financial loss.
1970.75,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1273.177,1282.363,"There is nothing in the Supreme Court holding that affects that state interest, does it?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1282.363,1283.2,"No, that's --"
1970.75,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1283.2,1286.197,Because then that -- it said that the name and address have to given.
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1288.09,1297.666,Well the other purpose that the state would have -- first of all the state has an interest in any case in knowing who caused accidents or why accidents were caused.
1970.75,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1297.666,1300.812,That's all satisfied in the Supreme Court decision.
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1300.812,1307.436,"But the other interest is in enforcing its criminal laws, that interest is not satisfied."
1970.75,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1307.436,1310.623,That's where -- that's the crux of it isn't it?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1310.623,1310.95,That is --
1970.75,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1310.95,1318.619,You want us -- as for purposes of prosecuting and convicting under the state criminal laws and surely that implicates --
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1318.619,1326.318,"But what about a statute that if you go over 80 miles and hour, you have to give a name and address, does that help in any part?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1326.318,1331.104,Well I think that I don't know what the state --
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1331.104,1333.47,Well my question is what's the difference?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1333.47,1336.22,Well I think there is a quite a lot of difference Your Honor going --
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1336.22,1347.255,"Insofar as the state is concerned, these are two traffic violations. All the state is interested in I assume with the traffic violation."
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1351.344,1352.44,That is correct Your Honor.
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1352.44,1353.711,What's the difference?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1353.711,1376.664,"Well I think the difference is that if the statute read that only people driving 80 miles per hour need to stop and give their name and address, then an 80 miles an hour were per se crime that perhaps it could be said in that case that the only state interest was to catch criminals if I understand your question correctly."
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1378.209,1388.249,"But if you drive 80 miles an hour and strike a car, just takes off the middle piece of thing, just leave the name and address."
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1388.249,1389.722,That is correct Your Honor.
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1389.722,1392.74,But what's the magic of having an accident?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1392.74,1399.499,Well the magic of the having the accident is that that triggers the hit and run statute and that --
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1399.499,1403.358,Requires him to admit that the he committed the crime?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1403.358,1408.767,"Well, we know we don't know, whether or not and you never know why an accident was caused."
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1408.767,1410.944,Why you are interested?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1410.944,1413.205,Well the state has a number of interests.
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1413.205,1423.129,"I can see the interest of the state in seeing through that citizen of the state who caused damage, who shall be able to litigate, know who did it."
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1433.061,1456.092,"Well Your Honor I think that the interest of the state in having a name and address -- now that I just make perfectly clear that in this case you are only required to give to a third party, but of course there are other reporting statutes, that are not involved in that case but this interest -- state has a great deal of interest in knowing number one, who is involved in accidents, are they careful and competent drivers."
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1475.355,1480.275,Are you interested in the prosecutorial use of it which is the Fifth Amendment?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1480.275,1481.999,"The Fifth Amendment, that's correct."
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1481.999,1487.076,That's my interest and the fact that you want statistics that doesn't bother me at all?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1487.076,1487.893,Well you --
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1487.893,1492.525,"And the fact that you want to prosecute this man, does worry me?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1492.525,1502.781,"Well, it seems to me Your Honor that if in any regulatory area, there are going to be criminal statutes."
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1533.824,1537.557,Criminal statute here is failure to leave your name and address?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1537.557,1538.539,It's correct.
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1538.539,1539.54,That's the statute.
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1539.54,1540.745,That is the statute.
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1540.745,1553.483,"So if you leave your name and address, is that for the benefit of the state because I thought you said that if you give it to the guy with the car, the state will never know about it?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1553.483,1556.679,That's correct Your Honor the state may not.
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1556.679,1558.748,"But what good is that to the state, no good?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1558.748,1560.578,"Well, but the problem is that the --"
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1560.578,1562.039,Right?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1562.039,1570.237,"No not -- yes when it's just given to the one driver then we may not find out about it, of course that also --"
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1570.237,1572.828,You won't find out about it to prosecute the man?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1572.828,1602.246,"Well, no the real problem Your Honor is that, if we find out about it, if the police is happened by, which is what happened in the case in Stockton, then -- and they discover either the man was drunk or he was an unlicensed driver, then because the State Supreme Court has said that the privilege applies at the very moment, a person is required to stop and identify himself."
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1613.348,1619.736,"In your Stockton case what do you need his name and address for, you said the police picked him up?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1619.736,1620.127,But that --
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1620.127,1622.811,And he was (Inaudible) drunk.
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1626.017,1627.241,Well the reason --
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1627.241,1629.395,You need it to prosecute him?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1629.395,1635.092,"Well the reason the driver stopped Your Honor was, because he hit a car."
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1635.092,1639.117,"Well if he (Inaudible) without the statute, he would have stopped."
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1639.117,1642.732,Well he alleged that he stopped because of the statute.
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1642.732,1645.596,That is definitely not this case.
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1645.596,1647.587,"No, it's not this case Your Honor."
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1664.394,1671.962,(Inaudible)
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1671.962,1674.141,Well --
1970.75,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1674.141,1674.661,(Inaudible)
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1674.661,1679.107,It said you can't use that information or the fruits of the compliance.
1970.75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1707.374,1731.959,"General Renne, when a person gets a license to drive on the roads of your state, is there -- are there any explicit conditions imposed or anything, any application he signs insofar as obeying the laws of the state, anything along those lines?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1731.959,1745.244,"Well the -- I would have to qualify my opinion on this Your Honor, there certainly is, there is not any kind of --"
1970.75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1745.244,1745.478,Any kind of expressive waiver.
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1745.478,1747.429,Agreement that he would stop.
1970.75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1755.897,1758.329,"As an implicit waiver, is it?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1758.329,1762.078,"Yes, I am sorry as an implicit wavier, yes."
1970.75,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1763.742,1768.155,"Hess against Pawloski has maybe some slight relevance, does it?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1768.155,1773.242,I think Hess v. Pawloski has a very great deal of relevance Your Honor.
1970.75,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1816.164,1826.413,Mrs. Renne I have lost as little bit as to what happened under count one and the offense under 21750.
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1827.168,1843.887,"Well, as a practical matter the case was never prosecuted, Your Honor, because we have always been on appeal and so meanwhile the prosecution on count one has been held on abeyance so there has been nothing that's happened."
1970.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1843.887,1849.897,"But it would in affect frustrated by the affect of this decision, I would think?"
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1849.897,1853.992,"I would certainly think so Your Honor, we are in very difficult position."
1970.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1853.992,1857.494,That's the only source of your information.
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1857.494,1858.631,"Well of course in this particular case, in this particular --"
1970.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.631,1859.911,For compliance.
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1862.316,1865.642,"Yes, we believe it would frustrated in the decision --"
1970.75,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1865.642,1867.301,"here there was no compliance, that's right."
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1867.301,1905.662,"That's correct, there are -- there may well be areas where a theory of use restrictions have very valid purpose and can accommodate a government's need for information, and the privilege, but the problem in this case is where accident occurs, it's a chance of thing it occurs, on this -- the duty must be performed on the spot and if the privilege applies, the minute there is an accident, the minute there is a duty to stop and give your name and address, we think we are placed in a virtual impossible situations as far as undertaking any kind of criminal law enforcement."
1970.75,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1905.948,1917.743,"Now your opposition tries, seeks I think to draw a distinction between the death or injury statute and the property damage statute."
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1922.134,1937.441,"Well, I think Your Honor that holding of one court particular, Bailey versus Superior Court which is cited in the respondent's brief and in our reply brief maybe the answer to your question at least one distinction the California courts have tried to draw."
1970.75,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1937.441,1938.6,I want to know what you think?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1938.6,1942.968,Well I think it's very difficult to draw any kind of distinction.
1970.75,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1981.57,1993.595,Certainly other state hit and run statutes often do not separate the death and injury portion from the other portion?
1970.75,0,35023,louise_h_renne,,1993.595,2004.673,"If I might add Your Honor that every time from the years ago when hit and run statutes were attacked under this grounds, they have been uniformly upheld."
1970.75,1,32436,john_w_poulos,,2214.715,2218.855,Mr. Chief Justice and if it may please the Court.
1970.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2393.113,2395.234,The state forced him to do that?
1970.75,1,32436,john_w_poulos,,2395.234,2397.664,Forced him by virtue of the statute.
1970.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2397.664,2399.757,But that's enforcement?
1970.75,1,32436,john_w_poulos,,2399.757,2404.593,"Well, but for the privilege against self-incrimination, it would have forced."
1970.75,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2404.593,2407.572,"But he could have objected, he didn’t have to (Inaudible)"
1970.75,1,32436,john_w_poulos,,2407.572,2420.22,"And that’s precisely what he did to, he did not comply with the statute, raising the Fifth Amendment privilege."
1970.75,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2450.452,2461.454,"Does it appear how they -- since he did not obey the hit and run statute, does it appear how they knew -- how the state knew who he was when the trial was --"
1970.75,1,32436,john_w_poulos,,2461.454,2468.481,"Well, I would have to speculate of the record."
1970.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2477.836,2479.086,Like the license plates?
1970.75,1,32436,john_w_poulos,,2479.086,2480.334,Like the license plates.
1970.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2480.334,2481.903,You think that would be barred too?
1970.75,1,32436,john_w_poulos,,2481.903,2483.587,"No, I do not."
1970.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.587,2485.308,You could be forced to --
1970.75,1,32436,john_w_poulos,,2485.308,2488.211,We are forced to drive automobiles with license plates.
1970.75,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.211,2492.887,Even though you may be in an accident and incriminate yourself for identifying yourself.
1970.75,1,32436,john_w_poulos,,2492.887,2502.972,"That’s correct and I am going to get back to that point in a minute is the reason that I feel that, that is true."
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4671.62,4673.634,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4712.716,4714.63,Well --
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4714.63,4715.105,Yes Your Honor.
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4715.105,4726.203,"Doesn't leaving the name and address not only identify yourself as a driver, but as a driver of the car that has just been in an accident?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4726.203,4734.09,"It does identify, yes it does identify yourself as a driver of a car that has been involved in an accident."
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4734.09,4735.624,In a specific accident.
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4735.624,4739.156,"A specific accident, that's correct Your Honor."
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4743.652,4746.67,What about this specific accident?
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4752.226,4755.128,That would not be incriminating and in this --
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4755.128,4756.22,Why wouldn't it be incriminating?
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4756.22,4770.952,The fact that you give the name and address or you have given a name and address as being the driver in this specific accident has nothing to do with incrimination in my understanding of your question Your Honor.
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4817.68,4830.234,"Well, what about Mr. Justice Black's question to your colleague, when the police show up at your house and say there was an accident here last week, we understand you were there, were you there?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4830.234,4833.614,I think that the police could ask that question.
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4833.614,4836.06,Could they make it a crime to refusing to answer it?
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4836.06,4844.379,"Well, I think it will have to depend upon why they were asking the question?"
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4844.379,4851.154,"Well, they come and ask you and you say sorry, it's none of your business, can you do that?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4851.154,4857.049,The week's lag maybe sufficient and particularly at what the police were trying to show is that you were hit and run --
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4857.049,4859.863,"Well, what if it's an hour after the accident?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4859.863,4863.605,I think that the police could ask that question.
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4863.605,4866.511,"Well, they can always ask you anything but do you have to answer?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4866.511,4875.193,"Well, you would certainly if I am answering the question, this way you would certainly have to answer if you were there right on the spot at the scene of the accident."
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4875.946,4882.852,"Now they ask you that, were you driving the car that was in an accident at 6th Street, New York?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4882.852,4884.321,That maybe a different case Your Honor.
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4886.358,4891.498,"Well, is that incriminating -- would it be -- would you say that would be incriminating?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4891.498,4897.199,I think -- could the state make that a crime?
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4897.199,4900.123,"Well, if it isn't incriminating, they can make you answer."
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4900.123,4901.559,"Well, I think that they could."
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4949.039,4962.234,"You say that the police -- the state may make him leave his name and identify himself at the scene of the accident, but an half an hour later he cannot me made to answer the question, were you driving the car in that accident?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4962.234,4964.87,"Well, I think that the problems maybe entirely different."
1970.75,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4968.816,4971.828,Well you don't care to speculate on what the answer should be?
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4971.828,4976.636,"Well under California law, under various statutes, he could be required to answer."
1970.75,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4983.543,4989.099,(Inaudible) law requires him to give an official report to the state (Inaudible)?
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4989.099,4990.594,"Yes, it does Your Honor."
1970.75,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4990.594,4992.247,(Inaudible)
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,4992.247,4998.09,If the reports are available to persons involved in accidents.
1970.75,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5006.619,5008.285,(Inaudible) involved driver of this car?
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5008.285,5020.83,"Oh, certainly and I think that when you pose the question, isn't this the exact same case as when you are filling out a license or a vehicle registration application."
1970.75,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5027.533,5034.607,"When you fill out application, you don't say that you were the driver of the car that had the accident, there is a difference there."
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5034.607,5041.096,"Well yes, but if your license is seen, then it is just -- you just found out who filed out the application."
1970.75,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5041.096,5044.108,You can then say the car was stolen.
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5044.108,5044.569,Well --
1970.75,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5044.569,5048.025,"But, if you give the name and say well, I don't think it's important."
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5048.025,5061.429,"Well, except under the theory the State Supreme Court I mean it could be the case that if you are wanted for another crime, you are not required to show your license because that might incriminate you for reasons unrelated to the accident at all."
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5061.429,5083.542,"Are you familiar with the line of cases beginning with, Chief Justice Marshall's statement in (Inaudible) that any evidence of which a man (Inaudible), any evidence that might tend to show that you are guilty of a crime, you can't refuse that."
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5083.542,5087.896,"Your Honor, are you referring to the link in a chain kind of analysis?"
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5095.812,5099.413,"It has been an unbroken line of decisions of this Court again, hasn't it?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5099.413,5105.301,That is -- the use of that certainly has been considered.
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5125.637,5128.118,(Voice Overlap) legislative by judicial proceedings?
1970.75,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5132.914,5136.097,In any criminal case?
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5136.097,5137.521,In any criminal case.
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5141.855,5161.594,"Have you read any cases that we decided that indicates that you got to be asking a pending criminal case following the line of Mr. Chief Justice's argument that even though there has not been, it might be used as a link in a chain, the victim of the crime, that he can decline that."
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5161.594,5168.344,"Well, I think there are two cases that come -- are two lines of cases that immediately come to mind in answering your question."
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5180.102,5181.919,"Well, wouldn't it be substantial?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5181.919,5184.153,"Name and address, no Your Honor."
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5185.527,5192.743,"Name and address in connection with an accident that has happened, somebody is hurt or somebody is killed."
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5192.743,5196.521,That could be caused by any number of reasons.
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5196.521,5199.092,"Well, they don't prove the guilt and innocence."
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5206.241,5227.736,"Well, if we are going to extend the link and the chain analysis endlessly, then it would mean that U.S. in U.S. v. Sullivan that decision should have gone the other way because the fact that a taxpayer files is required to file a tax return in which by the fact that he states the source of his income or the fact that he doesn't state the source of his income."
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5227.736,5228.828,Sullivan case.
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5228.828,5229.794,The Sullivan case --
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5229.794,5239.315,"Well, that's a general rule and he did not say they had to answer every question and he said they could be excused for making the report of the taxes."
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5239.315,5243.291,And we think that we have the exact same situation in this case Your Honor.
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5281.647,5285.261,"That seems he should have had quite an apprehension he was talking, wouldn't he?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5285.261,5285.946,Pardon me.
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5285.946,5288.968,Wasn't he tried for crime?
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5288.968,5290.484,The respondent in this case?
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5290.484,5291.112,Yes.
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5291.112,5292.569,"No, Your Honor."
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5292.795,5294.024,There wasn't a charge made against him.
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5294.024,5296.18,There was a charge made against him.
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5296.18,5297.256,What was the charge?
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5297.256,5300.141,The charge was failure to pass to the left safely.
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5300.141,5302.296,Was that an offense under the laws of California?
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5302.296,5303.93,It is an offense under the laws of California.
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5303.93,5305.336,What happened to that charge?
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5305.336,5314.96,"MWell, nothing has happened yet except that the State Supreme Court has said that the man -- it would be unfair to try the respondent Byers."
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5316.583,5323.672,"Well, he evidently could have had a reason for that apprehension and that's exactly what occurred, the state did charge him for crime."
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5323.672,5329.939,"The state did charge him, but the record doesn't show how the state found out, it was this man."
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5329.939,5333.25,"Well, they found out, when they found out, they charged him with the crime?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5333.25,5341.475,"Well they did because at the trial, the facts of what actually occurred would have come out."
1970.75,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5341.475,5356.128,"Mrs. Renne is it clear on this record, I thought your friend had said so that they did not find out about him because of his stopping and reporting in compliance with the statutes, is that right or not?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5356.128,5358.423,"Yes, the state did not find out."
1970.75,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5358.423,5363.633,So that it was not his stopping and reporting that brought on this criminal procedure at all.
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5363.633,5364.651,No.
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5364.651,5368.591,"Well, that was the (Inaudible), well that was the question I was asking you."
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5380.751,5382.445,He might be turned loose.
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5382.445,5387.52,"If it's a link in a chain of evidence, it might cause him to be prosecuted, he couldn't be compelled to answer?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5387.52,5390.158,"That is correct, that has been a statement law."
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5419.909,5421.003,Well it did.
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5421.003,5422.882,It did in this case.
1970.75,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5426.579,5429.46,"Well, he hasn't been convicted as I understand it?"
1970.75,2,35023,louise_h_renne,,5429.46,5433.477,"No, at the trial, we would have found out whether or not he was guilty"
1970.75,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5481.867,5482.68,Thank you Mrs. Renne.
1970.75,3,32436,john_w_poulos,,5494.216,5494.736,Thank you.
