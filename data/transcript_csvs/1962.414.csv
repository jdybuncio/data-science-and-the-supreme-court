1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,18.024,21.692,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.414,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,134.617,137.341,Is there indication as to why two of the judges did not participate?
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,137.341,141.453,"There's no indication whatever, Justice Stewart."
1962.414,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,347.722,359.52,Isn't this a matter that the -- if the judiciary was in the -- within the internal housekeeping management of each Court of Appeals?
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,359.52,367.592,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, it is that this Court has emphasized in Western Pacific case that the statute is addressed to the Court of Appeals."
1962.414,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,395.591,398.286,"Did it -- this did follow the rule of the Third Circuit, didn't it?"
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,398.286,398.568,It did.
1962.414,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,404.652,407.879,And it does as you began by saying follow the literal --
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,407.879,408.723,The literal language?
1962.414,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,413.737,420.648,"Mr. Wright, what is [Inaudible] is rehearing allowed to be controlled by the pan -- original panel?"
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,422.514,425.881,"Yes, Mr. Judge White."
1962.414,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.164,436.97,The Rule 33 of what?
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,436.97,438.958,The Third Circuit.
1962.414,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,441.869,443.441,"Yes, but just those three?"
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,443.441,444.835,Yes.
1962.414,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,445.009,448.345,"Is there a counterpart of that rule in other Circuits, do you know Mr. Wright?"
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,448.345,449.049,Rule 33?
1962.414,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,449.049,449.713,Yes.
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,449.713,451.66,"I would think so, Mr. Justice Brennan, yes."
1962.414,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,451.66,467.824,But is this -- is this the situation you were talking about when you said that if two out of the three of the original panel should -- can be delegated the power to grant a rehearing so should the four out of --
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,467.824,468.901,"No, Mr. Justice White."
1962.414,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,490.475,495.357,"Well, if it granted -- that if -- if it's granted, it doesn't go to the whole court?"
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,495.357,498.01,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.414,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,499.387,500.137,What if -- well --
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,500.137,500.346,Yes.
1962.414,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,500.346,509.079,"-- just before we leave this, what -- what if you're right on this point, supposedly it wouldn't reach the merits of the case, is that it?"
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,509.079,511.806,"Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart that is it."
1962.414,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,538.432,544.93,"But then that means, I suppose that your first point, the point you've discussed up to now becomes to be theoretical?"
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,544.93,546.959,"Well, that's what happened in the Drake Bakeries case when it came here."
1962.414,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,646.631,654.752,"Mr. Wright, [Inaudible]?"
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,654.752,656.459,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1962.414,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,656.459,675.845,[Inaudible]
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,675.845,676.697,That's all we have.
1962.414,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,676.697,681.643,[Inaudible]
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,681.643,682.214,That is correct.
1962.414,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,702.949,718.92,[Inaudible]
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,718.92,726.481,"Oh, if petitioner had been a volunteer, yes it was, but petitioner clearly, the record shows petitioner was doing this under instructions from his B&O supervisors."
1962.414,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,726.481,727.838,[Inaudible]
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,727.838,728.177,Yes.
1962.414,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,728.177,730.68,[Inaudible]
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,730.68,730.936,Yes.
1962.414,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1181.639,1200.138,[Inaudible]
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1200.138,1204.581,"I would distinguish Mr. Justice Goldberg, between foreseeability and notice."
1962.414,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1232.217,1243.245,Isn't a test whether a reasonable man in the exercise of ordinary prudence would have foreseen rather than whether the defendant could have foreseen?
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1243.245,1244.478,"Yes, I think so."
1962.414,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1244.478,1245.822,I'm talking now about the foreseeability.
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1245.822,1247.23,Yes.
1962.414,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1251.236,1258.64,"Mr. Wright, you said earlier I thought at the outset of some complaint about this very door had been made to someone?"
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1258.64,1259.446,"Yes, sir they --"
1962.414,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1259.446,1261.101,And it -- why -- what was that?
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1261.101,1273.681,"The baggage man on the P&LE car -- a P&LE employee said to Shenker just before he was injured that -- I -- that he had reported this defect to the railroad, but nothing had happened."
1962.414,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1273.681,1275.059,Meaning the P&LE?
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1275.059,1278.221,"Yes, to the P&LE."
1962.414,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1316.759,1326.566,"Well, you'd have an entirely different case if it's been a B&O car because then the defect in the door would have been the responsibility -- it would've resulted from the negligence of the B&O, the employer."
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1326.566,1330.201,"Well, I don't think that's necessarily so, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1962.414,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1345.886,1355.208,"Well, the B&O car would have been within the exclusive control of the employer, the defendant in this case where the P&LE car that -- this is just not the case, isn't that true?"
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1355.208,1365.791,"Of course it's not the case and they -- the principle for which I contend is that the employer-carrier, if it's going to send its employees to work on other lines, has to exercise the same precaution."
1962.414,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1414.51,1417.443,[Inaudible]
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1417.443,1425.681,"The instructions are not in the printed transcript, Mr. Justice Goldberg for the reason which counsel for respondent explained at page 20 of his brief."
1962.414,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1433.091,1437.4,[Inaudible]
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1437.4,1438.335,No.
1962.414,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1444.498,1446.591,[Inaudible]
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1446.591,1450.72,I'm embarrassed sir to say that I do not have the copy myself.
1962.414,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1522.579,1532.067,"Apart from that Mr. Wright, have you said as I understand you to say, you did not think this fellow was in the Sinkler line of authority?"
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1532.067,1533.729,"I do not, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1962.414,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1533.729,1536.226,Would you mind saying why?
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1536.226,1546.59,I think that if a P&LE employee had been injured here because of some defect and the mail truck perhaps of the B&O then we would have Sinkler type case.
1962.414,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1589.656,1597.401,"In other words, you're -- what you're saying here is P&LE is in the position of the employer on that case?"
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1597.401,1598.004,Yes.
1962.414,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1598.004,1601.547,And Baltimore is in the position of the Belt line?
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1601.547,1603.451,Yes.
1962.414,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1603.451,1606.872,[Inaudible]
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1606.872,1608.485,"Yes, I believe so, Your Honor."
1962.414,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1608.485,1609.174,[Inaudible]
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1609.174,1609.479,No.
1962.414,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1609.479,1611.537,[Inaudible]
1962.414,0,20273,charles_alan_wright,,1611.537,1614.16,I cannot believe so.
1962.414,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1614.16,1618.904,Mr. Hadden.
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,1618.904,1623.195,"May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice."
1962.414,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1843.118,1854.173,Mr. Hadden --
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,1854.173,1854.411,"Yes, sir?"
1962.414,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1854.411,1854.626,[Inaudible]
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,1854.626,1856.662,"That's as I understand it, yes sir."
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1873.791,1895.06,"Is your point of this form Mr. Hadden that even if the majority meant -- majority has even purported to nevertheless as a matter of internal administration, the Circuits are at liberty to give through majority the meaning they gave it here namely absolute majority of the total number of active judges?"
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,1895.06,1897.272,"My point does go that far, Your Honor."
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2133.2,2136.031,"But that he did work at the station itself, I gather that's --"
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2136.031,2136.161,Yes.
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2136.161,2138.127,His full-time employment was at the station?
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2138.127,2138.801,That's correct.
1962.414,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2192.835,2196.688,[Inaudible]
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2196.688,2210.411,"Well, that can be hypothesis, Your Honor but I assume that there probably would be telephone calls from the P&LE to the B&O station agent who would then relay them to petitioner and say, “Please go and load train X.”"
1962.414,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2210.411,2212.932,[Inaudible]
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2212.932,2213.437,Yes.
1962.414,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2213.437,2214.333,[Inaudible]
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2214.333,2221.017,To the extent that it may not have been scheduled routinely.
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2236.512,2239.101,"Incidentally, that's not a Safety Appliance Act Claim, is it?"
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2239.101,2242.431,"No, sir it is not a claim that it is."
1962.414,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2285.4,2288.72,[Inaudible]
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2288.72,2299.056,"There is only sentence in the record that touches upon that but in the interest -- plaintiffs own testimony and I believe the only interest from it is that they came from the United States Post Office, Your Honor."

1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2303.045,2306.084,"No, sir from the New Castle Post Office --"
1962.414,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2306.084,2308.076,Post office [Inaudible]
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2308.076,2308.763,"Yes, sir."

1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2310.967,2314.987,"Yes, sir, I -- I've forgotten that important part and I'll try to find it."
1962.414,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2314.987,2316.764,[Inaudible]
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2316.764,2317.204,Alright.
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2318.366,2323.237,"It is in the record, yes, right at the beginning of petitioner's testimony."
1962.414,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2386.53,2395.758,"Well, is it your position that the moment he left the B&O property and entered the P&LE property that he was on his own --"
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2395.758,2395.95,No sir.
1962.414,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2395.95,2397.841,-- so far as B&O is concerned --
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2397.841,2398.11,No sir.
1962.414,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2398.11,2400.642,-- and that he owed -- that it owed him no responsibility?
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2400.642,2401.315,"No, sir."
1962.414,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2401.315,2404.019,What responsibility did it owe?
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2404.019,2422.359,"Your Honor, this comes down to an interpretation of this Court's many decisions in the field as to what is meant by the non-delegable duty of care which is imposed upon a railroad under the Federal Employers' Liability Act to see that its employees have a reason to which they are placed to work."
1962.414,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2532.565,2543.824,"If that conviction had existed on a B&O train and petitioner had been injured under the same circumstances, would the B&O have been liable?"
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2543.824,2546.286,"Jury issues would surely have been presented, yes, sir."
1962.414,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2546.286,2550.473,[Inaudible]
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2550.473,2562.621,"Well, I would say, Your Honor as to that question, the duty to inspect under our negligence statute is a duty which must be governed by the circumstances confronting the parties."
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2586.669,2589.826,There isn't much you can do about that on the street --
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2589.826,2590.292,We're not --
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.292,2592.389,-- to control other drivers but there's a (Voice Overlap) --
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2592.389,2593.954,"Well, suppose it had been -- suppose there had --"
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.954,2595.824,-- by the stuck door.
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2595.824,2600.523,A stuck door on the mail truck for example which is a case that I have hypothesized on the briefs.
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2600.523,2601.467,"But Mr. Hadden, I --"
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2601.467,2602.057,Yes sir.
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2602.057,2609.261,I would suppose that B&O has been in the railroad business long enough who had much experience with stuck doors.
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2609.261,2610.78,I would assume they would know where the stuck door is (Voice Overlap) --
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2610.78,2626.039,"Well, now if it did, I would suppose if it -- he's going to assign one of its employees to work on railroad cars of P&LE which might get stuck doors, it might have some duty to look out for whether -- inspect in advance would it not?"
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2632.499,2635.057,"As to stuck doors, I am at loss to answer the question."
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2635.964,2636.226,You've made --
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2636.226,2643.52,"-- but in the ordinary course of events, a stuck door is going to become apparent to employees of the B&O if it's a B&O car."
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2643.52,2654.114,"Well, would you say -- would you say that if this had been a B&O car that you'll be making the same argument?"
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2654.114,2657.908,I would make the argument -- in the first -- if this were B&O car --
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2657.908,2663.19,"(Voice Overlap) set before the first instance, the first time this car had ever come through this town."
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2663.19,2663.492,I was --
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2663.492,2665.178,This fellow never been on that car before --
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2665.178,2676.957,"I would make that -- the same argument with probably somewhat less assurance, Your Honor, but I would make the same argument if it is a car in the possession in the ownership of the B&O."
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.713,2691.677,What more (Voice Overlap) -- what more duties does B&O got to inspect its own car than some other cars having an employee working on it or what --
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2691.677,2691.871,I don't --
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2691.871,2696.499,-- or chances it got to discover that stuck door on its own cars than in somebody else's cars?
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2696.499,2702.082,I don't think that there is any greater duty of care but the duty is one that's continuous.
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2743.893,2756.199,"Let's assume that both the baggage man, the P&LE baggage man and the petitioner were injured by the same stuck door at the same time."
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2762.096,2766.398,"Well, that carries me to another aspect of my arguments, Your Honor."
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2771.91,2773.077,"Yes, that's -- exactly."
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2773.077,2775.87,And I'll -- an argument which we make in our brief --
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2775.87,2781.495,Suppose there was a -- suppose the P&LE should've known that the door is fixed.
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2781.495,2782.563,There was evidence --
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2782.563,2783.725,[Inaudible] they shouldn't stick?
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2783.725,2788.091,"No, there was evidence that the door had stuck and it's been reported and not repaired."
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2788.091,2801.133,"Mr. Hadden, haven't we had some clinker cases where we've said that employees stumbling over clinkers could recover at least where the railroad didn't show it had some kind of inspection procedure?"
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2801.133,2801.508,There's one --
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2801.508,2808.007,No inspection procedures whatever that -- was there any question of the right of the employee to recover?
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2808.007,2820.13,There are clinker cases which hold I recall that through issues are presented from the bare evidence that the clinker was precedent in a place where employees were required to (Voice Overlap).
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2820.13,2824.613,And there was no evidence at least of any inspection procedures to discover it?
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2824.613,2836.827,"Well, necessarily since it's our own premises, we're talking about in your hypothetical case, it's we who created the defect and I think that furnishes the gravamen of the offense of negligence."
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2836.827,2845.841,"Well, I thought we had one of them where all the clinkers are suppose to come from a locomotive of -- on some adjoining track."
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2845.841,2846.704,I'm not as --
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2846.704,2847.259,Well --
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2847.259,2848.609,"-- familiar with that case, Your Honor."
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2848.609,2852.728,"The instructions in this case were adequate, you think [Inaudible]"
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2852.728,2865.22,"Our position is, Your Honor, as to the instructions that they do not state the correct test of legal liability and that if that test had been applied, the case would not have gone to the jury."
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.22,2868.334,You didn't think it should've been -- had gone to the jury at all?
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2868.334,2873.999,"Well, the instruction said and I do have them here and can provide the Court with a copy if you'd like to have them."
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2897.65,2902.6,"Well, I don't gather Mr. Wright urges that theory of recovery here."
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2902.6,2903.875,I'm not sure I understand Mr. Justice.
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2903.875,2907.719,"I say, I don't think Mr. Wright urges that theory of recovery either here."
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2918.219,2931.117,"That that -- that I gather is his basic position and our position -- our answer to that is, if he will stand up and tell us how as reasonable operatives of railroads, we are going to discharge that obligations."
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2934.895,2942.697,"But you're not asking or urging any error of the law are you, in the instructions or anything else?"
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2942.697,2944.229,No sir.
1962.414,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2944.449,2954.458,So really what you're saying is that there's no evidence whatsoever in this record to sustain the finding that the railroad failed in its duty of exercising reasonable care?
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,2954.458,2957.231,That's correct Your Honor.
1962.414,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3064.418,3064.664,Is that the issue --
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3064.664,3066.309,(Voice Overlap) -- have we had any issue here --
1962.414,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3066.309,3066.636,"Yes, (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3066.636,3068.763,-- as to the liability of P&LE?
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,3068.763,3069.593,"No, sir, we don't."
1962.414,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3101.04,3104.881,What you're suggesting is he had a better case against the P&LE than against you?
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,3104.881,3107.392,"He had a pretty near perfect case, I would say, yes, sir."
1962.414,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3107.392,3107.656,[Inaudible]
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,3107.656,3108.086,Yes sir.
1962.414,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3108.086,3114.257,[Inaudible]
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,3114.257,3114.652,That's right [Inaudible]
1962.414,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3114.652,3119.652,[Inaudible] is the one who made the motion for [Inaudible] for P&LE.
1962.414,1,16265,alexander_h_hadden,,3119.652,3120.631,That's correct Your Honor.
1962.414,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3487.097,3491.949,"If the Court please, I have only three points I wish to make in rebuttal."
1962.414,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3523.705,3528.347,"Mr. Wright, [Inaudible] P&LE?"
1962.414,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3528.347,3532.985,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I wouldn't think that the appeals did -- much chance of success."
1962.414,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3549.957,3554.647,"Well, in any event the reason in appeal was not taken was that you thought was not meritorious?"
1962.414,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3554.647,3557.508,"Yes, I think -- we did not think it would win."
1962.414,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3666.481,3671.257,Do the -- does the -- how -- did it show how long the car was there in the station?
1962.414,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3671.257,3674.784,"Only a very few minutes, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1962.414,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3674.784,3674.928,Or there --
1962.414,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3674.928,3680.012,Perhaps two or three minutes before he loaded it and maybe five minutes in all as I understand the record.
1962.414,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3680.012,3682.086,"Was this a what, a passenger train?"
1962.414,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3682.086,3684.327,I would gather that it was from this number of (Voice Overlap) --
1962.414,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3684.327,3685.723,"This is a mail car, wasn't it?"
1962.414,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3685.723,3687.521,"A mail car, yes sir."
1962.414,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3687.521,3691.975,Was there any evidence the car had ever been -- through there before?
1962.414,2,20273,charles_alan_wright,,3691.975,3698.059,I think the record is silent on that point.
