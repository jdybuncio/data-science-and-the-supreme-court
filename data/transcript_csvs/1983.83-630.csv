1983.83-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.638,We will hear arguments next in Bernal against Fainter et al.--
1983.83-630,0,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,35.782,39.594,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.83-630,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,216.023,220.396,Do those functions differ much from the functions of notaries public generally?
1983.83-630,0,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,220.396,223.583,"No, they are rather similar to the functions of notary publics."
1983.83-630,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.685,248.087,"Mr. Hitchcock, what difference does it make that the notaries public in Texas are constitutional officers--"
1983.83-630,0,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,248.087,249.275,In our view--
1983.83-630,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.275,253.008,"--as opposed to statutory authorization, such as in Griffiths?"
1983.83-630,0,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,253.008,263.519,"--In our view, Justice O'Connor, there is no difference between the fact that an office is created in the constitution and the fact that the office, such as commissioner of the superior court, is created by statute."
1983.83-630,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.519,268.704,"Well, does it indicate that the state considers the office more important?"
1983.83-630,0,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,268.704,274.202,I would say it indicates that the state does consider the office slightly more important.
1983.83-630,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,672.324,674.245,Do you think all those cases are consistent?
1983.83-630,0,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,674.245,682.492,"Well, I think that if some of the cases had come out differently we would have an easier time in this case, Justice Blackmun."
1983.83-630,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,705.279,714.432,"I suppose it's fair to say the Court's been cutting back from what, a more extreme position taken in Griffiths?"
1983.83-630,0,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,714.432,723.99,"Well, the restrictions have... the last three cases have applied a more deferential standard and have upheld the restrictions."
1983.83-630,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,737.454,746.654,Do you think this case can stand without Griffiths in effect being overruled?
1983.83-630,0,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,746.654,751.84,"No, Griffiths would have to be overruled in order for the state to prevail in this particular action."
1983.83-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,787.387,789.403,"Well, how about roads?"
1983.83-630,0,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,792.947,801.803,"Well, they've always been performed... they are public works, but it's not exercising the sovereign function of the government that goes to--"
1983.83-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,801.803,805.864,You mean the building of a road is not exercising a sovereign power?
1983.83-630,0,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,805.864,813.985,"--Not in the sense that it has been used in the descriptions, in the standards set forth in the decisions of the Court."
1983.83-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,820.951,823.419,Governments always have to hire people to do their work.
1983.83-630,0,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,831.806,842.537,"Chief Justice Burger, the difference tends to be, as the Court recognized in Sugarman, that there are differences between the functions that are performed by different state employees."
1983.83-630,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,910.26,0.0,Ms. Keller.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,916.508,920.178,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.83-630,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,970.535,973.034,Of what significance is that?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,973.034,987.575,"Your Honor, the significance is that historically Texas has considered the office of notary public to be a public office, one that the state gives high regard to."
1983.83-630,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1003.458,1009.221,"Does the holder get a special title, so that you call him Mr. Notary Public> [""] instead of Mr. Jones> [""]?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1009.221,1013.674,--I'm certain that a notary could insist on it.
1983.83-630,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1017.172,1020.671,"And yet, in your state most lawyers are called ""Judge"", aren't they?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1023.608,1025.483,"That is true, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1029.339,1034.993,"There are quite a few more notaries today than six per county, I take it?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1038.742,1042.35,"--Yes, Your Honor, there are quite a few more notaries."
1983.83-630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1043.522,1046.381,"For instance, how many today in the State of Texas?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1046.381,1050.862,"--I believe, reading Petitioner's brief, that there are in excess of 100,000."
1983.83-630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1057.736,1062.576,"Well, let's say the significance of the office has been diluted somewhat."
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1062.576,1063.685,--There are many more--
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1081.835,1086.083,May I go back to the 1845 constitution for a minute.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1094.376,1097.141,"Yes, Your Honor, until 1940."
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1097.141,1098.265,Until 1940.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1098.265,1098.952,Yes.
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.952,1101.358,That must have been a busy legislature.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1101.358,1102.264,Very busy legislature.
1983.83-630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1138.89,1148.606,In what ways do the actual functions and authority of notaries in Texas differ from those in Connecticut?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1153.181,1159.96,"Your Honor, I am not completely familiar with the functions of notaries in other states."
1983.83-630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1161.395,1166.627,"Well, I picked in Connecticut because of course that is where Griffiths was decided."
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1166.627,1167.049,--Right.
1983.83-630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1167.049,1170.314,And it might be closely reviewed.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1170.314,1170.767,Yes.
1983.83-630,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1206.705,1208.33,Is that special to Texas?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1208.33,1222.465,"--Your Honor, I found it to be very unusual, because, as we all know, there are deeds and mortgages that need to be recorded every day, and to limit it to three officeholders seemed unusual to me."
1983.83-630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1222.465,1225.293,And that isn't true in most states in your view?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1225.293,1227.416,"As far as I know not, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1230.929,1235.443,And who else was authorized in Connecticut that you found in your review?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1235.443,1237.833,"I'm don't know, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1241.316,1261.2,"Well, I would suspect that everybody on this bench has been a notary public at one time or another, and I would suspect that their certificates read something like this: That I, so and so, governor of the state of, imposing special trust and confidence in, do hereby appoint you a notary public."
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1265.369,1272.678,"--The only response I can make to that, Your Honor, is that Texas takes it seriously."
1983.83-630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1310.163,1313.459,I don't recall from the record here.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1317.612,1318.628,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1318.628,1321.862,"That's true in most of the states, is it?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1321.862,1323.675,I believe it is true in most states.
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.602,1350.163,"Well, I suppose a lawyer can be sued for malpractice, too."
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1353.599,1355.52,"No, Your Honor, absolutely not."
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1359.41,1363.939,Do you think that the notary has a more significant function to play in Texas than a lawyer does?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1363.939,1366.938,It's not a question of significance of the function.
1983.83-630,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1406.406,1408.577,"What is that fee, incidentally?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1408.577,1411.482,50 cents per notarial act.
1983.83-630,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1411.482,1412.435,50 cents?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1412.435,1412.997,"That's right, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1417.262,1420.714,"Well, other states are less than that and some are higher."
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1420.714,1422.635,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1983.83-630,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1422.635,1427.46,"I say other states are less than that and some are higher, so that Texas isn't very special in that regard."
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1427.46,1447.92,"It's not special, but the point is I think that the fee reflects the Texas perception that it be basically a function that a private individual performs on the behest of the state, but it is not an occupation."
1983.83-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1449.67,1452.435,Do judges have to be citizens in Texas?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1452.435,1457.964,"The judges in Texas are elected, Your Honor, and as part of the election--"
1983.83-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1457.964,1458.808,"Well, the question was--"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1458.808,1460.65,"--Yes, Your Honor, yes."
1983.83-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1460.65,1462.76,--The statute says they have to be citizens?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1462.76,1463.478,"Yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1463.478,1465.837,Do the lawyers?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1468.944,1470.46,"I don't know that, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1471.974,1473.785,Lawyers don't have to?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1473.785,1477.503,"Lawyers do not have to be, Your Honor, absolutely."
1983.83-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1477.503,1481.251,Do you consider your profession below a notary's?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1484.359,1487.686,"As I said, Your Honor, it's not a question of what's more important."
1983.83-630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1518.94,1522.984,Is the lawyer an officer of the court in Texas?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1522.984,1527.92,--I believe that... I don't know that.
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1547.396,1549.598,What about a prosecutor?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1550.223,1584.289,"Well, to the extent that Ambach makes distinctions between public school teachers and private school teachers, it may be that a state could designate certain attorneys as public officeholders and require that they be citizens."
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1584.289,1585.538,"No, that wasn't my question."
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1585.538,1586.101,"Oh, excuse me."
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1586.101,1588.444,"As a matter of Texas law, must a prosecutor be a citizen?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1588.444,1589.615,"No, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1599.096,1601.189,But he could hire assistant prosecutors who are not?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1601.189,1601.798,"--Yes, Your Honor, he could."
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1627.367,1639.128,"Well, I suppose there would be some jobs in which you would not be eligible for the position if you weren't a notary."
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1645.5,1659.713,"Your Honor, hypothetically it might, but the record before this Court includes two plaintiffs, one who became a citizen before we got here and the other who is still before the Court."
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1794.143,1800.048,"I'm sorry, but before you leave the first point about what the rational basis is, tell me again, what is the reason for it?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1802.531,1814.884,--Texas has given great amounts of authority to its notaries.
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1814.884,1818.086,I thought that's how you got to the rational basis standard.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1819.555,1820.787,"Well, Your Honor, my first threshold--"
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1820.787,1822.334,"Once you get there, why do you have to have citizenship?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1822.334,1826.537,--My first threshold is is it a governmental function.
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.537,1827.942,"Yes, and if we answer--"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1827.942,1829.94,And it's a governmental function apart from its duties.
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1836.172,1841.312,"--Yes, but once we get there we would say, now, having agreed with you on that, we say now we've got to find out what the rational basis is."
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1841.312,1842.092,Right.
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1842.092,1844.592,You can't say the rational basis is that it's a governmental function.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1844.592,1861.851,"The rational basis in Ambach and Cabell was, yes, it's a governmental function; is that function so essential to government that the legal bond of citizenship is required?"
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.528,1889.354,"Well, you're not suggesting notaries form policy, are you?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1889.354,1890.916,Notaries do not form policy.
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1890.916,1893.259,"Well now, what is the reason why they have to be citizens?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1894.15,1898.898,Texas has given notaries a great deal of authority.
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1899.523,1902.364,That's why it's a governmental function.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1902.364,1904.113,"--Yes, and I'm going to clarify it right now."
1983.83-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1929.651,1932.228,And it's so important that it's worth 50 cents.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1934.369,1941.209,"Your Honor, I think the notary is very similar, similarly situated to a juror."
1983.83-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1943.115,1945.755,"Well, even at that, a juror gets more than 50 cents."
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1947.081,1948.706,--Well this is just for one little act.
1983.83-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1961.123,1962.122,They get more than 50 cents.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1962.122,1967.792,"Well, they get ten dollars a whole day, I think, or something like that."
1983.83-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1967.792,1970.884,But they get more than 50 cents.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,1971.118,1972.774,"Yes, Your Honor, they get more than 50 cents."
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1999.123,2022.755,"Well, Ms. Keller, if we go along with you to the point that Justice Stevens took you and then said, so why does it have to be, why is citizenship required, in Cabell at that very point the Court inquired whether the position in question involves discretionary decisionmaking or execution of policy."
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2033.171,2034.061,"All right, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2034.061,2039.075,"Because that's part of the argument on the other side, is that this is wholly ministerial."
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2039.075,2064.3,"In Texas, as I was saying, under state law, in performing one of its important functions, which is preparing documents for recordation, the notary has the right to issue subpoenas to witnesses, and if they fail to come or fail to answer properly the notary has the right to punish them for contempt."
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2071.842,2080.871,And what does that... when does the notary get involved in this function?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2080.871,2087.946,"--As part of the statutory scheme for authenticating documents to be recorded, there are--"
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2087.946,2092.663,"If the notary disbelieves somebody, he can get some witnesses, is that it?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2092.663,2096.412,--There are two ways to record instruments.
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.489,2100.005,Yes.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2100.005,2107.237,"In the event that it's already been signed and the person is deceased, there is a proof of written instrument."
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.237,2109.861,"So he holds... in effect, takes some evidence?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2109.861,2111.25,"That's right, Your Honor, absolutely."
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2111.25,2113.531,Holds a... and makes a judgment.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2113.531,2118.512,"That's right, makes a judgment about whether or not this is the person who signed it, it's an authentic document."
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.475,2140.099,Is there anything else about the notary's job that involves some sort of discretionary decisionmaking?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2140.099,2150.406,"In taking affidavits, the notary is allowed to... is authorized by law to take oaths."
1983.83-630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2173.412,2194.638,"Suppose two or three people come into a notary and they present a deed of a conveyance, and one of the persons being requested to sign, perhaps the wife of one of them, exhibits great reluctance."
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2208.647,2213.287,"Yes, Your Honor, and that is another area where the notary exercises a great deal of discretion."
1983.83-630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2213.287,2235.824,"In Texas do they, as in some states in the past, are they required to take the oath of a husband and a wife separately, out of the presence of each other, so that they can determine whether the wife is making the husband sign or the husband is making the wife sign against their free will?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2235.824,2241.603,"Your Honor, that had been in the Texas statutory scheme, but it has been repealed."
1983.83-630,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2244.524,2249.334,But the notary must make a judgment as to whether or not the person is acting of his or her own free will?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2249.334,2250.209,That's absolutely correct.
1983.83-630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2262.282,2273.185,"Is that aspect of the notary's duty different, do you suppose, than that of other states, such as Connecticut?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2273.185,2295.254,"The ability to hold a person in contempt of court is one that I think is unusual and, looking at some of the publications of the American Association of Notaries, it does not appear to me that that is a standard authority given to notaries."
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2305.624,2311.528,Do you cite in your brief any cases in Texas in which a notary has held anybody in contempt of court?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2311.528,2312.7,"We do not, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.327,2348.951,And there has been no case in the last 40 years on it?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2348.951,2353.527,There have been no reported cases in the last 40 years that I have been able to find on this issue.
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.527,2357.963,"What does a notary do when he commits, when he finds somebody in contempt?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2361.806,2362.431,That's right.
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.431,2363.353,And what is it?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2366.274,2373.319,"Well, I suppose it depends on... it's a civil contempt until they're purged."
1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2375.787,2383.361,"May I ask, just to refresh my recollection, what are the qualifications to be a notary in Texas, beside being a citizen?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2383.361,2386.034,You must be over the age of 18.
1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2386.034,2386.75,Yes.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2386.75,2389.17,A resident of the State of Texas.
1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2389.17,2389.842,Yes.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2389.842,2401.666,"The Secretary of State, in making appointments, has to be convinced that there is no good cause... that there is good cause to appoint you."
1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2401.666,2404.665,What does that consist of?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2404.665,2406.773,"Basically, you cannot be appointed if you have committed a crime of moral turpitude?"
1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2406.773,2407.398,Ma'am?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2407.398,2411.256,You cannot be appointed if you have committed a crime of moral turpitude.
1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2411.256,2415.224,Do you have to present a court record or affidavit?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2417.161,2423.127,You certify on your application that there is no reason under law that you would be excluded.
1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2423.127,2429.921,Do you have to have any documentation from other people or is your certification accepted?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2429.921,2431.967,"I believe the certification is accepted, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2431.967,2433.029,Who appoints you?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2433.029,2437.558,"You're appointed by... now, since 1940, you're appointed by the Secretary of State."

1983.83-630,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2445.663,2448.241,And the notary need not know how to read or write.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2451.177,2456.519,--The notary... the requirement to be a notary does not include that.
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2472.309,2482.868,I don't see any requirement that somebody be able to read and write in connection with an awful lot of official positions.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2482.868,2485.757,That's probably... that is certainly true.
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2490.082,2494.675,Or maybe for the Senators and Congressman of the United States.

1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2552.104,2558.445,And the only evidence of character is the filling out of a form by the applicant himself or herself?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2558.445,2559.648,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2559.648,2561.366,How much is the bond?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2561.366,2563.866,"$2,500."
1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2563.866,2566.099,Does an insurance company put that up?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2566.099,2567.911,I believe they're... it's a bonding company.
1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2567.911,2569.098,And what is the premium?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2569.098,2570.847,"I don't know that, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2570.847,2572.799,And what is the term of a notary?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2572.799,2573.424,Four years.
1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2573.424,2574.189,Four years.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2577.298,2577.845,"Oh, yes."
1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2588.419,2590.247,Is it a political plum in Texas?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2590.247,2592.636,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1983.83-630,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2592.636,2594.339,Is it a political plum in Texas?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2594.339,2597.962,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2656.954,2659.313,Let me ask one other question about that contempt power.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2659.921,2661.499,"That is by statute, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2661.499,2663.045,And you cite that statute in your brief?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2663.045,2664.217,It is not specifically.
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2665.076,2666.403,I didn't see it in your brief.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2666.403,2670.449,--The statutory authority is 6618.
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.477,2681.272,Is this a statute you did not cite in your brief?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2681.272,2683.365,--Not specifically cited.
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2687.318,2688.318,I see.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2691.692,0.0,Yes.
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2692.614,2695.003,"And it was executed, exercised some 40 years ago?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2699.362,2700.61,It's not before the statute was passed.
1983.83-630,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2704.953,2706.5,In the notary law?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2706.5,2707.608,Presumably it's exercised on a daily basis.
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2708.514,2713.621,When was the provision about contempt in connection with a deposition put into the statute?
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2714.762,2718.322,"It's an old statute, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2720.431,2725.225,"Is that true, the only contempt case you can give us is one that was lost?"
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2725.225,2730.66,"--That's the only challenge to it by habeas corpus, Your Honor, that I have been able to find."
1983.83-630,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2730.66,2733.816,Is that the only contempt case that you can give us--
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2733.816,2737.486,"It's the only reported case involving the contempt power that I have been able to find, yes, Your Honor."
1983.83-630,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2737.486,2739.345,--It's so well established it's never been challenged.
1983.83-630,1,36135,mary_f_keller,,2739.345,2740.579,That's right.
1983.83-630,2,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,2742.032,2748.576,Mr. Chief Justice:
