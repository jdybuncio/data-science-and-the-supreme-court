1983.80_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.837,We will hear arguments first this morning in State of Colorado against the State of New Mexico.
1983.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,12.491,15.693,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.80_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,226.761,258.132,"Mr. Simms, on the first point and the way in which water can be augmented, how can New Mexico legitimately claim that nonuse over a thirty-year period never becomes in effect an abandonment of the use of a certain portion of the water?"
1983.80_orig,0,40584,richard_a_simms,,268.004,279.211,"Not at all, and I think the Court's first instruction to the Master in the first area of evidence taking suggests the answer to the question, Justice O'Connor."
1983.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,1426.987,1431.772,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.80_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1747.794,1760.118,"Mr. Welborn, let's assume that the Master was justified in finding that Colorado was entitled to some allocation out of the Vermejo."
1983.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,1766.005,1766.772,"Yes, sir."
1983.80_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1766.772,1781.515,"How is that going to work, say, if another year like 1974 comes along which Table 2 to the Master's Report shows that the annual flow at the Dawson checkpoint was 3,040?"
1983.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,1781.515,1789.705,"Well, the Colorado diversion... There are two or three factors there, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.80_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1813.486,1821.14,But isn't the Dawson checkpoint made up largely of water that you would call the Colorado production?
1983.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,1821.14,1834.317,"Well, it is, yes, but it is made up also of water coming in below the border, and as I say Colorado contributes roughly half to the total figure."
1983.80_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1850.676,1854.813,"How about a year where the Dawson gauge says 3,040?"
1983.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,1854.813,1878.346,"In such a year from here on, Justice Rehnquist, the District will be completely protected for this reason, the stock water situation, which has now as a result of recent developments come to fruition, but the District gave first priority according to its own witness, Mr. Moots, in his testimony gave first priority to the stock water."
1983.80_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1909.548,1923.224,"Are you saying then that you think the records supports the finding that New Mexico's demand could be satisfied with 3,000 acre-feet?"
1983.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,1923.224,1927.192,"Well, I would suggest this, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.80_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2061.965,2065.082,Is that because they are not lined with concrete or something?
1983.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2065.082,2075.022,There is no particular testimony except that the silting in the canals and the debris that seems to collect in the canals.
1983.80_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2079.676,2082.276,That might be quite uneconomical.
1983.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2082.276,2088.715,"No, there is no suggestion of that, and in this report it is simply the matter of cleaning up the canals."
1983.80_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.778,2201.371,"Mr. Welborn, what about Mr. Simms' point that their underutilization in the sixties or from '55 for ten years was excusable because it was a period of development?"
1983.80_orig,1,40798,robert_f_welborn,,2201.371,2217.148,"--Well, I suggest, Justice White, that there was not... According to this table, this New Mexico exhibit, there was not any underutilization then as compared with the later period based on the acreage irrigated."
1983.80_orig,2,40584,richard_a_simms,,3329.914,3349.645,"There is an extremely important point with regard to this 2,000 acre-feet that Colorado has talked about a great deal being conserved from the closed pipeline that was put in by New Mexico users, two very critical points."
