2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.072,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-608, United States v. Hayes."
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,6.887,21.817,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent's conviction for battering his wife is a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence primarily for two reasons: First, the statutory text is most naturally read that way."
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,66.455,71.735,"Well, Respondent says that may be because a lot of people in Congress wanted it to be a dead letter."
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,80.732,85.743,"--But Congress did act this statute, and this Court presumes two things: First--"
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,85.743,96.552,"Well, if it's a compromise with the people who wanted no statute at all and you come out with a statute that covers one-third of the States anyway, I mean that's, you know -- that's the deal."
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,96.552,101.38,"--There was a compromise made, but it wasn't with respect to whether there needed to be a domestic relationship element."
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,104.081,105.173,How do we know -- how do we know that?
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,105.173,108.656,"Well, if you look at the statute's drafting history, there were two versions considered."
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,120.074,125.603,But it also substituted this structure that we are -- that we are discussing today.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,127.604,128.275,The--
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.275,136.71,"So, why -- why say it's only the former provision that was the compromise and not the addition of this later language?"
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,136.71,145.019,"--Both the original structure and the statute as enacted had the same structure in that they had a ""committed by"" clause that modified the word ""offense""."
2008.07-608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,202.26,218.662,The suggestion was that Congress may have wanted to give an incentive to States to have special domestic violence statutes instead of punishing domestic abusers under a generic battery statute.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,218.662,233.308,"--I don't think that makes sense for two reasons: First, because when Congress wants to do that, it uses its spending power to give the States incentives to do things like that, and it did that in the VAWA enactment in 1994 and in VAWA re-authorization in 2005."
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,263.841,270.837,"Counsel, I understand your objection to the reading that your friend would have us adopt, but you have the same sort of problem."
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,289.423,297.248,"I don't think that that's right, with respect, Your Honor, because you have an offense that is of a certain character committed by a certain person."
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,297.248,299.046,But you've changed the word.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,307.137,311.696,"I think that the word ""offense"" is twice modified."
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,316.913,317.569,Okay.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,347.478,355.413,"--What I'm suggesting, Your Honor, is that the (i) and (ii) up to the break with ""committed by""."
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,368.36,368.922,Romanette?
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,368.922,371.044,"Oh, little Roman numeral."
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,371.044,372.373,I've never heard that before.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,374.791,376.339,"If you just look at this as a sentence, you have"
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.833,389.27,You can't.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,453.713,455.682,Two responses.
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,455.682,456.072,Nobody.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,456.072,457.211,"Two responses, Your Honor."
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.687,478.794,I wouldn't agree with that.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,498.397,501.334,"With respect, Your Honor, we think this can be read as all one sentence."
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,525.873,526.466,How do you -- I'm sorry.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,546.974,557.842,"We think that you'd say -- you'd have to say ""has as its elements"" to suggest that you would take two very diverse concepts and make them both required elements of the underlying offense."
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,570.417,582.35,"Well, but I thought the whole point of this was to get at violence committed by a family member, and if that's the critical element, you don't have to have two different elements, ""violence"" and then ""committed""."
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,585.068,599.262,"Well, with respect, Your Honor, we think that because Congress broke these up into these two different clauses -- one that relates to violence and then a separate clause that's introduced by ""committed by"" where ""committed"" naturally modifies ""offense"" -- that it was treating -- that these were two separate requirements."
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,615.039,627.721,"If we think that there are two awkward readings, yours and your friend's, and both of them require surgery, don't we resolve that under the rule of lenity?"
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,627.721,628.813,No.
2008.07-608,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,647.152,654.366,"What -- what -- what's been the underlying rationale for the rule of lenity, which is a rule I think we should apply with great caution?"
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,658.866,662.926,I think one of the -- the main concerns is providing fair notice of what's illegal.
2008.07-608,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,662.926,663.956,Fair notice.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,703.457,710.204,"Well certainly, Your Honor, we think that the statutory text is clear, and that's because people are presumed to know the law."
2008.07-608,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,713.39,714.092,"Well, but the rule--"
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,714.092,715.795,--the assault he was convicted of is one against his wife.
2008.07-608,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,715.795,716.092,--No.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,741.395,751.561,"Your Honor, it was at the time that this statute was enacted the case that very few States had statutes with a domestic relationship requirement, only 17."
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,776.938,778.752,"There was a small, a small number."
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,780.998,785.544,--I think it was a range of States.
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,788.465,789.682,"California, New York?"
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,789.682,791.963,"You know, I'd have to look at the list."
2008.07-608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,817.766,821.296,"May I ask -- may I ask, to make sure I understand the alternate reading."
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,848.409,849.407,--Yes.
2008.07-608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.676,865.824,"So your -- your reading -- I'm just following up on the Chief Justice's question -- requires us to assume that Congress really intended there to be a triple ""i"" as well as a double ""i"", and the triple ""i"" would have begun with the verb ""is""."
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,865.824,872.227,"--I think that that's one way of doing it, but I don't think that you have to do that, because if you look at the structure of this sentence--"
2008.07-608,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.227,877.086,"But it is true, is it not, that if you did do it that way, it would have been a lot clearer than it is now?"
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,877.086,880.771,--There are ways that Congress could have made its manifest intent even more clear.
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,899.419,905.119,I want to follow up on Justice Kennedy's inquiry about the rule of lenity.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,949.804,951.227,There were five firearms.
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,954.787,956.491,"Well, he could have ten, couldn't he?"
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,956.491,958.851,"Well, we would hope that he wouldn't in this situation."
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,959.225,959.662,Why?
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,959.662,963.363,"--Because he has been convicted of a serious violent offense, and I think that's--"
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.363,971.735,"But -- but for this language that you say makes his owning of a firearm unlawful, it wouldn't be unlawful at all, would it?"
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,975.107,981.215,--I think that a person who has been committed of a violent offense should be on notice that their procession of firearms--
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,981.215,981.62,Should be.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,982.716,983.839,--Yes.
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,983.839,988.072,A misdemeanor -- a misdemeanor offense.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,994.036,994.539,When--
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,994.539,996.27,I don't think anybody would assume that.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1006.596,1008.032,--I understand that concern.
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1016.341,1017.655,Make it clear.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1041.317,1043.517,"--Two thoughts on that, Your Honor."
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.721,1081.252,What -- a serious violent offense.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1084.765,1085.986,Yes.
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1085.986,1088.798,"And this was misdemeanor assault and battery, wasn't it?"
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1088.798,1089.734,"Yes, that's right."
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1091.859,1094.464,So it's not that serious an offense.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1095.95,1099.807,"--Well, I mean, certainly the offense is this particular case was serious."
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1106.71,1109.006,"Then he should have been charged with a felony, but he wasn't."
2008.07-608,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1110.644,1121.842,"Wasn't the -- wasn't the statute responding to just that problem, that domestic abuse tended to be charged as misdemeanors rather than felonies?"
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1137.071,1139.944,"--That's exactly right, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1268.535,1275.265,"Well, it seems there is no Federal misdemeanor that covers this particular type of assault, in other words?"
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1275.265,1278.545,--There is -- there is a general Federal assault statute.
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1278.545,1278.935,Right.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1278.935,1282.998,"But it doesn't have a domestic relationship requirement, and that's the problem."
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1307.596,1313.656,"I think -- I think that people are governed by the law that is passed, not by the law that Congress intended to pass."
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1313.656,1315.969,"--That's exactly right, Justice--"
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.969,1323.404,"So, really, if a lawyer reading this would not think that it applied, I don't care what Congress intended."
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1334.46,1335.929,"--Of course not, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-608,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1335.929,1336.288,Of course.
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1336.288,1343.332,"We look to the text first, but we also look to other indicia -- many of us also look to other indicia of Congress's intent."
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1354.749,1356.999,"Well, how does that relate to the rule of lenity?"
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1377.257,1389.424,"This Court has in -- in multiple cases looked to the fact that the statute, for example, would have such a narrow, limited purpose, in addition to the statute's text, to say, you know, we can't believe Congress would expect that purpose--"
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1389.424,1399.886,So the lawyer advising his client in the typical assault case is supposed to know at the time that only 17 States had this type of provision?
2008.07-608,0,37291,nicole_saharsky,,1399.886,1410.164,"--I think it was well known at the time that these offenses, even in the 17 States that had the domestic relationship element, were commonly prosecuted as assault and battery offenses."
2008.07-608,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1446.851,1448.305,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1453.43,1463.471,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: The fundamental flaw in the Government's argument is that it describes a statute that Congress considered but did not pass."
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.068,1493.645,"Well, wait."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1507.672,1517.729,"There is nothing that speaks to the words in the House of Representatives in the Congressional Record, Your Honor, but their inaction and the lack of words speak very loudly."
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1545.454,1565.774,"--But the other side says that the reason that was the case was that they objected to the fact that -- what was its language -- the -- the old version did not say a ""misdemeanor crime of domestic violence""."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1567.506,1574.412,"It certainly was broader, but there was nothing -- and there was no one that spoke in the House of Representatives on that matter."
2008.07-608,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1589.795,1600.398,"I thought it was that the use of force -- to make it clear is a misdemeanor -- had to involve a use of force, and that wasn't clear before, right?"
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1600.398,1601.791,The--
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.791,1604.726,Where -- where is the earlier version?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1606.633,1607.086,--Yes.
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1607.086,1608.178,--in the materials in front of us?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1608.178,1612.786,"Appendix B, page 5a of the red brief -- I'm sorry."
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1615.926,1617.205,Thank you.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1617.205,1618.593,I apologize.
2008.07-608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1618.593,1629.434,"While we pause, can I just ask you one question to make sure I understand the two -- two different positions?"
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1653.361,1654.832,No.
2008.07-608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1659.281,1666.764,Why would you need that in there if the statute means -- if the element is the use of force by a family member?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1669.591,1676.603,"Well, because that's who -- that's who it would -- that's who it would address to."
2008.07-608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1684.866,1686.239,"Well, I'm not interested in changes."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1696.002,1704.375,"--I -- I don't know, Justice."
2008.07-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1705.638,1710.278,"Well, I agree with Justice Stevens."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1723.631,1734.533,"It would still include -- it would still include both attributes into the one element even if the word ""committed"" were removed from double ii, yes."
2008.07-608,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1736.062,1748.373,"As I read this old one -- as I read the first one, Senator Lautenberg put in the language, and his language in the first one was to say I'll tell you a group of people who shouldn't have guns."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1842.286,1848.785,The legislation that the Senator introduced was not the legislation that was passed by Congress.
2008.07-608,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1878.554,1879.865,That's the conclusion.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1908.151,1912.335,--By take -- by taking a look at the final passed legislation.
2008.07-608,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1912.335,1914.211,"No, I've got the words."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1925.548,1933.732,"Other than the fact that the structure of the statute also changed, and the structure of the statute changed--"
2008.07-608,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1933.732,1935.467,I don't want the text.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1937.592,1938.497,--What we have--
2008.07-608,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1938.497,1939.105,Okay.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1939.105,1946.916,"--And what is problematic here, Justice, is that the legislative history does not speak on this particular matter."
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1948.148,1950.554,Did this structure come from Senator Lautenberg?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1950.554,1951.381,"No, it did not."
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.381,1952.025,Where did it come from?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1952.025,1962.971,"It is -- it has to be presumed that it came from -- we don't know exactly where, but it came out of the House, and the House of Representatives on September 28th--"
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.971,1964.238,It came out of the House version.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,1969.172,1970.158,--No.
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.786,2002.332,So this language came from the House?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2002.332,2003.003,"--Yes, it did."
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.003,2008.486,"Excuse me, Senator Lautenberg would not have been the drafter of this language."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2008.486,2015.466,The -- Senator Lautenberg does not disagree that he came to an agreement on this language.
2008.07-608,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2015.466,2015.918,I'm sorry.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2030.381,2040.095,"Justice, as this Court has articulated in Allapattah, that sometimes there can be a strategic manipulation to secure results."
2008.07-608,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2040.095,2045.469,I'm not -- we're in -- the question specifically is where did the words come from?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2067.177,2070.444,They would have come from the House of Representatives.
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2070.444,2070.928,What do you mean would have?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2074.161,2074.988,Yes.
2008.07-608,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2074.988,2080.268,So the -- the -- the language on physical force came from the House?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2084.249,2085.267,Threatened use of--
2008.07-608,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2085.267,2087.077,It might have.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2089.249,2099.761,"--The use or attempted use of physical force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon language, including the words ""misdemeanor crime of domestic violence"" came over from the House."
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.761,2106.616,This very form that was ultimately enacted was the form that came over from the House to the Senate?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2106.616,2108.036,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-608,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2108.036,2109.522,Making progress.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2116.861,2119.174,"Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-608,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2119.174,2120.344,And how do we know that?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2120.344,2134.603,"Well, by the mere fact that they -- we don't have them speaking to it, because there was no actual congressional record of them speaking to it or someone taking to the floor in the House of Representatives."
2008.07-608,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2165.655,2181.74,"Other than a desire to weaken this bill as much as possible, can you think of any reason why Congress would have drawn the distinction that you're drawing between States that have specific statutes relating to domestic violence misdemeanor statutes and those that don't?"
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2181.74,2191.926,I don't think we can speak why certain States did or did not or why Congress would only want there to be 17.
2008.07-608,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2202.795,2207.263,What sense would it make for Congress to say take two abusers?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2226.881,2235.784,"It was -- the language that was ultimately agreed upon by the entire Congress, Your Honor, was as a result of a compromise."
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2237.126,2244.547,I suppose it gives greater assurance of what exactly the prior conviction was.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2278.936,2281.171,--You will know that.
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.151,2307.504,"I understand that -- that when someone purchases a firearm, they have to affirm, check a box, I have been convicted of a crime of domestic violence."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2338.645,2348.441,There are -- there are cases that are prosecuted in that manner where also lying on the form gives charge -- gives rise to a Federal offense.
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2370.072,2383.736,Does -- does it make clear whether the offense has to be domestic -- a domestic violence offense or whether an ordinary assault offense will qualify if as a matter of fact it was domestic?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2383.736,2392.123,"Well, it -- it -- the ATF regulation denotes that you should even put it down if it's going to be an assault and--"
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2392.123,2394.14,I don't understand what you've said.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2394.14,2405.761,"--The ATF regulation is in appendix F to your red brief, page 12 A."
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2405.761,2430.0,"Oh, and it's drafted the way the statute should have been drafted."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2449.868,2451.693,"That is correct, Your Honor, but that--"
2008.07-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2451.693,2455.787,It's drafted the way it should have been if your friends are correct.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2455.787,2466.827,"--That -- it's drafted the way -- it's drafted the way the original sponsor of the legislation would have wanted it to pass Congress, Your Honor -- or Chief Justice."
2008.07-608,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2466.827,2471.466,The -- the -- the statute uses the word element in the term singular.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2505.97,2518.666,"Well, I think that the -- the best advice is to take that of judge Sentelle's dissenting opinion in Barnes where element or elements is insignificant, the plural of it."
2008.07-608,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2523.572,2527.445,"Well, I mean when we are gasping for straws I'm not sure anything is insignificant."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2527.445,2540.765,"Well -- and in this particular matter, when in seeking -- if after seizing everything from which the aid can or may be derived, I think we can only guess as to Congress's intent."
2008.07-608,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2540.765,2552.028,"But suppose this statute, the one that was enacted, had the word ""if"" before ""committed""."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2564.381,2580.454,"Well, that may make it slightly even more vague, Justice, because then it's whether or not it's even part or parcel or whether it is or isn't part of it."
2008.07-608,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2582.892,2587.748,"""If committed"" would break from ""use of force""."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2609.521,2619.079,"--I don't believe that to use the word ""if"" changes our position, Justice--"
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2619.079,2619.672,"Well, sure it would."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2621.439,2622.297,"--Well, ""was"", if--"
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.297,2629.074,"--I mean, if you want to add words you can add ""if"", you can add ""as is"", you could rewrite the statute a lot of ways."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2629.074,2633.996,"--Well -- and one way is that this statute denotes that there is a part (c), of which there is no part (c)."
2008.07-608,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2686.77,2690.097,Do you really think there is a notice problem here?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2719.632,2734.687,"--I believe it would have been -- in 1993, '94 time period, it would have been very difficult -- it would have been, it should have been very easy to -- to advise Mr. Hayes with respect to that issue."
2008.07-608,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2769.982,2778.947,But if -- counsel advising Mr. Hayes surely would have looked at what was the uniform position in all the circuits.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2799.281,2814.07,"And Justice Ginsburg, the only reason I say that in this particular case, is because Mr. Hayes was in 1993 -- and was pled in 1994, which was prior to enactment of this statute and/or any of the circuit court opinions."
2008.07-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2854.957,2857.145,I'm sorry.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2861.332,2862.097,Yes.
2008.07-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2862.097,2875.7,"I looked at the amicus brief filed by the National Network, page 18 footnote 53, and I see California, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2877.996,2885.244,"And that is the right list, Chief Justice, and that includes West Virginia in the 1996, that was passed."
2008.07-608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2936.567,2940.813,Let me be sure I understand the legislative history correctly in a broad sense.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2948.39,2949.326,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2008.07-608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2949.326,2954.072,And there was a change made in the House in the form of an amendment to that bill?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2956.572,2958.884,It was not a separate bill.
2008.07-608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2964.461,2967.612,They enacted a different text.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2967.612,2967.71,--Yes--
2008.07-608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2967.71,2968.193,"--, they did."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2979.471,2981.109,--That is with only -- yes.
2008.07-608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2990.588,2991.808,Thank you.
2008.07-608,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2991.808,2994.054,But he did say that he agreed to the change.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,2994.054,3003.507,"He did say that he agreed with the change, and that he also said, though, that the he -- that the bill, the new bill made it more precise and broader."
2008.07-608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3010.206,3012.066,Let me be sure.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,3014.749,3016.266,--Yes.
2008.07-608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3016.266,3017.046,Yes.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,3017.046,3023.449,"If there are no further questions, Respondent asks that the Court affirm the judgment of the--"
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3023.449,3024.249,Excuse me.
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,3029.322,3035.635,--Other than he said the words that it made it more precise and broader.
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3035.635,3037.912,How did it make it broader?
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,3045.984,3050.344,The text of the statute as enacted makes it more narrow.
2008.07-608,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3050.344,3051.218,Of course it does.
2008.07-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3051.218,3054.481,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-608,1,42753,troy_n_giatras,,3054.481,3055.105,Thank you.
2008.07-608,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3055.105,3060.291,"Ms. Saharsky, six minutes."
2008.07-608,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3060.291,3062.088,Thank you.
2008.07-608,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3075.082,3076.428,"Well, if I could stop you there."
2008.07-608,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3083.392,3097.7,"--Right, and this Court has said that you do that only when two things are true: When it makes sense in context, and we think it doesn't because of the word ""committed"", which Respondent wants to read right out of the statute, and also because you do it when it's necessary to fulfill the evident purposes of the statute."
2008.07-608,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3102.18,3109.413,"I know, but basically what you're saying is we don't follow 1 U.S.C. section 1 because our reading is correct."
2008.07-608,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3121.985,3133.995,"--It's because the element -- the singular ""element"" has other indicia meaning it involves the word ""committed"" and then also this -- the fact that Congress's objective would be stymied if you took Respondent's reading."
2008.07-608,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3160.22,3161.624,You have to add words.
2008.07-608,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3205.513,3224.99,"--With respect, Justice Scalia, we don't agree with that, and I'll give you two illustrations that hopefully would help establish that point: One, if you just read this all as a sentence without respect to the Romanettes (i) and (ii), you have an offense that is as a misdemeanor and has, as an element, committed by a certain group of persons."
2008.07-608,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3230.314,3240.109,"For that, you'd have to assume that the GS-12 who drafted this, or whoever the equivalent was in the Senate, put the ""that"" in the wrong place."
2008.07-608,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3252.602,3254.178,I think it would read better that way.
2008.07-608,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3255.165,3255.804,"You'd would have to put a ""that""--"
2008.07-608,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3255.804,3256.304,--It would read--
2008.07-608,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3256.304,3258.491,"--You'd have to put a (ii) as well, wouldn't you?"
2008.07-608,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3258.491,3261.662,"--Again, I think if you just -- I don't think you need to do that."
2008.07-608,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3293.302,3300.395,"And, again, not to beat a dead horse, but it's footnote 8 of your brief on page 23 that lists the 17 States."
2008.07-608,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3308.093,3321.105,"--No, but it wouldn't be consistent with what Congress was intending, which is to solve the nationwide problem that every person who proved that they were willing to hurt their family members should not be able to possess a firearm, whether they're a felon or whether they were convicted of a misdemeanor."
2008.07-608,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3322.134,3326.179,"I know, but you point was this doesn't do any good because it's only 17 States."
2008.07-608,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3328.756,3336.38,"--Right, but some persons in those States who commit the same types of offenses, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out -- you know, they commit the same violent acts against family members."
2008.07-608,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3351.343,3352.747,It makes it easier to identify it.
2008.07-608,2,37291,nicole_saharsky,,3363.336,3376.568,"With respect, Justice Scalia, you can't just tell from the face of the State indictment whether you would not be able to possess a firearm under Federal law, because the domestic relationship covered by the State offenses, it is a broader universe in each of those 17 States."
2008.07-608,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3426.685,3428.857,"Thank you, counsel."
