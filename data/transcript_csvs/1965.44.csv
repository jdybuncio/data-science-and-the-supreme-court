1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,18.96,20.759,Thank you.
1965.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,82.438,84.528,I just -- may I get that chronology --
1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,84.528,84.883,Yes.
1965.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,84.883,85.528,One more time.
1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,85.528,85.651,Sure.
1965.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,85.651,87.511,The petition in bankruptcy was filed when?
1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,87.511,89.376,September of 1961
1965.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,89.376,90.247,And the claim for refund?
1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,90.247,98.773,"The claim for it was filed in 1962 after the discharge and in 1963 the money was paid, and since then we've been litigating."
1965.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,98.773,102.251,And the refund was for what taxable year?
1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,102.251,102.92,1961.
1965.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,102.92,104.699,"1961, the -- the year of the --"
1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,104.699,106.253,That's right.
1965.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.718,413.362,"Well, your second -- your second point --"
1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,413.362,413.674,Alright.
1965.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,413.674,424.914,"-- suppose that his claims were denied, it shouldn't be as positive because of many claims are -- are I would think he would concede property of the bankrupt which may or may not be good claims, isn't that correct?"
1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,424.914,427.082,"Good point -- well taken, that's right, it is."
1965.44,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,431.882,432.83,So long as it's a good valid claim.
1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,432.83,434.319,"That's right, exactly."
1965.44,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,897.531,911.875,"Suppose there were, Mr. Klepak, suppose it was for a corporation, instead of individuals and partnership, would that make any difference in the practical consequences of the rule for what you're contending?"
1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,911.875,913.462,I don't think it would.
1965.44,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,923.371,942.094,"What happened then would be that the corporation would get -- would get the benefit of the refund and as distinguished from the corporation in the hands of the trustee, is that what comes to (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,942.094,943.074,"Yes, that's true enough."
1965.44,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,944.731,946.924,"And it sounds -- sounds kind of peculiar, but --"
1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,946.924,957.443,"Yes, it does but how do you realize when you say, “Well, if you want to seek acquiesce, you might have say, well now, the first thing to do is to take the funds that the bankrupt did recover and give it to a creditor.”"
1965.44,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,965.509,980.499,"Now, I'm not saying -- I'm interested in that kind of a judgment, I'm just interested in what practical consequences of this rule for which you're contending would be as applied to a corporation?"
1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,987.784,988.076,I believe (Voice Overlap) -
1965.44,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,988.076,990.13,"-- whatever the theory might be, sir?"
1965.44,0,27407,henry_klepak,,990.13,1001.588,"I believe it was a corporation because he takes over, dealt with the brief with me over here but I -- I think he takes over the stock of the corporation as well."
1965.44,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1032.469,1034.163,Mr. Rochelle.
1965.44,1,46014,william_j_rochelle,,1034.163,1046.008,"Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices, it may be somewhat unusual to commence an argument with emphasis on what the case is not about."
1965.44,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1123.595,1128.648,But what -- what happened here between the dates of bankruptcy in the end of the taxable year with respect to --
1965.44,1,46014,william_j_rochelle,,1128.648,1129.284,"Your Honor, the individual --"
1965.44,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1129.284,1129.935,-- property losses?
1965.44,1,46014,william_j_rochelle,,1129.935,1135.048,-- partners apparently continued to work -- continued to earn money.
1965.44,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1163.582,1174.69,"I thought the -- I thought both the partners, both the -- both the Segals as partners and also each one of them individually went into bankruptcy."
1965.44,1,46014,william_j_rochelle,,1174.69,1175.324,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.44,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1175.324,1176.748,"Well, then how did they --"
1965.44,1,46014,william_j_rochelle,,1176.748,1182.741,"In these cases, it has been administered in a consolidated proceeding."
1965.44,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1191.221,1195.572,And this was just simple bankruptcies or any Chapter 11 or anything like that.
1965.44,1,46014,william_j_rochelle,,1195.572,1197.506,"No, Your Honors, straight bankruptcy."
1965.44,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1201.763,1206.088,And I don't quite see how they continue to operate after bankruptcy.
1965.44,1,46014,william_j_rochelle,,1206.088,1207.363,They didn't.
1965.44,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1223.323,1224.197,They got other jobs?
1965.44,1,46014,william_j_rochelle,,1224.197,1226.556,"Yes, Your Honor."
1965.44,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1381.014,1387.289,How about -- your answer is that the rule is the same -- with respect to a corporation --
1965.44,1,46014,william_j_rochelle,,1387.289,1387.403,Precisely.
1965.44,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1387.403,1388.667,-- with respect to a natural person.
1965.44,1,46014,william_j_rochelle,,1388.667,1390.941,"Corporation, partnership, and individual, no difference."
1965.44,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1390.941,1395.302,Right.
1965.44,1,46014,william_j_rochelle,,1395.302,1404.211,"To be proper -- to be right which passes to a trustee in bankruptcy under Section 70, the right must pass two tests."
1965.44,2,27407,henry_klepak,,2204.925,2213.477,"Just really I want to conclude, just one remark.Both courts did hold that it was something for Congress to correct."
1965.44,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2254.02,2267.248,We'll adjourn.
