1955.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,6.528,"-- on the docket, Dantan George Rea versus United States of America."
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,21.973,25.592,May it please the Court.
1955.30,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,211.842,214.61,Is your case versed entirely on the constitutional grounds?
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,214.61,215.578,"Not entirely, Your Honor."
1955.30,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,215.578,217.77,But why do you begin with that?
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,222.043,228.155,"I begin with this, Your Honor, because I think that is the -- the strongest point."
1955.30,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,228.155,234.177,"I wonder how it would be fair to say, you don't begin with the constitutional point, you end with it."
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,236.883,237.684,"Very well, Your Honor."
1955.30,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,237.684,243.396,We always wanted a decision on the broadest possible point.
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,251.707,252.864,"Very well, Your Honor."
1955.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,522.321,524.139,What do you mean by inherent authority?
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,530.652,534.492,"That the Court, any court has a power as a court."
1955.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,542.103,549.277,"Well, you -- if it's inherent, would it be superior to the congressional power in that field?"
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,549.277,551.17,"No, Your Honor."
1955.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,551.17,552.5,You don't -- you don't speak of it --
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,552.5,552.782,I do not --
1955.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,552.782,553.947,-- in this way?
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,553.947,555.099,Congress has not specifically --
1955.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,555.099,555.284,Yes.
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,555.284,562.683,-- given this power and in the absence of giving it as a court in able to -- in order to -- to be able to conduct its function as a court.
1955.30,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,660.311,663.027,Do you have -- have the power to return?
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,663.027,663.607,"No, Your Honor."
1955.30,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,667.284,669.317,What -- what was the property?
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,669.317,669.866,The property --
1955.30,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,669.866,671.744,Did the record show that?
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,671.744,675.479,The record shows that it was claimed to be marihuana --
1955.30,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,675.479,675.779,(Inaudible)
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,675.779,678.608,-- and I believe two tobacco cans and two pipes.
1955.30,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,678.608,681.2,What -- what did you ask to be done with it?
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,681.2,684.89,We simply asked that it be suppressed.
1955.30,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,684.89,687.581,"Quash the search warrant, of course, that was done so --"
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,687.581,691.662,And -- and the search warrant quashed which was done.
1955.30,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,691.662,701.195,"Well, what -- what piece of paper do you rely on that you filed in the Court, in the -- in the District Court?"
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,701.195,704.357,We filed a motion to suppress --
1955.30,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,704.357,709.203,"Why did -- here's a motion on page 3, a motion to quash the search warrant?"
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,709.203,709.667,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.30,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,710.978,713.693,That's the sole request that you have?
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,713.693,714.776,"No, that is not, Your Honor."
1955.30,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,729.77,732.87,"Yes, but nothing else?"
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,732.87,745.964,And we also asked that he be enjoined in the -- and federal officials having federal custody of this -- of the illegally seized property that they be enjoined from transferring it out of the custody of the Federal Government.
1955.30,0,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,750.232,752.835,Where is that motion?
1955.30,0,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,752.835,754.944,"That is on page 5 of the record, Your Honor."
1955.30,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3130.306,3131.519,May it please the Court.
1955.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3488.695,3492.92,Has it then (Inaudible) of New Mexico come in either below or here?
1955.30,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3492.92,3493.323,"No, Your Honor."
1955.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3493.323,3500.335,The first that State of New Mexico may have the benefit of the result of this proposed legislation?
1955.30,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3500.335,3503.135,"No, they have not come in."
1955.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3782.978,3785.229,Have you found any other State of the Senate?
1955.30,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3785.229,3792.828,"No, but I have also not found any recent New Mexico decision on the question of suppression."
1955.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3792.828,3798.728,And California has been -- had a very sharply divided point on that subject.
1955.30,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3801.8,3802.232,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3802.232,3807.945,"So far as I know, that's not true of any other State that rejected the Weeks doctrine."
1955.30,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3807.945,3826.928,"Nevertheless, it seems to us that in the light of the recent decisions of this Court on the question, in the light of the California example, a State of New Mexico ought at least to have the opportunity to pass for itself on the question of whether it wants to go with what is in newer trend."
1955.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3826.928,3830.118,"But that's a very different problem, Ms. Rosenberg."
1955.30,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3878.4,3879.381,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1955.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3972.566,3973.915,That isn't the ground.
1955.30,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3999.154,4001.955,"Well, that -- I think is the question of policy, Your Honor."
1955.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4072.814,4089.724,"But Ms. Rosenberg, we -- we in such has ought to be -- to know few things and such can have ordinary simple knowledge, and we know that in these cases, officially narcotics issues, the federal officials and the State officials are in close with contradict and intimate collaboration."
1955.30,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,4089.724,4090.081,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4090.081,4095.953,But there was a determination here to the start this proceeding in the federal court and not in the state court.
1955.30,1,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,4125.593,4126.376,"Yes, Your Honor."
1955.30,2,32945,joseph_a_sommer,,4721.569,4726.788,"Your Honor, I have nothing more unless there are some questions which have arisen as a result of the Government's argument."
1955.30,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4726.788,4729.991,Thank you.
