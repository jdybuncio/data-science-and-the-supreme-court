1994.94-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.116,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-270, United State against Aguilar."
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,10.418,13.761,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,62.941,70.338,"Mr. Feldman, no charge was brought under section 1512, I take it."
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,70.338,71.366,That's correct.
1994.94-270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,71.366,77.241,And do you think the conduct here would have been covered by 1512?
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,77.241,78.813,I think it likely would have been covered.
1994.94-270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,78.813,81.695,Might have fitted it rather closely.
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,81.695,84.246,I think it likely would have been covered under section 1512.
1994.94-270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,84.246,87.058,"Why was no charge brought under that section, do you suppose?"
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,87.058,103.08,"Well, I think the main reason is that respondent's conduct, if you looked at what he did, was aimed... it was felt was aimed directly at the grand jury investigation, and that therefore the count that had to do with obstruction of a grand jury investigation was the most appropriate count."
1994.94-270,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,152.902,158.064,"Did the FBI agents testify before that grand jury, the ones that talked to him in Honolulu?"
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,158.064,160.045,--At least Agent Carlon did.
1994.94-270,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,161.597,169.852,"Was there any showing, or was it the Government's theory that they were more or less in charge of bringing the matter to the grand jury?"
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,169.852,178.508,"I don't think there was a feeling that they were in charge of bringing it to the grand jury, because I don't think the count rested on any showing that they were in charge of the investigation."
1994.94-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.487,214.532,"Was he charged under, what is it, 1001, for simply making false statements to an executive official in the performance of his duties?"
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,214.532,216.904,"No, he wasn't charged under 1001."
1994.94-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,216.904,217.925,"That would have applied, wouldn't it?"
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,217.925,220.886,In our view that would have applied.
1994.94-270,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,248.753,277.464,"Mr. Feldman, I suppose if we went about statutory interpretation sort of in the usual way and looked at the series of related statutes, 1503 and 1512, and we looked at them cold, we'd probably say, well, 1512 is the one which is obviously aimed at this situation, and so the catch-all in 1503 probably shouldn't be construed to cover it."
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,298.185,303.27,"Well, 1512 in some respects is broader than 1503, and--"
1994.94-270,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,303.27,305.88,That's the omnibus character.
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,305.88,306.312,--Right.
1994.94-270,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,306.312,309.383,"But I thought there was another distinction that you were making, and I don't remember what it was."
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,309.383,320.06,"Well, I think the main point would be that section 1503 is a catch-all provision, and it covers a great deal of conduct that doesn't have anything to do with what would be covered by section 1512."
1994.94-270,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,320.06,323.633,"Well, yes, but that's always true of a catch-all, so--"
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,323.633,326.694,"Right, and I think it's also, I guess I would... I'd just--"
1994.94-270,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,326.694,338.253,"--But I mean, if that were the distinction, then in effect the catch-all would always be duplicative of the more specific statute on your theory, then."
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,338.253,355.833,"--But I don't think that that's true that it would always... it has some overlap both with the earlier clauses of section 1503, with section 1512, and with some of the other obstruction of justice statutes, but the fact that it has that overlap is necessarily a result of the fact that it is an omnibus clause and a catch-all clause."
1994.94-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,359.927,375.395,"Mr. Feldman, though, did I understand you correctly in answer to Justice O'Connor's question that you didn't have doubts about the fit of 1512, that you would think that 1512 did fit, but for whatever reason you chose 1503 instead."
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,375.395,378.197,I do think he could have been charged under 1512.
1994.94-270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,454.379,459.442,"Mr. Feldman, what is the closest case in the courts of appeal supporting your position in this case?"
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,459.442,466.207,"Well, before... well, I think the closest case probably is the Grubb case, United States v. Grubb."
1994.94-270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,483.367,485.157,"The Grubb case was testimony before the grand jury, wasn't it?"
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,485.157,485.968,--I beg your pardon?
1994.94-270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,485.968,488.26,Wasn't the Grubb case testimony before the grand jury?
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,488.26,488.71,No.
1994.94-270,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,512.856,520.561,"In your earlier case, was the FBI agent acting sort of specifically as the grand jury's agent at the time?"
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,525.874,538.633,"There's no... as far as I can tell, and certainly as far as you can tell from the reports of any of those cases, there's no reason to think that he was acting any closer, in any closer connection to the grand jury than the FBI agents were here."
1994.94-270,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,622.959,631.995,"Well, I suppose under the omnibus clause you could prosecute a person for lying before his own... at his own trial on the witness stand."
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,631.995,637.088,--I think that's probably right.
1994.94-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,637.989,640.59,"What about the word ""corruptly""?"
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,649.997,667.649,"I think ""corruptly"" has, I think, uniformly been construed by the courts of appeals to mean that you need the specific intent to obstruct, and in fact it has a number of different meanings depending on what the specific offense probably is that's being charged, because there's such a broad range of conduct that does come in within the omnibus clause."
1994.94-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,667.649,668.828,"Well, then it's still redundant."
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,671.282,674.463,"I think in combination with ""endeavor"" it brings into intent."
1994.94-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,688.031,689.822,Can I read you an entry in Black's Law Dictionary?
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,708.254,709.885,I... I don't think--
1994.94-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.885,716.028,"In other words I think what Justice Ginsburg and I are asking is, how much of a... you say it's a catch-all."
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,728.598,740.325,"--I think, first the jury was instructed in this case that respondent had to be trying to obtain some advantage for himself, and they found that he was, and in fact he was trying to obtain an advantage for himself."
1994.94-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,751.742,776.79,"But a lie would be a deliberate falsehood, would be for some purpose, and my concern is, you seem to be reading this as though ""corruptly"" just wasn't there, to add nothing more than a deliberate or conscious factor to it, but that's what a lie is."
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,781.432,792.65,In some... I guess the... stating the fact that the defendant has lied is not itself a statutory term.
1994.94-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,827.992,829.243,Maybe we can get at my problem this way.
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,844.764,869.54,"I guess... I don't know if I... I can't think of an example offhand for that, but again, I'm not sure why the fact of whether... why you... false statement cases may, just like alteration or forgery of document cases, may always be corrupt, because whenever they're altering or forging a document knowingly, it's going to be a corrupt action in the sense that the statute means it."
1994.94-270,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,880.478,890.583,Is the answer to what's bothering people possibly an historical answer?
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,923.505,925.856,"--I think so, except the only thing--"
1994.94-270,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,925.856,927.769,Do you know when it first appeared in the statute?
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,927.769,934.261,"--It was in the statute at least as far back as the Pettibone case 100 years ago in 1893, or '92."
1994.94-270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,941.226,961.479,"Mr. Feldman, your time is going to be up shortly, and there was another section under which the defendant was charged, section 2232(c), giving notice or attempting to give notice of a possible wiretap interception."
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,972.977,978.192,"It's our theory that he actually did give notice, although only an attempt would be necessary for violation of this statute."
1994.94-270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,981.564,992.754,Is over the fact that at the time of the defendant's action the wiretap authorization had terminated?
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,992.754,1001.888,"--Right, and the question is whether, when the statute says, what he has to disclose is the possible interception, really the dispute concerns the meaning of the word ""possible"" there."
1994.94-270,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1170.077,1175.971,Is there some disagreement in the lower courts about the impossibility question?
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1176.792,1180.084,I don't think there is any disagreement.
1994.94-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1195.185,1207.823,"The charge to the jury with respect to the 1503, would that have been different if the respondent had been indicted under 1512?"
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1207.823,1221.412,"It would have been... I... you know, I... it would have been... you would have had to show under 1512 was that there was an official proceeding, and in this case you had to show there was a pending proceeding."
1994.94-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1224.233,1229.557,So could respondent perhaps be retried under 1512 without the bar of the statute of limitations?
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1229.557,1234.291,It's possible that he would be able to.
1994.94-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1300.372,1302.846,But there were some changes made in 1503--
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1302.846,1303.765,Yes.
1994.94-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1303.765,1305.367,--at the time 1512 was enacted.
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1305.367,1305.956,"Yes, there were."
1994.94-270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1335.097,1340.87,"I was also wondering about the words ""in order to"" in the second statute."
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1398.348,1399.579,"Yes, I--"
1994.94-270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1399.579,1400.718,That's the kind of thing that's puzzling me.
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1400.718,1402.311,--I think essentially that's right.
1994.94-270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1413.257,1420.352,"So if he's thinking in his own mind, sometimes these things expire... most judges know that they expire."
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1436.943,1439.153,"No, I don't think he does get off under the circumstances."
1994.94-270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1456.864,1457.525,Mr. Feldman--
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1464.58,1471.145,"Right, but I think the ""in order to"" clause is meant to apply for the purpose of interfering with the wiretap."
1994.94-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1481.231,1487.125,"--If he knew... if he knew that the wiretap had expired, would he be guilty of violating this statute?"
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1489.495,1499.873,"--No, I don't think he could be, but the reason he couldn't be is, if you know that the wiretap has expired, then you can't be found to have intended to obstruct it, or at least it would be a very odd situation, which--"
1994.94-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1499.873,1504.696,You could just be intending to tip your relative off that he's under suspicion for something.
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1504.696,1505.157,--That's right.
1994.94-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1505.157,1506.969,And then he wouldn't be violating this statute.
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1506.969,1509.411,"That's right, and I think that would obviously be an entirely inappropriate--"
1994.94-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1509.411,1523.63,"So isn't it logical that a Federal judge would understand that the chances were better than not that the tap would not have been continually renewed, so that at the time he's tipping off his relative it's still alive?"
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1523.63,1530.682,"--I don't think so, and I don't think that that kind of guesswork is what I'm talking about when I say that he knows that it's expired."
1994.94-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1544.543,1549.947,But if he testified he thought it was more probable than not that this tap had expired.
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1549.947,1552.568,If he testified?
1994.94-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1593.073,1596.917,Or even would expire and a new one be authorized.
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1601.211,1603.031,That's correct.
1994.94-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.031,1605.813,"I mean, we've been discussing it as though it said, ""such authorization""."
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1606.925,1607.483,That's correct.
1994.94-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1615.359,1626.686,"Do you tie anything to the time when the inventory is given as any kind of, at least at that... that is the point when the statute no longer applies?"
1994.94-270,0,30335,james_a_feldman,,1626.686,1628.028,I think that might well be the case.
1994.94-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1662.149,1663.43,"Very well, Mr. Feldman."
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,1664.562,1671.475,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1775.124,1785.771,"Well, are you saying that Congress in 1982, Mr. Luskin, impliedly narrowed the omnibus clause of 1503?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,1785.771,1795.327,"What I'm saying, Your Honor, is that Congress narrowed the scope of 1503 and by doing that, yes, impliedly narrowed the scope of section 1503."
1994.94-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1799.33,1800.301,It took witnesses out.
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,1800.301,1818.771,"--It took everything in relation to witnesses out, and it's important to bear in mind the Government's theory of this prosecution, which is that Judge Aguilar, by his false exculpatory statements to the FBI, influenced the FBI agents as potential witnesses so that they would convey false information to the grand jury."
1994.94-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.771,1826.338,"How, mechanically, did Congress accomplish this process of narrowing the omnibus clause?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,1829.72,1831.06,"No, sir."
1994.94-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1859.159,1868.075,"Well, that's a perfectly good argument for saying it shouldn't be used that way after 1982, but it's not a very good argument for saying that Congress changed the meaning of the clause in 1982."
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,1868.075,1880.605,"What I think it is, it's an argument to say that in looking at what Congress accomplished in section 1512, it's important to look at the prior statutes, as this Court did in Fausto, with a view to what the Court was trying to accomplish."
1994.94-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.213,1882.575,What Congress was trying to--
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,1882.575,1882.975,--I'm sorry.
1994.94-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.268,1911.854,"--Yes, but of course the doctrine of implied repeal is disfavored, and as I understood it, you're not... are you relying here on the doctrine of implied repeal?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,1911.854,1912.324,"No, sir."
1994.94-270,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1938.18,1955.422,"Well, if we disagree with you that somehow the amendment of section 1512 affected the meaning of the omnibus clause in 1503, if we disagree on that, do you place reliance on the meaning of the word 1503?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,1955.422,1968.672,"Well, if we were solely to look at section 1503, Your Honor, I think what we place reliance on is corruptly endeavoring to disrupt the due administration of justice."
1994.94-270,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1981.368,1993.646,"Well, certainly something that you tell a witness that you know is going to testify at the proceeding, hoping to affect the proceeding, can have that nexus."
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2003.604,2006.205,"No, Your Honor, I don't think I'm saying that."
1994.94-270,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2080.414,2090.199,So you don't think that 1503 is limited by the need to use a bribe or a threat of violence or something of that kind?
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2090.199,2090.77,"No, ma'am."
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.233,2172.874,"How do you get all of this out of the word ""corruptly""?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2175.345,2177.096,I get it--
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2177.096,2183.48,"--does handle destroying evidence, it does cover that, but it does not cover lying."
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2184.992,2185.572,--I--
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2185.572,2188.784,"--if you say so, but I don't know why the language leads you to that conclusion."
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2188.784,2201.532,"--I get it, Your Honor, from the concept of obstruction of the due administration of justice, and the gloss that's been placed on that concept by cases such as In Re Michael in this Court, and by other cases which require--"
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2201.532,2204.183,"You're not relying on ""corruptly"" for it, then?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2204.183,2204.604,"--No, sir."
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.604,2205.144,Okay.
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2207.046,2207.947,We don't.
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.947,2218.002,"I thought you... well, but you did on page 22 of your brief: finally, even if in some circumstances section 1503 might be read as to cover a prospective witness, blah, blah, blah, a mere false statement is not one of those."
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2222.896,2224.277,In--
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2224.277,2226.711,"It isn't ""corruptly"" that makes any difference to you?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2226.711,2242.609,"--It makes a difference only insofar as it helps to characterize the caliber, or quantity, or significance of the conduct that has to take place, and the reason that that's important is because of the risk it carries with it of an undue influence on the grand jury."
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.609,2246.472,It becomes more corrupt if it's... if it's greater activity?
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2246.472,2254.517,It becomes more corrupt because it raises the risk that the lawful functions of the grand jury will be impeded or obstructive.
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2254.517,2255.138,It seems--
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2260.772,2262.782,"No, sir, I don't think we did."
1994.94-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2262.782,2263.994,Why was that?
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2263.994,2279.374,"I think, Your Honor, that the issue has been framed by the Government's reply brief, in which they suggested essentially that any kind of misconduct in any fashion that might sort of float downstream on a current of causation might affect the grand jury."
1994.94-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2279.374,2281.455,Do you have a citation now for the case?
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2281.455,2281.765,"Yes, sir."
1994.94-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2290.14,2290.951,Thank you.
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2290.951,2294.164,"And Michael, Your Honor, was a contempt case."
1994.94-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2310.934,2319.4,"What, in your opinion, is the proper method of limiting both these statutes, i.e., 1503 and 1512?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2376.247,2378.317,"Well, two things, Your Honor."
1994.94-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2394.82,2397.232,"Well, the amorphousness is over in 1512 as well--"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2397.232,2398.782,"--It is, Your Honor--"
1994.94-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2398.782,2403.235,"--and therefore, really my question goes to both, and it's a general question, but you've thought about it--"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2403.235,2403.916,--That's right.
1994.94-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.916,2416.284,"--and it's relevant, and the question really is, how do you separate out what is perhaps quite normal but very indirect conduct, but badly intended?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2454.61,2478.523,"And I think where that is captured, Your Honor, and it's been captured by the decisions of the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits in the Wood and Thomas cases, is to impose a requirement that in addition to this wrongful intent, the conduct itself, qualitatively, viewed qualitatively in isolation, has to have a natural and probable consequence of influencing the due administration of justice."
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2505.641,2506.222,You don't assert that that--
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2509.495,2511.007,"Oh, absolutely, Your Honor."
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2512.266,2515.008,"And it's not proximate enough, so it wouldn't even be covered by 1512?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2515.008,2518.671,I think it could be charged under 1512.
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2519.162,2519.763,But not successfully.
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2519.763,2520.611,--I think that we--
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.611,2522.384,"I mean, anything could be charged under 1512."
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2522.384,2523.583,--Anything could be charged.
1994.94-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2571.254,2576.627,What intent did the jury have to find in order to convict Judge Aguilar on the counts that it did?
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2576.627,2583.393,"On section 1503, Your Honor, and the instruction is found at page 127 of the Joint Appendix."
1994.94-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2594.239,2595.821,And the jury found that it was.
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2595.821,2596.272,"Yes, sir."
1994.94-270,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2596.272,2603.265,Did you object to the instruction and submit an instruction which encapsulated the theory that you've just presented to Justice Breyer?
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2603.265,2621.567,"We filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the Ninth Circuit ultimately affirmed, and we objected to the instruction insofar as it implied that there was some natural relationship between the role of the grand jury and the function... the FBI agents on the one hand, and the grand jury on the other."
1994.94-270,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2621.567,2637.318,It's not clear to me why there's no necessary nexus between the success for the outcome of the grand jury investigation and giving... trying to lead the FBI agents down a false trail.
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2643.363,2671.97,"Well, as a practical matter, Your Honor, the grand jury doesn't hear exculpatory evidence, and had the FBI agents actually believed the exculpatory false statements that Judge Aguilar had made, as a practical matter in 99 out of 100 cases those exculpatory statements would not have been reported to the grand jury, and there's no evidence that the FBI agents were or did, in fact, testify to the grand jury on this matter."
1994.94-270,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2671.97,2681.287,"Well, if the Government abandons the grand jury investigation because it's been led down a false trail, you say that's not impeding the due administration of justice?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2681.287,2686.621,"But that, Your Honor, is the distinction between the grand jury on the one hand and the FBI on the other."
1994.94-270,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2704.041,2705.964,But the hypothetical is that the two are linked.
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2705.964,2708.815,"But they're not linked, Your Honor, as a matter of law."
1994.94-270,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2732.751,2734.811,"Well, in fact one of the agents did testify, didn't he?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2734.811,2738.925,"The testimony is only, Your Honor, that one agent did testify."
1994.94-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2759.078,2763.28,"Well, but we review evidence after conviction in a light most favorable to the Government, do we not?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2763.28,2776.0,"Yes, sir, you do, but in this case there's really no evidence at all from which one could infer that Agent Carlon testified after this interview, or about this interview, or in relation to this interview."
1994.94-270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2880.768,2882.31,"Well, may I interrupt you there?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2893.036,2893.868,"Yes, sir, that's correct."
1994.94-270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2893.868,2902.263,"So that the knowledge which is spoken of in the first clause is a knowledge of possibility, it's not a knowledge of specifics."
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2902.263,2903.853,"Well, it's--"
1994.94-270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2903.853,2906.396,"Specifics will satisfy it, but possibilities will, too."
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2906.396,2911.268,--Not a possibility about the existence of an application or an authorization.
1994.94-270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2912.327,2915.269,"Possibility about its content, duration, and so on."
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2915.269,2916.04,"--Yes, sir--"
1994.94-270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2916.04,2916.421,Yes.
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2916.421,2916.961,--that's correct.
1994.94-270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2990.559,2996.383,And an application which the agent believes to be possible is also a possible interception.
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,2996.383,3004.058,"--But the problem with that, Your Honor, is that the term ""possible interception"" defines what may or may not be disclosed."
1994.94-270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3010.772,3016.837,"Well, it may not modify it, but it may refer back to it in the sense of taking the meaning possibility from it."
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,3016.837,3034.88,"--It could indeed, Your Honor, but where it sits in the statute, the possible interception refers back to the initial clause, which is, an application has been made, or an authorization is in place, and in our view it defines the class of disclosure which are prohibited."
1994.94-270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3037.891,3050.279,"It may do that simply by referring to what the defendant understands or believes to be the application, or the authorization."
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,3056.003,3056.444,--No.
1994.94-270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3074.386,3112.18,"No, but isn't the answer to your objection, to your argument that he does not have to know the particular content or details of the authorization, he does have to know that there has been an application or an authorization, and the knowledge, the reference of possibility, is back to what he knows, i.e., understands to have been the application or the authorization, and if, in fact, what he knows is indeterminate, then the possibility, I would suppose, is likewise indeterminate?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,3112.18,3120.217,"--I understand what Your Honor is saying, but what the statute says is, you have to have knowledge of an application or authorization."
1994.94-270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3121.826,3130.042,Not necessarily knowledge of its content or specifically the content of any order that may have been issued?
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,3130.042,3154.629,"--That's correct, but in the final clause, which defines the class of disclosures which may not be made, the way in which Congress has defined that is to say he may not disclose a possible interception, and that doesn't modify the defendant's state of mind, it defines the class of things which may not be disclosed, and I think the Government moves ""possible"" back into the state of mind."
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3154.629,3161.561,"Mr. Luskin, you're discussing possible interception as though it means possible interception."
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,3175.291,3185.478,"No, sir, I don't think so, and the reason that it doesn't is that the statute covers not only the wrongful disclosures of authorizations, but applications, and--"
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3185.478,3191.792,"How can you give notice of an interception that does not now exist and may never exist, it is just possible?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,3200.246,3200.847,"--No, sir."
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3221.742,3223.164,How can it be the existence of a possible interception?
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,3226.704,3229.686,"That's right, and that--"
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3229.686,3232.039,And yet you're giving notice of the existence of something that doesn't exist.
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,3232.039,3234.351,--You're giving notice of a possible interception.
1994.94-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3234.351,3237.092,"Of the possibility of interception, is what you're giving notice of."
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,3237.092,3244.896,"You're giving notice that as a matter of law, an interception is possible, because it's been applied for."
1994.94-270,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3252.803,3265.55,"Mr. Luskin, what about Judge Hall's view that interception is still possible until the district court... as long as the district court orders the secrecy of the tap maintained?"
1994.94-270,1,39739,robert_d_luskin,,3280.881,3285.113,"And I think that that confuses two separate statutory provisions, Your Honor."
1994.94-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3378.915,3380.106,"Thank you, Mr. Luskin."
1994.94-270,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3382.418,3385.65,I just had two brief points I wanted to make.
1994.94-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3458.196,3460.377,"May I ask you a question that's troubling me, Mr. Feldman?"
1994.94-270,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3476.038,3491.598,"I guess that would... I think that would depend on whether in the first clause of the statute it... what it is that he has to have knowledge of, when it says he has to know of an application or authorization."
1994.94-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3491.598,3491.899,He knew about the application.
1994.94-270,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3492.129,3492.419,Right.
1994.94-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3492.419,3493.801,--There was an existing application.
1994.94-270,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3505.048,3509.871,"I think... it's hard... I tell you, frankly, it's hard for me to tell--"
1994.94-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3509.871,3511.433,"It's very similar to this case, it seems to me."
1994.94-270,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3511.433,3511.784,--I--
1994.94-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3511.784,3517.396,"It's... that's sort of lateral rather than vertical, but it's the same sort of impossibility."
1994.94-270,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3517.396,3519.137,"--No, I really don't think it is."
1994.94-270,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3526.192,3530.133,"He's wrong about that, just as in my hypo he's wrong about the person who might be affected by it."
1994.94-270,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3530.133,3548.817,"Yes, well, I mean, I suppose in that... in the case that you posit, I think he could be prosecuted for that, too, if he acted in order to obstruct the interception that he knew about... so long as he knew about it, and as long as what he acted was in order to obstruct it, and what he said was, there's a possible interception, again referring back to what his actual knowledge was."
1994.94-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3548.817,3557.181,What do you do about the last example that Mr. Luskin gave about someone who receives notice of a wiretap and--
1994.94-270,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3557.181,3559.354,I don't... I do a couple of things.
1994.94-270,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3573.343,3577.414,--So you're saying that the knowledge he gets would preclude the intent which is necessary?
1994.94-270,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3577.414,3578.516,--I think it would be likely to be.
1994.94-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3578.516,3580.176,"But for that, though, you'd have him."
1994.94-270,2,30335,james_a_feldman,,3580.176,3593.927,"Well, I think also because there would be the question of whether you would construe that to be knowledge of an application or an authorization, not just merely because of the fact that it's completed, but it's not... what he's finding out there is the inventory of the actual conversations, not the application or authorization."
1994.94-270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3593.927,3595.469,"Thank you, Mr. Feldman."
