1972.72-214,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,35.529,"We'll hear arguments next in 72-214, the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway against the Wichita Board of Trade, and 72-433, Interstate Commerce Commission against the Wichita Board of Trade."
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,39.646,42.799,May it please the Court.
1972.72-214,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,368.577,374.276,Under the former requirement that the inspection have to take place while the grain was in in-transit?
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,374.276,394.439,"No, Mr. Justice Stewart, it did not have to be done while it was in transit, but as the Commission pointed out because of prior practice and because of convenience, the practice of in-transit inspection of grain continued."
1972.72-214,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,394.439,395.417,So it wasn't a requirement?
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,395.417,417.077,"It was not required and in fact, one of the principal reasons for the Commission's decision in this case is to stimulate the grain trade so as to depart from this practice in the light of the Commission's findings that in-transit inspection is by no means essential."
1972.72-214,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,417.077,418.861,"but it wasn't essential, as you just told me, under the old law?"
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,418.861,420.812,"That's right, that's right."
1972.72-214,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,559.787,566.221,Does the basic impetus Mr. Pollock for these inspections come from the consignee or the shipper?
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,566.221,582.258,"Primarily, the consignee and indeed primarily from the grain exchanges which are the principal plaintiffs in this case."
1972.72-214,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,910.695,913.233,What did they say about the Arrow case?
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,913.233,915.542,"It said absolutely nothing, Your Honor."
1972.72-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,962.47,976.158,"Well, what if -- what if the District Court had held the findings of the Commission were not supported by substantial evidence and set them aside?"
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,979.797,996.56,"No Your Honor, because all that we would have in that case would be a situation where the Commission had intervened with respect to carrier made rates and the entire seven month period of suspension had expired."
1972.72-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.56,1005.149,"You say that the only -- that the only -- that the only, the thing was suspend the rates once the seven months is expired, is a finding by the Commission, that they were unjust and unreasonable?"
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,1005.149,1007.176,"That's right, that's what the --"
1972.72-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1007.176,1012.608,What happens when the court sets aside a Commission's finding that they are just and reasonable?
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,1021.172,1031.29,The matter would then go back to the Commission for consideration of the alleged error pointed out by the District Court.
1972.72-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.29,1036.539,"But until and unless they find the rates unjust and unreasonable, the rates stand to affect?"
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,1036.539,1037.108,That's right.
1972.72-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1037.244,1040.357,"In the court, the Commission can just the bat the ball back and forth forever?"
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,1040.357,1043.196,"No, it isn't quite like that, Your Honor."
1972.72-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1051.269,1052.3,"Sorry, I didn't mean to --"
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,1052.3,1060.005,"No, that's quite alright, Your Honor, I would like to answer that immediately, that is the Congress provided two very specific remedies for that situation."
1972.72-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.667,1081.488,Why would the Commission ever do it if it didn't agree with the court?
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,1081.488,1093.363,"It would be again within the matter of the discretion of the Commission to grant such relief, Your Honor, while it is considering whether the court's order is appropriate."
1972.72-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1093.363,1096.479,"Yes, but it couldn't enjoin the rates -- enjoin the rates, could it after --"
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,1096.479,1098.224,It can set aside the rates.
1972.72-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.224,1098.921,Could set aside the rates?
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,1098.921,1100.189,"Yes, it can set aside the rates."
1972.72-214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.189,1102.948,But it couldn't do that except upon of finding of just and reasonable?
1972.72-214,0,22954,earl_e_pollock,,1102.948,1103.985,That's right.
1972.72-214,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1139.116,1140.587,Mrs. Christian?
1972.72-214,1,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1140.587,1143.953,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1418.195,1418.929,Mrs. Christian?
1972.72-214,1,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1418.929,1420.519,Yes sir.
1972.72-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1420.519,1424.545,You attach any significance to footnote 22 in the Arrow opinion?
1972.72-214,1,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1424.545,1439.053,"On footnote 22, Your Honor, this Court pointed out that it was not reflecting in anyway upon decisions recognizing a limited power of the courts to preserve the status quo pending judicial review."
1972.72-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1439.053,1439.983,Is that this case?
1972.72-214,1,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1439.983,1441.941,That is not this case.
1972.72-214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1443.576,1446.893,"Well it was -- what was on review was a final agency action, wasn't it?"
1972.72-214,1,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1446.893,1453.602,"What was on review was a final agency action, Your Honor, but this footnote does not apply for two reasons."
1972.72-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1543.114,1548.179,"And I kind of take it that the courts do not have that power either, do they, can find the rates unlawful?"
1972.72-214,1,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1548.179,1551.325,This is exactly the point I was coming to Mr. Justice Stewart.
1972.72-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1551.325,1557.348,"And until the Commission finds them unlawful, the rates stand to affect, is that it?"
1972.72-214,1,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1557.348,1558.456,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1972.72-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.624,1584.478,"Now, what about my question to Mr. Pollock where the Commission upholds the rates as lawful and they are in effect and the District Court claims that the judgment is not supported by substantial evidence, it sets aside the Commission's findings and let us assumes the court is quite right that the Commission's finding weren't supported by substantial evidence."
1972.72-214,1,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1589.348,1592.672,"Yes Your Honor, it is solely a question of substantial evidence."
1972.72-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1603.555,1617.472,"If these are automatically followed from the -- if the record remains the same, the Commission must then automatically enter a judgment finding them --"
1972.72-214,1,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1617.472,1619.505,"I would not say automatically, Your Honor."
1972.72-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1636.501,1642.613,Could a District Court order a Commission to find them unlawful unless the record is examined?
1972.72-214,1,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1642.613,1655.331,"I think that the court could not order them to find the rates unlawful, but certainly its opinion could be written in such a way that under the court's legal standards, the Commission would have no alternative but to find them unlawful."
1972.72-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.227,1690.994,Can the Court itself enter a refund order contingent upon finding of unlawfulness.
1972.72-214,1,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1698.6,1709.765,"Certainly, in connection with an appeal of the agency's final decision to court, the courts and the agency have assumed that the courts have the power to issue an accounting and refund order."
1972.72-214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1721.444,1725.882,Even if it cannot find the rates unjust and unreasonable or suspend them?
1972.72-214,1,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1725.882,1727.416,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1972.72-214,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1861.422,1871.356,Thank you Mrs. Christian.
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,1872.955,1877.492,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-214,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1992.84,1999.187,"If it is in transit, that suggested that it was originally destined somewhere beyond this market, does not it?"
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,1999.187,2000.861,"No, it shipped to the market."
1972.72-214,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2055.114,2060.849,Are you suggesting there are no other alternatives for solving the problem?
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,2060.849,2075.081,"Well, I think the alternative that many people have suggested is that if the railroads are really concerned about giving the shippers an incentive to eliminate the grain inspection, the thing for them to do would be to reduce their rates."
1972.72-214,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2079.043,2087.995,"Well, that is obviously an easy solution, but the carrier has no interest in the quality of that grain, has he?"
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,2087.995,2108.043,"The carrier has no interest in the quality of grain, however, by providing a service which is of value, he is enhancing the attractiveness of the railroad service, but the point is that the carriers, when they made the $0.20 rate for example, they put into that rate $0.2 specifically because of the cost of the grain inspection, this was stipulated in the record."
1972.72-214,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2121.072,2134.596,You agree with I think it was Mr. Pollock's comment that the railroads lose money on this inspection and that the inspection process costs more than the enhanced rate.
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,2136.115,2141.775,"Well, if you are talking about the $17 per car charge, the $17 approximates what it costs --"
1972.72-214,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2141.775,2145.232,We are just talking about his generalization.
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,2146.801,2148.781,They are always not losing money on grain traffic.
1972.72-214,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2158.088,2159.946,"Well, that was not my question."
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,2159.946,2161.203,I am trying to get your question.
1972.72-214,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2161.203,2178.883,"Well, my question was just of losing money on the inspection process standing alone, that is so that they would rather eliminate the whole process and from their point of view, they argue that they would be better off?"
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,2178.883,2181.788,"Now, he has not said that he is losing money on inspection process."
1972.72-214,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2209.967,2216.087,"But there is not dispute that the carrier is not interested in this inspection, doesn't it?"
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,2221.971,2230.251,"I do not think that is correct, Your Honor because if they want to do that, they would have proposed and said, as from tomorrow, we will not form any grain inspections, regardless of price."
1972.72-214,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2240.379,2247.606,"As I understand the Mr. Pollock to say that they just leave, stop the while business."
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,2256.196,2259.152,"Well, they are competing with other modes of transportation."
1972.72-214,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2296.991,2299.831,So the inspection helps the carrier?
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,2299.831,2306.065,"The inspection helps the carrier to get grain on his railroad instead of having that grain go down the river on the barge, instead of going by truck."
1972.72-214,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2306.065,2312.813,"And if on the other hand he is willing to give up that great asset, you object to it?"
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,2312.813,2314.668,Yes Your Honor we object it for two reasons.
1972.72-214,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2416.281,2419.412,Would you say that's tantamount to an increase in the line haul rate?
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,2419.412,2422.193,It certainly is Your Honor.
1972.72-214,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2433.2,2435.076,"It's a paradox though, isn't it?"
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,2445.032,2452.191,"Well, it's selected, Your Honor, as we figure they've collected between four and five million dollars a year on this so they've been getting money on this."
1972.72-214,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2452.191,2456.277,"Well, I'm just relying on what they represent in the argument?"
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,2456.277,2457.581,I find that paradoxical.
1972.72-214,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2915.925,2925.475,"But that at least amounts to a finding by the Commission, whether supported or otherwise, doesn't it, that even treating this as an increase in the line haul rate is justified?"
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,2925.475,2928.712,I would treat that as a conclusion rather than a finding.
1972.72-214,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3252.74,3257.19,Why do you say Mr. Sweeney that Arrow doesn't apply here?
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,3257.19,3263.593,Because Arrow concerned itself with what could take place before the decision of the Commission?
1972.72-214,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3307.801,3316.281,What do you say to Mrs. Christian's argument that the footnote dealt only with the maintenance in the status quo?
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,3316.281,3320.68,"Well the status quo, Your Honor, is the last piece of those status prior to litigation."
1972.72-214,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3340.423,3354.04,You don't read the Arrow case as taking the judges out of rate making men as in the barred terms that the opinion seems to read?
1972.72-214,2,21507,daniel_j_sweeney,,3354.04,3371.358,"I don't think that affects rate making one way or the other I think for a court to issue an injunction like they did here, all they are saying is that you are required on the 16, section 15 (7) to fulfill a burden of proof of showing the rate is just and reasonable."
1972.72-214,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3436.326,3443.736,Mr. Imhof.
1972.72-214,3,45090,william_a_imhof,,3443.736,3446.894,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-214,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3809.734,3814.467,"Before you do, let me ask, what's your answer on Mrs. Christian argument on Status quo?"
1972.72-214,3,45090,william_a_imhof,,3814.467,3815.748,"On footnote 22, Your Honor?"
1972.72-214,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3815.748,3815.973,Yeah.
1972.72-214,3,45090,william_a_imhof,,3815.973,3824.54,"First of all I think we might argue, we might well remember that the court here did not flatly remanded to the Commission and lose hold of it."
1972.72-214,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3835.443,3842.715,It's certainly is anticipated that the Commission is going to take some further proceedings in the meanwhile?
1972.72-214,3,45090,william_a_imhof,,3842.715,3844.201,"Yes, Your Honor, I suppose it would be, yeah."
1972.72-214,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3844.201,3851.741,"No, I think so it would – we set aside the order because you haven't given a decent enough reasons."
1972.72-214,3,45090,william_a_imhof,,3851.741,3854.976,I would assume that it would be remanded with directions.
1972.72-214,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3908.543,3915.854,"What you are saying is -- it's not been held that rates are unjust and unreasonable, don't you or do you?"
1972.72-214,3,45090,william_a_imhof,,3915.854,3917.652,"I tend yes, Your Honor."
1972.72-214,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3920.748,3934.706,And has the Congress provided or hasn't that the rates may not be suspended beyond seven months until there is a finding of it as unjust and unreasonable?
1972.72-214,3,45090,william_a_imhof,,3934.706,3939.147,"Until there is an order of the Commission, Your Honor, I submit that that's a very valid and vital distinction in this case."
1972.72-214,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3939.147,3941.361,Order in case that they unjust and unreasonable?
1972.72-214,3,45090,william_a_imhof,,3941.361,3946.452,Till there is an order of the Commission in the proceeding pending at that time before the Commission.
1972.72-214,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3958.332,3971.888,"So you say that if rates in effect Commission finds the rates just and reasonable, the Commission itself could suspend the rates beyond the seven months pending judicial review?"
1972.72-214,3,45090,william_a_imhof,,3971.888,3973.998,If the rates were just and reasonable?
1972.72-214,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3973.998,3976.178,"Yeah, they are kind of just and reasonable?"
1972.72-214,3,45090,william_a_imhof,,3976.178,3978.144,"No, no, Your Honor, I do not."
1972.72-214,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3978.144,3981.381,"You don't, even though a court could?"
1972.72-214,3,45090,william_a_imhof,,3981.381,3988.845,A court could suspend the rates if it found that the Commission's decision was not supported in your example by substantial evidence.
1972.72-214,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3993.39,3998.303,"Well I know, I know but that still leaves the rates in effect that under the seven months rule?"
1972.72-214,3,45090,william_a_imhof,,3998.303,4002.394,"And not once the court has jurisdiction over the case, I would submit Your Honor."
1972.72-214,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4019.307,4021.642,Have you fully answered my question?
1972.72-214,3,45090,william_a_imhof,,4021.642,4037.29,"I am not sure if I did or not, Your Honor, I believe I answered the first part as to whether or not the Court is retaining jurisdiction, pending judicial review and Mr. Sweeney has pointed the case as indicating the status quo can be restored and I submit to Your Honor, that effect would answer the second question."
1972.72-214,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4037.29,4039.407,You associate yourself with that argument?
1972.72-214,3,45090,william_a_imhof,,4039.407,4044.527,"With that argument, yes, I do, Your Honor, Thank you very much."
