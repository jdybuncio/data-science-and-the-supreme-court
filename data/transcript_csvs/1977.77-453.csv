1977.77-453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,21.799,We will hear arguments next in Eastex against the Labor Board.
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,25.872,29.721,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,240.444,263.953,Is there not a subquestion there Mr. Abercrombie even assuming that both of the last two – both of your questions are answered by the Board as to whether the principle of Republic Aviation should be applied the same way to strictly political literature as to organizational literature?
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,263.953,295.121,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we believe that that is part of the basic question of whether the mutual aid or protection language of Section 7 protects political expression, but to the extent that Republic Aviation states that there is a right to in-plant distribution, that case is of course limited by its terms to in-plant distribution by employees relating to organizational effort."
1977.77-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,295.121,305.05,But that -- and that was an upholding by this Court of the Board’s finding that this particular type of rule was reasonable with respect to organizational material?
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,305.05,306.562,Yes sir.
1977.77-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,306.562,334.508,"And my question to you is even though one were to conclude that the sort of literature that were to be -- that was sought to be distributed here was covered under Section 7 and even though the Board were permitted to conclude under the Act that some distribution were permissible on the employer’s property, would it necessarily be entitled to simply use the Republic Aviation formula without any reweighing of factors?"
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,334.508,372.654,"No sir and that is exactly what the Board and the Fifth Circuit did in this case was to use the presumptive invalidity of the refusal to distribution, the presumptive rule of right to distribute on an employee’s property, growing out of Republic Aviation was of course based on the organizational efforts of employees under the fundamental provisions or the fundamental rights of Section 7."
1977.77-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,386.853,392.538,"Put that way, you are not necessarily arguing that it is unprotected."
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,395.896,398.629,Are you arguing both of them --
1977.77-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,398.629,404.686,"Even if it is protected, you cannot do it on the employer’s premises and it is not protected in the first place, is that it?"
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,404.686,409.171,"Mr. Justice White, it is our position that it is unprotected."
1977.77-453,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,419.665,427.44,"Well, I just -- I suppose you can say a lot of things are protected, but you just cannot do them some places."
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,433.08,433.738,That is right.
1977.77-453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,433.738,439.53,"You would not challenge the right to circularize this outside the company gates on the public sidewalk, would you?"
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,439.53,440.92,Yes sir.
1977.77-453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,441.04,444.756,On the public sidewalk?
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,449.315,457.256,I would challenge the right to do so under the provisions of Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.
1977.77-453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,457.256,462.72,"Well, does the Section 7 have anything to do with it if it is out in a public place?"
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,462.72,470.244,Section 7 establishes the rights of employees in dealing with their employer.
1977.77-453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,478.507,485.081,That is why I asked you whether Section 7 has anything to do with what they do out on the public highway?
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,485.081,486.109,"No, sir."
1977.77-453,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,486.109,493.591,So the could hand the leaflets out on the sidewalk as the employees came out of the plant?
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,493.591,504.954,"Yes sir, but you asked me not in the context of a union organization, but just whether it had anything to do with employees handing out political literature."
1977.77-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,530.505,539.856,"Mr. Abercrombie, following up on Justice Rehnquist’s question, I do not understand you to contend that the right to distribute literature is limited to organizational literature?"
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,539.856,542.376,"No, sir, I am not so contending."
1977.77-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,571.432,577.466,"You do concede, do you not, that if this pamphlet had included nothing, but items one and 4, it would have been protected?"
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,577.466,580.342,"Yes sir, it would have been."
1977.77-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,580.342,584.659,"Act 4 is a general exhortation in favor of the unions, is it not?"
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,584.659,585.307,Yes sir.
1977.77-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,586.229,592.124,"Act 4 is just sort of a general exhortation that unions are fined organizations, is it not?"
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,592.124,593.536,"Yes sir, it is."
1977.77-453,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.536,598.42,"That sort of general exhortation you say is protected, but why are not 2 and 3 in the same general category?"
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,598.42,610.445,"They are not -- four is at least relating to or could be considered as union institutional literature, not related to the question of political beliefs."
1977.77-453,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,619.583,629.905,"Mr. Abercrombie, I suppose they urge them to vote for minimum wage, that is political?"
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,629.905,637.981,"Mr. Justice Marshall, it is my view that that is unprotected for distribution on the employer's premises."
1977.77-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,727.435,731.215,"Nor is that the employer is the Congress of the United States, I take it?"
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,731.215,732.048,I beg your pardon.
1977.77-453,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,732.048,738.623,I said nor is the employer is the Congress of the United States so is to be forbidden from abridging Freedom of Speech?
1977.77-453,0,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,738.623,744.652,"No sir, this is not a First Amendment Freedom of Speech case."
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1703.72,1706.293,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1706.293,1724.046,"While you are on that, before you get started, do you disagree with that last proposition that the union cannot carry six political messages and one union message in one pamphlet and be protected by Section 7?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1724.046,1745.019,"I agree with that proposition, Mr. Chief Justice to the extent that the union is simply sticking in incidental Section 7 material in literature that is primarily a vehicle for unrelated political propaganda."
1977.77-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1765.978,1767.796,"Well, then let us reverse it."
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1775.964,1783.318,"Mr. Chief Justice, it is hard to speculate without knowing all of the circumstances of what the literature relates to and I would not want to say what the Board would decide."
1977.77-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1783.318,1790.991,Let us say it is supporting a candidate for running for public office at that time?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1790.991,1806.421,"If in for example a union newspaper, one column out of a five page newspaper said Vote for Joe Smith, I do not think if the rest of the newspaper was substantially devoted to relevant Section 7 materials that were not suggesting --"
1977.77-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1806.421,1809.632,Then you would get into a word count?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1809.632,1814.499,"That is right, but the Board’s position in this case is designed to avoid a word count."
1977.77-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1814.499,1816.188,You do not want census yet?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1816.188,1821.053,"That is right, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1977.77-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1867.078,1876.43,"Why do you phrase the issue that way Mr. Allen, where the employer must show some special, is that on the base of Republic?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1876.43,1883.805,That is on the basis of Republic Aviation in its progeny including NLRB vs. Magnavox most recently.
1977.77-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.805,1906.43,But do you not concede that the Board might rationally adopt a different rule for the peripheral matter included under Section 7 or other mutual aid or protection than it did for organizational materials such as was involved in Republic?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1906.43,1912.233,The Board has not made any such distinctions.
1977.77-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.218,1961.382,"Well, one of my difficulties here was that Republic Aviation of the opinion of the Court sets out at a great length the Board’s reasoning for concluding it organizational material was the kind of distribution to which the employer’s property rights had to yield and all I see in this -- the Board’s stream of this case is that they rather summarily affirm the findings of the administrative law judge?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,1961.382,2013.077,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it is the Board’s position we contend that legally correct position that the distribution that the news bulletin here came within the scope of Section 7, that it related to matter involving – it was a concerted activity for mutual aid or protection that is protected by Section 7 and the Board has adopted in cases involving employer restraint on Section 7 activities, the general rule of Republic Aviation that unless the employer has come up with some special interest in production or discipline, he may not lawfully prohibit the distribution by employees of Section 7 material on nonworking time and in nonworking areas."
1977.77-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2013.077,2027.764,Is there any particular Board decision that says Republic Aviation should be carried over to all or rather mutual aid or protection and why it should be?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2027.764,2058.349,"Well, I cannot think of any Board decision specifically making that point although I would submit that NLRB vs. Magnavox does so implicitly to the extent that, excuse me a second, according to petitioner’s definition, that would be an organizational activity, but I am sorry, I cannot think of one offhand although --"
1977.77-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2058.349,2060.809,This case is not a bad one?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2060.809,2063.594,"Pardon me, Mr. Justice White."
1977.77-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.594,2066.101,This might be the first case?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2066.101,2068.784,"Well, each case depends on its facts."
1977.77-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2215.712,2219.128,"How do you term those materials, Mr. Allen?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2219.128,2229.248,"I term those materials, Mr. Chief Justice as materials that are within the scope of the mutual aid or protection clause of Section 7."
1977.77-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2254.332,2267.178,"What if they were advocating high tariffs on all products of Japan on the grounds that Japanese were guilty of unfair competition, lower labor?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2267.178,2269.605,It was affecting their jobs?
1977.77-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.018,2286.867,But you seem to agree then that there must be some kind of a reasonable connection with the employee’s job for this particular employer?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2286.867,2290.34,"Well, not exactly, Mr. Justice White."
1977.77-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.34,2295.56,So it need not have any connection?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2304.961,2308.668,That seems to me clearly under the case that it would protected by Section 7.
1977.77-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.173,2312.304,But even though it has no connection with the job at all?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2312.304,2313.2,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1977.77-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.743,2340.68,That is not then on the employer’s premises?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2340.68,2346.955,"Well, but the first question we have to isolate is whether or not the activity is within the scope of Section 7."
1977.77-453,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.955,2355.277,"Then I will ask you the next question, how about that boycott literature distributed on the employer’s premises?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2355.277,2376.306,It would seem to me that under the established rules that the distribution of that literature by employees in nonworking areas on nonworking time was an activity that was protected by Section 7 unless the employer came up with some kind of reason as to why he had an interest of any kind in prohibiting it.
1977.77-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2376.306,2381.965,"When you said the case is recognized Mr. Allen, what cases are you referring to?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2381.965,2385.495,"Well, the cases we have cited in our brief, but the cases --"
1977.77-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2385.495,2393.58,Were they Court of Appeals cases?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2393.58,2414.348,There are many Court of Appeals cases and Supreme Court cases as well that recognize that Section 7 is not limited to matters which affect the employee’s relationship with their employer or and that involve matters over which the employer has any right or power to affect.
1977.77-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2414.348,2427.252,That was not the basis on which the Court of Appeals in this case proceeded. You proceeded under the basis that this particular distribution was reasonably related to these particular employees and their jobs.
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2427.252,2444.76,The Court of Appeals adopted that standard and we think that that standard is well within the standard boundaries of Section 7 and we think the Court of Appeals accurately found that the distribution of this news bulletin did affect the employees themselves in their jobs.
1977.77-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2448.031,2457.489,What about literature which urges them to vote against a given congressman or senator on the grounds that he favors right to work laws?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2457.489,2461.02,"Well, that is essentially what we have in this case."
1977.77-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2461.908,2465.004,Let me give you an easy one.
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2473.568,2475.276,Oppose sales of airplanes to Arab countries?
1977.77-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2475.276,2478.612,And to support the ERA?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2478.612,2487.668,"With respect to the first part of that, I cannot really see how it would affect the employee’s interests as employees unless perhaps they were employees of the aviation industry."
1977.77-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2487.668,2490.82,You do not think that there will be a little argument?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2490.82,2492.758,A little argument on behalf of the employees?
1977.77-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2492.758,2496.42,"Yes, you do not think all of them would agree one way or the other, do you?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2496.42,2499.17,I think there would be a dispute among the employees as --
1977.77-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2499.17,2505.438,Do you not think the employer would prefer not to have dispute among his employees?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2509.467,2510.716,"No, it is not wide open."
1977.77-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2510.716,2518.224,And then you say who decides the boundaries?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2518.224,2524.974,It is certainly not wide open and we want to emphasize that it is not.
1977.77-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2547.784,2550.808,What is the boundary is what I am trying to get?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2550.808,2551.721,Where is it bounded?
1977.77-453,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2551.721,2552.449,Yes sir.
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2552.449,2565.292,That is difficult to say and the Board has not -- it is difficult to articulate a standard other than the language of Section 7 itself to describe the outer boundaries of Section 7.
1977.77-453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2566.962,2572.246,"What is the boundary that as my brother Marshall asked, who determines it?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2597.607,2601.583,The answer to that question Mr. Justice Stewart is that the union does not have the unreviewable discretion.
1977.77-453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2601.583,2619.805,"Let us say this particular union, head of the local is a very strong environmentalist and he is convinced that proposed environmental legislation in the state of Texas is going to be very good for the employees of this plant as well as employees generally, can he have literature distributed along those lines?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2619.805,2622.958,"Well, if in fact his opinion is unreasonable I do not think that he is entitled to an unreasonable opinion."
1977.77-453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2622.958,2627.901,"No, no, it is perfectly reasonable and so would an opposite opinion be perfectly reasonable?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2627.901,2637.766,"Well, I think the Act vests in a Board, the ultimate determination of whether or not the activity is within the scope of Section 7."
1977.77-453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2637.766,2642.228,And does it depend upon whether it is reasonable?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2642.228,2645.278,"Yes, I think it would."
1977.77-453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2659.668,2665.802,Why because the Board has the opposite view about the environmental legislation?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2665.802,2672.547,"No, the Board has the function not of determining the merits of environmental legislation, but determining the scope of Section 7."
1977.77-453,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2672.547,2674.728,That is the question of course.
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2674.728,2710.964,"And I would like to emphasize in that connection Mr. Justice Stewart that as this Court has recognized many times, the Board’s determination or the question of whether -- of the scope of Section 7 and whether -- and how it applies to particular fact situations is a question that the Board’s determination should we believe be given a large measure of latitude and the reason for that is that the field of labor management relations obviously involves an infinite variety of situations."
1977.77-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2721.108,2736.442,"Mr. Allen, all I find that the Board has said in these cases on 24 (a) and 25 (a) in the petition for certiorari are four paragraphs simply a boiler plate affirmance of the findings the administrative law judge."
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2752.933,2758.567,You are referring to the Board’s order of adopting the decision of the administrative law judge?
1977.77-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2758.567,2759.105,Yes.
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2759.105,2764.539,"Well, the decision of the administrative law judge, Mr. Rehnquist has to be deemed to be incorporated within the Board’s order."
1977.77-453,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2764.539,2772.878,"Well, then you say in effect that the discretion ultimately is not necessarily lodged in the Board, but in the administrative law judge?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2772.878,2777.638,"Not at all, the administrative Board has power to review and reverse the administrative law judge."
1977.77-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2827.288,2833.208,Let me come back to the last answer you gave me and see if you still want to stand on it.
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2855.612,2871.075,This case urged -- the paragraph -- the bulletin of this case urged its employees – urged the members of the union to vote for legislators who would support a minimum wage legislation.
1977.77-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2871.075,2872.914,Yes but that is not my hypothesis.
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2872.914,2878.014,Your hypothesis is different because it specifically sets out a list of candidates --
1977.77-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2878.014,2879.639,Nothing else?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2881.963,2918.747,"In your hypothesis, I think it might well be open to the Board to determine that that kind of purely political solicitation in the context of a political campaign was and I am saying I think it might be open or not, I do not -- of course I cannot predict how the Board would find it, but I think it might be open to the Board to determine that that kind of activity was sufficiently removed from the interest of the employees as to not merit Section 7 protection."
1977.77-453,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2918.747,2926.092,What would be an example of political activity that in your opinion would not be subject to Section 7 protection?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2926.092,2959.474,"Well, one case we cite in our brief is it was a decision by the Board in the Ford Motor Company case, cited in our brief at page 30, where the Board held that an attempt by the union to distribute a newspaper which I believe was a socialist worker’s party newspaper, was not activity that was protected by Section 7 because the Board said, it was purely political propaganda."
1977.77-453,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2959.474,2967.513,Can it be anything more political than supporting a candidate for office or opposing another candidate?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,2969.058,2971.094,That is right.
1977.77-453,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2997.787,3009.014,"In a general election, let us assume that all that was distributed was a list of the candidates with some biographical data saying these are friends of labor?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,3009.014,3022.849,That is the hypothesis that the Chief Justice gave me and I was suggesting that in those circumstances it might be open to the Board to determine that this was not a bona fide --
1977.77-453,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3022.849,3024.145,Just might be open?
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,3024.145,3025.089,It might be open.
1977.77-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3106.914,3116.797,"If your quotation of the foreign case is accurate and I assume it is on page 30, I do not think you will have to either defend the Board or blush at defending them."
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,3136.317,3137.693,With respect to your hypothetical?
1977.77-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3137.693,3142.573,"Yes, well not in particular my hypothetical, the Board’s own decision in the Ford case?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,3142.573,3144.696,No I think the Board stands by that decision.
1977.77-453,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3144.696,3149.477,"Well, then you would not have to worry about defending them because unless they change their position?"
1977.77-453,1,38596,richard_a_allen,,3149.523,3157.074,It am not sure that that position would necessarily foreclose the Board from determining that in your hypothetical.
1977.77-453,2,28812,john_b_abercrombie,,3675.867,3681.459,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.77-453,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3903.38,3904.11,Thank you gentlemen.
