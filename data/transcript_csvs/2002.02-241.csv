2002.02-241,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.176,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-241, Barbara Grutter v. Lee Bollinger."
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,8.517,11.387,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court:
2002.02-241,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,92.372,107.119,"Well, of course, you... I mean, a university or a law school is faced with a serious problem when it's one that gets thousands of applications for just a few slots."
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,142.722,149.236,"Well, Your Honor, first of all, race is impermissible because of the constitutional command of equality."
2002.02-241,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.802,170.767,You say that's not... it can't be a factor at all.
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,176.953,183.681,"--Our view, Your Honor, is that race itself should not be a factor among others in choosing students because of the Constitution."
2002.02-241,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.681,208.105,"Well, you have some... some precedents out there that you have to come to grips with, because the Court obviously has upheld the use of race in making selections or choices in certain contexts, for instance, to remedy prior to discrimination in other contexts."
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,208.105,208.819,"Oh, absolutely, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,208.819,209.522,All right.
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,209.522,211.372,And I want to be clear about that.
2002.02-241,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,211.813,215.96,"Well, but you are speaking in absolutes and it isn't quite that."
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,222.505,225.24,"--And we absolutely agree, Justice O'Connor."
2002.02-241,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,225.24,250.835,"Is it cause for concern with your... if you're the dean of the law school or the president in the university or the Governor of the State that minority students, particularly from the Black and Hispanic community are underrepresented by a large factor, according to their... their share of the population."
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,262.981,269.54,"We believe not, Your Honor, for the reason that we need to get away from the notion that there's some right number for each racial group."
2002.02-241,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,269.54,280.585,"So if year after year after year there's an underrepresentation, there is no cause for the State or the Government or its educational experts to be concerned whatsoever?"
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,280.585,290.661,"I wouldn't say not to be concerned, Your Honor, I think the mere fact of underrepresentation, that is that say, blacks are not represented as they are in the population is not a concern that would justify racial preferences."
2002.02-241,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,294.206,303.705,"Well, it's a broad social and political concern that there are not adequate members of... of the profession which is designed to protect our rights and to... and to promote progress."
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,307.888,311.283,"The current concern there, Your Honor, ought to be addressed by... by addressing the problem."
2002.02-241,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,324.06,352.756,"Mr. Kolbo, may I call your attention in that regard to the brief that was filed on behalf of some retired military officers who said that to have an officer corps that includes minority members in any number, there is no way to do it other than to give not an overriding preference, but a plus for race."
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,378.967,385.657,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe we have an adequate record in this case from which to conclude that we wouldn't have representation of minorities."
2002.02-241,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,387.066,387.891,Suppose that were true.
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,405.341,407.439,"--I believe race could not be used, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,423.084,428.219,"Yes, they have, if the brief is accurate about the regulations, the academies have taken a position?"
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,428.219,431.519,"As I understand it, Justice Stevens, the briefs are filed on the behalf of individuals."
2002.02-241,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,431.519,432.552,I understand that.
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,438.943,439.804,"Well, Your Honor--"
2002.02-241,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,439.804,442.407,Do you challenge the fact... that that is a matter of fact?
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,442.407,444.437,"--We don't challenge what they say, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,446.063,449.099,"No, but do you challenge the fact that they are giving the preference?"
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,449.099,451.226,We don't have enough information on it to know whether--
2002.02-241,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,451.226,454.674,Are you serious that you think there is a serious question about that?
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,459.257,462.563,"--I just don't know, Your Honor, what the facts are with respect to the military because this case was--"
2002.02-241,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,462.563,464.939,"It depends on what factor you're talking about, doesn't it?"
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,478.003,478.778,"--It does not, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,481.536,509.024,"The issue as I understand it is not whether without preferences there can be a military academy population with some minorities, the question is whether without the... the weighting of race that they do in fact give, they can have an adequate number of minorities in the academies to furnish ultimately a reasonable number of minorities in the officer corps, that's the issue, isn't it?"
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,509.024,515.734,"Well, Your Honor, again, the... the terms you've used, reasonable and adequate, we have no information in this record on which I can make those--"
2002.02-241,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,515.734,518.907,More than what would happen if they did nothing?
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,518.907,521.2,"--And that number, Your Honor, I don't know what it is."
2002.02-241,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.414,533.93,"More than what would happen if they did something else, such as making special provision for all people of economically disadvantaged background."
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,536.44,537.623,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,538.093,547.41,Do you believe that that would be an adequate... at least means of experimenting here... take it as an alternative?
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,547.41,549.358,--Taking race neutral alternatives into consideration?
2002.02-241,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,549.358,551.846,"Well, taking for example economic disadvantage?"
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,551.846,552.489,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,552.489,556.403,Do you seriously believe that that would be anything but a surrogate to race?
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,569.053,570.558,"It certainly functions differently, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,571.579,572.357,Do you think it would?
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,572.357,573.015,"--Certainly, yes--"
2002.02-241,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,573.015,574.456,Is there any reason to believe that it would?
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,574.456,578.401,"--I do, Your Honor, because it's not just minorities that are socioeconomically disadvantaged in this country."
2002.02-241,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,583.08,594.756,"The object... but the object I would have assumed given the dialogue, the object is to increase the racial number of the percentage of minorities."
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,599.816,610.02,"--Well, I would disagree, Your Honor, because I think if you have a race neutral means that accomplishes many purposes, and one of them is race, that is not necessarily under this Court's precedents unconstitutional."
2002.02-241,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,610.753,618.321,"Well, let me ask you this, it's about the military brief that you didn't come here to argue about, but it will maybe get you back to your case."
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,618.321,618.398,--Sure.
2002.02-241,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,618.398,632.771,The military brief tells us... the green brief... that there are preparatory schools that the academies have and 40 percent of the registration in those preparatory schools are racial minorities.
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,647.863,650.171,"I see no constitutional objection there, Justice Kennedy."
2002.02-241,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,666.584,669.169,Would you allow recruiting targeted at minorities?
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,669.169,671.72,"--I don't see the constitutional objection with that, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,671.72,671.773,Fine.
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,755.249,761.968,"Because very simply, Justice Breyer, the Constitution provides the right of... individuals with the right of equal protection."
2002.02-241,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,779.849,797.777,The reason that the injury is more severe to the white person who doesn't get in when that white person doesn't get in because she's not an athlete or he's not a... he's not an alumnus or he's not any of the other things that fits within these other criteria?
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,800.44,802.087,"The difference is the Equal Protection Clause, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,805.15,807.563,That's the legal conclusion.
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,837.646,840.501,"Sound and reasonable, Your Honor, is not enough when it comes to race."
2002.02-241,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,863.129,878.952,"Why... why do you draw the line at... you said you can recruit... you can use a race criterion, if I understood you correctly, to recruit, you could have minority students only given the benefit of scholarships to go to these preparatory schools."
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,885.866,889.249,Because it doesn't prevent someone from applying.
2002.02-241,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.884,897.806,These preparatory schools... do you concede that they're only for minority students?
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,900.244,900.857,Certainly not--
2002.02-241,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.857,908.166,"The majority of the people that attend them are young men and women who really want to get into the service academies, but don't have the grades for it."
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,915.685,916.591,--That--
2002.02-241,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,916.591,918.56,It isn't just for minorities.
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,918.56,919.422,"--They're not, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,922.224,936.037,"I was asking you about your answer to the question, not... the fact may very well be, but I thought you had answered the question, yes, you could have special preparation for minorities only, yes, you could have recruitment for minorities only."
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,938.015,940.885,"I believe you can... as part of a broad program, I believe you could."
2002.02-241,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,954.006,959.283,Including at the point of giving the benefit of going to one of these preparatory schools.
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,963.211,964.214,"No, of course, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,983.58,984.645,May I ask--
2002.02-241,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,984.645,997.646,"--If you're right... if you're right about what equal protection requires and we have also two statutes that incorporate the equal protection principle, then there could be no affirmative action, I take it, in employment?"
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,997.646,1006.665,"There could be, Your Honor, to remedy past identified discrimination, but not to exceed diversity and there is not today as I understand it any compelling interest in the employment context with respect to--"
2002.02-241,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1006.665,1022.861,"So, for example, if we have a prison that was largely minority population and the State wanted to give a preference so that it would have a critical mass of correction officers of the minority race, that would be impermissible?"
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,1022.861,1029.224,"--It would be impermissible, Your Honor, unless based upon a compelling interest and the only one that has been recognized in the employment context is identified discrimination."
2002.02-241,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1031.653,1032.896,"No, it's not in my hypothetical."
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,1032.896,1034.175,Mr. Chief Justice.
2002.02-241,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.175,1036.176,Can I ask you one question about the extent of your position.
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,1054.041,1055.628,I don't believe so Your Honor.
2002.02-241,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.044,1064.169,"Or just one, still would be a... that would exclude an impermissible number of slots for--"
2002.02-241,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,1064.169,1065.419,"If it's slots on the basis of race, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1068.259,1069.232,"--Very well, Mr. Kolbo."
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1071.504,1080.583,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2002.02-241,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1092.359,1095.697,"General Olson, just let me get a question out and you answer it at your convenience."
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1101.122,1102.702,"--Well, I'm not sure--"
2002.02-241,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.702,1107.012,That's the one about the generals and about the military academies.
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1107.012,1125.525,"--I understand... the... our position with respect to that is we respect the opinions of those individuals, but the position of the United States is that we do not accept the proposition that black soldiers will only fight for... black officers or the reverse that race neutral means should be used in the academies as well as other places."
2002.02-241,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1139.411,1143.398,Your suggestion is that the military has broader latitude than the private university?
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1143.398,1144.1,"--No, I'm suggesting that--"
2002.02-241,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1144.1,1145.767,"Well, you're pointing to Rostker suggests that."
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1145.767,1154.221,"--Yes, I'm suggesting that the Court will want to look at each of these individual situations according to the circumstances and that may be a factor in that context."
2002.02-241,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1172.236,1181.848,"But you recognize, General Olson, that here and now, all of the military academies do have race preference programs in admissions?"
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1181.848,1183.377,The Coast Guard does not.
2002.02-241,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1189.971,1192.211,Is that that's illegal what they're doing?
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1192.211,1193.244,--Pardon me?
2002.02-241,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1193.244,1196.923,"Is it... that it is illegal, a violation of the Constitution?"
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1196.923,1202.036,We haven't examined that and we haven't presented a brief with respect to the specifics of each individual academy.
2002.02-241,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1208.91,1215.155,"What do you... what do you think is the... is the principal race neutral means, that the academy should use?"
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1215.155,1215.921,Well--
2002.02-241,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1215.921,1224.148,"Without criticizing necessarily what they're doing now, what would be the... in your judgment, the best race neutral way for them to go about reaching your objective?"
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1224.148,1236.917,"--Well, there are a variety of race neutral means and narrowly tailored methods by which academies and universities can reach out to people of all backgrounds to make sure that they've eliminated--"
2002.02-241,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1236.917,1237.878,"No, no."
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1249.1,1254.746,"Widespread recruiting, making sure that there's opportunities for education and advancement in the... in the academies."
2002.02-241,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1254.746,1257.38,Recruiting with an objective of minority students?
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1257.38,1269.873,"--Not limited, a race neutral system of broad scale recruiting that this Court has always supported the proposition that efforts may be made by governmental institutions to eliminate barriers that have existed where artificial barriers--"
2002.02-241,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1269.873,1270.024,Okay.
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1295.787,1297.944,--That is the opinion of certain individuals.
2002.02-241,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1346.358,1348.651,"Well, what they do is they use race."
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1348.651,1349.953,Exactly.
2002.02-241,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1349.953,1350.772,I know.
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1383.462,1395.548,"Well, a response to those many arguments is that they've... they're using stereotypes to in an effort, they say to break down stereotypes, they're using race as a... a surrogate for experience."
2002.02-241,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1403.56,1404.188,That's not what they say.
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1417.299,1431.596,"--But that person... that person if he went to Exeter and he has a great GPA and so forth gets an extra opportunity either a portion of the class is set aside for that individual solely on the basis of race, irrespective of his experience."
2002.02-241,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1444.553,1461.737,"General Olson, do you... do you agree with the articulated proposal of Justice Powell in the Bakke case of using race as a plus factor as he... as he saw the use of it."
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1463.963,1478.484,"We disagree with that approach in the sense that we... we... in the first place, contrary to what our opponents have said, we would not believe that that single opinion, which was the only opinion, to examine the issue of diversity under a compelling argument--"
2002.02-241,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1478.484,1480.527,I don't think it commanded a court.
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1483.329,1487.099,"--We're reluctant to say never, Justice O'Connor."
2002.02-241,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1495.922,1499.15,"But General Olson, is race different from sex in that regard?"
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1518.977,1520.745,I don't disagree with that.
2002.02-241,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1520.745,1522.776,Why would race discrimination be any different?
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1522.776,1537.5,"I'm suggesting that the programs here, without getting to the point of whether are there any other circumstances whether they be remedial, which this Court... a factor of the Court has recognized before, or something else in an unusual situation, where it could be appropriate."
2002.02-241,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1539.963,1561.458,"I think Santa Clara... I think what Justice Scalia said bears modification, because in fact in Santa Clara, the highway dispatcher, there was a plus for sex, although there was no proven discrimination against that particular woman and this Court approved that."

2002.02-241,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1579.158,1582.275,"General Olson, I'm not sure you answered Justice O'Connor's question."
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1589.367,1594.427,"--No, the Harvard program A wasn't examined aaccording to to any compelling governmental interest."
2002.02-241,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1595.385,1597.115,"So your answer is no, you would not agree with that?"
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1597.115,1599.541,"--We would not based upon any what we see in that opinion, which is--"
2002.02-241,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1599.541,1604.773,Would you disagree with his use of the term diversity as being a permissible governmental goal?
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1604.773,1610.537,"--Well, the only way to answer that Justice Kennedy is that the word diversity means so many things to so many different people."
2002.02-241,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1624.671,1626.597,So is the Texas plan constitutional?
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1638.193,1643.011,"--Justice Breyer, I don't believe that that is the stated motive of the Texas plan or the California or the Florida plan."
2002.02-241,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1663.307,1671.776,"General, what do you say to the argument that the only reason accomplishes it is because it depends on segregation at the lower level of the schools, otherwise it would not accomplish that?"
2002.02-241,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1671.776,1677.164,"No, there is no evidence that it depends upon segregation of the schools in Texas or in any other place."
2002.02-241,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1681.436,1682.634,"Thank you, General Olson."
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1684.663,1689.75,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-241,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1705.883,1710.693,I'm not sure... in his brief does he acknowledge that can be a compelling interest?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1710.693,1716.374,The brief says that it is one of the paramount interests of government to have diversity in higher education.
2002.02-241,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.93,1756.802,"Ms. Mahoney, supposing that after our Bakke decision came down, whereas Cal. Davis set aside 16 seats for disadvantaged minorities, and Cal. Davis said we're going to try to get those 16 seats in some way, we're going to try high school graduates, we're going to try socioeconomic and none of the... none of those methods get the 16 seats that they want."
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1762.987,1764.32,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1781.534,1787.754,"But my hypothesis was, they wanted 16 seats and that plan just won't give it to them?"
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1787.754,1802.044,"--Well, if... if the program was designed to have a fixed 16 seats, no matter what the qualifications of the applicant pool, no matter what the disparities between the minority and majority students would be, then I think it's fair to say that that would be a quota."
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.522,1843.891,"Ms. Mahoney, I... I find it hard to take seriously the State of Michigan's contention that racial diversity is a compelling State interest, compelling enough to warrant ignoring the Constitution's prohibition of distribution on the basis of race."
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1919.01,1929.655,"Your Honor, I don't think there's anything in this Court's cases that suggests that the law school has to make an election between academic excellence and racial diversity."
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1932.351,1934.981,If it claims it's a compelling State interest.
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1945.649,1950.439,"--Your Honor, the question isn't whether it's important to override the prohibition on discrimination."
2002.02-241,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1955.666,1956.608,"No, no."
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1961.522,1963.973,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1963.973,1972.059,"And Justice Scalia's question is designed to put to you the fact that this isn't a compelling interest, because it's a choice that the Michigan law school has made to be like this."
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1972.059,1985.449,"Your Honor, the issue is whether it is sufficiently compelling to allow Michigan to take race into account in this limited fashion in order to provide a much better education for students of all races."
2002.02-241,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1991.555,1998.616,But the question put to you is Michigan has designed its school in a particular way and it doesn't have to do that.
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1998.616,2022.407,"--But Your Honor there is a compelling interest in having an institution that is both academically excellent and racially diverse, because our leaders need to be trained in institutions that are excellent, that are superior academically, but they also need to be trained with exposure to the viewpoints, to the prospectives, to the experiences of individuals from diverse backgrounds."
2002.02-241,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2022.407,2026.828,"But... but that brings us to the question of the use of race, which is being used here."
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2048.837,2057.465,"No, Your Honor, because the district court did not make any factual findings that would support the conclusion that this is a disguised quota."
2002.02-241,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2057.465,2060.478,Is it beyond this Court's capacity to say that?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2069.426,2076.103,"Well, Your Honor, the... there has to be evidence in the record that would support the conclusion that it's a quota."

2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2132.674,2133.707,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2156.496,2156.567,Excuse me.
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2161.176,2162.021,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.021,2164.664,If adopted by... by a State institution?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2164.664,2165.42,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2165.42,2167.383,It held that it was constitutional?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2167.383,2167.816,Yes.
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2168.374,2171.714,We didn't even... we didn't even have the details of the Harvard plan before us?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2171.714,2194.634,"--Your Honor, in fact, the Court upheld... or just Powell appended the Harvard plan to his opinion in this case and there were five votes that the reason that the mandate of the California Supreme Court should be reversed was because there was an effective alternative for... for enrolling minorities and that effective alternative was a plan like the Harvard plan."

2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2228.477,2250.497,"Your Honor, there is... there is certainly a major difference between an educational policy that is motivated by an intent to exclude people based on racial animus and one like the Law School's policy and the Harvard plan, which is designed to include students of all races, so that the education of all students will be enriched as a result."
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2250.497,2252.145,But not too many of any race?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2252.145,2252.737,"Well, Your Honor--"
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2252.737,2255.08,"Or not too many of any religion, I assume?"
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2255.08,2257.678,--Your Honor it is not a question of not too many.
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.535,2273.727,But... but without a quota?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2275.838,2277.021,Your Honor it is not a quota.
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.021,2281.503,"When you say sufficient numbers, you're... I mean that suggests to me that there is... there is some minimum."

2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2286.369,2288.364,"Well, then you have to eliminate the word sufficient."
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2288.364,2292.836,"Your Honor, it... it can be related to numbers without being a quota."
2002.02-241,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2318.716,2321.051,Certainly they don't interpret the Constitution?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2321.051,2323.524,"No, they don't Your Honor, but that is what Bakke held."
2002.02-241,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2335.527,2354.413,Is it fair to say that the... what the... what... what justice Powell and the five who agreed or the four who agreed on the Harvard plan were getting at was that there is a permissible zone between a purely token number and a quota or a set aside and you can shoot for something in that zone?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2355.745,2356.958,Absolutely Your Honor.
2002.02-241,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2370.278,2378.089,"--It's hard to see that that's... that's true here, when every day the admission staff looks to see what the numbers are based on race?"
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2378.089,2379.609,"Your Honor, that's not correct."
2002.02-241,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2388.182,2390.174,You just have a daily report that they look at once a week?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2390.174,2398.361,"Your Honor, the reason it's called a daily is that it is a running database that allows for the report to be printed at any time."
2002.02-241,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2400.936,2407.613,To show how well they're doing in getting the so-called critical mass which is just a synonym for a number?

2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2448.87,2449.445,Okay.

2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2453.53,2454.764,"Like 8, is 8 percent?"
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2454.764,2455.347,"--Now, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2455.347,2463.481,"Now, does it stop being a quota because it's somewhere between 8 and 12, but it is a quota if it's 10?"
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2470.961,2475.653,"Your Honor, what a quota is under this Court's cases is a fixed number."
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2482.45,2487.33,"As long as you say between 8 and 12, you're okay?"

2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2654.301,2654.764,--Yes.
2002.02-241,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2654.764,2655.459,Or whether--
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2655.459,2656.909,"Yes, they're not quotas, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2656.909,2660.245,--The critical mass?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2660.245,2660.775,We know aspirations.

2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2686.6,2703.677,"I think the answer would be that we do know that in 1964 when there was a race-blind policy, there were no blacks admitted, and under a race-blind policy today, probably six blacks would be admitted without consideration of race."
2002.02-241,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2710.69,2720.083,Do we know what's happened in the law schools in California since it was determined by State law affirm tisk?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2720.083,2720.478,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2766.741,2769.59,"Well, there are other law schools in California, too, are there not?"
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2769.59,2775.543,"--Yes, UCLA, well, this is mainly Your Honor a problem for the highly selective schools because of the nature of the pool."
2002.02-241,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2775.543,2778.214,"You have some good law schools, you have UCLA, you have USC?"
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2778.214,2778.919,UCLA.
2002.02-241,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2778.919,2780.528,SC is private?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2780.528,2780.791,Yes.
2002.02-241,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2780.791,2781.721,But UCLA?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2781.721,2789.235,"UCLA... UCLA had... the class that's graduatiing this year, for instance, I believe had five blacks in it."
2002.02-241,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2848.229,2849.979,That's difficult when it's not in the record.
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2890.904,2892.746,"Because, Your Honor I think--"
2002.02-241,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2892.746,2901.347,It seems to me that that was a... a really a false... or an improper qualification that you gave to your answer?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2901.347,2902.448,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2934.521,2945.758,"How does the University determine from one year to the next, you say some years it'll come out 8 percent, some year 9 percent, do they make a conscious decision?"
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2945.758,2947.996,"No, Your Honor, the evidence shows--"
2002.02-241,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2947.996,2948.807,Just toss a coin?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2948.807,2952.21,"--No, it's not tossing a coin, but it is not a fixed number."
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2974.879,2982.534,"Ms. Mahoney, do you know any quota program that would take somebody to fill the quota no matter what?"
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2998.191,2998.825,--Your Honor--
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2998.825,3007.874,To establish that kind of a standard for quota is... is to... is to just eliminate the... the whole purpose of... of that aspect of our law.
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3007.874,3021.535,"--Actually, Your Honor, the way that in Bakke it worked, it wasn't the situation that they would take someone no matter what, but they did have a rule, that you could not be considered for the spaces that had been set aside if you were white."
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3049.339,3051.323,But they aren't just like every applicant.
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3054.977,3062.889,"Your Honor, they are given extra weight in the process, because they have something unusual and important to bring to the class."
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3066.98,3069.941,Which you say automatically follows from race?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3069.941,3074.408,"--Your Honor, they also write essays about diversity."
2002.02-241,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3078.833,3104.851,"Ms. Mahoney, how does the Michigan plan differ or the Harvard plan, for that matter, from what was familiar, that is, highly selected schools will reject a certain number of people, take a number of people as automatic acceptance and in the large middle will say, well, we'll... we'll take people because they're different, because they play the bassoon, because they belong to a minority race?"
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3113.877,3118.517,--That's exactly what the University of Michigan Law School plan does.
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.157,3140.276,--Does the Constitution prohibit distribution against... against oboe players as opposed to flute players?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3140.276,3140.943,"--No, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3140.943,3145.202,Does it prohibit distribution on the basis of alumna status?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3145.202,3145.945,"No, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3145.945,3149.077,But it does prohibit distribution on the basis of race?
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3149.077,3152.076,But the question is whether this is prohibited discrimination.
2002.02-241,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3165.849,3188.655,"Ms. Mahoney, may I ask you a question that is really prompted by Justice O'Connor's question about the terminal point in all of this point and we're all hoping some day race will be a totally irrelevant factor in all decisions, but one of your arguments on the other side of your case is that there's actually... these programs actually generate racial hostility particularly on the part of the excluded members."
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3195.611,3198.866,The record certainly does not support that inference under this program.
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3264.19,3265.223,"Sure, they're in already."
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3265.223,3266.926,--Your Honor that's for the--
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3266.926,3280.73,The people you want to talk to are the high school seniors who have seen... who have seen people visibly less qualified than they are get into prestigious institutions where they are rejected.
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3283.804,3290.161,"--Well, Your Honor, certainly the minorities who have been admitted under the program are not feeling stigmatized by it."
2002.02-241,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3325.572,3348.272,"If Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke can be viewed as, yes, you can used race as a plus factor, where the program is not against anyone, but you cannot go too far, and it says individualized consideration is necessary there, what in your opinion would be going too far, other than quotas?"
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3350.632,3353.438,I think there are really three things other than a quota to look for.
2002.02-241,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3428.594,3437.821,"Do we know what would be the increase of the named Plaintiffs, the increase in their chance of admission, were there no average tisk programs?"
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3437.821,3447.506,"I don't know what the increase for the... for Barbara Grutter would have been, for instance, we do know that across the class, it would have been approximately 5 percent."
2002.02-241,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3461.14,3468.325,"I don't know any other area where we... where we decide the case by saying well, there are very few people who are being treated unconstitutionally."
2002.02-241,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3482.371,3486.257,I think you can regard that as a statement rather than a question.
2002.02-241,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3486.257,3487.178,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2002.02-241,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3487.178,3492.293,"Mr. Kolbo, you have two minutes remaining."
2002.02-241,3,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,3492.293,3494.297,"Thank you, if I may follow-up on the last question."
2002.02-241,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3628.083,3629.334,Thank you Mr. Kolbo.
