1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.272,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-7351, Jeffrey Alan Walton v. Arizona."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,28.483,32.637,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-7351,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,178.46,185.666,That... that is different from... from just in the course of a robbery suddenly shooting someone.
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,203.211,209.865,"--Well, I can't refrain, Justice Scalia, from pointing out that there isn't, of course, any testimony that such a debate occurred."
1989.88-7351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,243.286,246.788,"Well, what about this... how about the fact that Justice Scalia points to?"
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,254.877,266.285,"Well, if the Arizona Supreme Court had said that discussing whether or not to shoot a person in... in his presence was an aggravating circumstance... and that was the definition of this aggravating circumstance... that would be, of course, a different case."
1989.88-7351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,267.052,267.485,Well--
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,267.485,269.737,"--until this case, and I'm not sure they said it in this case."
1989.88-7351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,269.737,272.688,"--Well, what if they did say it in this case?"
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,272.688,282.996,"Well, if they did say it in this case, the point... our point again... remains, Justice White, that they never said it in any case before and in many other cases where it occurred before that was--"
1989.88-7351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.996,290.317,"Well, I know, but they... they carried out an independent review of the death sentence and they said here is what cruelty is."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,298.806,302.125,"--Well, of course, and that's what the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals said in Maynard as well."
1989.88-7351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,319.669,342.1,"Well, Arizona... the Arizona court purported to exercise its authority... an authority under state law to affirm the... the death sentence despite any... any evidence that the sentencer below had that in mind."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,342.1,342.316,--Yes.
1989.88-7351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,342.316,349.303,"They said, here is a... here is... here is what cruelty is, and on the facts of this case there was cruelty."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,349.303,349.736,That's correct.
1989.88-7351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,349.736,351.505,But you say that is contrary to Maynard?
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,351.505,367.014,"It seems to me that that's exactly what the court of criminal appeals did in Maynard and in actually in some ways worse because in a court of criminal appeals in Maynard we had a jury instruction... we knew what that jury was told constituted heinous, atrocious or cruel."
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,457.455,461.574,Is this to you a violation of the Sixth Amendment or the Eighth Amendment or both or--
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,461.574,494.145,"This is a Sixth Amendment issue, Mr. Chief Justice, and Fourteenth Amendment as well because the specific intent of the framers of the Sixth Amendment in 1791 and the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, as evidenced by the commentators, as is evidenced by the words of Justice Jay three years after the Sixth Amendment was written, as evidenced by the Colonial and English history of what a jury was, everyone agreed ad quaestionem facti non respondent Judices... judges could not answer question of fact."
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,494.145,496.83,"--Well, how do you get around our Hildwin case?"
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,496.83,505.27,"Well, the Hildwin case, Your Honor, I think takes us right to the threshold of what the framers were trying to preserve for the jury."
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,517.828,522.164,"Yeah, but there was the trial judge who carried out... who had the final say."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,522.164,524.882,"Well, the trial judge has the final say on sentencing."
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,539.859,541.626,"Yeah, but the judge in Florida does."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,541.626,545.145,"Well, the judge in Florida... as I understand Florida law, in the--"
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,545.145,548.815,"Well, have you... you must take it as we understood it in Hildwin."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,548.815,549.132,--Okay.
1989.88-7351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,555.369,557.405,"Well, what do you do about Cabana?"
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,557.405,565.409,--What Cabana involves is... as the Court... I reread Cabana last night and it explains very carefully that the finding of fact that's involved there is--
1989.88-7351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,565.409,575.366,"I know, but in... he... that... that... that defendant was not eligible for the death penalty unless it was found as a matter of fact that he killed or intended to kill."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,575.366,576.682,--And... and as the--
1989.88-7351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,576.682,583.536,And we... I thought we indicated that that wasn't necessarily a job for a jury.
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,583.536,593.344,--Because that requirement was imposed by the Eighth Amendment and... by the Federal courts as a matter of their proportionality review under the Eighth Amendment.
1989.88-7351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,597.63,609.838,"Well, that may be so, but... so that your generality, the way you put it, isn't quite true, that... that if a... if a fact is necessary to make somebody eligible for the death penalty, it must be found by the jury."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,609.838,610.705,--If the fact is eligible--
1989.88-7351,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.705,611.222,That's what you said.
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,611.222,611.722,--That's correct.
1989.88-7351,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,640.559,650.831,"I... I take it that a sentence enhancement statute enhancing the sentence if a bank robber carries a gun, in your view, would have to be submitted to the jury?"
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,650.831,653.116,Certainly not under McMillan v. Pennsylvania.
1989.88-7351,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,666.174,667.042,"Well, do you--"
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,667.042,667.625,Number two--
1989.88-7351,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,667.625,671.66,--Do you say then that this is an element of the offense?
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,671.66,678.164,--This is necessarily an element of the offense as that term is understood everywhere in the law.
1989.88-7351,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,681.449,697.041,"Well, every... everywhere in the law does the jury have to be separately instructed on the difference between... two different charges, felony murder or... or murder by the perpetration of the defendant?"
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,697.041,700.993,"--I... as I understand it, juries do in Arizona and everywhere have to be instructed on those."
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,721.573,734.314,"But take... take this sentence from, Mr. Ford, from Hildwin: The ultimate decision to impose a sentence of death, however, is made by the court after finding at least one aggravating circumstance."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,734.314,735.416,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,735.416,739.951,There it was made by the court after the court found an aggravating circumstance.
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,739.951,740.601,That's correct.
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,760.246,767.602,"But see... you know, you've made this very broad statement here that all facts must be found by a jury under the Sixth Amendment."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,778.373,786.86,"--I think not, Mr. Chief Justice, because what I'm talking about are the terms, as these terms would have been understood in 1791 and in 1868."
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,787.812,795.216,"Well, what... what... what would have been understood about aggravating circumstances in 1791?"
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,796.835,801.988,"--Well, they... though that particular phrase wasn't used... I'm not sure the phrase ""elements of the offense"" was used at that time."
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,818.681,820.866,"Well, you're just arguing that Hildwin is wrong."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,820.866,821.816,"--Well, I think not."
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,828.889,829.372,"Well, how--"
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,829.372,830.172,"But if it does, then--"
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,830.172,831.591,--How does... does it differ?
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,831.591,840.946,"--It differs because the statute is written differently, because the statute talks about these factors as considerations and the determination is whether they are sufficient."
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,852.901,853.285,"Well, what--"
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,853.285,853.92,--judicial one that--
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,853.92,860.324,"--Why should that make any difference, the fact that one aggravating circumstance isn't enough to impose the death penalty in Florida?"
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,860.324,860.641,--Yes--
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.641,863.276,How is that distinguished for Sixth Amendment purposes?
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,863.276,870.597,--Because an element of the offense is a discrete atomic sort of... that's why I think maybe we call them elements.
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,908.952,916.874,"Well, a judge can make findings that the considerations existed, but a jury has to make findings that aggravating circumstances existed."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,916.874,917.408,--No.
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,924.378,924.745,"Well, but no."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,928.932,946.893,"--Well, as I understand, the way that the Florida statute is written, Mr. Chief Justice, is that those factors are there to be identified so that appellate courts can look and avoid arbitrariness by saying, here are the factors that are... were in this case; we're looking at comparative cases; we have reasons stated on the record."
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,978.699,989.47,"Well, Arizona still has a series of elements in the offense that the jury has to find to make you come within a definite first step of a capital sentencing process."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,989.47,991.839,--They have the traditional first-degree murder.
1989.88-7351,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1089.936,1095.721,"Mr.... Mr. Ford, how do recidivism statutes work?"
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,1102.094,1103.51,--They vary in many ways.
1989.88-7351,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1169.019,1193.567,"Well, of course, it... it does... it does seem to me that this jury found the defendant guilty of murder as specified in the statute and that for double jeopardy purposes, for finality purposes was complete when the jury was instructed on the elements of the offense without reference to the aggravating and mitigating character... character of the act."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,1193.567,1195.317,--He was convicted of first-degree murder.
1989.88-7351,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1214.131,1223.57,"Well, I suppose under the Federal sentencing guidelines there are any number of... of different factual circumstances that the trial judge finds on sentence."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,1225.022,1225.988,That's correct.
1989.88-7351,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1245.3,1252.437,"You mean the more facts the judge can find, the... the less need there is for the fact-finder under your theory?"
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,1252.437,1257.174,"--The... when... yes, exactly, because that's what the Court said in Spaziano."
1989.88-7351,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1464.523,1465.539,"Or your other issue, I suppose."
1989.88-7351,0,42694,timothy_k_ford,,1465.539,1471.842,"--The other issues are difficult for me to argue, Justice White, because the Court has other cases that are so close to them."
1989.88-7351,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1496.994,1498.144,"Thank you, Mr. Ford."
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1506.182,1509.217,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1989.88-7351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1594.407,1601.311,"I mean, is that whether or not the... the defendant knew that and intended that?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1601.311,1602.827,"--Justice Scalia, the--"
1989.88-7351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1602.827,1605.096,Because here... here that obviously occurred.
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1605.946,1606.898,--He did know because--
1989.88-7351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1606.898,1614.219,"--victim was blinded by... by the shot in the head and wandered around in the desert for five days before he finally died of starvation, as I gather."
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1614.219,1614.752,--That's correct.
1989.88-7351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1645.187,1658.762,"Now, Arizona does not require the trial judge to spell out what factors of the crime make... make it especially heinous and cruel?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1658.762,1661.378,"Your Honor, in order to understand that you have to understand--"
1989.88-7351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1661.378,1662.714,Yes or no?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1662.714,1667.701,--The... the facts do not have to be specified in the written order.
1989.88-7351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1667.701,1671.486,"It would certainly make it easier on appellate review, wouldn't it?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1671.486,1677.056,"Your Honor, how it comes to appellate review is what I was trying to get into."
1989.88-7351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1701.519,1712.843,But you nonetheless do not know which factors were relied on and found to exist by the trial judge?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1712.843,1718.497,"The trial court stated that it found the circumstance... it stated it found cruel, heinous or depraved."
1989.88-7351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.732,1755.855,"Well, I take it the definition of cruelty that the supreme court articulated in this... in its opinion in this case was... had been previously articulated--"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1755.855,1756.472,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-7351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1756.472,1759.224,--in the two or three cases they cited.
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1759.224,1760.507,"Many, many times."
1989.88-7351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.876,1767.347,"So, I suppose you can assume trial courts know what the law is, what the definition of that--"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1767.347,1780.471,"That was the second area I was getting... that the problem with Maynard is that the sentencing body, the juries, were not given instructions on what the definition of the law was to inform them what facts were necessary to be found."
1989.88-7351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.029,1824.564,--[inaudible] in non-First Amendment case?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1824.564,1833.004,"--Your Honor, the contention is that it applies to too many or it applies to all first-degree murderers."
1989.88-7351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1849.078,1856.417,"Have we ever had a case that applies, quote, overbreadth, unquote, in a capital case?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1856.417,1857.267,"--No, Your Honor, I can't--"
1989.88-7351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1857.267,1861.655,Why are you talking about it as though we had?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1861.655,1865.272,--The contention was raised in Lowenfeld that the circumstance--
1989.88-7351,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1865.272,1869.241,"Well, I would think you would say overbreadth doesn't apply."
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1869.241,1871.593,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-7351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1890.822,1893.424,I must say I didn't really follow your argument based on Lowenfeld.
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1897.208,1897.708,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-7351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1905.414,1911.901,And if the crime is... and that the category of people eligible for the death penalty was adequately narrowed by the definition of the crime.
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1912.837,1913.22,--That's right.
1989.88-7351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1913.687,1915.52,So what does that got to do with this case?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1915.52,1916.137,--Like--
1989.88-7351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1916.137,1917.139,Because you don't rely on that.
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1920.941,1921.407,--No.
1989.88-7351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1934.482,1938.533,But isn't one of those the factor you're just talking about?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1939.4,1939.885,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-7351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1939.885,1940.218,Oh.
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1940.218,1941.884,One of those is the factor we're just talking about.
1989.88-7351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1942.684,1947.805,"So then it is necessary that that factor perform a legitimate narrowing function, isn't it?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1947.805,1950.221,"--No, because it didn't... wasn't required in Lowenfeld."
1989.88-7351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1953.709,1957.577,But your... does your statute... is your statute just as narrow as the Louisiana statute was?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1957.577,1963.23,--Many of the cases that would fall within Louisiana would not be first-degree murder in Arizona and vice versa.
1989.88-7351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1971.068,1971.586,I'm still puzzled.
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1976.122,1977.49,Absolutely not.
1989.88-7351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1979.906,1983.394,"Well, then if it's not superfluous, why... why doesn't it have to perform a narrowing function?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1985.86,1986.512,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.88-7351,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.552,1999.337,As narrowly defined in that statute.
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,1999.337,2000.52,That is correct.
1989.88-7351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2032.558,2038.462,You are saying it's superfluous if... if you're... you're saying you wouldn't really have needed that anyway.
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2038.462,2038.945,That's correct.
1989.88-7351,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2038.945,2045.116,"But it's narrow enough without the cruel, heinous circumstance narrowing."
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2045.116,2046.466,That is correct.
1989.88-7351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.466,2054.138,I... I thought I also understood your response to Justice Stevens that it does perform some narrowing function.
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2054.138,2055.338,That is also correct.
1989.88-7351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.366,2078.087,"Well, that's no different from the aggravating circumstances in any other death penalty statute."
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2078.087,2083.991,It is no different than any other aggravating circumstance.
1989.88-7351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2174.299,2183.588,What if the trial judge thinks the evidence is in equipoise as to the existence of a... of mitigating evidence?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2192.026,2196.414,"If he believes the defendant has failed to meet its evidentiary burden, then he is precluded from considering that."
1989.88-7351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2196.414,2198.43,What do you do about Mills?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2198.43,2209.322,"Well, Mills is a different situation, Your Honor, because there the sentencer was the jury and one juror was controlling whether or not the mitigation was found."
1989.88-7351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.872,2213.876,"Well, I know, but the... but the... so, the... so the problem was unanimity, wasn't it?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2213.876,2215.776,--That's correct.
1989.88-7351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2215.776,2233.52,"And the net result of it even if... even if it wasn't unanimous... even if it was 11 to 1 that there was a mitigating circumstance, the... or there was no mitigating circumstance... one juror was still entitled under Mills to consider the mitigating evidence."
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2233.52,2233.987,That is correct.
1989.88-7351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.907,2253.267,But the trial judge here is... unless... unless... unless the evidence is... the mitigating circumstance is proved by a preponderance to his satisfaction--
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2253.267,2253.934,That is correct.
1989.88-7351,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.934,2255.953,--he will not consider it at all.
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2255.953,2263.373,Because under the preponderance standard it means that it is probably not true.
1989.88-7351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2263.373,2279.501,"Well, what were the... were there specific examples here of efforts by the defendant to show mitigating circumstances which one of the Arizona courts said needn't be considered or shouldn't be considered because of failure of proof?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2279.501,2280.918,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-7351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2280.918,2285.138,Then why... why is that question involved in this case?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2285.138,2287.84,The defendant makes a facial attack on the statute.
1989.88-7351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2287.84,2293.578,"Well, I think we have to perhaps get back to what Justice O'Connor mentioned before."
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2303.934,2313.039,Because the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that our statute was unconstitutional on its face in that... in that case.
1989.88-7351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2317.859,2333.369,"Do you think that our capital punishment jurisprudence says that you simply go through all the provisions of a statute in the abstract regardless of how they may have been applied to the particular defendant in question and says, well, this is good, but this isn't?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2333.369,2335.005,"No, Your Honor, I do not believe that is--"
1989.88-7351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2335.005,2338.373,So you don't think there should be permitted a facial attack?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2338.373,2340.073,"--No, I do not believe that's the case."
1989.88-7351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2340.073,2343.844,But you're... you're defending this because the Petitioner makes it?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2343.844,2356.734,I'm defending this because the Petitioner makes it and based on the Ninth Circuit's opinion there's a deadlock that cannot be resolved unless this Court resolves the issue.
1989.88-7351,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2496.589,2503.409,"Well, is... in your position... is it your position that this is not an element of the offense?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2503.409,2504.076,Absolutely not.
1989.88-7351,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2507.278,2516.884,"Well, is it a matter for state law to define what's an element of defense when a jury... when the issue is whether you're entitled to a Federal jury trial?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2516.884,2524.672,--It is within the purview of the state court to determine the purpose for which it... those aggravating factors exist.
1989.88-7351,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2537.48,2537.863,"Well, part of the sentencing process?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2537.863,2538.713,Absolutely.
1989.88-7351,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2545.918,2558.643,"The... the allegation that it was the defendant that pulled the trigger here, what particular part of the Code does that come under?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2563.463,2568.082,"That would not be an aggravating offense, the simple fact whether or not he pulled the trigger."
1989.88-7351,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2570.951,2579.473,That was relevant to the difference between a felony murder and a murder under... a first-degree murder of another type under the statute?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2579.473,2580.842,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-7351,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2580.842,2584.377,"Well, then why isn't that an element of the offense?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2584.377,2584.86,He was--
1989.88-7351,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2584.86,2587.978,"If it's not an aggravating factor, what is it then?"
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2590.378,2594.299,--He was... he was convicted under first-degree murder.
1989.88-7351,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2614.379,2620.699,Was... was the fact that he pulled the trigger relevant in the judge's aggravation/mitigation analysis?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2620.699,2629.639,The judge said it was relevant in determining mitigation because one of the proffered mitigating circumstances was that he... his claim that I did not do it.
1989.88-7351,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2648.366,2668.847,And... and how do you distinguish this from Justice Stevens' hypothetical in his separate opinion in which he said that it's like an assault and then the further inquiries whether it's assault with intent to kill or assault within the course of a rape?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2668.847,2674.684,The elements of whether or not the defendant is liable for first-degree murder have not changed.
1989.88-7351,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2686.342,2690.51,How do we know the difference by looking to the face of the statute?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2690.51,2691.895,--The difference between--
1989.88-7351,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2691.895,2698.366,An... an element of the defense and a factor that's used in sentencing?
1989.88-7351,1,38170,paul_joseph_mcmurdie,,2698.366,2708.155,"--Your Honor, you can simply... in my state you can simply look at the purpose based on the legislative history of the aggravating circumstances."
1989.88-7351,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2761.207,2762.726,"Thank you, Mr. McMurdie."
1989.88-7351,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2767.278,2771.995,"Justice Kennedy, you won't find the word... the phrase ""elements of the offense"" anywhere in the Arizona statute."
1989.88-7351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2850.144,2872.507,"Rather, if you just left it to the judge and didn't specify what particular criteria would determine the severity of the sentence... let's say you leave it to the judge to pick between a fine and imprisonment, which also differs in the terms ""life, liberty or property""... it's the difference between property and liberty... you could leave it entirely to the judge."
1989.88-7351,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2881.715,2882.048,--It's--
1989.88-7351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2882.048,2893.338,"But your position is that if the state says that you can only give imprisonment if you find a certain fact, then it has to come out of the sentencing judge and go to the jury."
1989.88-7351,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2894.606,2895.273,--That's right.
1989.88-7351,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2911.049,2915.203,Why does it cease to be a sentencing determination simply because you specify?
1989.88-7351,2,42694,timothy_k_ford,,2915.203,2928.863,"Well, when you specify... because there... the line between where we are and Justice Stevens' hypothetical and McMillan vanishes because there no longer is any answer left except we called it sentencing, therefore, it's okay."
1989.88-7351,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3121.18,3121.763,"Thank you, Mr. Ford."
