2015.14-940,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.29,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 14-940, Evenwel v. Abbott. Mr. Consovoy."
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,7.29,19.685,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This appeal presents a fundamental question. That question is whether the one-person, one-vote rule affords eligible voters any reasonable protection."
2015.14-940,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,53.195,74.105,"What about the many times the Court has said that the -- the principle is equal representation of the population? And we have had now, for half a century, population -- that the population is the -- the legitimate standard."
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,89.69,98.96,"I can answer the question in -- in three different ways. First, with respect to the phrase ""equal representation for equal numbers of people."" That sentence originated in Wesberry."
2015.14-940,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,143.64,155.664,"I thought -- I thought Burns said it approved a deviation from population but it took great pains to say, we're not saying you could do that in every case."
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,173.105,178.45,"I -- I read Burns as reserving on it completely, to not choose one way or the other."
2015.14-940,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,225.23,230.535,The problem is that -- what you're forgetting is the dual interest.
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,289.93,296.77,So if I can just clarify: It's not really a representational interest that's being claimed on the other side.
2015.14-940,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,348.45,356.74,"Mr. Consovoy, of course it's true that when we apportion House members, we use total population as the metric."
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,370.4,385.06,"Apportionment and intrastate districting are fundamentally different concerns. Apportionment at the time of Article I's framing was focused on taxation issues, on giving States autonomy with respect to voter qualifications."
2015.14-940,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,417.64,427.385,"What's interesting is in Reynolds is the reason they caved was because, constitutionally, the Arizona Constitution required total population."
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,438.605,443.3,"Well, the -- not that this Court found the case, because it wouldn't -- couldn't be before this Court on a State law ground."
2015.14-940,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,444.23,444.31,No.
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,450.87,454.05,"There's no doubt that Reynolds thought, in that case, total population."
2015.14-940,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,517.44,518.05,I'm -- I'm sorry.
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,522.89,523.195,No.
2015.14-940,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,566.3,587.785,"Is it your view that what the Fourteenth Amendment means is that in all the years between -- what was it? -- 1868 and 1920, it was wrong for the States to include, for these purposes, women? They were not eligible voters."
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,587.785,591.08,Any -- there is no question that was a problem.
2015.14-940,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,598.72,600.42,But you're saying that that was wrong.
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,614.38,619.235,"For purposes of the -- of the Equal Protection Clause, the one-person, one-vote rule protects voters."
2015.14-940,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,643.49,647.995,"Yes, but here we have -- I want to go back to Justice Kagan's question."
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,736.935,748.93,"So two answers. One is to argue that this is justiciable on the other side as a Guarantee Clause claim, I think shows just how far the logic has to go to come up with something on the other side of the ledger here."
2015.14-940,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,761.9,762.45,"Well, Mr. Consovoy --"
2015.14-940,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,762.45,763.05,I'm not making it.
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,770.345,790.17,"If I could -- but Reynolds, I think, does speak to this, because that exact theory would be the one that would have sustained the model that Alabama brought to the Court, that -- that followed the House of Representatives, which does take account of these issues. And even if, Justice Breyer, even if you're correct, that theory is correct, that doesn't solve this case."
2015.14-940,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,802.66,805.825,"You had an expert say it, but you didn't have an expert prove it."
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,808.16,819.96,"We did not come in with a map. One, we're still at the motion-to-dismiss stage in this case, so our allegation, which is at paragraph 22 of the complaint, has to be taken as true. But second, the reason we didn't come to a map is fundamental here as well."
2015.14-940,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,830.99,858.64,"How is -- does practical possibility play into this discussion at all? I mean, the ACS, which you posit is the way that you can find who the eligible voters are, has been -- has been -- I think almost decisively been proven as being inadequate. It only measures cities with populations or places with populations over 65,000."
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,863.6,865.57,I -- I think -- sorry.
2015.14-940,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,865.57,869.12,It's flawed on many levels.
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,877.28,886.645,"I will take the assumption and then I will try to argue again against it, if you -- you'll allow me. But practicality, if the Court were to hold that -- two different questions."
2015.14-940,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1061.13,1089.98,"Mr. Consovoy, could I go back to the question that Justice Breyer raised and can -- stripped, if he'll permit me, of the Guarantee Clause, because the Fourteenth Amendment is actually quite -- you know, the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment explicitly considered this issue, and, you know, made a decision. So Senator Howard, who introduces the Amendment on behalf of the joint committee that drafts it, talks about these deliberations."
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1144.305,1145.85,Justice Harlan agreed with you.
2015.14-940,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1146.79,1148.96,That's a good person to be on the side of.
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1148.96,1149.4,Yes. (Laughter.)
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1149.4,1153.43,But his -- his position was rejected 8-1 in Reynolds.
2015.14-940,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1187.72,1190.68,I hear you as to that it does not apply.
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1209.0,1215.38,"So, two answers. We take our cue on that from the right that is supposed to be protected."
2015.14-940,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1322.06,1334.47,"In -- in your view, the States would have a choice between the citizen voting-age population or they could use the registered voters? Either one would be okay?"
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1334.47,1337.57,"Well, we start with the proposition that Burns said."
2015.14-940,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1426.57,1430.935,Do you think they did that invidiously? Did they do it purposely?
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1430.935,1436.95,"Well, under one-person, one-vote, a deviation over 10 percent, as the Court just recently heard --"
2015.14-940,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1436.95,1442.135,"They knew that, and they intentionally decided to have deviations greater than 10 percent? That's what you're saying?"
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1442.135,1445.62,I don't think we can know -- we'll ever know because they were handcuffed by State law.
2015.14-940,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1453.66,1459.645,That goes both back to my point that they decided that they wanted to make this a representational matter.
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1466.36,1466.735,No.
2015.14-940,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1477.05,1486.445,"Well, we have -- we have plenty of case law that says you can have deviations greater than 10 percent -- Hawaii did -- if you have a legitimate reason."
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1496.955,1498.9,We think it is a -- a reason to go over 10 percent.
2015.14-940,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1510.53,1516.96,You're -- you're now -- you're now saying 10 to 20 percent is okay instead of 10 percent when we use total population.
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1516.96,1521.925,"The -- the Court has up -- held up the 16.5 percent, and -- and Mahan 20 percent as the outer limit."
2015.14-940,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1523.86,1528.615,"Suppose Texas said here, we want children to be represented? That's all."
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1535.59,1537.34,We haven't examined it.
2015.14-940,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1550.26,1551.55,"Well, how about --"
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1551.55,1551.7,-- have --
2015.14-940,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1551.7,1557.54,"How about children who are citizens when their parents are not, which is fairly common in many areas?"
2015.14-940,0,62606,william_s_consovoy,,1557.54,1567.97,"And -- and when -- when they become eligible voters, they will move into this base. They are not counted for Section 2, and don't -- haven't heard any argument that Section 2 discriminates against children. If I might, Mr. Chairman, reserve the balance."
2015.14-940,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1567.97,1575.745,"Thank you, counsel. General Keller."
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1575.745,1590.585,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The only question the Court has to resolve here is whether the Equal Protection Clause requires every State to change its current practice and use voter population to reapportion."
2015.14-940,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1607.94,1611.76,"Well, why don't they use that under Section 2, then?"
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1611.76,1615.655,In Section 2 of --
2015.14-940,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1615.655,1616.56,The Voting Rights.
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1616.56,1617.23,The Voting Rights Act?
2015.14-940,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1617.23,1617.8,Yes.
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1617.8,1628.655,"Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act for tax voters -- and our position, unlike the United States's position, is that only voters are protected under the Voting Rights Act."
2015.14-940,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1639.34,1642.58,"Well, it is -- it is called the one-person, one-vote."
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1645.84,1651.87,"It does protect voters, but there are multiple legitimate bases here on which a State can redistrict."
2015.14-940,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1729.215,1731.83,There are at least two arguments that could support your position.
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1773.255,1782.84,"I don't believe we're making either of those arguments, Justice Alito. Total population is not permissible because it tracks voter population."
2015.14-940,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1802.11,1805.92,It seems to me that the two interests are not always consistent.
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1843.105,1848.905,I believe what this Court said in Burns is you allow the States to choose the theory of representation.
2015.14-940,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1873.525,1889.31,"Well, if the voter population is a permissible basis under the Constitution, I assume that's because there is -- is an ethical, a good government, a liberty interest in protecting these voters."
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1891.425,1892.25,Correct.
2015.14-940,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1892.25,1921.885,"Well, if in a case like this where there is a 45 percent deviation, something of that order, then why isn't Texas required at that point to recognize that these interests that are legitimate under the Constitution, which are voter based, should not be accommodated, and so that you should at least give some consideration to this disparity that you have among voters?"
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,1921.885,1933.8,"Well, first off, the court in Gaffney upheld the use of total population while recognizing that there could -- there was, in New York at least, a different State, a 29 percent deviation in voter population."
2015.14-940,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1974.295,1992.475,"What we have -- and that's why I think Justice Alito's question is important -- is a table on page 9 of the Blue Brief. Now, just looking at that table, by inspection, I don't know whether the true -- whether this is true or false."
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2050.77,2051.09,Sure.
2015.14-940,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2083.23,2096.63,"That sounds an awful lot what they had in 1750 or something, where the British Parliament said, well, don't worry, America, you're represented by the people in England because after all, they represent everybody in the British Empire."
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2096.63,2097.38,Which is --
2015.14-940,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2097.38,2104.325,"I mean, that people are being represented through somebody else is a little -- possible, but tough."
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2104.325,2110.93,"Well, for instance, a child in my congressional district would still be represented by that member of Congress."
2015.14-940,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2126.635,2149.475,"But why is one option exclusive of the other? Why can't you have both? You have population equality and voter quality, both, especially when you have indicated that a voter-based apportionment is -- is valid and serves important purposes."
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2155.41,2171.85,"Well, first of all, there's been no demonstrative plan that was submitted to the Texas legislature, which has a notice-and-comment procedure on this, or to the district court, that both of these could have been equalized within 10 percent. Indeed, their demographer didn't specify the extent of the deviations."
2015.14-940,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2202.46,2206.975,"That sounds highly probable to me. Has anything been written on this, or any studies on this --"
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2206.975,2208.0,I -- I -- I don't --
2015.14-940,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2208.0,2209.315,-- in -- in the context of Texas.
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2209.315,2212.74,I -- I -- I don't believe so. We're not aware of any.
2015.14-940,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2225.9,2234.85,"Do you have any idea how often this is a problem? I mean, it is a case that, of course, around the country, people use total population."
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2242.765,2251.755,"I believe New York's amicus brief suggests that in places such as California, Alaska, possibly New York, certainly New York City, the issue will absolutely come up."
2015.14-940,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2252.45,2255.915,But only in -- only in those particular handful of --
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2255.915,2257.16,A few more examples --
2015.14-940,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2257.16,2257.915,And I'm not suggesting --
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2257.915,2261.85,"-- Delaware, Maryland. By no means would this necessarily be a problem anywhere."
2015.14-940,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2269.71,2286.125,"Well, what if it were you had the same minor or de minimis deviation allowed there? In other words, if you're within -- the deviation between total population and voter population was within -- under 10 percent, does that take care of many of the areas where it's a problem?"
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2286.125,2294.43,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, for the reasons I just suggested to Justice Kennedy, I believe that would be quite an onerous burden and change the nature of redistricting."
2015.14-940,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2329.214,2338.245,Could you explain why the ACS -- your adversary says ACS is fine; it's used in Section 2 and Section 5.
2015.14-940,1,56070,scott_a_keller,,2351.305,2365.66,"Well, our position is that if the ACS data is reliable enough to hold the State liable under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, it would also be reliable enough to use in apportionment. Now there could be issues about the granularity of the data."
2015.14-940,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2465.43,2481.685,"Thank you, General. Mr. Gershengorn."
2015.14-940,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2481.685,2493.895,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Redistricting on the basis of total population, as Texas did here, vindicates the principle of equal representation for equal numbers of people that is at the heart of Reynolds and Wesberry."
2015.14-940,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2625.53,2627.995,That's often used for Section 2.
2015.14-940,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2627.995,2631.37,"Your Honor, it's used for a very different purpose with respect to Section 2."
2015.14-940,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2656.9,2664.63,"Well, can I ask you this? Who has standing to bring a Reynolds v. Sims claim? Is it anybody who is counted in the census?"
2015.14-940,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2664.63,2669.62,"So Your Honor, that's a question this Court noted and reserved in Baker v. Carr in footnote 23."
2015.14-940,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2687.82,2688.6,Are you going to tell me who has --
2015.14-940,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2688.6,2689.16,-- we've heard this morning.
2015.14-940,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2689.16,2690.8,Are you going to tell me who has standing or not?
2015.14-940,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2690.8,2691.48,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-940,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2717.47,2720.31,That includes everybody who is counted in the census.
2015.14-940,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2720.31,2721.09,"Yes, Your Honor."
2015.14-940,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2721.09,2721.48,It includes --
2015.14-940,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2721.48,2722.205,But let me say --

2015.14-940,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2725.145,2725.62,And let me --
2015.14-940,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2725.62,2727.33,It includes undocumented aliens.
2015.14-940,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2727.33,2729.16,But let me explain why I don't think it's necessary.
2015.14-940,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2729.16,2731.32,But does it include all those groups?
2015.14-940,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2731.32,2732.305,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2015.14-940,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2732.305,2735.46,Does it include members of all of those groups?
2015.14-940,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2735.46,2739.95,"So we think it might, but we don't think that you have to agree with that to rule in our way."
2015.14-940,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2853.82,2856.54,-- as to whether it would have a large practical effect.
2015.14-940,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2987.2,2989.67,Isn't your argument that voters are -- are irrelevant?
2015.14-940,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,2989.67,2992.36,"So Your Honor, I don't think our argument is that voters are irrelevant."
2015.14-940,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3020.65,3025.13,"What would you say about the extreme case -- I mean, your time is going to going to expire -- an extreme case."
2015.14-940,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3057.365,3073.29,"So Your Honor, two points in response. First, this Court has recognized -- and we don't dispute -- that census data isn't the sole data. A State can -- and this Court approved it in Mahan -- make adjustments to census data to more accurately capture actual residents in the State."

2015.14-940,3,62606,william_s_consovoy,,3128.665,3129.61,In each --
2015.14-940,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3129.61,3133.45,"Now I don't know who they are from the briefs; and therefore, it's pretty tough for me to -- to tell."
2015.14-940,3,62606,william_s_consovoy,,3133.45,3139.29,"The data shows that it's a mix of noncitizens, children, all the categories; disenfranchised felons."
2015.14-940,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3144.4,3145.52,Illegal immigrants.
2015.14-940,3,62606,william_s_consovoy,,3145.52,3146.225,Some.
2015.14-940,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3161.79,3164.22,That's not quite accurate.
2015.14-940,3,62606,william_s_consovoy,,3184.265,3188.565,I'm not suggesting -- we're not suggesting we should choose for the State who they allow to vote.
