1996.84_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.817,"We'll hear argument next in Number 84 Original, United States v. Alaska."
1996.84_orig,0,25560,g_thomas_koester,,15.541,17.942,"Yes, you are, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1996.84_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,17.942,33.382,You may proceed.
1996.84_orig,0,25560,g_thomas_koester,,33.382,36.845,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.84_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.899,178.398,"Now, the 10-mile rule, you're referring to the horizontal sort of connections between islands, and the 10 miles in between the ends of the two islands that are off-shore?"
1996.84_orig,0,25560,g_thomas_koester,,178.398,178.999,That's correct.
1996.84_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.999,180.909,You're not talking about some vertical rule.
1996.84_orig,0,25560,g_thomas_koester,,183.269,185.102,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1996.84_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.919,206.307,And this Court dealt with that in one sense at least in that Mississippi Sound case?
1996.84_orig,0,25560,g_thomas_koester,,206.307,207.346,"--That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1996.84_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,209.827,223.929,"And was that case one that was based on historic treatment, kind of an exception to all other rules, kind of an historic bay argument?"
1996.84_orig,0,25560,g_thomas_koester,,223.929,231.222,--The ultimate decision in that case was that Mississippi Sound constituted historic waters.
1996.84_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,231.222,236.865,"And there's no historic water claim here, is there?"
1996.84_orig,0,25560,g_thomas_koester,,240.579,242.098,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1996.84_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,249.795,252.517,And that is not Alaska's argument here?
1996.84_orig,0,25560,g_thomas_koester,,252.517,253.147,--That is correct.
1996.84_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.156,260.591,So to that extent that Mississippi Sound case doesn't help us all that much.
1996.84_orig,0,25560,g_thomas_koester,,260.591,282.806,"--It does in this respect, Justice O'Connor, and that is that in the Mississippi Sound case the Court found as a fact... not as necessarily a legal principle, but as a fact that the United States' policy from 1901 to 19... from 1903 until 1961 was to employ this 10-mile rule to delimit its inland waters."
1996.84_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.806,284.336,But an irrelevant fact.
1996.84_orig,0,25560,g_thomas_koester,,286.309,287.809,Not in our submission.
1996.84_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,289.429,294.724,"If it was decided on the basis of historic bay, then that fact didn't make any difference."
1996.84_orig,0,25560,g_thomas_koester,,294.724,298.396,It certainly supported the Court's decision in that case.
1996.84_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,348.417,360.937,"Okay, but we are dealing here I guess with the effects of the Submerged Lands Act as to what Alaska got at statehood."
1996.84_orig,0,25560,g_thomas_koester,,375.806,378.377,"Where there are no inland waters, that is correct."
1996.84_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2480.641,2491.487,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.84_orig,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2536.836,2546.133,"Well, there is language to that effect in that Mississippi Sound case, certainly, what was the policy, and the policy, we said, was uniformly to apply."
1996.84_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2546.133,2553.427,"--Yes, there was that statement in the Alabama and Mississippi Sound case, and I think that is simply that."
1996.84_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2559.211,2562.273,"You think it doesn't control this issue for what reason, Mr. Minear?"
1996.84_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2562.273,2565.775,"--First of all, because it was not essential to the decision in that case."
1996.84_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2604.842,2611.955,Do you think the statement was not at all of any relevance to the Court's analysis in the view of the Court?
1996.84_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2611.955,2616.779,--I think that the Court would have reached the same decision--
1996.84_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2616.779,2623.723,"Yes, I think you're right, but do you think nonetheless that the Court thought that was a factor, albeit a minor one?"
1996.84_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2623.723,2624.213,--Yes.
1996.84_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.177,2632.59,And you're saying it was wrong about that?
1996.84_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2632.59,2640.415,"I think it was wrong, and I think that the Alabama and Mississippi boundary case is actually in tension with California, too, which we think is the important case in this area."
1996.84_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2642.276,2645.678,"The Alabama case came after the California case, didn't it?"
1996.84_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2645.678,2673.207,"--That's right, but in the California case, in California II, the Court adopted the convention as the... as providing the exclusive methodology for determining the limits of inland waters, and part of its reason for adopting that methodology was its conclusion that there was no formal basis for determining baselines, that there... in fact the Court had... the Court in 1965 examined the same materials that Alaska asks you to examine here, and concluded that none of it amounted to a formal policy."
1996.84_orig,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2673.207,2676.777,Let's assume there had been a formal policy prior to that time.
1996.84_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2694.989,2695.82,Yes.
1996.84_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2707.788,2716.304,"But I presume the United States could change its mind as to whether it wants to use that discretionary option or not, right?"
1996.84_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2716.304,2717.496,"Yes, the United States could."
1996.84_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2717.496,2718.084,"Well, what happens?"
1996.84_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2725.551,2726.492,"No, Your Honor."
1996.84_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2744.383,2745.953,I really don't understand this.
1996.84_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2748.074,2760.583,"--I think that the appropriate way to look at this, the question that the... the way the Court approached this problem in California II is that it said that when we encounter these issues we will apply the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone."
1996.84_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2773.002,2774.811,But I thought... I'm sorry.
1996.84_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2778.344,2790.663,"If the United States adopts it in the future, I think the problem we would encounter is that the determination of inland waters should be based on the time that the State became... the State was admitted to the Union, so I think--"
1996.84_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2790.663,2792.624,"Well, of course, the convention didn't even exist then, isn't that right?"
1996.84_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2792.624,2795.536,"--That's right, the convention didn't... the Court has--"
1996.84_orig,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,5152.066,5157.892,"Thank you, Chief Justice."
1996.84_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,5157.892,5163.226,"Mr. Koester, can you address the question of Alaska's position with respect to the uplands and the wildlife--"
1996.84_orig,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,5163.226,5163.576,Certainly.
1996.84_orig,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,5179.004,5182.877,"--Well, Alaska changed its position on the petroleum reserve."
1996.84_orig,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,5190.712,5199.0,"There is now a fully effectuated Federal withdrawal and reservation in place, and that's the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and it's not open to sale or entry or other kind of disposal."
1996.84_orig,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5199.0,5202.96,"Yes, but was it at the time of statehood?"
1996.84_orig,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,5210.267,5217.419,"The regulations provided that the lands be withdrawn from the operation of disposal statutes, and we have no quarrel with that."
1996.84_orig,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,5220.761,5226.115,"--Can you represent that it is the position of Alaska that it will not, in fact, contest that?"
1996.84_orig,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,5226.115,5231.868,--I can represent that I will urge Alaska not to because I don't believe the law would permit it.
1996.84_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,5234.59,5238.003,"Well then, that withdrawal under 6(e) was sufficient for the uplands."
1996.84_orig,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,5238.003,5247.69,The withdrawal was sufficient for the uplands in that they were withdrawn from private disposal statutes and remain so withdrawn until the refuge was created after statehood.
1996.84_orig,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,5247.69,5254.716,"Well, what is there in the withdrawal process that distinguished between the submerged lands and the uplands, just the Submerged Lands Act?"
1996.84_orig,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,5254.716,5264.58,The distinguishing feature is that section 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act only addresses fully established refuges on the date of statehood.
1996.84_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5297.571,5309.561,"Have you urged... I understand that argument, and I'm very interested in knowing whether you have alternative theories, because I'm just trying to limit what it is I'd have to decide, and your argument I understand."
1996.84_orig,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,5321.688,5326.152,The same two basic arguments that we made with respect to the petroleum reserve apply here.
1996.84_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5335.038,5337.111,No clear intent in what?
1996.84_orig,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,5337.111,5340.143,No clear intent in section 6(e) to defeat--
1996.84_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5340.143,5340.995,In 6(e).
1996.84_orig,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,5340.995,5341.913,--Alaska's title to the submerged lands.
1996.84_orig,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5341.913,5343.676,"All right, so... but I can focus right on 6(e)."
1996.84_orig,2,25560,g_thomas_koester,,5345.396,5350.079,"That's the only provision that the United States argues defeated Alaska's title, and there's nothing there that does."
1996.84_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5391.305,5392.927,"Thank you, Mr. Koester."
