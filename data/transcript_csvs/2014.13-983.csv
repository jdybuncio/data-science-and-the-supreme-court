2014.13-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.587,"We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 13983, Elonis v. United States."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,8.939,12.391,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
2014.13-983,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,27.833,35.737,I'm not sure that the Court did either the law or the English language much of a good service when it said “ true threat ”.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,49.064,49.58,--That's true.
2014.13-983,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,49.58,55.651,"--We can't fault you for citing what the Supreme Court has said, but it's a most unhelpful phrase."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,55.651,62.155,And it also doesn't help that it was announced in a per curiam decision that didn't have the benefit of merits briefing or argument.
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,81.301,83.403,"Well, that was an assault at common law, wasn't it?"
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,90.324,95.295,--I think assault is somewhat different because assault can also be an attempted battery.
2014.13-983,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,105.833,112.154,How does one prove what's in somebody else's mind?
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,141.09,144.208,"I think two ways, generally speaking."
2014.13-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,165.891,179.882,"Yeah, you are going to find a lot of information on the cell phone that the guy is really angry at his ex-wife and -- and, you know, would like to see her suffer."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,195.058,201.647,--I think -- but I think the point is that there is a lot of information that you could find.
2014.13-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,210.753,216.757,How does the fact 2 I thought your whole point was the fact that she is in fear doesn't tell you enough about what the defendant wants.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,216.757,227.195,"--No, but if he -- if you can see that he visited her website at the time that she was saying, I'm afraid of this guy or I'm afraid of what he is saying, you could say -- you could prove up that he knew at the time, that he was aware--"
2014.13-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,227.195,234.868,"Based on your submission, all he has to do is say either, as I understood your brief, it's therapeutic, it's a good thing I could do this, or it's art."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,234.868,239.939,"--If he is on notice that she's in fear, that is all we're asking for."
2014.13-983,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,248.895,249.478,Could I--
2014.13-983,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,249.478,252.513,Can you tell me -- I'm sorry.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,275.292,275.859,That is correct.
2014.13-983,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,275.859,290.719,"So if that's the case, isn't the jury acting like a reasonable person in looking at the words and the circumstances and saying, did he intend this or didn't he?"
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,301.177,308.331,"As the government put it in this case in the closing argument, under the instruction that was given it doesn't meter what the defendant thinks."
2014.13-983,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,315.353,319.805,"But -- I mean, how is that different from what you intend?"
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,329.763,331.829,--But that is -- it's a negligence standard.
2014.13-983,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,339.302,351.26,"--Mr. Elwood, sort of along the same lines, and getting back to what the Chief Justice asked you, because I was a little bit surprised by your answer: I'm trying to figure out what exactly the level of intent you want is."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,379.526,379.926,--The second.
2014.13-983,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,379.926,380.543,The second.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,380.543,386.78,"That if you know that you are placing someone in fear by what you are doing, that is enough to satisfy our version of--"
2014.13-983,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,386.78,391.415,How about you just take it a step down more but not get to the government's.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,403.389,406.775,--I think that we would say that recklessness is not enough.
2014.13-983,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,432.239,434.406,"Well, what would be wrong with a recklessness standard?"
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,453.418,467.675,"I think many of the speakers who are online and many of the people who are being prosecuted now are teenagers who are essentially shooting off their mouths or making sort of ill-timed, sarcastic comments which wind up getting them thrown in jail."
2014.13-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,509.418,514.139,"It's not just a reasonable person, at least as I understand the government's submission."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,533.051,539.037,"--That is true, but the thing is everyone has a different view of what context matters."
2014.13-983,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,573.108,579.996,"And on the briefs, I thought on the basis of the briefs that there are two separate questions."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,599.575,600.125,Well--
2014.13-983,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,600.125,607.429,"A true threat -- you've seen the definitions, the instruction that was given is similar to ones that are well-embodied in the law."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,682.477,692.1,--Because I think the way the way you are explaining it is different than the way I think the government is explaining because you seem to be suggesting that he knows that a reasonable person would be placed in fear.
2014.13-983,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,692.1,693.952,"He has to know that, and I will ask the government."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,702.308,704.576,But my understanding of the government's position is that--
2014.13-983,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,704.576,710.663,"Forgetting their position for the moment, what do you think of the position I just took, which is my question?"
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,710.663,714.798,--The way I understood your position is that if he had to know that a reasonable person--
2014.13-983,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,714.798,715.314,"Yes, he does."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,737.227,738.746,"--Well, the thing is, though--"
2014.13-983,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,738.746,742.381,"I wouldn't have asked it if I didn't want your view, so what is your view?"
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,742.381,743.398,--I'm trying hard to give it to you.
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,759.077,761.493,"Well, you wouldn't go along with that."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,761.493,765.747,"I mean, I would prefer that he has to know -- he has to know--"
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,765.747,777.704,"Well, that would cover the situation in which somebody transmits in interstate commerce a warning that Al-Qaeda going to assassinate a certain person."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,794.764,796.082,"--Well, it--"
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,796.082,798.182,"The -- the threat of Al-Qaeda, right?"
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,798.182,798.534,--It depends.
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.674,812.376,So you're back to what the intention of the sender is.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,816.746,830.337,"--Because I think -- again, we're just talking a threat is only -- you know, the question is whether it's your statement of intent to cause harm versus your warning somebody of somebody else's intent to cause harm."
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.337,830.587,Yes.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,830.887,831.437,But--
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,831.437,832.053,--Exactly.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,844.761,845.18,--That is right.
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,847.28,852.166,"Once you eliminate that, you -- you can accept Justice Breyer's position."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,852.166,856.568,"--But among the many things that is wrong with that is, I mean, I'm not the only one who says this is a negligence standard."
2014.13-983,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,866.424,887.353,But is it your position that a properly instructed jury can convict if it is instructed that the defendant in -- communicated the threat with the intent to cause fear or intimidation to the victim?
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,887.353,889.539,"Yes, that's correct."
2014.13-983,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,890.789,894.426,And would in -- would you accept anything less than that in this case?
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,894.426,899.061,--I think that the closest thing is that he knew that a reasonable person--
2014.13-983,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,899.061,899.661,"I mean, you can say no."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,899.661,900.763,--would be placed in fear--
2014.13-983,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,900.763,904.382,But that's what this -- that's what -- that's the way I read this instruction.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,904.382,906.151,--And that's -- I disagree.
2014.13-983,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,912.738,913.488,But he intentionally makes a statement.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,913.488,924.962,"--He intentionally makes a statement, and it happens -- he intentionally makes a statement, he says these words and, full stop, a reasonable person viewing those words would view it as a threat."
2014.13-983,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,924.962,925.462,All right.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,925.662,926.028,And that's why--
2014.13-983,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,926.028,933.466,--then seems to me that you can't accept anything lesser than the instruction that we first agreed upon is your position -- is your preferred position.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,933.466,943.838,"--Again, it's my understanding that the government is not accepting the idea that if he knew that a reasonable person would be placed in fear, he would be guilty."
2014.13-983,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,959.697,960.564,Of the -- of the government's brief?
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,960.564,961.632,"--Of the government's brief, right."
2014.13-983,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,978.276,992.616,"I thought your answer to Justice Kagan a few minutes ago was that it is not necessary for the defendant to have the purpose of causing fear, but it's sufficient for the -- for the defendant to have knowledge that it will cause fear."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,992.616,993.035,--That's right.
2014.13-983,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,993.035,994.018,Which of the two is it?
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1001.805,1006.109,"This is one of the things that -- the reason why we all hate the pre-Model Penal Code era, but if you look at LaFave."
2014.13-983,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1017.631,1021.951,So you say it's knowledge -- knowledge that will cause fear on the part of whom?
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1027.022,1028.955,--What we're asking for is the particular recipient.
2014.13-983,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1033.176,1039.413,"And could you continue, you were telling me how that would be proved what is in his head."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1049.535,1060.826,"The government would prove it by, you know, proving the circumstances, what he said, you know, how he saw people reacting to it, his own personal statements about things at the time."
2014.13-983,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1060.826,1069.115,"On the facts of this case on remand, could the government proceed on this evidence with your instruction?"
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1072.067,1074.184,I believe there would be enough to go to a jury.
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1078.555,1078.905,"Well, wait."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1144.68,1157.24,"--I -- I may have been distracted, but I thought it was the idea that I mean, he is -- he is causing a series of events that results in his wife being told that he wants to kill her."
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.49,1158.857,"I'm -- not no, no."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1167.696,1168.964,And--
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1168.964,1177.653,"He doesn't -- it's not his purpose to put her in fear, but it certainly puts her in fear."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1180.353,1184.824,"--Because I think maybe the thing that is missing is that it is a warning, that it's not a statement of his."
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1186.876,1188.392,Exactly.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1196.465,1196.798,--Right.
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1196.798,1200.334,--get to where you want to be without -- without putting purpose in there.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1200.334,1211.141,"Well, in any event, it is our position that it is a big step up from a reasonable person standard to at least have it based on his understanding that when I say this, it will put that person in fear."
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.141,1212.841,"It's better -- it's better, but not good enough."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1212.841,1215.559,"But, Justice Ginsburg, if I could return to your comment."
2014.13-983,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1233.405,1234.923,"Well, let me give you a concrete example."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1302.131,1302.983,Yes.
2014.13-983,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1302.983,1304.5,"Yes, that's the answer?"
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1304.5,1304.75,"Yes, exactly."
2014.13-983,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1306.702,1307.719,You think that's what Congress intended.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1307.719,1308.887,Yes.
2014.13-983,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1308.887,1317.141,"Congress wanted to say, this is okay, it's all going to turn on this inquiry into a really strange psychological state."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1317.141,1319.427,"I will say -- I will say that at the time, it was very well known."
2014.13-983,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1341.442,1352.498,"In the example just given, I guess there would be a jury question of whether he knew that a reasonable person would take this communication as a threat."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1376.23,1376.616,That's right.
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.637,1386.287,"Counsel, you--"
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1386.287,1389.922,"They convict people of fraud, you know, hundreds of times--"
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1389.922,1391.905,--You really have me confused at this point.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1414.954,1415.704,--I'm--
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.704,1416.22,--and you know that.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1416.22,1417.454,"--I'm sorry, I have not made my -- oh."
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.239,1419.122,And you know that.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1419.122,1420.941,--They -- the intent we're asking for--
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1420.941,1421.941,That's not an intent to cause fear.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1425.91,1438.217,"--It's our understanding that the two things that Cohen is specific intent under the kind of old, the pre-model penal code standard are purpose and doing something with the knowledge that something is virtually certain to happen."
2014.13-983,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1442.771,1449.858,"Mr. Elwood, when we have looked at fighting words statutes, we've never applied this kind of heightened intent."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1468.422,1470.089,--It's a very different tradition.
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1553.573,1558.542,"And this is valuable First Amendment language that you think has to be protected, right?"
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1558.542,1559.359,I think that there is--

2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1564.03,1574.752,"--I think that the -- when you are doing it as a category, yes, this is valuable language because virtually any language that uses forceful rhetoric could be penalized, like as they say, the blood of tyrants quote, or--"
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1574.752,1577.621,It has to reasonably put somebody in fear.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1579.856,1583.008,"--Exactly, which is a very low standard, that--"
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1583.008,1590.864,"It may be a low standard, but to my mind it doesn't eliminate a whole lot of valuable speech at all."
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1590.864,1592.031,"--Well, for example, another--"
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1592.031,1593.482,It eliminates a lot of valuable speech.
2014.13-983,0,30165,john_p_elwood,,1593.482,1610.525,"--another example, and then I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, if someone puts on their Facebook page a picture of a woman walking into a family planning clinic over the phrase “ turn or burn ”, you know, maybe that is a statement of, you know, Christian doctrine and she's saying she's going to be going to hell, maybe that is a risk of a firebombing."
2014.13-983,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1613.294,1614.229,"That would be for the jury, I assume."
2014.13-983,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1614.229,1616.246,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1617.764,1621.133,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-983,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1662.876,1665.01,And the minimum penalty is what?
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1666.495,1667.512,That's correct.
2014.13-983,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1673.432,1674.518,But it is a felony.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1674.518,1692.229,"--Yes, it is a felony and I think that Congress was quite clear that when it enacted this it did not prescribe any additional specific intent or purpose to frighten or to threaten that Petitioner, up until standing at the podium today, appeared to argue for."
2014.13-983,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1719.212,1720.046,But that's -- can you go back?
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1781.25,1782.2,--So I--
2014.13-983,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1782.2,1783.65,You just saw people being sworn in.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1825.379,1834.552,--The individual can know the meaning of the words without necessarily drawing the same conclusion that the recipient of the communication or a reasonable person would.
2014.13-983,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1835.335,1837.171,Are you quarreling with Justice Breyer?
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1838.254,1838.587,--Yes.
2014.13-983,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1838.587,1840.805,Why are you -- why are you quarreling?
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1840.805,1841.622,This is the whole--
2014.13-983,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1841.622,1850.042,It's not enough for you for us to say a true threat is when you intend to put another person--
2014.13-983,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1850.042,1852.161,In fear.
2014.13-983,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1852.161,1852.478,--in fear--
2014.13-983,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1852.478,1853.211,A reasonable person.
2014.13-983,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1853.211,1860.381,--or you know that your words will cause a reasonable person to feel fear.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1862.75,1862.983,--That's right.
2014.13-983,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1862.983,1864.733,You want something broader.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1864.733,1873.874,What we want is a standard that holds accountable people for the ordinary and natural meaning of the words that they say in context--
2014.13-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1873.874,1875.324,"Well, but in context is right."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1886.098,1887.965,--If there is such a thing.
2014.13-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1914.782,1918.819,"So it's -- but there again, we're talking about what subculture you're looking at."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1932.577,1945.804,"--The speaker chooses their audience, and the speaker can communicate in a completely private manner on a Facebook page, the speaker can make certain aspects of the communication private, or the speaker can open it up more widely."
2014.13-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1956.528,1959.98,"Well, I know, but you are asking for a standard that presumably would apply across the board."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1974.656,1977.458,--It will depend on to whom he is communicating the statement.
2014.13-983,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1996.069,2009.161,"But that doesn't seem to me answers Justice Scalia's hypothetical of the friend who calls to report the threat or another hypothetical, when one student says,"
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2019.435,2022.487,"No, that's not our view and I think it's important to clarify--"
2014.13-983,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2022.487,2034.712,"But what is the -- what is the suggested instruction you would have in order to eliminate liability in my hypothetical or Justice Scalia's hypothetical, it was the same thing with the friend?"
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2034.712,2040.965,--The statement has to express a serious intention of the speaker to inflict bodily harm on somebody.
2014.13-983,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2040.965,2045.419,"Oh, well, that was not in the instruction that was given in this case."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2045.419,2049.371,Not literally and it wasn't requested and I think that it is implicit in it.
2014.13-983,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2049.371,2050.99,"Well, I mean, if you are saying it's waived, that's something else."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2057.16,2067.35,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I think that it does if you read it in entire context, that it was understood as being a reference to the speaker's intent to carry out the threats."
2014.13-983,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2068.316,2075.539,But it seems to me that if that's the case you should have no problem at all in accepting Mr. Elwood's suggested instruction of specific intent.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2075.539,2076.922,"--No, because--"
2014.13-983,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2076.922,2078.99,"We all have specific intent, as you well know, all the time."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2078.99,2085.144,"--Let me give you a couple examples of what Mr. Elwood's position, as I understand it, would cut out."
2014.13-983,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2097.035,2107.327,"Well, how would using that exact standard -- and it's pretty similar to the standard that Justice Breyer had because the way Justice Breyer had it, it's knowledge that a reasonable person would cause fear."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2137.829,2159.442,"--Well, the first thing that's wrong with it is that it basically immunizes somebody who makes that statement and then can plausibly say later, hey, I was dead drunk, I realized that I just called in a bomb threat and the police had to respond and an elementary school had to be evacuated and I knew what I was saying but I was too drunk, it really didn't--"
2014.13-983,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2159.442,2163.246,"Well, drunkenness is often not a defense in a specific intent case."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2163.246,2166.698,"--No, drunkenness is a defense in a specific intent case, it--"
2014.13-983,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2166.698,2167.448,With knowledge.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2224.485,2224.785,--No.
2014.13-983,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2243.847,2247.214,"I agree with you, no specific intent."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2264.174,2264.39,--You just have to know what you're doing.
2014.13-983,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2268.126,2268.478,All right.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2273.113,2279.35,--And petitioner is not disputing in this case that he knew the words that he was saying.
2014.13-983,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2319.744,2324.647,"So the drunken person who says I don't know what I was saying, is he or she guilty?"
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2324.647,2326.414,--Yes.
2014.13-983,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2355.184,2359.219,I'm still not sure how you answered Justice Scalia's hypothetical and mine--
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2359.219,2362.338,Let me try one more time.
2014.13-983,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2362.338,2364.456,--The threat is just repeated--
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2364.456,2365.022,That's right.
2014.13-983,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2366.324,2366.591,--with no bad purpose.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2366.591,2370.443,--Let's say a newspaper prints it on the front page.
2014.13-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2402.831,2419.959,"If you have -- if you have a statement made in the style of rap music as this one or several of these were, is the reasonable person supposed to be someone familiar with that style and the use of what might be viewed as threatening words in connection with that music or is -- or not?"
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2419.959,2424.844,"So, Mr. Chief Justice, it depends on whom the speaker is speaking to."
2014.13-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2427.53,2429.232,To a general audience.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2429.232,2441.706,"--to a general audience, then I think that the individual has to understand that not everybody will have the same private meanings that that person attaches to rap music and will bring to the table--"
2014.13-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2441.706,2446.693,So that does subject to prosecution the lyrics that a lot of rap artists use.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2446.693,2455.215,"--No, not at all, Mr. Chief Justice, because in the context of those statements, it's pretty clear that the purpose of the communication is entertainment."
2014.13-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2463.305,2466.021,So how do you start out if you want to be a rap artist?
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2470.725,2475.446,--I think that you have perfect freedom to engage in rap artistry.
2014.13-983,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2514.238,2519.558,"You've just made a wonderful closing statement, but -- a summation."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2529.597,2541.988,"--So I think, Justice Sotomayor, the clearest problem would be if the Court goes with the position that petitioner advocated in this case, which is that there must be a purpose to frighten."
2014.13-983,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2551.863,2553.679,But I think Mr. Elwood disavowed that.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2558.017,2568.655,"--Justice Ginsburg, he did disavow it but the time to propose a jury instruction is in the District Court, not from the podium as the petitioner is arguing the case in the Supreme Court."
2014.13-983,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2584.684,2595.473,"My understanding of the Model Penal Code levels of mens rea is that there is a distinction, but a razor-thin distinction, between purpose and knowledge."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2616.805,2619.405,I think you basically understand it correctly.
2014.13-983,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2651.375,2653.327,Exactly.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2687.179,2687.546,--The former.
2014.13-983,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2687.546,2687.912,--Hmm?
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2687.912,2688.464,The former.
2014.13-983,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2688.464,2689.114,I know.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2689.898,2690.348,Right.
2014.13-983,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2690.348,2692.5,"--and the real issue is, is it the former or the latter?"
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2692.5,2692.733,Correct.
2014.13-983,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2692.733,2712.397,"And the -- if it's totally open in the history and so forth, I think, you know, people do say things in domestic disputes that they are awfully sorry about later, and -- and where the person didn't know that he was saying something that a reasonable person would take as a threat--"
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2712.397,2715.181,I think it--
2014.13-983,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2715.181,2721.335,--I'm -- I'm hesitating to say that Congress wanted or it makes sense to -- he is lacking something there.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2724.721,2738.547,"--Well, so the jury instruction in this case said right before the passage that we've all been focused on, which is on page 301 of the Joint Appendix among many other places, is that after giving the definition of a true threat, Justice Breyer, the court said,"
2014.13-983,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2753.823,2773.118,"Counsel, lest we define deviancy down, I don't -- I don't agree with the proposition that in -- in -- well, intramarital disputes people make physical threats to the person of the other."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2776.237,2776.922,"Well, I think that--"
2014.13-983,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.922,2779.072,Even -- even in the heat of -- of anger.
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2779.072,2783.676,--And it often will trigger just what happened here.
2014.13-983,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2815.131,2833.426,"Mr. Dreeben, you are asking us to go down -- you know, it's not purpose, it's not knowledge of causing fear, it's not a conscious disregard of causing fear, it's just that you should have known that you were going to cause fear, essentially."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2867.229,2868.845,"--I don't think so, Justice Kagan."
2014.13-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2914.293,2920.464,What about the language at pages 54 to 55 of the Petitioner's brief?
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2943.06,2943.476,No.
2014.13-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2945.91,2948.145,Because Eminem said it instead of somebody else?
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2948.145,2952.166,--Because Eminem said it at a concert where people are going to be entertained.
2014.13-983,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2993.157,2996.861,"Well, yes, but you're dealing with some very inflammatory language."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3003.449,3005.15,"Well, there are two protections there."
2014.13-983,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3030.949,3035.917,"And the third point is that if the first two are correct, this language is not worth a whole lot any way, right?"
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3035.917,3038.119,"--That is correct as well, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-983,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3104.061,3115.285,"In this statute there is subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d); (a), (b) and (d) all have specific intent."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3117.035,3117.535,Yes.
2014.13-983,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3117.535,3129.277,"Is it proper for us then to say that it's likely that section (c) also should be a specific -- it's very odd to say that (a), (b) and (d) are specific intents but this one isn't."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3129.277,3138.984,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I think that it actually cuts the other way because Congress, in the other sections of this statute, focused on an intent to extort."
2014.13-983,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3232.592,3247.185,"But, Mr. Dreeben, couldn't you say that about a lot of criminal law, that the harm is the conduct, irrespective of what was in the person's head, and yet we insist on looking very often at what was in the person's head?"
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3247.185,3247.635,--Yes.
2014.13-983,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3312.724,3315.01,"Well, let's go to that question."
2014.13-983,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3324.699,3326.466,"--I don't -- I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor."
