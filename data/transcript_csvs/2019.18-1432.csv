2019.18-1432,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.0,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-1432, Nasrallah versus Barr. Mr. Hughes."
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,8.0,29.48,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Congress enacted the jurisdiction-stripping provision in (2)(C), it expressly defined the key term ""order of removal."" It is an order that finds an individual deportable or orders deportation. A CAT order does neither, and the government does not disagree."
2019.18-1432,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,143.52,143.88,Do you agree --
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,143.88,144.44,That's both --
2019.18-1432,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,144.44,163.6,"-- do you agree that, assuming that review of the -- of BIA fact-finding, assuming that it's available, wouldn't that review be highly deferential to the BIA?"
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,163.6,169.6,"Yes, Your Honor, it would be for the substantial evidence review that would govern in circumstances when (2)(C) does not apply."
2019.18-1432,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,184.48,190.6,Do you agree that your CAT claim is covered by the so-called zipper clause?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,190.6,195.68,"So I think there is an open question, Your Honor, if the zipper clause extends here."
2019.18-1432,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,232.08,271.36,"Well, what about the language of the zipper clause and a comparison of the language of the zipper clause with the language of the criminal alien bar? The zipper clause says that ""all questions of law and fact arising from an action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter shall be available"" -- and this is what may be important -- ""only in judicial review of a final order under this section."" So, if your CAT claim is covered by the zipper clause, that claim can be reviewed only in judicial review of a final order under this section."
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,289.12,290.84,"So two things about that, Your Honor."
2019.18-1432,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,335.0,345.12,"Well, and all this is very complicated, but I still -- I -- I don't know that that answers the question about what the pretty clear meaning of the statutory language is."
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,384.68,385.96,So I think that's --
2019.18-1432,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,385.96,392.8,"And so, therefore, your CAT claim is reviewable only in review of a final order of removal."
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,392.8,413.44,"So the title, again, is Consolidation of Questions for Judicial Review, and I agree with Your Honor that when the CAT claim occurs in situations -- circumstances where there is a final order of removal, if (b)(9) applies, it has the operation -- it's the same effect as (a)(4) in FARRA, to say those two things occur together. What happens is you get review of the final order of removal to the extent that review is allowed."
2019.18-1432,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,435.64,442.76,And -- and nothing else? Not -- not all of the preliminary decisions -- all the earlier decisions that lead to the final order of removal?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,442.76,453.76,"I think the merger principle this Court identified in Chadha is the correct one, which is to say anything on which the final order of removal is contingent would appropriately merge into that and be governed by 2(C)."
2019.18-1432,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,510.04,510.2,It --
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,510.2,511.56,-- that the government says is --
2019.18-1432,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,511.56,514.8,"Well, let me approach it one -- one other -- one other way."
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,526.08,527.32,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1432,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,527.32,533.0,And what is the -- what is the nature of the petition that you can file under 1252?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,533.0,533.92,There are two independent ways.
2019.18-1432,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,567.96,576.92,Now isn't it the case that the only kind of petition that you can file under 1252 is denominated a petition for review of a final order of removal?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,576.92,581.32,"I think (a)(4), Your Honor, provides a separate basis for someone to file a petition."
2019.18-1432,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,603.6,607.76,"A petition for review under 1252, it has to be under 1252?"
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,607.76,608.56,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1432,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,608.56,620.36,"And you agree, I take it, that all of the requirements for a petition, including a CAT petition, that are set out in subsection (b) apply? All of those requirements apply?"
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,620.36,623.0,"And, Your Honor, I'll say 2(C) applies."
2019.18-1432,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,625.92,626.72,All right.
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,636.08,671.68,"What happened, Your Honor, this -- I -- I -- I -- I appreciate this is a bit of a Franken-statute here, but Congress enacted (a)(4) after all of the requirements in (b) had already been enacted by AEDPA and ARARA. So what Congress did in (a)(4), which came later in time, by -- by referencing the section, I think it's fairly read to say we are putting (a)(4) in later and we're incorporating saying you can't get around the venue provisions or timeliness provisions or standard of review provisions by incorporating all of the requirements of this section. And, again, my point that I said a moment ago, I don't resist that we could say 2(C) generally could be thought to apply."
2019.18-1432,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,687.04,695.92,Doesn't the CAT order at least temporarily invalidate the order of removal as to a particular country?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,695.92,697.08,"No, Your Honor."
2019.18-1432,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,697.08,698.4,At least in common parlance?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,698.4,706.24,"I -- I -- I don't think it does because it remains effective and, if the CAT order is removed, the individual can still be sent to that country."
2019.18-1432,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,746.44,747.44,And can't --
2019.18-1432,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,747.44,748.96,What -- what -- sorry.
2019.18-1432,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,748.96,750.2,Go ahead.
2019.18-1432,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,750.2,754.64,What -- what -- two things here seem to be difficult for you.
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,831.52,833.48,"Well, so two answers to that, Your Honor."
2019.18-1432,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,974.24,978.56,You agree there's no review in the cancellation of removal context?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,978.56,979.16,The -- the --
2019.18-1432,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,979.16,980.6,Cancellation of removal.
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,980.6,985.72,"That's under the 1229(b). That -- so that is a 2(C) argument, yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1432,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1000.2,1002.0,And the denial of cancellation of removal?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1002.0,1002.76,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1432,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1004.16,1006.96,The factual -- the factual components of that?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1006.96,1008.76,That is part of the final order of removal.
2019.18-1432,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1025.08,1031.48,"How about statutory withholding, which is much more comparable to the withholding at issue here?"
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1031.48,1038.16,I do think statutory withholding is the one thing in addition to CAT claims that probably our rule sweeps within. The language is less clear there.
2019.18-1432,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1045.84,1048.52,So what work does (a)(4) and (a)(5) do for you?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1048.52,1062.4,"So (a)(4) and (a)(5) is decisive textual evidence in our view that Congress understood for purposes of Section 1252, that a cause or claim under CAT that's addressed in (a)(4) is simply not a final order of removal."
2019.18-1432,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1089.12,1093.04,So why does it encompass statutory withholding?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1093.04,1093.64,Why does --
2019.18-1432,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1093.64,1097.88,Why does it necessarily encompass statutory withholding?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1097.88,1103.0,"I -- I -- I'm not sure either of those arguments by their plain text encompass statutory withholding, Your Honor."
2019.18-1432,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1114.2,1118.88,"Well, I agree with you that everything comes up -- under your interpretation, everything comes up to the Court."
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1135.08,1146.84,"That's right, Your Honor. Our -- our ultimate position is a straightforward one of, if the claim in the petition for review challenges the validity of the final order of removal, if it is -- and that is most things that are in a Section 1252 --"
2019.18-1432,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1146.84,1149.0,"Like cancellation of removal, things like that affect that Act?"
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1149.0,1149.48,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1432,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1157.0,1157.32,All right.
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1157.56,1158.48,-- statutory withholding.
2019.18-1432,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1158.48,1175.84,-- the -- in one of the briefs -- I can't remember if it was yours or someone else's -- there was a whole list of situations in which CAT claims would be reviewed independent of the petition for renewal -- independent of the decision on the removal.
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1175.84,1177.64,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-1432,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1177.64,1189.72,How would there be jurisdiction? I understood from your briefs that you think (a)(4) provides independent jurisdiction or (c)(4) provides independent jurisdiction.
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1193.04,1193.32,So I --
2019.18-1432,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1193.32,1197.76,-- in those similar situations where it doesn't come up with the order of removal?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1197.76,1206.4,I -- I think statutory withholding is more similar -- is less likely to come up in an independent circumstance than CAT. So I'm not sure that those are going to arise as frequently --
2019.18-1432,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1206.4,1206.76,Why?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1206.76,1207.16,-- as --
2019.18-1432,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1207.16,1208.4,That's what I don't understand.
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1208.4,1214.52,"Well, I think the CAT, as being a final backstop, is the -- the sort of claim that is often seen more independently."
2019.18-1432,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1258.16,1258.48,What do you --
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1258.48,1260.32,-- of the statutory withholding.
2019.18-1432,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1260.32,1288.36,"Can I just ask you before your time expires -- and I -- I'd like the government to answer this too -- what you have to say about -- putting aside the question of waiver, about the Eleventh Circuit's holding that the criminal alien bar applies at all in this case, since the ground for removal in this case is 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), right, not --"
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1288.36,1288.68,Yes.
2019.18-1432,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1288.68,1296.68,"-- (a)(ii)? So if -- if they're wrong on that, there's really no reason for us to get to this other issue."
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1314.64,1314.96,Yeah.
2019.18-1432,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1314.96,1316.92,-- basis for the criminal alien bar?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1316.92,1326.16,"So, to the first part, what we do with that, two quick answers is, one, there's certainly no basis to -- to DIG or not -- this case or not resolve the question presented."
2019.18-1432,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1412.92,1417.68,Can you address the government's reliance on Foti and why that decision doesn't carry forward?
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1417.68,1419.04,"A few things about Foti, Your Honor."
2019.18-1432,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1422.88,1424.08,The language in Foti.
2019.18-1432,0,56059,paul_w_hughes,,1424.08,1442.48,"So -- so the only issue in the language of Foti where it does sweep more broadly, Congress defined the key term, ""order of deportation,"" after Foti, and it defined it in a way that's completely consistent with Foti's holding but is not consistent with Foti's broader language that absolutely anything that occurs in a removal proceeding falls within the order of deportation."
2019.18-1432,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1504.64,1511.48,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Guarnieri."
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1511.48,1541.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Section 1252(a)(2)(C), the term ""final order of removal"" encompasses the various administrative decisions that are made in the course of removal proceedings, including the denial of an alien's claims for relief or protection from removal. That has been the established understanding of the judicial review provisions of the INA since this Court's 1963 decision in Foti against INS."
2019.18-1432,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1667.64,1668.0,Counsel --
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1668.0,1669.52,-- entered at the conclusion of the proceedings.
2019.18-1432,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1669.52,1672.36,-- two questions. Take them in whatever order you want or ignore them both.
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1717.16,1731.08,"Well, Justice Gorsuch, if I may take your second question first, we think the language of FARRA is -- quite specifically identifies how Congress understood CAT claims to be reviewable in this context. The relevant language is reproduced at page 18a of the government's brief."
2019.18-1432,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1744.24,1745.44,"I understand, exactly."
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1751.72,1753.44,"Well, no, I agree with that, but the -- the --"
2019.18-1432,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1753.44,1753.72,Okay.
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1757.88,1790.72,"Section 1252 prescribes a mechanism whereby aliens can seek judicial review of what occurred in the removal proceedings by petitioning for review of the final order that is entered at the end of those proceedings. Since this Court's decision in Foti, the -- the uniform understanding of how judicial review works in this context is that, when the alien petitions for review of that final order which concludes the administrative proceedings, then the various other decisions that were made in the course of the removal proceedings are also reviewable as part of the final order of removal."
2019.18-1432,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1792.48,1792.76,But you agree --
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1792.76,1792.88,-- as an integral part.
2019.18-1432,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1792.88,1793.8,-- it's not the same thing as --
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1793.8,1795.52,FARRA uses the same language.
2019.18-1432,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1795.52,1799.72,You'd agree that the CAT order is not the same thing as a final order of removal?
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1799.72,1805.24,It -- it -- it can be distinguished from the order by which the immigration judge orders the alien to be removed.
2019.18-1432,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1807.28,1807.76,Why isn't that the case?
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1807.76,1812.48,-- the order of removal remains valid even if the alien is granted CAT protection.
2019.18-1432,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1812.48,1826.4,"Once the government concedes, as I think it must, right, that -- that a CAT order is distinct from, is not the same thing as a final order of removal, why -- why isn't that seriously problematic, turning to the first question I asked you?"
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1826.4,1830.64,"Justice Gorsuch, we -- we think it is part of the final order of removal."
2019.18-1432,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1833.88,1834.6,Part of and integral to --
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1834.6,1835.48,-- as this Court's Foti decision --
2019.18-1432,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1835.48,1836.96,-- but distinct from.
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1837.88,1842.24,It -- it is distinct from the order of removal in the legal sense --
2019.18-1432,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1842.24,1844.12,"Sounds pretty metaphysical, counsel."
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1847.64,1848.08,"Well, Justice --"
2019.18-1432,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1848.08,1849.24,It's like the Holy Trinity. (Laughter.)
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1849.24,1878.48,"One could say -- Justice Gorsuch, one could make the same observation with respect to the review of final decisions of the district courts. In -- in the course of litigation in district court, a district court may make a variety of decisions that culminate in a final decision. The final decision under the -- the -- the statutory provision for review of final decisions to the district court has been universally understood that review of the final decision also encompasses review of the various decisions made earlier in the course of the district court proceedings --"
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1878.48,1878.88,Can I ask you a --
2019.18-1432,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1878.88,1879.12,"Well, but --"

2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1881.68,1883.56,Go ahead.
2019.18-1432,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1883.56,1885.28,"I -- I mean, I think that's very different."
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1915.6,1926.44,"It -- it certainly does affect the final order, Justice Kagan, in this sense: To take this case as a specific example, Petitioner in this case was ordered to be removed to Lebanon."
2019.18-1432,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1943.8,1946.56,But the order is -- is for removal from this country.
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,1962.96,1966.0,"Well, respectfully, Justice Kagan, the order is more specific than that."
2019.18-1432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1985.24,1989.16,"Well, why is this -- why -- look, analogize it if you want."
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2065.04,2073.68,"Sure, Justice Breyer, we -- we have two responses about the presumption of the availability of judicial review. First, of course, we do not think the statutory text is ambiguous."
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2112.24,2112.56,Can I --
2019.18-1432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2112.56,2137.32,"Why is it different from -- from what I've seen 10,000 times? In a court of appeals, we are reviewing a piece of paper called a judgment, right? And it is the order of that judgment that we review. But, when we review it, we have like 10 different standards that you apply to different aspects depending on what the argument is."
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2139.72,2149.16,"Justice Breyer, when Congress enacted the criminal alien jurisdictional bar in (a)(2)(C), it used the term ""final order"" in the same sense that it used that term in (a)(1)."
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2156.24,2156.92,Can I ask a --
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2156.92,2157.92,It's true that --

Does that figure into this analysis at all in how you treat a -- a CAT claim, that we -- we have undertaken and we want other countries to undertake the same pledge, that people will not be returned to places where they're subject to torture?"
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2195.0,2196.68,"No, Justice Ginsburg, I don't think so."
2019.18-1432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2212.32,2213.0,Is -- is there any --
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2213.0,2214.0,-- he will not be tortured.
2019.18-1432,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2216.76,2232.36,"Is there any impediment -- and this -- this is very limited -- he can be deported any place else in the world, just not to Lebanon? Is there an impediment to deporting him to some other country?"
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2232.36,2235.88,"That -- no, there is not currently an impediment."
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2252.52,2253.84,Can I pick up on Justice --

2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2264.12,2270.6,"Well, I -- I don't know that there have been any administrative proceedings in this particular case to identify an alternative country of removal, but --"
2019.18-1432,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2270.6,2271.44,So it would have to be --
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2271.44,2272.2,"-- certainly, that would be in the analysis."
2019.18-1432,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2272.2,2275.48,-- a country that would accept him? Some country with which he has no connection would have to accept him.
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2275.48,2276.56,That's correct. That's correct.
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2276.56,2276.88,Can I pick up on --
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2276.88,2278.04,If I can return to a point that I was trying to --
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2278.04,2295.96,-- can I pick up on Justice Breyer's questions for a minute in thinking about how Congress structured this statute? The factual components of the order of removal often are not going to be seriously disputed because it will be convictions for prior offenses.
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2329.0,2336.36,"Justice Kavanaugh, the same could be said with respect to an alien's claims for asylum or to statutory withholding of removal."
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2365.32,2365.92,I just don't see --
2019.18-1432,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2365.92,2366.2,Mr. Guarnieri --
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2366.2,2368.4,-- claims for asylum and statutory withholding.
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2368.4,2392.88,"I just don't see any language that says the factual components of a CAT claim, which, correct me if I'm wrong, but those are going to be highly important in a lot of these cases, that we, Congress, don't want judicial review, even the deferential judicial review that Justice Ginsburg identified, we don't even want that, of the factual components of the CAT claim?"
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2392.88,2397.2,"Well, of course, (a) -- (a)(2)(C) itself broadly precludes review at all."
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2411.56,2416.76,"Well, that just begs the question of whether that encompasses, as Justice Gorsuch says, the CAT claim."
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2436.2,2462.04,"That is -- Congress never used those precise words, but in the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Congress did direct that CAT claims would be reviewable only as part of the review of a final order, which, in turn, should be read against the backdrop of Section 1252 and Section 1252's limits on final order of review. Congress also reinforced those limitations in the REAL ID Act of 2005, which added --"
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2462.04,2463.12,Don't you think that --
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2463.12,2464.76,-- subsections (a)(4) and (a)(5).
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2464.76,2465.56,Sorry to interrupt.
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2471.92,2475.04,"Yes, certainly, but this is a complementary part of the same project."
2019.18-1432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2526.52,2528.6,"No, it doesn't say that."
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2577.48,2591.0,"Justice Breyer, we -- we understand that to mean that Congress anticipated that CAT claims would be reviewable only as part of and subject to the limitations on final order review. That also was the administrative understanding of the statute."
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2610.24,2619.44,What was the nature of that review between 1998 and 2005? Because I'm a little murky on the chronology and how that would have worked in that -- those years.
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2619.44,2619.76,Sure.
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2625.88,2627.52,Let's talk about criminal aliens.
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2627.52,2633.6,"Well, for criminal aliens, as a result of this Court's decision in INS against St. Cyr --"
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2633.6,2635.24,Before St. Cyr.
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2635.24,2644.92,"Well, before St. Cyr, the matter was -- was somewhat unclear because, on its face, the criminal alien jurisdictional bar, as it was then written, would preclude review of all final orders by --"
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2644.92,2647.0,"There would be no review at all, right?"
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2647.0,2648.16,"That's correct, including for CAT claims."
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2648.16,2654.44,And doesn't that pose a problem given that FARRA seemed to suggest that there would be some review?
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2654.44,2659.24,"Well, but, for non-criminal aliens, there was -- review was occurring in the ordinary course."
2019.18-1432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2708.2,2708.84,Is this right?
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2708.84,2709.12,Now Congress --
2019.18-1432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2709.12,2711.24,Is this right? I'm trying to get this straight.
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2816.4,2819.12,"Justice Breyer, if you examine the legislative history --"
2019.18-1432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2819.12,2821.88,Was I right or wrong? Because I'm not asking for an argument.
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2824.92,2825.4,We don't --
2019.18-1432,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2825.4,2825.56,-- and if --
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2825.56,2830.2,-- we don't agree with Petitioner's account of the history that led to the REAL ID Act.
2019.18-1432,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2974.0,2974.12,The problem with --
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,2974.12,2974.92,-- that both of those are --
2019.18-1432,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2974.92,3003.12,"-- motions to reopen is that what you're seeking to do is to undo the order of removal, and so that fits quite clearly within your -- your -- the other side's theory. We still -- what you haven't told me is where the language of defining ""order of removal"" -- how I read that language in the statute? It's the first definition Congress has given."
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3014.16,3021.84,"We -- we think the language of 1101(a)(47) should be read in light of the -- the many decisions that preceded it, recognizing that --"
2019.18-1432,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3021.84,3022.04,The problem is --
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3022.04,3022.88,-- final orders of removal --
2019.18-1432,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3022.88,3043.52,"-- that Congress had those decisions in front of it and it could have chosen to write something much more comprehensive, but it didn't. It could have said ""order of removal"" is any order of removal and all -- all other decisions encompassed by it or all other orders encompassed by -- a part of it."
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3047.4,3052.2,"Well, we -- we think that language is naturally read to include the decisions that precede the order of removal."
2019.18-1432,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3052.2,3052.56,It's only naturally --
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3052.56,3053.16,There's no indication --
2019.18-1432,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3053.16,3056.04,"-- read that way because we decided, I think it was Foti --"
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3056.04,3056.96,That's correct.
2019.18-1432,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3056.96,3064.32,"-- that in terms of channeling review, we wanted everything channeled to the court of appeals."
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3073.56,3073.64,Well --
2019.18-1432,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3073.64,3079.32,"Channeling and reviewing it, so Congress looked at it and said the one thing we're barring is only removal."
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3079.32,3104.6,"Well, the -- the definition, it -- it defines a term that is -- appears not only in the provisions of the statute that limit review but also in the provisions of the statute that authorize review, as I explained earlier. Section 1252(a)(1) uses this term, ""final orders of removal,"" and there is no indication, and Petitioner has yet to explain why Congress would have wanted to, excludes statutory withholding claims --"
2019.18-1432,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3104.6,3105.48,"Well, according to him --"
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3105.48,3106.28,-- from reviewability.
2019.18-1432,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3106.28,3108.32,"-- according to him, maybe they didn't."

2019.18-1432,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3108.48,3111.12,I don't think he's taking a position in your favor.
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3113.16,3132.56,"Justice, I think in the reply brief Petitioner makes clear that if you accept his theory, that would mean that statutory withholding claims are not reviewable as part of a final order of removal. Now, in Footnote 7 of the reply brief, Petitioner has tried to hypothesize some other bases on which courts might be able to review those claims, but that would be a very startling development. Now, also, I think, the def --"
2019.18-1432,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3132.56,3156.96,"Mr. Guarnieri, this not a case where we have to figure out the meaning of a term by looking to zillions of different statutory provisions and trying to make sense of them. This -- there is an explicit statutory definition here, and this statutory definition says what a final -- what an order of removal is. It says ""order of deportation,"" but nobody thinks that that makes a difference."
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3201.04,3206.16,"Well, Justice Kagan, we do think the history that preceded this statute should inform the Court's understanding of it."
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3265.16,3285.16,"Back -- back to the main argument, the Seventh Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have adopted Petitioner's view of this statute, obviously, big circuits with lots of cases. Are you aware of significant problems in how they've been applying substantial evidence review to factual components of CAT claims or other problems that that's generated?"
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3285.16,3289.48,"Your Honor, the -- the -- the standard has made a difference in some cases in the Ninth Circuit."
2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3302.76,3304.4,Which way does that cut?

2019.18-1432,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3305.16,3311.72,"I mean, doesn't that suggest there, at least the courts thought there were mistakes being made in the administrative process in those cases?"
2019.18-1432,1,63110,matthew_guarnieri,,3311.72,3332.2,"Well, it's true that there are some decisions in which panels of the Ninth Circuit disagreed with the agency fact-finding. But I will just add, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the rule that the Seventh and Ninth Circuits have applied is not the rule that Petitioner has advocated here and, in fact, he has abandoned the reasoning of those courts."
