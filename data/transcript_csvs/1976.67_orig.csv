1976.67_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.53,"We’ll hear arguments first this morning in No. 67original, the State of Idaho and others against the States of Oregon and Washington."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,17.142,25.745,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, Attorney General Gorton, Attorney General Johnson, gentlemen."
1976.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,193.017,198.294,Is there some reason why membership has not been achieved?
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,198.294,201.919,"Your Honor, I guess I would have to blame politics."
1976.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,212.53,216.807,"Mr. Attorney General, if you are admitted, is that the end of your problem?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,216.807,218.733,"No, sir, it is not."
1976.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,248.415,253.57,"By what authority do you have, General Kidwell, for this Court's power to grant you what you want?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,253.57,277.053,"Justice Rehnquist, I was going to point out that I recognize that there has been no case, at least that we have been able to find, whereby this Court could say directly that we would be entitled to become a member; however, there is considerable authority, Your Honor, that this Court is the final say-so on the politity and operation and fairness of interstate compacts."
1976.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,300.043,311.942,What authority do you rely on for this Court’s power to review what you call the fairness of a Compact that has been entered into by the two States and ratified by Congress?
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,311.942,338.117,"Your Honor, probably the most clear expression by this Court would be a fairly recent case, Nebraska versus Iowa at 406 U.S, Your Honor, where the Court then was not reviewing a fish compact, but it was a compact between two States concerning itself with the river boundaries between the two States."
1976.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,338.117,340.423,"And had that been ratified by Congress, that compact?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,340.423,343.346,"Yes, Your Honor, it had been."
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,343.346,366.788,"Well, you're asserting right now no more right than you would assert if there had been no Compact at all, namely, if you suggest that this Court apportion the anadromous fish in the river among the States just as though we were operating on a stream."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,366.788,368.443,"That’s essentially correct, Your Honor."
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,368.443,383.392,"And that if you're right, if you’re entitled to a portion of those fish runs, if Idaho is, then the agreement between two other States isn’t about to deprive you of it."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,384.529,386.152,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,414.888,418.644,"Well, your second argument is independently of the Compact."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,418.644,419.61,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,419.61,422.259,"Well, now, I still don’t understand your first one."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,429.572,430.115,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,430.115,437.819,"That’s all, and that’s not the issue on the -- you want to have Idaho made a party member to the Compact, isn’t that it?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,445.079,453.413,"Justice Brennan, the reason I cited Nebraska versus Iowa is only to point out that this Court has said that they are the final arbiter, that you are the final arbiter."
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,453.413,454.374,As to the meaning of a Compact.
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,454.374,472.539,"As to the meaning of a Compact; and if this Compact, if it were determined by the proof that the Compact itself was depriving Idaho of substantive rights in this natural resource, then the Court could declare it invalid insofar as it takes these rights from the State of Idaho."
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,472.539,483.855,"You know, as a remedy, you don’t need anything more than the declaration of -- if you have it, the declaration of your right to these fish runs and enjoining anybody else who interferes with it."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,483.855,485.387,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1976.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,485.565,498.19,"Is there in the ... anywhere that would prevent you now, the State of Idaho, from being an original-jurisdiction suit against the other two States?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,500.232,511.892,"No, Your Honor, the Compact does not bar us, and at this point we felt that the most appropriate remedy and after much discussion would be to come to this Court with this type of original-jurisdiction case."
1976.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,511.892,516.596,What if Congress did not approve it?
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,517.433,518.64,"Your Honor, there is always that hazard."
1976.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,553.387,577.397,"Now the Assistant General has represented that the State of Oregon has agreed to your joining the Compact and that the State of Washington was on its way to agreeing to it, one of its Houses having enacted the necessary legislation or passed the necessary resolutions, and then the term of the Legislature ended, but that there is every possibility that the State of Washington will do so early next year."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,579.464,589.202,"Justice Stewart, if, in fact, the problem would become moot sometime in the future, Idaho would be first in line to ask to dismiss this case."
1976.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,629.102,631.552,"Well, something has happened recently."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,645.462,647.602,"Your Honor, there is an additional problem, however."
1976.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,669.13,678.343,"Incidentally, what has prompted this activity finally in Oregon and Washington, the filing of this complaint?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,678.343,691.594,"Your Honor, I think it would be unfair to completely characterize it as that; but from my standpoint, there was no Compact passed by the Legislature until after we had filed this motion and after about 40 years of discussion."
1976.67_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,700.081,715.57,"General Kidwell, as I understand it, you want two things:  you want Idaho to be written in as the member of the Compact, and to rewrite the Compact and, I assume, to compel Congress to approve it."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,715.918,722.287,"Justice Marshall, obviously, I recognize that we cannot compel Congress to approve it."
1976.67_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,722.287,726.872,"Well, is there any difference in compelling Congress and compelling the States?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,736.521,750.208,"Your Honor, that's -- Justice Marshall, that’s why I pointed out that I believe that this Court could achieve that by invalidating that portion of the Columbia River Compact that would deny Idaho its say-so."
1976.67_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,750.208,759.398,"Well, do we have to do that, or could we just have some type of action which would say that these two States cannot interfere with Idaho’s fish?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,759.398,761.306,"Your Honor, that in effect would do it."
1976.67_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,762.024,763.595,But that is not what you asked for.
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,763.595,785.534,"Your Honor, we are asking for two things:  one, to be made a member of the Compact; recognizing the difficulties there, the second part is what I have entitled equitable apportionment or, in other words, giving us a right to our fair share of the fish commensurate with the amount of the fish produced in the State of Idaho."
1976.67_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,785.534,790.557,"May I ask one more question about the first part of the case, the Compact part?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,805.157,807.553,"Yes, Your Honor, and that certainly is a problem."
1976.67_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,831.898,844.473,"Well, just to dispose of the first part of the case in my own mind, if I may first, am I correct in believing you are not merely asking to be let in, but you are asking to be let in on the terms that you would specify?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,844.473,848.789,"Your Honor, I think that would be putting at a little harsher than we would like to have it recognized."
1976.67_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,855.781,862.678,"No, but you have to decide what kind of say-so, wouldn’t you, in order to formulate a meaningful decree on the Compact issue?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,862.678,870.575,"Your Honor, we feel that if there was an order entered that Idaho was entitled to its share of the fish, that this would then enforce the States to agree."
1976.67_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,871.029,875.601,But then you are in effect saying all you need is the second branch of your argument.
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,875.601,882.319,"Your Honor, I am saying if the second part of our argument were granted, if that relief were granted, it would take care of the first."
1976.67_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,882.319,888.485,And the first part can’t really do anything all by itself anyway without this Court in effect the writing the Compact for the three States.
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,888.485,901.53,"Your Honor, we feel that even if we had a voice or a say-so in the Compact, the first part, which would not give us our total relief, even having the say-so as one-third of the Compact would be more than we have had for the last 40 years."
1976.67_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,906.964,914.03,"Mr. Attorney General, then I would suggest you get to the second part, and let's hope we don’t question you further on the first."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,914.03,915.056,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1976.67_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,915.056,919.388,"Mr. Kidwell, may I ask this question before you move on?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,934.143,934.87,"Your Honor, it is --"
1976.67_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,934.87,937.313,... in the face of the eight dams?
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,937.313,945.079,"Your Honor, it is capable of determining the amount of fish that are going into the headwaters with almost mathematical precision."
1976.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,981.11,984.604,By limitation of both sport fishing and commercial fishing ...
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,984.604,985.762,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,985.762,986.542,... primarily.
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,995.573,996.917,We do feel some efforts could be made --
1976.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,996.917,999.464,... I guess there's some pollution and so on and nitrogen in the water.
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,999.464,999.988,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1014.888,1016.267,"Additional ladders, maybe, or …"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1016.267,1021.049,"Additional ladders, yeah, improved ladders that will take care of the other varieties of --"
1976.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1021.049,1024.57,Are we talking about various varieties of salmon and also steelhead?
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1024.57,1033.383,"Salmon and steelhead, Your Honor, yes; primarily, the spring chinook salmon and the steelhead."
1976.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1042.188,1047.637,Do those fish generally die upstream after they spawn?
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1050.316,1054.507,"Your Honor, the chinook salmon automatically does die."
1976.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1117.671,1125.181,"Is there any fishing of them, legal fishing of them, when they're on their way out to the ocean or only when they're coming upstream?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1125.181,1130.768,"No, there is no significant problem when they are on their way back other than the dams and the other …"
1976.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1130.768,1131.199,Which way?
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1132.334,1133.347,When they are going back to the ocean.
1976.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1133.347,1133.87,Uh-huh.
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1139.573,1146.386,"Okay, either one, either the steelhead going back or the smolts going down, juveniles, no, Your Honor, there is no problem of fishing."
1976.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1146.386,1147.116,Of fishing on their way down.
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1147.116,1152.441,"There is a tremendous problem with turbine damage and the ladders and this type of things, but no problem with the fishing."
1976.67_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1153.575,1154.391,Going upstream.
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1154.391,1156.181,-- up to spawn.
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1273.849,1278.653,"Excuse me, Mr. Kidwell, I think you said the United States had no interest?"
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1278.653,1292.136,"I notice that the Solicitor General, in the memorandum that he has submitted as amicus, states that the United States is an indispensable party to this litigation."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1292.136,1310.253,"Justice Brennan, what I was saying is that we respectfully disagree with the position of the Solicitor General, in that there is no reason or no legal reason why the United States would have any interest or want to be involved in this lawsuit between these two States."
1976.67_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1310.253,1316.572,"Does it interfere with your rights, your claims, if they were parties in some way?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1316.572,1318.979,"Your Honor, I don’t believe that it would."
1976.67_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1332.153,1350.524,"The stated position, however, is that it would be improper for the Court to make an equitable apportionment of the fishery among the three States in the absence of the tribes or the United States as their trustee or both, suggesting indeed that there may be conflicts of interest between upstream and downstream Indian tribes."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1350.524,1352.754,"Yes, Your Honor, and I am aware that the ..."
1976.67_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1352.754,1353.635,But you disagree with that.
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1353.635,1355.879,We disagree with that.
1976.67_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1358.207,1362.692,Do you think that the Solicitor General of the United States has any interest in dams on navigable rivers?
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1362.692,1364.444,"Your Honor, I think they have a tremendous interest."
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1364.444,1369.773,"Well, won't this require changing dams on navigable rivers?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1369.773,1371.139,"Not necessarily, Your Honor, Under --"
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1371.139,1375.194,I thought you said you had to do something with the flow of the dam and the ladder.
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1375.194,1376.464,"Your Honor, I said that if Idaho --"
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1376.464,1377.69,Didn’t you?
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1377.69,1384.832,"Yes, Your Honor, I said that if Idaho were admitted as a member of the Compact, we feel that we could have some say-so."
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1393.644,1400.01,Suppose that interferes against the interests of the United States in a navigable river.
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1400.01,1400.886,"Your Honor, if that did --"
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1400.886,1403.239,So the United States has an interest.
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1403.239,1405.245,"Yes, Your Honor, if that did happen."
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1413.755,1419.812,"Well, I don’t know; but can you change a dam without the permission of the United States?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1425.546,1437.77,"Your Honor, other than through the Congress; the Congress, I believe, could make additional appropriations for moneys for fish ladders or the various remedies that are available through the dam."
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1437.77,1442.72,"And if Congress called on the United States to give them their views, of course they would."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1442.72,1443.191,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1443.191,1445.439,"Well, why can’t we?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1445.439,1447.158,"Your Honor, certainly you can."
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1452.168,1455.994,"Well, why do you resist making United States a party?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1466.011,1466.334,"Yes, sir."
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1466.334,1473.22,"... that is under the cases of this Court, the States are wholly ... they couldn’t possibly totally deny it."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1476.045,1477.588,"I well recognize that, Your Honor, and I --"
1976.67_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1477.588,1480.595,"Well, why do you resist United States being a party?"
1976.67_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1480.595,1482.624,Are you free to join the United States?
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1483.988,1484.525,"No, sir."
1976.67_orig,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1493.476,1496.849,Why can’t you move to join them as a party defendant?
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1496.849,1505.338,"Your Honor, we could. We just didn’t feel that there was any interest paramount of the United States that would call for that."

1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1530.396,1531.033,"Yes, Your Honor, although --"
1976.67_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1531.033,1541.947,"That ignores ... if you had asked for that relief alone, would the existence of the Compact be a barrier to the Court’s granting that relief alone?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1541.947,1549.368,"Your Honor, the Compact would rear its head in that and would be headlong in conflict with our asking for this remedy."
1976.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.769,1571.716,"With you, I don’t understand why you would think that if Idaho has the right to claim that an agreement between two other States completely eliminate it. I don’t understand that."
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1571.716,1575.428,"Justice White, I do not feel it can, and that is the equitable apportionment."
1976.67_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.428,1580.116,"Well, why do you need any remedy against the Compact, I mean, as such?"
1976.67_orig,0,45205,wayne_l_kidwell,,1580.116,1584.51,"Your Honor, we do not per se have to have the remedy of the Compact."
1976.67_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1604.801,1610.079,Very well.
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,1612.373,1616.285,"Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.67_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1638.794,1652.478,What if the State of Idaho had come in to pursue the question I just put to your friend and asked for nothing expect essentially what they pray for in Paragraph 2.
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,1660.643,1662.907,"No, I do not."
1976.67_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1667.876,1676.083,"Well, isn't it true that sometimes when people ask for five or seven paragraphs of relief, a Court grants one or two?"
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,1676.083,1702.504,"Well, my point is, Mr. Chief Justice, is, that it is not what the State of Idaho is asking; indeed, that is the last thing that the State of Idaho wants, and I think maybe I can explain this by simply first maybe describing the regulatory scheme that exists in Oregon and Washington and pointing out to what Idaho wants, it doesn’t want to strike down that regulatory scheme; they just don’t like the way we are doing it."
1976.67_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.884,1877.915,"I am not sure I follow that, Mr. Attorney General."
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,1888.892,1891.025,"I've got to ... one is, as I recall, that --"
1976.67_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1891.025,1902.467,"One is that we take jurisdiction, the formal prayer, and the second is that we declare -- that we determine the equitable apportion of the upriver fishing that is due to Idaho."
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,1902.467,1903.856,"Well, all right."
1976.67_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1922.985,1927.651,"Well, they state that or at least they represent that they spawn the fish originally."
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,1927.651,1934.815,I don’t see how that gives them any right whatsoever.
1976.67_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1959.073,1959.988,You are now going --
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,1959.988,1962.467,-- simply because Idaho wants to protect that bird?
1976.67_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1962.467,1963.821,You are now going to the remedy.
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,1975.237,1984.674,"Well, I don’t see how the Court can take jurisdiction unless there is some legal interest that Idaho alleges that’s being violated."
1976.67_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1985.034,1985.825,"Well, that's just it."
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,1987.788,1988.079,All right.
1976.67_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2017.595,2017.962,"Well, suppose --"
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2017.962,2020.3,There is no comparable -- pardon me.
1976.67_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2020.3,2032.313,"Suppose that the lower States simply established a barrier in the river and let no fish through whatsoever in Idaho, that they're just going to take them all."
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2045.332,2047.066,"No, I would disagree there ..."
1976.67_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2047.066,2049.583,"Well, what right would they have?"
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2049.583,2067.668,"... on the grounds there, there, I think if the State’s regulatory scheme -- if the State did nothing, it’s another question; but if the State’s regulatory scheme, basically that was the effect of the State’s regulatory scheme, then I think Idaho has a contention, would have a very legitimate contention that the State --"
1976.67_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.668,2070.815,Where do you find that right?
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2070.815,2075.13,"Interstate commerce, undue interference with the interstate commerce."
1976.67_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.666,2082.268,Idaho asserts that the other State is interfering with interstate commerce and the fish.
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2082.268,2082.61,Yes.
1976.67_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.002,2101.486,"Well, in any event, whatever the source of the right, you would concede Idaho would have a right?"
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2101.486,2104.322,"Yes, premised on the Constitution."
1976.67_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2121.219,2122.443,But not enough of them.
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2122.443,2126.746,"Not enough, I mean, what Idaho is asking this Court -- this is their whole point."
1976.67_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.822,2154.333,"So you simply concede that Idaho is entitled to an equitable portion of the fish, and you just say you are giving them an equitable portion."
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2156.309,2157.149,No.
1976.67_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2184.433,2185.62,"Well, where do you draw the line?"
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2195.259,2196.327,"No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
1976.67_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2196.327,2210.634,"Your point is, as I understand it, Mr. Attorney General, that if there were no Compact between Washington and Oregon and if indeed the States, either in cooperation with each other or individually, did nothing, then no fish would get to Idaho."
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2210.634,2211.99,Right.
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2211.99,2216.376,"What he is saying, he hasn't -- this is the most extraordinary remedy."
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2223.635,2227.541,He's saying -- you're just saying we're not being good enough policemen.
1976.67_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2289.188,2306.07,If it were physically feasible -- and I have no idea whether it is -- could Idaho put nets up at its border and keep all these fish in Idaho and never let them get out without --
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2306.07,2322.034,"I think they can, or the only question there is whether they are in effect by their State action unduly interfering with interstate commerce, and that would be the only contention we could be on."
1976.67_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2322.034,2326.228,You said it would be an interference if that happened on the upstream side.
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2330.144,2331.681,"Well, I would have to say this."
1976.67_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2345.71,2348.484,"General Johnson, let me test your distinction."
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2365.179,2366.554,Yes.
1976.67_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2366.841,2367.879,Why is that different?
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2367.879,2369.822,I am saying that as a matter of law.
1976.67_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2372.959,2379.259,"Well, why is that different than supposing Idaho had no regular -- the water flows towards the ocean, I assume."
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2395.048,2397.878,"On water rights, I think there is a long common-law --"
1976.67_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2397.878,2398.839,But then what's the difference?
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2398.839,2402.355,"I do not think we can on fish, because the common law is pretty well-established."
1976.67_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.599,2412.635,But you conceded they'd have a right on fish if it were an interference rather than a lack of adequate regulation.
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2412.635,2415.582,"Well, first, I was answering you on the common law."
1976.67_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2425.613,2428.483,Idaho was failing to do anything is my question.
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2430.548,2437.698,"I feel that our remedy is, we do not have a right to go enjoin the State of Idaho to regulate its fishery."
1976.67_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2437.698,2441.566,"Now, I'm talking about you would agree it could if it were water, though."
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2441.566,2446.145,"On water, I think there is a possible contention -- we can certainly to the point that it’s destroying our riparian rights."
1976.67_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2446.145,2452.935,"But you'd have a remedy, even though what you sought was an order compelling them to impose additional regulation they didn't now impose."
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2454.161,2469.261,"Well, I think it gets -- and this Court in those water-right cases, it has accepted jurisdiction in a number of them; in most of them, as I recall reading them, the Court has backed off because of this statutory problem."
1976.67_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2510.263,2513.589,"You are now into your colleague’s time, General."
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2513.589,2515.002,Thank you.
1976.67_orig,1,34663,lee_johnson,,2515.002,2520.922,It’s our opinion that the case should be dismissed.
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2522.423,2525.496,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.67_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2586.963,2590.687,Was the United States a party in Arizona against California?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2590.687,2596.965,"It was -- the first Arizona versus California case was dismissed, because the United States was not joined as a defendant."
1976.67_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2596.965,2598.102,How about the second?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2598.102,2600.408,"In the second one, it was a party."
1976.67_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2600.408,2604.889,"Well, what are you asking, that we start all over again and name the United States?"
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2604.889,2609.099,"From the point of view of his asking to be in the Compact, it seems to me he clearly has to be."
1976.67_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2614.901,2618.383,Then you'll be up here in a few more months all over again.
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2618.383,2620.472,"We might well be, and we’ll argue what I am going to argue --"
1976.67_orig,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2620.472,2627.912,So what you gain by this point when the Solicitor General certainly could move to intervene if he wanted to.
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2627.912,2632.988,"By the time that that happened, Idaho would probably have been offered membership in the Compact."
1976.67_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2691.506,2692.851,How about the High Mountain Sheep Dam?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2694.284,2696.852,"No, that’s … pardon me."
1976.67_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2696.852,2697.958,Is that on the same river?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2697.958,2699.231,"Yes, that is on the Snake."
1976.67_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2703.199,2714.116,"Are you suggesting, General Gorton, that this case be put on the backburner and let these diplomatic processes that your friend from Idaho talked about to proceed?"
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2714.116,2720.414,"Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice, exactly as you did in New York versus New Jersey and Vermont versus New York."
1976.67_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2775.025,2779.737,This has been because Washington and Oregon have prohibited commercial fishing?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2779.737,2784.203,"Have prohibited commercial fishing for those fish, which go to Idaho."
1976.67_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2787.477,2788.106,How about the Indians?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2789.185,2801.84,"The Indian fisheries have gone on longer than that; but the Indian fisheries, which of course are not controlled by our States or by the Compact, were stopped on a commercial basis in the terrible year of 1975."
1976.67_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2806.344,2809.514,All of one year ago.
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2809.514,2813.529,"Well, that is because 1975 was a terrible year, Your Honor."
1976.67_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2818.039,2823.918,"But, General Gorton, when you ask us to look at these figures, aren't you asking us to look at the evidence that would be before the trier of the fact?"
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2826.137,2835.935,"You are entitled, it seems to me, to take judicial notice of matters which are published, and particularly of orders --"
1976.67_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2835.935,2841.367,But aren't these the precise factual issues that would be involved in a trial if the complaint were to be filed?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2841.367,2843.901,They are some of the facts which would be so involved.
1976.67_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.901,2846.04,"You are, I think, in essence, saying they can’t prove what they have alleged."
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2846.04,2855.642,"That is exactly right, Your Honor, and it seems to me that you should consider whether or not this is a case in which you can fashion appropriate judicial relief."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.282,2896.182,"Mr. Gorton, is the United States subject to suit in this action against its consent?"
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2896.182,2898.306,"I believe it is not, Your Honor."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2901.754,2910.349,And although I take it appropriate officials of the United States might be subject to suit in this very action.
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2910.349,2923.372,"I believe so, and I believe in a District Court action, for example, that it is very likely, at least, that the fish commissions of the respective States could be sued if we were to start at a District Court level."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2923.89,2926.826,Who administers those dams?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2926.826,2929.885,The United States at the Corps of Engineers.
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2932.261,2942.034,"In terms of the suit against the United States, I take it to the extent those dams are significant in this litigation, the Corps of Engineers or the Generals could be made parties."
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2942.034,2943.16,"Exactly, it could be."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2974.2,2978.573,"What about your territorial waters, the ocean on the ocean side?"
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2978.573,2980.964,Those are not under the Compact.
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.141,2987.979,"Well, whether they're under the Compact or not, what about your commercial fishing at the mouth of the rivers?"
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,2987.979,3000.63,"There is a very considerable commercial fishery not at the mouths of the rivers, but on the open ocean, which involves Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and California fisheries."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3000.63,3004.404,Any foreign nations?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3004.404,3017.489,"Well, until the 2 -- under the new 200-mile limit law to which General Kidwell referred, there is now a commission to work on that 200-mile-limit area, of which Idaho is a member."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.358,3049.977,You don’t think more fish would come upstream if there was no commercial fishing on the ocean side at all?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3049.977,3059.299,"If there were no commercial fishing on the ocean side at all, which is not totally under the jurisdiction of these States, more fish would get up there."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3060.199,3064.413,So there is some commercial fishing in the ocean that is subject to your jurisdiction.
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3064.413,3067.999,"There is, but that has not been a subject of this complaint."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3175.496,3183.052,"General Gorton, is that really a basis on which we can decline an original-jurisdiction case, that it’s going to get us into a morass?"
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3183.052,3186.97,It’s a way -- it’s one on which you have historically declined such.
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3200.82,3202.533,"We've had some of these cases for a long time, General Gorton."
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3202.533,3203.02,Pardon?
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3203.02,3205.364,"I say, we've had some of these original cases here for a long time."
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3205.364,3206.891,"I understand that, and then --"
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3206.891,3208.697,Let me ask this.
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3212.265,3213.88,That was on Puget Sound.
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3214.288,3215.455,"Puget Sound, not on the river."
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3215.455,3215.801,No.
1976.67_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3330.359,3332.95,They get decimated as their smolts' going out to sea.
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3332.95,3340.329,95% of the 1973 smolts going downstream were killed by the dams.
1976.67_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3340.329,3346.68,And this is what in your view and your submission basically accounted for the gross deterioration of the fishery in 1975?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3346.68,3361.348,"Exactly, and why we were unable -- and why we simply had to ban any commercial or recreational fishing at all on fish going to Idaho, because we agree with them that too few fish are going back there for anyone to have the season and for the fish to reproduce themselves."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3374.73,3381.706,You said there's litigation over the operation of the dams that Oregon and Washington has presently pending against the Corps of Engineers?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3381.706,3382.573,Washington does.
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3384.777,3391.144,"But, of course, you don’t have , I gather, any suit pending on the Hells Canyon Dam, do you?"
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3391.144,3392.242,"No, we do not."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3392.242,3393.235,That's private.
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3393.235,3394.785,That was privately built.
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.697,3405.09,"Of course, if you were a party to this case, then you could file a crossclaim again and enjoin that private outfit."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3405.09,3417.901,"We might well because, of course, while those fish came down and benefited our citizens when that dam was built or, actually, its predecessor really first cut the ... cut off all of Idaho."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3417.901,3419.721,That dam hurts you worse than anyone ...
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3419.721,3420.707,"Yes, it hurts us worse than anyone."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3420.707,3421.584,... as far as the fishing goes.
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3421.584,3422.897,"Yeah, exactly."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3446.403,3453.656,"Well, this might be a form of that, maybe interest on all these parties."
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3453.656,3468.13,"They may well be, but they can probably solve the problems better themselves, now that we have a Congress which is much more interested in giving money for fish escapement than it ever was in the 1930s, 1940s and the 1950s when these --"
1976.67_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3468.13,3480.337,"Before you sit down, I understand from the Assistant General’s memorandum that you contemplate that your Legislature is going to adopt the necessary enabling legislation to bring Idaho into the Compact?"
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3480.337,3480.741,"Yes, sir."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3506.455,3508.008,"Thank you, General Gorton."
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3511.744,3516.346,"We certainly will, Your Honor."
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3516.346,3544.045,"Mr. Chief Justice and the General Kidwell, for the brief time I have left, the Court asked -- Mr. Justice White asked earlier -- about our priorities, and if you can look at the complaint or when you do, in the complaint I would point out that after our recital that the Court accept and assume jurisdiction, the second point is the equitable-apportionment part."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3548.717,3556.464,Is it true that no salmon or steelhead can pass either way on the Hells Canyon Dam?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3556.464,3561.82,"Yes, Your Honor, unfortunately it is true, and I dislike that as much as, I'm sure, the other two States."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3561.82,3563.527,And where is the Hells Canyon Dam?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3568.722,3570.895,"Your Honor, it’s on another tributary."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3581.111,3581.793,"""The State made a mistake""?"
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3585.097,3588.691,"Well, at least I feel they did not take all of the factors into consideration."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3590.619,3594.056,Is it on a tributary of the Snake River?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3594.056,3596.474,"It’s on the Snake River itself, Your Honor."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3596.474,3598.408,Where?
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3598.408,3603.512,"Well, it is on the border between Oregon ..."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3603.512,3603.925,And Washington.
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3603.925,3606.034,... and Washington and Idaho.
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3606.034,3610.954,"And Idaho, so that no fish can come upstream from there?"
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3610.954,3611.837,Up this branch.
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3611.837,3612.251,Up this branch.
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3612.251,3616.884,"Up this branch of the river, that’s right, Your Honor."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3656.384,3657.628,"No, that’s just a signal."
1976.67_orig,2,41407,slade_gorton,,3659.021,3659.971,"Oh, I see."
1976.67_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3706.845,3707.675,"Thank you, gentlemen."
