1990.89-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.909,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1541, Roderick A. DeArment, Acting Secretary of Labor v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission."
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,26.43,29.642,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,100.028,106.863,"Mr. Sloan, does that same principle apply to the Commission itself when it decides issues?"
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,112.617,114.32,"Yes, it does, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,114.32,123.743,"So the error that was made here, in your view, was made at the Commission level by its failure to defer to the Secretary's position?"
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,123.743,126.374,That's correct.
1990.89-1541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.704,158.715,I'm curious here.
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,183.614,190.098,The reason for that was that the regulation that was relied on was perfectly appropriate.
1990.89-1541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.262,207.779,"Well, when you rely on the training regulation, it's perhaps ambiguous, or you have to stretch to see how it applies."
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,213.924,220.608,"--Well, in terms of some of the objections that have been raised to it, those objections would not be present."
1990.89-1541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,223.661,229.653,"Yeah, I just... it seems the present interpretation would appear to make it duplicative."
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,238.928,239.719,"Well, part of the reason--"
1990.89-1541,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,239.719,248.555,"I might say that I share Justice O'Connor's concern as to why an amendment wasn't made, or why you didn't rely on the other provision."
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,248.555,250.566,--Two... there are two reasons.
1990.89-1541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,345.098,352.014,"That may be interesting background, but it doesn't answer the question, because the shorter version was in effect, was it not?"
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,352.014,354.515,--At the time--
1990.89-1541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,354.515,356.167,"Here, yes."
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,356.167,356.595,--That's correct.
1990.89-1541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,357.166,360.407,So why wasn't it used or cited?
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,360.407,365.012,"--Okay, and that gets to the second... that gets to the second question, the second part of the question."
1990.89-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.838,487.1,"Mr. Sloan, where in your brief or in the petition are these various sections set out?"
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,487.1,489.782,"The regulations, Justice... Chief Justice Rehnquist?"
1990.89-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,489.782,493.025,What you have just been talking to in response to Justice O'Connor and Justice Blackmun's questions.
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,493.025,493.126,Okay.
1990.89-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,540.646,545.181,Is... one of the regulations that the Secretary relied on is not reproduced?
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,545.181,547.632,"--No, Chief Justice Rehnquist, that's not what I'm saying."
1990.89-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,575.281,575.742,Thank you.
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,575.742,581.916,"As a clerical matter, the second sentence wasn't deleted until somewhat later, but this is what was in effect at the time."
1990.89-1541,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.537,634.503,"Are you, therefore, Mr. Sloan, asking us to send the case back so the court can address that question, or are you asking us to decide it?"
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,634.503,647.499,"We think that it would be appropriate to send the case back to address the reasonableness after clarifying the threshold question which has divided the courts of appeals, which is whether deference should be given to the Secretary or to the Commission."
1990.89-1541,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,654.515,659.848,"Would you agree that if one just reads (e)(5), that the Secretary's position is unreasonable?"
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,659.848,670.615,"No, I would not agree with that, because (e)(5) includes the language that the employee must have an opportunity to have the respirator fitted properly."
1990.89-1541,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,771.18,778.085,"Mr. Sloan, you spoke of the question of relative deferences between the Secretary and OSHA as being a threshold question."
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,792.645,802.531,"Well, we agree that that should be the primary... that that should be the first question that the Court looks at, and that was a serious error in the court of appeals' decision."
1990.89-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,823.313,827.867,But that isn't the question you presented in your petition for certiorari.
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,840.006,842.907,"--That's correct, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1990.89-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,864.6,867.943,You're talking about what the court of appeals should address rather than what we should address.
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,867.943,868.193,That's right.
1990.89-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,868.193,869.085,I didn't understand that.
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,869.085,869.946,"That's right, Chief Justice."
1990.89-1541,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.946,879.86,"Well, I suppose part of your... part of the question you presented is whether the Secretary's position is reasonable?"
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,883.402,887.546,"You don't defer to something that's unreasonable, I agree with that."
1990.89-1541,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.873,903.997,You may... I suppose you would think we would be unreasonable if we said that the Secretary's position is unreasonable.
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,910.992,927.762,"--Well, in terms of the question, it is related to the question of deference, Your Honor, because if in fact the Commission should receive deference in its reasonable interpretations, then, as the court of appeals did, there is no reason to consider the reasonableness of the Secretary's interpretation."
1990.89-1541,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,945.754,958.213,"Well, if the... you think the issue here is just whether there should be deference or not, and the court of appeals didn't think that it was entitled to any deference, so it didn't reach the reasonableness."
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,958.213,960.064,--Of the Secretary's interpretation.
1990.89-1541,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.064,960.344,"Yes, exactly."
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,960.344,960.825,That's right.
1990.89-1541,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,960.825,961.165,Exactly.
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,967.519,977.363,"Well... I think that's correct, the Court does not have to get mixed up in the reasonableness issue if it clarifies the general legal principle that has divided the courts of appeals."
1990.89-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.363,985.241,"Mr. Sloan, I don't know why you, I thought you conceded earlier that the preliminary issue was whether this was a reasonable interpretation of the Secretary or not."
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1008.235,1017.982,"The reason why I think that the threshold question should be which entity receives deference, and I didn't mean to say anything contrary to that--"
1990.89-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1017.982,1019.494,I thought you did.
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1019.775,1037.006,"--The reason why I think that the identity of the entity that should receive deference is the threshold question is because that is the legal rule that then structures the court's analysis in its case-by-case consideration of these cases, and that's exactly the issue that has generated the--"
1990.89-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1037.006,1038.724,"It's the more important question, no doubt."
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1038.724,1038.984,--That's right.
1990.89-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1038.984,1048.242,"In whatever might be logically prior in some sort of theoretical analysis, one question is presented by this petition for certiorari, and that is who gets deference."
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1048.242,1050.523,"That's correct, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1990.89-1541,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1050.523,1057.188,"Yes, but it's presented on the assumption that there is some ambiguity that needs... justifying deferring to somebody."
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1062.892,1067.717,"Well, it is... the question presented arises from the judgment of the court of appeals."
1990.89-1541,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1067.717,1072.509,"They assume that there was ambiguity, and therefore they decided which one to have to defer to."
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1086.326,1090.039,"If there, if there is no ambiguity there is no question of deference presented."
1990.89-1541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1130.415,1133.267,"Mr. Sloan, may I ask you one other question?"
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1155.123,1160.565,That issue would bear on the reasonableness of the interpretation.
1990.89-1541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1186.963,1195.309,"Well, suppose it just comes to the Commission to decide, and all they have is that particular compliance order."
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1202.133,1204.103,"--Well, they--"
1990.89-1541,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1204.103,1208.197,"So the Commission has to defer, and the court subsequently has to defer?"
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1213.19,1224.189,"--When that's all you have, which is the hardest question... I should point out that this issue encompasses a great many other kinds of interpretations by the Secretary which aren't as hard as that hardest case."
1990.89-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.488,1256.299,Why is that?
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1262.474,1263.793,--It is the official act.
1990.89-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1263.793,1265.235,Is it a governmental act?
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1265.235,1266.135,"Yes, it is."
1990.89-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1266.135,1267.286,And official.
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1281.835,1282.607,Well--
1990.89-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1282.607,1283.388,I don't understand that.
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1283.388,1291.091,"--I agree that it should be upheld if it's reasonable, and that's why my answer to Justice O'Connor on this question was that yes, it should, it should get deference."
1990.89-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1322.163,1323.393,I think you can play that in reverse.
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1337.982,1338.612,--I--
1990.89-1541,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.612,1341.855,I hereby advise you I'm going to interpret black to mean white.
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1343.495,1344.156,--I agree with that.
1990.89-1541,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1443.771,1445.564,Are those statutory factors?
1990.89-1541,0,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,1445.564,1446.562,"Yes, they are."
1990.89-1541,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1450.185,1451.266,"Very well, Mr. Sloan."
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1452.077,1457.29,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1535.953,1542.849,"Mr. Faught, I suppose Congress could have just not have provided for administrative adjudication at all."
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1550.823,1552.602,That is not--
1990.89-1541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.602,1558.206,There are a lot of statutes where you don't have an administrative agency adjudicating.
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1577.33,1578.7,"--That is not correct, Justice White."
1990.89-1541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1578.7,1579.14,What?
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1579.14,1583.114,What Congress created was an independent administrative agency.
1990.89-1541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1583.114,1587.446,"I know that, but let's assume for the moment that they had put it in a court, an Article III court."
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1593.42,1602.745,"The Article III court would look at the... what Chevron, and apply the analysis under Chevron as to whether it gives way to the court or way to the Secretary."
1990.89-1541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1602.745,1609.541,"Do you think the... do you think the... you think OSHA, the Commission doesn't have to follow Chevron, is that it?"
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1609.541,1611.711,"Your Honor, Chevron is a judicial--"
1990.89-1541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1611.711,1614.333,"A court would have to, but the Commission doesn't?"
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1614.333,1619.048,"--The Commission would not follow Chevron per se, if I may explain."
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1648.296,1658.211,"Mr. Faught, maybe that's true, but it's certainly not true because Congress wanted to create an independent, as you have described it, an independent adjudicative agency."
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1675.932,1688.461,"As this Court has held in a long series of cases, beginning with SEC v. Chenery, Justice Scalia, is that an administrative agency in adjudicatory power also has the power to make policy."
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1714.189,1720.622,"Do you think that OSHA can develop regulations through its adjudication the way the labor board can, for example?"
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1725.935,1731.261,"They cannot make up rules in terms of rule-making power, which is given to the Secretary."
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1733.972,1740.066,That impose new substantive obligations that are not imposed by the Secretary's regulations?
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1740.066,1743.597,They can... the Commission can act in a number of ways.
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.939,1745.941,Can you answer that?
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1755.315,1755.716,"--Yes, it can."
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.716,1756.136,It can?
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1756.136,1756.766,"Yes, it can."
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1757.247,1758.357,Such as?
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1758.357,1763.892,Such as the Commission has interpreted what is a repeated violation under the act.
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1778.381,1779.241,That's not a new substantive rule.
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1791.659,1800.364,"--It cannot make policy in the sense of establishing substantive standards, which is the power of the Secretary under its rule-making authority."
1990.89-1541,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1823.211,1838.228,"Well, now, if there were no Commission and the question went to an Article III court, the same question we have here, would the Article III court defer to the Secretary's interpretation of an ambiguous regulation?"
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1838.228,1849.548,"On the facts of this case the answer is no, Justice O'Connor, because the matter that is presented here by the Secretary, her interpretation of the standard is not based on her rule-making authority."
1990.89-1541,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.679,1880.036,"Oh, so your answer is that you only defer to certain kinds of interpretations, but not to an interpretation developed and presented during the course of litigation."
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1881.118,1881.358,That is correct.
1990.89-1541,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1881.949,1886.911,And do you have authority from this Court for that proposition?
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1886.911,1887.462,Yes.
1990.89-1541,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1887.462,1888.103,Is that clear?
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1888.103,1894.856,Bowen v. Georgetown University makes it very clear that litigation positions are not entitled to Chevron deference.
1990.89-1541,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1899.29,1901.672,But in this case it was a citation.
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1919.874,1924.806,"What you have here, Justice Kennedy, is an ambiguous standard."
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.259,1960.91,What was the litigation position involved in Bowen?
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1960.91,1968.884,--The litigation position involved the retroactive application of a wage index by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1968.884,1972.177,"Right, defending against a suit against the Secretary, right?"
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,1972.177,1972.858,That's correct.
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1999.636,2007.249,"But there, there the mere action that the Secretary had taken in Bowen didn't bespeak that interpretation."
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2042.172,2043.854,And to be entitled to Chevron deference?
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2043.854,2044.154,Yeah.
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2044.154,2044.505,No.
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2046.225,2048.437,So it can't clarify a regulation.
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2049.378,2056.143,"--To be entitled to controlling weight, it would have to act through what the authority that Congress has delegated it, which would be rule-making authority."
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.239,2071.453,"Is this so for all agencies, or is this just OSHA?"
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2071.453,2072.906,It would be for all agencies.
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2081.949,2086.092,But we have a lot of cases deferring to the agency's interpretation of its own regulation.
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2101.934,2110.761,"In those cases, Your Honor, there is... there is confusing language about the controlling weight under Chevron or whether you give considerable deference."
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2160.421,2177.423,"So when the FCC prosecutes somebody for a violation of one of its regulations in a district court, let's say, and the case comes to a district court, and the FCC's position is reasonable as to the meaning of that regulation, we would not defer to the FCC, you would say?"
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2177.423,2184.939,"--If the action of the FCC is based on the authority that Congress has delegated to it, it would be a Chevron question--"
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2184.939,2185.658,"No, this is a regulation."
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2201.869,2206.911,--You would give deference to the regulation as an interpretation of its authority under the statute--
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2206.911,2209.463,But not to the FCC's interpretation of the regulation?
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2209.463,2215.196,"--If they argued in court and gave you their interpretation that added to it, that is not entitled to--"
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.196,2215.627,Not just arguing in court.
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2219.05,2221.121,--Your Honor--
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.121,2223.204,And you say it would not get Chevron--
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2223.204,2232.321,"--If the citation... if the citation conforms with the standard and there is no ambiguity in the standard, then the agency is going to get controlling weight."
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2423.794,2437.172,"--Mr. Faught, is it your position that the, that OSHA does not defer to the Secretary with respect to the Secretary's interpretation of the statute as well as the regulations?"
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2447.49,2454.143,"If the Secretary interpreted a statute through a rule making, as delegated by Congress, it would be binding on the Commission."
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2454.143,2454.854,"No, no."
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2463.259,2471.915,"And the only forum of the Secretary's interpretation was the citation itself, no, it is not entitled to any controlling weight by the Commission."
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2475.137,2476.178,Not controlling weight.
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2492.738,2507.477,"It's our position, Justice Scalia, that again it would depend on the forum, that if... that the Secretary has acted in a fashion authorized by Congress, then the court should apply Chevron and determine whether it is entitled to controlling deference."
1990.89-1541,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2600.119,2614.718,"Well, I just read Bowen, the part that you're interested in, and it seemed to me the Court's opinion there was talking about kind of justifications offered for a regulation in the course of litigation sustaining it."
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2624.636,2628.807,"Yes it is, Justice Scalia... Justice Rehnquist... Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1990.89-1541,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2651.153,2657.427,But that is done in the context of the exercise of the Secretary's administrative authority.
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2675.548,2682.001,"I will distinguish again, Justice Kennedy, between considerable deference and controlling deference."
1990.89-1541,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2710.83,2716.694,"Mr. Faught, in Bowen... I'll try to put it again; I'm not sure you're responding to what seems to be the problem."
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2757.841,2774.964,"In this situation, Justice Scalia, the only explanation, the only thing that the Secretary has done that places the requirement she is seeking to impose here in this regulation, is the arguments of her counsel and the compliance officer writing."
1990.89-1541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2867.573,2881.774,"What do you, what would you say if... would you say we would be dead wrong if we gave some deference to the... to the National Labor Relations Board view of the National Labor Relations Act?"
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2881.774,2886.415,"It would depend on the forum, Justice White."
1990.89-1541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2886.415,2903.046,"Well, here's the... they issue a complaint and they adjudicate, and they present a view... their interpretation of this statute when it's challenged."
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2908.151,2913.244,The National Labor Relations Board was carrying out its delegated authority from Congress to adjudicate cases.
1990.89-1541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.976,2920.397,"Well, I know, but they've never issued a rule in the history."
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2920.397,2921.899,Issued a--
1990.89-1541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2921.899,2936.668,"Maybe one or two procedural rules, but they don't have to get up and have a big rule-making authority, proceeding, to announce a construction of the statute that is entitled to deference."
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2936.668,2940.92,"--They have been given adjudicatory authority by Congress, just the same as the Commission here."
1990.89-1541,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.92,2945.674,"Well, that's just... that's just exactly... that's just... that's exactly what the Secretary did in this case."
1990.89-1541,1,30248,john_d_faught,,2956.702,2960.494,"The difference here, Justice White, is that Congress has separated the functions."
1990.89-1541,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3118.667,3119.348,"--Thank you, Mr. Faught."
1990.89-1541,2,20126,clifford_m_sloan,,3121.649,3123.822,"Just a few brief points, Your Honor."
1990.89-1541,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3256.837,3258.419,"Thank you, Mr. Sloan."
