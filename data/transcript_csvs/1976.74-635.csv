1976.74-635,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,56.554,"We’ll hear arguments next in 74-635, United States against Rose Wong."
1976.74-635,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,60.146,64.176,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.74-635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,253.961,256.536,"Mr. Sheehan, I’m just wondering why you’re going through these specs?"
1976.74-635,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,263.123,268.229,"Well, the Lower Court found specifically that she did not understand the warnings regarding the privilege."
1976.74-635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,278.257,284.146,Does the case involve any issue with respect to the adequacy of the warnings pertaining to perjury?
1976.74-635,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,284.146,284.739,"No, it does not."
1976.74-635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,298.622,304.571,You think it's important as to whether or not the prosecutor deliberately misled her of simply that she was misled?
1976.74-635,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,307.73,308.699,"Well, we think that the proper --"
1976.74-635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,308.699,310.779,"She did not understand is the point, I guess rather than --"
1976.74-635,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,310.779,315.419,We think that the proper analysis is under the self Incrimination Clause as I will come to.
1976.74-635,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,337.616,340.906,I just didn’t quite understand the relevance of the details of the testimony.
1976.74-635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,344.848,367.981,"Mr. Sheehan, in view of the District Court’s findings that she didn’t understand these warnings that analysis in this case has to proceed upon the premise that the situation here was tantamount to the situation that would exist if no warnings had been given."
1976.74-635,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,367.981,370.589,"Yes, that is correct."
1976.74-635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,371.772,373.96,And that is -- so you accept that premise?
1976.74-635,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,373.96,375.311,"Yes, yes."
1976.74-635,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,387.812,395.204,Is that the predicate for your suggestion that the case could be decided on a narrow ground?
1976.74-635,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,395.204,407.815,"The predicate for our suggestion that the case can be decided on a narrow ground is because we think that it does not matter whether or not she had received warnings, effective or otherwise."
1976.74-635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,757.791,762.768,May I just ask you this before you proceed to that point?
1976.74-635,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,777.8,779.325,You are correct.
1976.74-635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,779.325,780.095,That is correct and that is --
1976.74-635,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,780.095,781.957,"Yes sir, that is correct."
1976.74-635,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,781.957,786.857,"And here, we proceed on the premise that Mrs. Wong was not?"
1976.74-635,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,786.857,788.122,That’s correct.
1976.74-635,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,978.728,980.258,What page of the appendix was that?
1976.74-635,0,46106,william_f_sheehan,,980.258,983.122,That was page 9 Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.74-635,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1020.694,1025.398,Very well.
1976.74-635,1,15486,allan_brotsky,,1029.645,1034.736,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.74-635,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1099.015,1102.234,"Well, isn’t that the issue in the next case?"
1976.74-635,1,15486,allan_brotsky,,1102.234,1113.936,"I believe it is, but I think before we can complain of what happened to Mrs. Wong, it has to be held that she had a right to be warned."
1976.74-635,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1249.153,1251.841,Isn’t there possibly another choice?
1976.74-635,1,15486,allan_brotsky,,1264.983,1290.141,"That is available to a witness that knows that that can be done, but when the prosecutor in this case asked Mrs. Wong, rather when he was asked at the hearing on the motion to suppress, what the situation was in that regard and when she was asked and he asked her, she said she thought that she had to answer every question."
1976.74-635,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1334.345,1347.515,And the District Court elected to accept her understanding at that stage as against her understanding in the questions that appear earlier in -- for the Grand Jury?
1976.74-635,1,15486,allan_brotsky,,1347.515,1349.324,Her understanding at what stage sir?
1976.74-635,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1349.324,1356.891,The scope of understanding that as he relied on her without an interpreter (Voice Overlap).
1976.74-635,1,15486,allan_brotsky,,1356.891,1361.657,"There was an interpreter in the hearing before the District Court, clearly there was."
1976.74-635,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1369.053,1383.234,But your position is that the questions and answers set forth on pages 3 and 4 of the appendix are now all foreclosed because the District Court may define it which has been affirmed by the Court of Appeals?
1976.74-635,1,15486,allan_brotsky,,1383.234,1384.23,Yes.
1976.74-635,2,46106,william_f_sheehan,,2953.685,2955.862,I do not Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.74-635,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2955.862,2957.048,"Very well, thank you gentlemen."
