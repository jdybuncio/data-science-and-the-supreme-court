2012.11-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.32,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-465, Johnson v. Williams."
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,8.537,11.622,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,52.349,72.31,"What happens when there is a challenge to the admission of evidence on a state law ground on a Confrontation Clause ground, and all the state court does is grapple with the evidentiary rule, but it's self evident that the Confrontation Clause is based on a different theory?"
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,81.249,93.24,"Your Honor, we would assume that there the state court, through its denial of relief, did adjudicate the presented Confrontation Clause claim."
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,104.198,125.545,"Am I to make that assumption when, before our line of cases in this area, state courts generally had held that if hearsay was admissible under their evidentiary rules, that that was the end of their Confrontation Clause challenge?"
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,139.371,150.678,"In that situation, if the state court rule was consonant with the Confrontation Clause, we would have certainly an adjudication of the Confrontation Clause."
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,150.678,154.13,"Well, let's assume it's not after our -- we render our decision."
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,154.13,166.788,"And if it were -- if it were different, we would still hold that in that situation, as this Court -- in relying on Richter, in that situation it would be more of a summary denial on the confrontation analysis."
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,166.788,168.221,If one--
2012.11-465,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,168.221,175.81,"Well, we can continue and probably should talk about this broad theory that you want us to adopt."
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,244.704,263.018,"Yes, Your Honor, we agree that in our situation it just so happened to be that the state standard also encompassed this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence because it was citing U.S. v. Wood, and it was citing Smith v. Phillips among the -- the Sixth Amendment cases."
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,286.467,287.15,--Irrebuttably?
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,287.15,301.577,"--Your Honor, in -- we have suggested that -- that it can be rebutted by a plain statement, if the state court says that it is not reaching it or, more particularly, if a state court imposes a procedural bar."
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,301.577,303.76,I see exceptions to that already.
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,312.432,313.348,Yes--
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,313.348,321.019,"So you really can't say in that situation that you can assume they reached the second, can you?"
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,321.019,326.423,"--Well, Your Honor, I posit that those Strickland cases are different."
2012.11-465,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,361.163,361.663,"Well, suppose that the--"
2012.11-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,361.663,366.567,"Ms. Brenan, we are straying pretty far from this case."
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,430.49,446.535,"Yes, Your Honor, I completely agree with the view that here Williams did present a completely dependent Federal claim; and, therefore, the State's analysis -- the State court's analysis would have fully adjudicated that."
2012.11-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,462.98,473.836,"The court of appeals, whose decision we're reviewing, understood the Respondent to present a separate State claim and a separate Federal claim, correct?"
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,473.836,474.871,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2012.11-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,474.871,476.954,"That's the predicate to the whole question we have before us, right?"
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,476.954,477.823,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2012.11-465,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,479.506,480.942,Let me give you this hypothetical.
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,518.798,521.667,"--Yes, Your Honor, in that situation we would."
2012.11-465,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,564.262,568.048,Why is it necessary to go so far as to require a plain statement?
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,596.365,609.708,"Sure, Your Honor, but the reason why there should be a plain statement is because it's long been held that in order to rebut that presumption of regularity, you need clear evidence."
2012.11-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.587,646.881,"Well, I assume that in -- in many cases, especially capital cases, one could argue for years over whether -- whether, in fact, there was enough indication that the court did not consider it or not, right?"
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,650.416,652.535,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2012.11-465,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,657.772,673.715,"--Well, I suppose -- I suppose the broader rule, if you took $28.52 out of the State's judicial budget and bought them all a stamp which just says, we have considered and rejected all constitutional claims, then there would be no problem?"
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,673.715,678.102,"--Your Honor, they really do that when they say “ affirmed ” at the end of the decision."
2012.11-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,688.041,696.397,Any idea based on your experience how many separate claims are typically raised in a capital case of this sort?
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,696.397,699.183,If -- this was not a capital case--
2012.11-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,699.183,699.749,I'm sorry.
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,699.749,701.051,--but an LWOP case.
2012.11-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,720.862,730.218,"There would be a lot of good debate over whether it was presented clearly enough, is presenting it in two sentences enough to require the court to answer it."
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,748.532,757.137,"All of the circuit courts basically have a rule close to the one announced by Justice Alito, don't they?"
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,757.137,762.875,"--Your Honor, if they happen not to mention one particular claim?"
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,762.875,777.116,"All of them have essentially a presumption that's rebutted by some form of evidence, except for perhaps the Eleventh and this circuit that have a clear, almost irrebuttable presumption."
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,780.335,784.622,"The Eleventh Circuit and, I believe, the Sixth Circuit as well."
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,784.622,787.157,But it's not as absolute as the Eleventh.
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,787.157,790.859,True that the Eleventh Circuit has a broader rule.
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,791.709,796.529,"I have a -- you know, I mean, for every rule you're going to find an exception that abuses it."
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,809.67,813.391,"--I don't have that figure off the top of my head, Your Honor."
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,813.391,819.128,"Would you be willing to accept that it's -- in relationship to the total granted, it's very, very small?"
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,819.128,825.032,"Yes, I believe that is true, that there is a small number of granting of petitions, yes."
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,825.032,828.901,"So whatever the abuse of the system is, it hasn't halted justice."
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,828.901,842.225,"Well, Your Honor, the thing is that -- and I think that Justice Scalia has adverted to this -- is that if we were to require only an indication, it would create a situation where there would be all this litigation."
2012.11-465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,861.972,864.674,"Well, why can't they just do what we used to do?"
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,922.695,930.849,"--Justice Breyer, I would disagree with -- with that proposal because it is in the end just -- could become reflexive--"
2012.11-465,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,930.849,931.801,"Well, anything."
2012.11-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.772,970.51,Doesn't the -- doesn't the word denied at the end of the order say the same thing?
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,971.876,972.226,--No.
2012.11-465,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,972.226,974.545,"--all of the points made, and we have denied them."
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,1007.516,1010.235,I think we could be arguing the same problem.
2012.11-465,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1021.672,1024.191,"Ms. Brenan, can I ask you what you mean by a plain statement?"
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,1048.389,1061.149,"A plain statement would be a procedural bar, or if there were -- a court were to say, we're not, for some reason, going the reach the constitutional claim, that they really need to say it out loud."
2012.11-465,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1064.434,1065.701,"Yes, I don't know why they would say that either."
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,1072.021,1080.026,"No, Your Honor, I would disagree, because there is the possibility of having -- having the procedural bar."
2012.11-465,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1080.026,1091.251,"Well, what if -- what if the brief raises five arguments, and the opinion says the appellant has raised four arguments, is that a plain statement that the fifth -- the fifth argument was overlooked?"
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,1091.251,1097.655,I would say that it possibly could be if it were in that situation.
2012.11-465,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1112.165,1112.865,That's not a plain statement?
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,1124.655,1131.476,"Possibly it could be, Your Honor, but here we don't -- we don't have that situation."
2012.11-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1131.476,1136.697,May I ask you about the underlying claim here?
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,1145.219,1146.153,Correct.
2012.11-465,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1146.636,1160.413,"And the possibility of getting rid of the juror, the hold-out juror, in this way is -- is really troublesome."
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,1180.226,1189.165,"Well, Your Honor, the thing is that here we have a trial court who is looking at this juror and makes the determination that the juror is biased."
2012.11-465,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1201.187,1211.994,"Well, I have to -- I mean, this takes us into the merits, which is really interesting, but I -- we probably shouldn't go there, but, as long as we're there for a minute, I agree with Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,1238.229,1260.742,"Well, Justice Kennedy, it's a situation where, through the voir dire, what comes out is not that we're trying to get -- that the trial judge is feeling to get rid of this juror because he's the hold-out juror, but it's because through the voir dire he determines that this juror is biased, and that is the bias, and that's what makes it different."
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1260.742,1263.694,That the person is not guilty is a bias?
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,1263.694,1266.046,"No, Your Honor, that's certainly not it."
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1287.475,1302.219,"That -- that's -- that may be your strongest point, but most of what he said was basically this is a murder case, and the evidence has to be beyond a reasonable doubt, and I think it has to be clear enough for me to be convinced."
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,1304.721,1308.325,"That is not a biased juror, but that's what he said to the court."
2012.11-465,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1328.052,1339.26,"I must say that, like Justice Kennedy, I'm deeply troubled when trial judges intrude in the deliberative processes of juries."
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,1361.793,1372.231,"Well, Your Honor, I believe in this situation it's one where the judge was presented with possible misconduct, and therefore had to do something."
2012.11-465,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1395.781,1404.703,"Could I go back, Ms. Brenan, to your basic theory, because I guess I'm not sure I understand what you're arguing now."
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,1446.13,1459.373,"What we're saying is that, at the very least, in our type of situation where -- where the court discusses the alleged error, there is an adjudication on the merits, but that plays into the larger and broader rule."
2012.11-465,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1459.373,1461.739,"Well, why does your theory make any sense?"
2012.11-465,0,41075,stephanie_brenan,,1483.739,1492.26,"Yes, in -- especially if you're going to look at the state courts, which are -- must decide both the Federal and state questions."
2012.11-465,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1543.193,1543.693,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1548.097,1550.966,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1583.27,1589.608,"Well, just the way you phrased it, if it addresses the bulk of the claims, under your theory it has to address every claim, correct?"
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1589.608,1597.512,"If -- under my theory, if there is a Federal claim that's overlooked or omitted, then the inference--"
2012.11-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1597.512,1598.014,"No, no."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1600.314,1600.982,--Correct.
2012.11-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1600.982,1602.732,Not analyzed in the opinion.
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1602.732,1603.366,Correct.
2012.11-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1612.956,1627.216,"You agree that if -- this was raised when your friend was at the lectern -- if the court at the end said, not only denied, but said, I considered all other arguments not addressed, denied, then you have no case, correct?"
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1627.216,1627.666,Correct.
2012.11-465,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1640.607,1646.428,That would mean that if you prevail it would just become routine.
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1655.716,1669.46,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, as Justice Breyer was saying, we, and as my friend was arguing, you know, there is regularity and we do -- it's fair to assume that a judge who is looking at an appellate court brief is going to do their job and look at the briefs."
2012.11-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1669.46,1672.662,"Well, you're not willing to assume that when the judge says “ denied ”."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1676.53,1677.316,Right--
2012.11-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1677.316,1681.434,It seems to me if you give them the presumption of regularity in the one case you ought to give it to them in the other.
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1681.434,1694.758,"--And I don't think the presumption of regularity should apply here, just as this Court in Smith v. Digmon looked at the opinion and looked at what was argued and said: All the courts below made a mistake; it was fairly exhausted."
2012.11-465,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1724.963,1726.897,--Was it fairly presented here?
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1726.897,1728.332,It was fairly--
2012.11-465,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1728.332,1733.735,Given that the argument was abuse of discretion?
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1733.735,1737.704,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it was fairly presented."
2012.11-465,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1750.095,1752.447,"Of course, again this is fact-specific to the case."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1791.422,1801.88,"Justice Kennedy, I'm glad you brought that up because I do want to address your concern on that, and it's Dye -- this Court's opinion in Dye takes care of the intertwined argument."
2012.11-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1812.836,1813.77,"Yes, but that's the state court."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1824.71,1829.578,"If that were the case, then we would have a different case."
2012.11-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1836.934,1842.855,And were they under any obligation to agree with Federal courts of appeal as to the interpretation of the Sixth Amendment?
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1842.855,1843.905,--They were not.
2012.11-465,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1843.905,1860.466,"Well, they -- isn't the -- isn't the reasonable reading of Cleveland that we're adopting this rule, this is our State rule, it's based on a very broadly worded State statute, it is informed by our understanding of the Sixth Amendment, and we disagree."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1867.453,1868.053,Correct.
2012.11-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1878.845,1879.578,Didn't the -- I'm sorry.
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1879.578,1881.047,But this case isn't Cleveland.
2012.11-465,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1883.297,1884.665,I'm not sure how you can say that.
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1921.422,1932.479,--There -- the problem with that determination is that there's the Federal standard on what is -- what the Sixth Amendment standard is.
2012.11-465,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1935.531,1936.814,That's a different question.
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1958.38,1966.485,--This gets to the -- my friend's argument about how their argument is upside down.
2012.11-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1995.37,1996.522,Well -- I'm sorry.
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,1997.072,2012.364,"--Instead you look at Brown, Thomas, and Symington, and they say that if the juror's views on the merits of the case have been expressed and the juror might be kicked off because of -- which is exactly what happened here -- kicked off because of his views on the case, then the Sixth Amendment has been violated."
2012.11-465,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2012.364,2014.899,What Supreme Court precedent commands that result?
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2014.899,2022.22,"Supreme Court precedent doesn't command it, but because it's de novo review and because -- because it's a quid pro quo."
2012.11-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2043.051,2043.403,"No, the--"
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2043.403,2044.836,--The main event is supposed to be in State court.
2012.11-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2047.438,2061.53,"--The discussion you've been having with Justice Sotomayor and Justice Alito highlights another problem with your approach, is that the court is going to have to decide in every case whether or not State law is coterminous with Federal law."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2082.694,2085.146,And it's not because this is the rare case--
2012.11-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2085.146,2085.512,I'm sorry?
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2085.512,2085.979,--I'm sorry.
2012.11-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2086.912,2087.379,"Oh, it's not."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2087.379,2098.469,"Mr. Chief Justice, this case is a rare case where, looking at the opinion, we can't tell if they adjudicated the claim on the merits."
2012.11-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2109.261,2111.796,Except in a case like Harrington v. Richter.
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2111.796,2129.924,"Harrington v. Richter created a very simple, straightforward, and appropriate presumption, because when you have a unexplained order it makes sense that, in that context, that they have adjudicated everything on the merits."
2012.11-465,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2142.565,2149.469,"Well, I may be just repeating some of my colleagues here, but I think if you take this opinion at face value, it cuts against you."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2182.725,2184.209,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-465,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2195.883,2198.585,"You're quite right, it does not adopt the consensus standard."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2222.684,2224.719,--And so two points on that.
2012.11-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2288.995,2294.197,The -- section 1089 is very broadly worded; isn't that right?
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2297.684,2301.802,Section 1089 -- I don't--
2012.11-465,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2301.802,2302.652,All right.
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2323.383,2335.357,"--In People v. Collins, the California Supreme Court said that 1089 is a rule of efficiency so that courts can efficiently deal with possible juror bias."
2012.11-465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2371.583,2377.469,"--a minute, please, to Justice Kennedy's question about page 104(a)."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2436.758,2437.608,The problem--
2012.11-465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2437.608,2445.631,"The remaining 14 lines do consist of state law too; but, I mean, how can we say they didn't consider the Federal issue?"
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2445.631,2451.351,--Because Nesler doesn't talk one iota about kicking off the holdout juror.
2012.11-465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2451.351,2452.985,"No, they didn't quote -- Nesler doesn't."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2464.758,2467.794,And that Federal case has nothing to do with kicking off a holdout juror.
2012.11-465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2467.794,2468.979,"Well, maybe it doesn't."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2491.993,2496.713,"You hit the nail right on the head, Justice Breyer, because they are taking about impartiality."
2012.11-465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2501.367,2502.617,For Constitutional purposes.
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2506.419,2512.406,The bottom line is they did not apply the Federal rule.
2012.11-465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2520.912,2536.255,"Well, then your claim over in the Ninth Circuit is not that they didn't consider it, but that, rather, they considered it, but no reasonable juror could reach -- no reasonable jurist could reach the conclusion that they reached on the issue."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2551.55,2558.804,"Respectfully, Justice Breyer, they don't -- they're just talking about a definition of one word, of what actual bias is."
2012.11-465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2558.804,2560.572,Which happens to be the issue in this case.
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2560.572,2578.367,"The issue in this case is can you kick off a juror who has expressed 10 or 15 times -- and this came out right out of the bat -- the foreperson was called out, asked about some notes and said, Juror No. 6, 10 or 15 times has said, I don't think there's sufficient evidence."
2012.11-465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2612.522,2612.972,No.
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2669.71,2677.364,"I would respectfully request that, read -- that reading this whole thing in context, it's clear that the California Court of Appeals is dealing with 1089."
2012.11-465,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2689.838,2703.947,"Is this -- is this a holding that the Sixth Amendment requires you to keep a biased juror as long as the juror says, I have doubts about the sufficiency of the evidence?"
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2703.947,2704.447,--No.
2012.11-465,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2705.133,2706.099,"Now, answer my question."
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2709.585,2710.235,--No.
2012.11-465,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2710.235,2711.62,All right.
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2732.284,2732.767,"Yeah, right."
2012.11-465,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2747.376,2751.412,Did the California court find the juror was biased?
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2751.412,2752.028,--Yes.
2012.11-465,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2774.442,2775.508,That was one of the things.
2012.11-465,1,33859,kurt_d_hermansen,,2816.552,2829.778,"--But the threshold issue is when the foreperson, at the very, very, very beginning, says, Juror No. 6, 10 or 15 times has said he doesn't think there is sufficient evidence, all questioning should have stopped at that point, because there was no indication of bias."
2012.11-465,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2885.031,2886.498,"Thank you, counsel."
