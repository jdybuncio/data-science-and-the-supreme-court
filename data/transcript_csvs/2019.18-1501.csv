2019.18-1501,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.64,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1501, Liu versus the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Rapawy."
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,7.64,19.16,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: SEC disgorgement orders compel a payment to the Treasury as a consequence for violation of a public law."
2019.18-1501,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,144.2,172.36,"Mr. Rapawy, you started out by saying Kokesh labeled this a penalty and equity doesn't enforce penalties and that's it. But Kokesh was in a specific context. It said, for statute of limitations purposes, it is a penalty."
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,269.04,273.96,"Justice Ginsburg, I certainly agree that this Court reserved this question in Kokesh in Footnote 3."
2019.18-1501,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,315.92,326.84,Why is it -- is that so? Is it not an equitable principle that no one should be allowed to profit from his own wrong? That's not an equitable principle?
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,326.84,329.56,"That is certainly an equitable principle, Your Honor."
2019.18-1501,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,354.08,371.96,But is your argument that disgorgement is never possible or that disgorgement has been interpreted too broadly by the courts? Suppose it were limited to net profits and suppose every effort was made to return the money to the victims of the fraud.
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,377.52,395.16,"I think it still would not, Your Honor, and the reason is that the -- the traditional form of equitable relief to which the government has drawn an analogy is the accounting, and an accounting did have those characteristics that Your Honor has stated. But it also had the characteristic that it was typically available only in cases involving a breach of fiduciary duty."
2019.18-1501,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,413.8,416.0,"What -- what do you mean by ""ancillary""?"
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,416.0,429.92,Ancillary jurisdiction meaning that once a court had some other independent ground of equitable jurisdiction over the case -- and this is true of the old patent and copyright cases -- it might then to go on -- go on to award an accounting in order to afford complete relief.
2019.18-1501,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,429.92,433.08,How about the fraud cases in which it was granted?
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,433.08,447.28,"So I believe that the fraud cases -- and we do address this in our -- in our reply, Your Honor -- I believe the fraud cases all -- that the professors -- I assume you're referring to the fraud cases cited in Professor Laycock's brief, and I think those all involve fiduciary relationships."
2019.18-1501,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,447.28,450.36,But let me -- let me go back to that answer you gave.
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,507.76,522.6,"So I have -- I have two answers to that, Justice Sotomayor, if I may. And one -- the first answer is that precisely because of the complexities that your question recognizes, the better course would be to say this remedy that the SEC has sought here, SEC disgorgement, which does not have a historical parallel, does not exist."
2019.18-1501,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,523.56,535.16,"So why is it okay in the administrative process and in all the other laws where you say disgorgement is referenced? You're making an argument that there should never, ever be disgorgement --"
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,535.16,535.6,"Not at all, Your Honor."
2019.18-1501,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,535.6,540.48,"-- in any statute, because it's undefined in some way outside the common law?"
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,540.48,566.16,"Not at all, Your Honor. I am saying that in those con -- when Congress says disgorgement, then it is the Court's task to figure out what does disgorgement mean. And perhaps in doing so, it would look at that history and say, well, it would -- you know, the money has to go back to the individuals and it can be no more than -- than the amount of the gains and so forth. But, in a case where Congress has not said disgorgement, and they did not say so here, I think the Court should hesitate to read it into a general provision for equitable relief."
2019.18-1501,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,566.16,566.68,If we --
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,566.68,567.8,And my --
2019.18-1501,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,567.8,568.64,"Keep going, sorry."
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,568.64,579.16,And my second point in connection with that is that the reason not to read equitable relief to encompass ancillary jurisdiction is the same one this Court gave in Great-West.
2019.18-1501,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,593.92,606.2,"If we were not to agree with you on this last point, what do you then say to Justice Alito's two conditions, net profits, returned to victims?"
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,606.2,628.36,"If you were not to agree with me on that point, then those are the -- the primary inconsistencies that we've identified, we've established with regard to historical remedy. I do think that the remedy that was applied here, that the SEC sought here, was -- was clearly a penalty and clearly inconsistent with Kokesh and that the -- there -- there is an important background principle that --"
2019.18-1501,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,628.36,634.84,"And that's because it was not limited to net profits and was not returned to the victims, at least not necessarily?"
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,634.84,635.48,Yes.
2019.18-1501,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,641.0,641.24,Right.
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,641.56,645.28,-- Your Honor has questioned that point.
2019.18-1501,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,645.28,645.48,Yeah.
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,645.48,645.8,And --
2019.18-1501,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,645.8,648.68,You may be right or wrong on that point.
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,650.36,650.68,Okay.
2019.18-1501,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,650.8,651.88,-- just to be clear.
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,651.88,694.2,"-- analytically, Your Honor, the point is -- the point is separate. I do think that there are substantive reasons for limiting the remedy to the fiduciary duty as well, and that goes -- and this is discussed in the amicus brief by Professors Bray and Smith that talk about the origins of the fiduciary or, rather, the accounting remedy, and -- and explain that it is -- it is in some respect equity forcing the fiduciary to do what the fiduciary should have been doing in the first place, which is to keep -- keep track of the property that person is holding for someone else, to make no profits on it, and to remit to that person any -- any profits they had gained. Those are substantive duties that do not apply to everyone who is subject to the securities laws."
2019.18-1501,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,694.2,710.48,"But how -- how realistic do you think it is to assume that when Congress used this term ""equitable relief,"" Congress meant to incorporate every curlicue of old equity jurisprudence?"
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,710.48,737.52,"My best answer to that, Your Honor, is that this Court had given the phrase ""equitable relief"" in ERISA that meaning six months before Congress passed this statute. So, if Congress had wanted to know exactly what ""equitable relief"" meant in the most recent precedent of this Court, in a statute that I think has some similar structure -- structural issues to this one, and I'd like to get to those, they would have gone to Great-West and they would have said, huh, okay, this -- they will look to history if we use these words. If we don't want them to look to history, we should use other words."
2019.18-1501,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,755.32,762.32,"But, Mr. Rapawy, Congress acted against a backdrop in which the SEC was routinely seeking disgorgement, didn't it?"
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,762.32,794.56,"It did, Your Honor. However, I do not think that that supports the government's position here for two reasons. The first is that those cases, the cases that form that backdrop were not interpreting the text, not interpreting the words, and so the prior construction canon by its terms does not apply. The second and perhaps more substantive reason is that the decisions in the court -- in the circuit courts were not, although there was -- there was a consensus that the SEC could get something accounted as disgorgement, there was not a consensus as to what the -- what that disgorgement was."
2019.18-1501,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,855.52,861.88,"Well, that may raise the qualifications that Justice Alito was talking about on what the disgorgement remedy would entail."
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,875.08,900.6,"I don't think it is, Your Honor, because I think it would leave too many -- it would essentially leave this Court in the position of deciding how the traditional remedy, which would not by its terms apply here, the government agrees in its brief that SEC disgorgement is a substantial departure from historical norms. How do you craft that historical remedy in light of all the policies under the securities acts to -- to make sense here and apply here? And I think that should be done by the legislature in the first instance."
2019.18-1501,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,900.6,908.0,"I'm sorry, but they don't do it when they gave the SEC administrative authority for disgorgement."
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,946.32,951.44,"Well, Your Honor, with respect, I think in -- in the -- in the administrative context, they did."
2019.18-1501,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1051.72,1059.68,"But I believe you agreed with me that it's an equitable principle, that no one should profit from his or her own wrong."
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1072.64,1096.44,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but I would say that in -- I would refer back to this Court's decision in Livingston, which talked specifically about what counts as punishment in terms of the equitable rule. And in that case, it's -- it's one of the older patent cases, the special master had imposed a remedy, a -- that -- that effectively was what we probably would call a damages remedy now."
2019.18-1501,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1160.92,1165.0,Would it be -- I thought there were efforts to get the money to the investors.
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1185.52,1187.44,"They -- they do that in some cases, Your Honor."
2019.18-1501,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1195.12,1209.4,"Well, suppose we were to reject your broad argument and focus the question on -- on this issue and also on the net profits issue. What constraints do you think the SEC is under?"
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1209.4,1210.6,"I'm sorry, Your Honor. Constraints?"
2019.18-1501,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1210.6,1237.72,"On the -- on the question of giving money back to the investors, I think Justice Ginsburg raised the issue about maybe you can't find them, they're not identifiable, there are too many of them. How -- what -- what do you think that if -- if we -- if we said, you know, it's an equitable principle that the money should go back to the investors if possible, what does that mean exactly that the SEC has to do?"
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1237.72,1250.48,"I would say that if you were to take that position and disagree with my primary argument, it would -- then the -- the rule should be, if you're giving the money back to the investors, then you can take it and not otherwise, because if you're not giving it back to the investors, then it's just a punishment."
2019.18-1501,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1250.48,1255.64,"So not otherwise, even if like you -- you've tried to find the investors and you can't?"
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1255.64,1260.48,"Well, I mean, I don't know that there's any way in which the Court could workably police how hard they're trying, Your Honor."
2019.18-1501,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1260.64,1265.8,"Well, you know, make -- make good-faith efforts; make, you know, diligent efforts."
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1269.56,1274.64,"I -- I mean, Your Honor could certainly write that a decision -- in a decision."
2019.18-1501,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1283.68,1284.0,Counsel --
2019.18-1501,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1284.0,1284.24,How --
2019.18-1501,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1284.24,1285.36,"-- why -- why -- oh, I'm sorry, Chief."
2019.18-1501,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1285.36,1307.52,"Excuse me. How hard is that? Presumably, the investors would want money, and I -- I suppose these things could be done, you know, secretly or -- but, if -- if the SEC is engaged in a proceeding like this with respect to investments, I would assume that investors should be pretty easy to find if there's money available."
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1307.52,1315.08,"I -- I guess what I would say, Your Honor, is that the -- the -- in many cases that they currently use the power, they don't even believe that it's appropriate to return the money to investors."
2019.18-1501,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1351.12,1370.32,"Counsel, in -- in -- in equity and kind of paralleled in our class action practice today, we do police the efforts of the defendant to find and return money to the investors that he or she's defrauded."
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1393.16,1400.36,"I guess that would go -- I would -- I'm not saying you couldn't draw an analogy to the class action cases, Justice Gorsuch."
2019.18-1501,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1401.76,1406.72,"And they come from equity and traditional principles of equity, right? I mean, they're drawn from that?"
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1406.72,1410.6,"Under traditional principles of equity, they couldn't recover because there's no fiduciary here, Your Honor, but --"
2019.18-1501,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1410.6,1411.92,I understand your argument.
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1411.92,1441.24,"But -- but in the class action context as a workable matter, you could, but I really think that is getting to the point where the Court is creating a new regulatory scheme where one doesn't currently exist to save a remedy that was originally created on the basis of circuit court decisions that the government doesn't really defend anymore and that the best course would be to say: This remedy that the agency sought here does not exist, and if -- if they think that they need this remedy, they should go to Congress for it."
2019.18-1501,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1441.24,1450.6,"And may I ask you about your net profits rule, a similar kind of question? I mean, what does the SEC, in your view, have to deduct?"
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1450.6,1475.52,"So, at a minimum, they have to start from the right place, which is they have to start from the gains to the individual defendant rather than what they did in this case, which is starting from the losses to investors. And then I believe the standard that this Court -- if you're -- if you're going to go by the accounting standard that's applied in -- in the old patent cases, you would say it's you calculate the profits as a manufacturer calculates the profits of his -- of their own business. So it would be certainly legitimate expenses."
2019.18-1501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1493.28,1508.6,"If the leases in the machinery was just a printout, only used for more fraudulent stuff, would you deduct it then? I mean, what they did is they had fliers going around saying invest in my fraudulent gold company, the equivalent thereof."
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1508.6,1509.84,"Well, I suppose that --"
2019.18-1501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1509.84,1511.2,Then you'd deduct it?
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1511.2,1511.6,I'm sorry.
2019.18-1501,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1511.6,1513.16,Is that legitimate?
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1513.16,1532.52,"I think there may be a certain point at which you could say -- I mean, there's -- you could imagine a Ponzi scheme, Your Honor, and in the case of the Ponzi scheme, okay, it's all tainted. But I think that the decision below did not give the kind of consideration you would need to give before reaching that kind of conclusion about these defendants, where --"
2019.18-1501,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1532.52,1534.16,You -- finish that sentence.
2019.18-1501,0,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,1534.16,1536.6,"I'll wrap it up there, Your Honor."
2019.18-1501,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1536.6,1538.56,You may not want to -- okay.
2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1541.68,1560.6,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by discussing the significance of Kokesh, and, as some of the questions have illuminated, the Court in Kokesh said that SE -- disgorgement in SEC cases was a penalty for purposes of a statute of limitations provision."
2019.18-1501,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1840.6,1898.72,"But your -- your position is, if I understand it correctly, follow whatever the common law rule was with respect to calculating net profits, return it to investors, but that you're also a victim and so that you -- you could take the money ahead of investors, that you can keep the leftover amounts? What -- what is your position with respect to that broader question of who gets the money? Why is it the Treasury? It's not the SEC getting the money. And one could see if -- potentially an argument that if the SEC got the money, it could then spend it on protecting investors, but if the Treasury's getting it -- and I know you're going to say money is fungible -- but, if the Treasury is getting it, we don't really know if it's being used to help investors."
2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1898.72,1901.56,Let me say three or four things in -- in response to that.
2019.18-1501,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1936.96,1947.12,"Before you -- before you leave that, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I -- I thought last time around in Kokesh that the representation from the government was different on that score and that sometimes you do and sometimes you don't."
2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1947.12,1950.44,"I mean, sometimes it is done and sometimes it is not done."
2019.18-1501,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1974.44,1977.72,Is it sometimes not done just because it's not done?
2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1977.72,1979.72,I -- I can't rule out that possibility.
2019.18-1501,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1991.8,1996.72,Would the government have any difficulty with a rule that the money should be returned to investors where feasible?
2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1996.72,2017.0,"I would say if -- if that is couched as a general equitable principle; that is, the court is sitting as a court of equity, there would be nothing wrong with a district judge in an individual case saying unless you can persuade me that it is infeasible to return this money to investors, I am going to order that that be done."
2019.18-1501,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2018.4,2020.96,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt from Justice Sotomayor's question."
2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2021.6,2022.24,No.
2019.18-1501,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2070.4,2096.76,"Why? If -- if -- if the statute says that equitable relief that may be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors, do we have to say here and should we say or not say here that that means if it's not feasible to return it to investors, that it's for the benefit of investors to give it to the SEC?"
2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2096.76,2117.76,"I -- that statutory language, we think, and I want to explain why, refers to measures that will benefit the investor community generally, not necessarily the particular individual victims. And I'd give the following reasons. The first is that language applies to equitable relief generally under Section 21(d)(5)."
2019.18-1501,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2135.28,2139.48,"But if we can get back to the money, which is where we're at, not injunctive relief."
2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2156.4,2156.92,I -- I -- I --
2019.18-1501,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2156.92,2161.68,"I take that to be her point or her question to you, and -- and I would appreciate an answer to that."
2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2161.68,2171.2,I -- I -- I don't -- I don't see a problem with saying it is appropriate or necessary only if it is forwarded to investors if it is feasible to do that.

Because the first time you answered it, you said it would be appropriate for a district court to say that. And I think Justice Gorsuch then followed up and Justice Sotomayor."
2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2211.56,2215.4,I -- I -- I wouldn't have a problem with that.

2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2257.64,2260.52,"The other thing I wanted to say that I -- I think is -- I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.18-1501,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2260.52,2290.24,"Well, you -- you were talking about the administrative authority to order disgorgement, but you said that an admin -- an ALJ can't do what a court could do, as it did in this case, order an asset freeze. But couldn't you take the administrative decision and ask a court to enforce that decision by freezing assets?"
2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2290.24,2322.96,"I mean, we sometime -- we sometimes do, after issuing an administrative order, go to a court for enforcement if the defendant is not obeying, and I think one of the reasons that the SEC sometimes elects to proceed in court originally is if we have doubts about the defendant's compliance and we think we're going to be in court anyway, then we might want to save a step and go there first. I guess part of our response to the arguments about could we do this administratively are to the effect that it wouldn't be entirely unworkable."
2019.18-1501,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2595.48,2615.36,"What is your answer -- what is your response to the argument, if I have it right, that in equity, the closest thing is restitution, and in Great-West, the majority said: Well, restitution was an equitable remedy when it was a case in equity, but it was a legal remedy when it was a case in law?"
2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2615.36,2619.76,"Well, I think what Great-West was dealing with specifically was --"
2019.18-1501,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2619.76,2620.48,A different thing.
2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2625.68,2627.84,Let me say two things in response to that.
2019.18-1501,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2818.32,2830.48,"What do you do with the Ninth Circuit saying there were no legitimate expenses to -- to deduct, to arrive at net profit?"
2019.18-1501,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2830.48,2850.24,"I -- they -- they allowed us a very small deduction for the amount that remained in the corporate account and could be distributed to investors, and, certainly, that would always be an appropriate deduction, any -- any benefit that the investors received at the end of the day. But there were basically two categories of expenses that the Ninth Circuit and the district court didn't allow."

2019.18-1501,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3114.68,3131.04,What -- what about the statutes that assume the availability of disgorgement? Those statutes would have no work to do if -- if the Court can order disgorgement absent express statutory authority?
2019.18-1501,2,63231,gregory_g_rapawy,,3131.04,3135.4,"We tried to show in our opening brief, Your Honor, that -- that most of those statutes do have some work to do."
