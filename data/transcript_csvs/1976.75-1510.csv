1976.75-1510,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.935,"We’ll hear arguments next in number 1510, Weatherford against Bursey."
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,48.962,53.627,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,494.385,499.08,"The State Solicitor that was here, a county or state official?"
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,499.08,512.208,"He is a circuit solicitor and the particular circuit he serves has two counties in it. South Carolina has 16 different circuits varying in size, from two counties to five."
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,512.208,513.198,He was the prosecutor though?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,513.198,514.424,He was the prosecutor.
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,514.424,519.768,More like of a county prosecutor or district attorney except his jurisdiction was two counties?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,519.768,521.145,That’s correct.
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,524.984,527.457,I just want to be sure about I understood what his office was.
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,527.457,528.656,Yes.
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,589.87,592.689,"And Bursey is now out on -- released on bond, pending trial?"
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,592.689,597.291,"He was released on appeal bond, yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,597.291,598.025,An appeal bond?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,598.025,600.292,"Not an appeal bond, I beg your pardon, but on bond --"
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,600.292,600.716,Pending trial.
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,600.716,601.147,-- to prepare for trial.
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,601.147,602.219,-- before trial.
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,602.219,603.781,"Was on bond I think $12,500.00."
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,603.781,607.134,And Weatherford also purportedly out on bond or --?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,607.134,609.061,Purportedly out on bond.
1976.75-1510,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,863.971,866.975,"Let me interrupt you in just a moment, Mr. Coleman, if I may."
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,886.606,886.916,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-1510,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,886.916,888.455,You’re going to get to that.
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,888.455,888.635,Yes.
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1022.015,1044.272,"The only technical difference as I remember was that the Court as such set aside the convictions and Mr. Justice Harlan and I would not have done so, and would’ve allowed the trial judge to make a determination of whether or not there was any taint and allow him in his discretion to set aside the convictions if he found that there was taint, but I think you’re right"
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1044.272,1047.665,"That an invalid (Inaudible) , yes sir."
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1047.665,1063.076,But in any event -- at most that was even what the Court did was for a set aside of the convictions and then for a determination of how much if any taint there had been of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1063.076,1071.594,That is exactly our point that Black and O’Brien are simply not support of the --
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1071.594,1072.642,For any per se rule?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1072.642,1073.705,For any per se rule.
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1075.232,1082.656,"Because it had been conceded that there had been electronic surveillance in the one case, did both cases involve electronic surveillance?"
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1082.656,1090.209,I think one case involved the intrusion of a police agent of some description.
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1090.209,1093.473,And the other was electronic surveillance in one of the Washington DC Hotels.
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1093.473,1105.997,"I believe that the Black case was involved in electronic surveillance yes sir, and of course, I think both Coplon and Caldwell did involve electronic surveillance cases."
1976.75-1510,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1145.308,1153.207,What’s the governmental interest here in having this man sit down at the conference between lawyer and client?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1153.207,1162.253,"Justice Marshall, we do not claim that as being a legitimate state interest."
1976.75-1510,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1163.586,1164.977,"Well, how do you defend it?"
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1164.977,1175.869,We say that the maintenance of the identity of the agent Weatherford or the maintenance of his cover was the legitimate state interest.
1976.75-1510,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1175.869,1182.891,And that’s sufficient to override a federal constitutional interest?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1182.891,1186.254,"Well, we think of course the federal constitutional issue is there, but we say that --"
1976.75-1510,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1186.254,1195.594,"Couldn’t they have said that you may maintain your cover, and just pick a fight with him and say you don’t want to talk to him anymore?"
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1195.594,1196.802,"That of course could’ve been done, sir."
1976.75-1510,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1196.802,1197.61,That’s right.
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1204.523,1210.639,"However, as you say, it is our position that this was necessary in those circumstances to --"
1976.75-1510,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1210.639,1217.43,Just like putting a spy camera in the wall of the Garden Hotel was necessary on the Black case.
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1217.43,1221.635,"No, sir I can’t agree with its analogous although I see your point."
1976.75-1510,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1221.635,1225.572,"This is not the only agent that they have in the South Carolina, isn’t it?"
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1225.572,1227.99,"Not is South Carolina, as I understand it."
1976.75-1510,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1228.963,1231.509,How long had he been an agent?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1231.509,1233.196,Oh!
1976.75-1510,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1234.715,1237.378,I don’t think as some others could’ve done it?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1237.378,1238.908,"Yes, there could’ve been another agent."
1976.75-1510,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1238.908,1243.984,"I mean, rather than to sit to and do what you say, you admit that it was wrong?"
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1243.984,1246.471,I admit that I would’ve done it.
1976.75-1510,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1248.439,1257.135,It’s not wrong for the Government to have a government agent sitting down at the conference between a lawyer and a client?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1257.135,1259.473,I cannot say that I feel that that is --
1976.75-1510,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1259.473,1262.338,"Well, let’s say is it immoral?"
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1262.338,1263.636,Not in those circumstances?
1976.75-1510,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1263.636,1265.306,Is it dirty cool?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1265.306,1266.999,Not in my opinion in those circumstances.
1976.75-1510,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1266.999,1269.8,Is it good?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1269.8,1270.81,I don’t think it’s good.
1976.75-1510,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1321.866,1324.203,"Mr. Coleman, I come back to my apparent point."
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1332.68,1367.552,"Well, the only case cited by the Fourth Circuit in support of the rule that there would be a damage action is the, I believe, Via against Cliff from the Third Circuit and that case is reported in support of the Fourth Circuit’s holding that there can be a 1983 action, even though there might not be a provable damage to the defendant, to the criminal offender in the case."
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1367.552,1372.9,"That was cited at the District Court level and not on the papers, not on a motion, but after the trial, wasn’t it?"
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1372.9,1374.544,"That’s correct, sir."
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1374.544,1378.019,And then the judgment was for the defendants?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1378.019,1379.388,The way it was for the defendants.
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1379.654,1382.009,Although that was reversed by the Court of Appeals?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1382.009,1382.458,I think that’s correct.
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1382.458,1384.772,"So, there has been no assessment of damages or anything like that?"
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1384.772,1385.307,"No, sir."
1976.75-1510,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1413.525,1431.139,"But going back to Mr. Bursey’s situation, were all of these claims which are made as a basis for the 1983 damage claim available as challenges to the validity of his conviction originally?"
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1431.139,1442.15,"I don’t know when -- yes sir, they would be because Weatherford was the very first witness and of course, at the criminal trial."
1976.75-1510,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1442.15,1443.514,Where Bursey was convicted?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1443.514,1444.483,Bursey was convicted.
1976.75-1510,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1444.483,1445.652,And he took no appeal?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1445.652,1446.707,He took no appeal.
1976.75-1510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1446.707,1448.31,"Well, he fled the State actually."
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1448.31,1448.85,"I beg your pardon, sir?"
1976.75-1510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1448.85,1450.852,"He fled the State, didn’t he?"
1976.75-1510,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1450.852,1452.063,He was a fugitive?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1452.063,1452.441,"Oh, yes."
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1462.359,1464.297,But then he did come back and serve his sentence?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1464.297,1467.575,"He was apprehended, came back to serve his sentence and then after that --"
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1467.575,1469.547,He did not appeal as the Chief Justice suggested?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1469.547,1470.762,Did not appeal his criminal --
1976.75-1510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1470.762,1475.887,Could he have appealed when they brought him back after his two years--?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1475.887,1476.833,"I think not, sir."
1976.75-1510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1496.079,1502.684,You didn’t plead a res judicata or collateral estoppel in your pleadings in the District Court?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1502.684,1507.296,"No, we did not Sir."
1976.75-1510,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1507.296,1511.967,And there still proceedings to go in the District Court?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1511.967,1512.779,"Well, --"
1976.75-1510,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1512.779,1515.215,With respect to qualified to immunity?
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1515.215,1517.536,The Fourth Circuit has remanded it.
1976.75-1510,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1517.536,1519.568,Yes.
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1523.683,1530.047,The Fourth Circuit indicates that the other defenses not originally raised might be open.
1976.75-1510,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1530.047,1531.575,"Might, but you said it was?"
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1531.575,1541.388,"Yes, I believe so, yes sir."
1976.75-1510,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1593.625,1613.053,"Well, I take it, to your position or the state’s position is that the only remedy that Mr. Bursey had was to take an appeal under and then perhaps if he got his conviction reversed upon these grounds then he might conceivably have a different course of action from the one the Fourth Circuit is now --"
1976.75-1510,0,29673,j_c_coleman,,1613.053,1615.321,That is certainly a possibility.
1976.75-1510,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1735.96,1743.092,"Thank you, Mr. Coleman."
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1745.438,1749.069,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1510,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1822.652,1825.09,Including the facts or those basic facts you just stated?
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1825.09,1825.32,Yes.
1976.75-1510,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1825.32,1825.983,Those were accepted?
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1825.983,1835.332,"They were all accepted yes, but substituting certain per se requirements for the balancing of interest approach that the District Court took."
1976.75-1510,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1936.319,1938.37,And that is had he maintained his cover?
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1938.37,1942.158,"No, had he not maintained his cover and --"
1976.75-1510,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1942.158,1942.265,He did not maintain --
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1942.265,1945.592,"-- had not said to Bursey, “I’m an agent."
1976.75-1510,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1976.313,1991.61,"Let me just ask you this just before you leave that, I think I read in the briefs that he, ultimately at the trial he pretty well admitted his implication, that is Bursey did?"
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1991.61,1992.643,"Yes, he did."
1976.75-1510,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1992.643,1994.51,"He did not plead guilty, did he?"
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1994.51,1995.831,"No, he didn’t."
1976.75-1510,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2000.293,2002.349,But did concede his participation in the (Voice Overlap) episode?
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2002.349,2010.634,"Yes, as indeed seemed inevitable in the face of the prosecution’s evidence."
1976.75-1510,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2080.447,2089.434,(Inaudible) so much difficulty with this need to maintain cover which was gotten rid of?
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2089.434,2089.864,Well.
1976.75-1510,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2089.864,2097.456,"It always leads to cover until they got this information and then after that, they didn’t need to go there --"
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2097.456,2100.604,"Well, I don’t think it’s accurate to say that they got the information."
1976.75-1510,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2104.676,2109.624,"Facts are that one, they wanted to keep the cover."
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2125.129,2140.885,"Well, those are some of the facts the District Court found that the reason that they didn’t need the cover or the reason that they elected to abandon the cover which is really what happened, was a fear that the cover had been blown by independent incidents."
1976.75-1510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.668,2177.17,"Mr. Frey, what if the government had asked the agent on the stand to testify as to what happened at the meetings between the defendants and his lawyer and that the question was and the information he wanted was clearly relevant to guilt?"
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2177.17,2180.023,I think that would probably be inadmissible.
1976.75-1510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.023,2181.791,Why?
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2181.791,2196.247,"Well, in terms of our analysis, there are two ingredients in a possible Sixth Amendment or Due Process, I’m not sure what the ground is, it’s violation for intrusion into defense --"
1976.75-1510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2196.247,2202.181,You say it’s inadmissible and it has to be and it would be inadmissible because of some constitutional reason?
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2202.181,2202.843,"I think, yes."
1976.75-1510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.843,2206.139,When did the constitutional violation occur?
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2206.139,2206.393,The constitutional --
1976.75-1510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2206.393,2207.625,When the evidence is offered or when --
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2207.625,2209.181,It occurred when the evidence is offered.
1976.75-1510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2232.206,2239.334,But the violation is rooted in sitting in the defense counsel?
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2239.334,2245.241,"Yes, but it’s not because the sitting in is itself a violation of standing alone in our view."
1976.75-1510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.17,2254.47,"That is your fundamental position in this case, I take it."
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2254.47,2254.874,I think.
1976.75-1510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2257.566,2258.8,But that’s one of the --
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2258.8,2259.542,There are two.
1976.75-1510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.542,2262.182,"That’s the end of the case, if you’re right, I suppose?"
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2262.182,2266.195,"Well, that’s not necessarily the end of a civil case."
1976.75-1510,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2278.54,2289.171,"Well, at page 49 on your brief, which is near the end as you are near the end of your time of argument, you’ve said that Weatherford’s testimony at trial is not an appropriate source of civil liability."
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2291.361,2292.344,"Well, that --"
1976.75-1510,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2292.344,2293.808,The State did not seem to be much interested?
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2293.808,2296.461,"Well, I had not."
1976.75-1510,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2356.512,2359.089,"When you say take measures, you mean take an appeal from his conviction?"
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2359.089,2369.178,"Well, the first object to the introduction of this evidence, object if it was improper for Weatherford to testify at the trial, the defendant could’ve objected."
1976.75-1510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2384.543,2390.785,"Mr. Frey, unless the violation occurred at the time of the meeting, why would the agent ever be liable for what happened at trial?"
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2392.55,2394.805,"We suggest in our brief, he would not be."
1976.75-1510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2394.805,2398.646,He’s called by the prosecution and he’s under an obligation to testify.
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2398.646,2406.081,"Yes, we suggest that as long as he gives truthful testimony, at least, he’s absolutely immune from liability."
1976.75-1510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.081,2408.526,"Unless, there’s a violation at the time of the meeting."
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2408.526,2409.416,"Well, yes."
1976.75-1510,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2505.106,2507.442,What kind of a violation are you addressing now?
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2507.442,2510.671,"Well, I think that would be the situation I think Caldwell and Hoffa were dealing."
1976.75-1510,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2510.671,2512.253,Is it a constitutional violation?
1976.75-1510,1,15933,andrew_l_frey,,2512.253,2529.157,A constitutional violation; I am not -- I am a little uneasy about resting it on the Sixth Amendment and I have to hark back to cases like Herring and in Faretta where the Court is somewhat divided on whether what the roots of some of these rights are.
1976.75-1510,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2745.461,2749.638,Mr. McDonald.
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,2749.638,2755.55,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2867.548,2871.738,"When was this offer of protection given, after he testified or before?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,2871.738,2873.473,I believe that’s correct sir.
1976.75-1510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2873.473,2875.537,"Which is it, after or before?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,2875.537,2884.98,"I think it was after he testified, Strom offered him a job of so-called “above the ground” kind of agent, to use Weatherford’s phrase, and he declined."
1976.75-1510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3021.769,3040.66,"How, in your view, did the testimony of Weatherford, testimony now, not anything that preceded it cause a damage, an actionable damage to him?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3040.66,3051.541,"Well, Your Honor, the gist of our complaint is that there was an interference with the right to counsel prior to trial and that there was a creation of surprise --"
1976.75-1510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3051.541,3054.584,"To what did he testify, Weatherford?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3054.584,3059.495,He testified about what was done at the Selective Service Board itself.
1976.75-1510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3059.495,3062.161,"He was an eyewitness of the event, was he not?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3062.161,3062.895,"That’s right, sir."
1976.75-1510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3062.895,3074.403,"Now, did he testify to any facts which he learned after the events based in the indictment?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3074.403,3076.865,The answer is no.
1976.75-1510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3082.966,3085.453,"He didn’t testify falsely, did he?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3085.453,3088.667,"We don’t attack his testimony in this civil suit, Your Honor."
1976.75-1510,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3088.667,3092.636,"He didn’t testify as eyewitness, testified as fellow participant, didn’t?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3092.636,3093.191,That’s right.
1976.75-1510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3098.601,3100.709,"That made him an eyewitness, didn’t it?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3100.709,3101.71,He was both.
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3102.823,3110.446,"Mr. McDonald, I have a little trouble with the surprise theory because what difference would’ve been made if you know 10 days in advance he’s going to testify?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3110.446,3118.7,"I think, one of the difference is -- well, for example he might have had a defense based on entrapment had he known that Weatherford was an agent."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3148.959,3154.269,Why couldn’t he made that decision whether to claim entrapment at the close of the prosecution’s case?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3157.928,3164.829,"Well, Your Honor, that’s of course part of, it seems to me part of advice in allowing the State to try a case basically by ambush."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3165.408,3167.116,There’s another thought that runs to my mind.
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3173.536,3176.656,"I think that he wouldn’t know that defense was available, Your Honor."
1976.75-1510,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3184.656,3191.48,Do you want a pro se rule that every stool pigeon’s testimony must be revealed before trial?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3191.48,3213.763,"Your Honor, we argue that a per se rule would be applicable in this case, but it’s possible for this Court to affirm the opinion of the Court of Appeals without reaching such a result because I think there clearly was constitutional prejudice here in that the Court of Appeals found there was deliberate intrusion."
1976.75-1510,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3225.713,3229.522,What was the affirmative other than hiring his man?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3229.522,3229.882,"Well,--"
1976.75-1510,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3229.882,3232.439,"He didn’t set up either one of these meetings, did he?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3232.439,3234.891,"No, he did not Your Honor but he made contact with them."
1976.75-1510,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3234.891,3239.192,"And they came after him, isn't that correct?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3239.192,3266.415,"The meetings were, Your Honor, set up by Mr. Bursey and it is true that Mr. Weatherford was asked to join those meetings, but I think that we must understand that Weatherford was hired by Strom and his specific instructions were to infiltrate certain groups at the university and to establish contact with certain people and one of the people who was specifically mentioned, specifically talked about by the chief was Bursey."
1976.75-1510,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3275.614,3279.481,Chief Strom said that he knew nothing about this?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3279.481,3280.748,He said that he didn’t know that the actual --
1976.75-1510,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3280.748,3284.153,"He said that if he knew about it, he would have stopped."
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3285.856,3286.742,That’s correct sir.
1976.75-1510,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3351.1,3356.292,And he specifically denied ever knowing about it?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3356.292,3371.147,"He did specifically deny that and we of course -- and if our standard of proof, Your Honor is that we must prove that he even knew or that prosecutor was told by Weatherford, the we lose because --"
1976.75-1510,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3371.147,3381.426,What evidence do you have in the record to show that the chief was not telling the truth on the statement that he knew nothing of the two conferences with the lawyer?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3381.426,3389.973,"Your Honor, there are a lot of things we can look at in the record to suggest whether or not the chief’s memory was actually faithful."
1976.75-1510,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3399.866,3407.4,"You mean, you can assume that it -- is there any testimony from Weatherford that he talked to him?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3407.4,3408.425,"Talk to the chief, Your Honor?"
1976.75-1510,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3408.425,3409.659,About this?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3409.659,3411.622,He denied that he talked to the chief specifically --
1976.75-1510,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3411.622,3413.655,"Well, you got two people who deny it."
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3417.391,3422.112,"Your Honor, I can actually concede that if we must prove that, we lose because we can’t."
1976.75-1510,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3422.112,3422.143,"Well, I thought so."
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3422.143,3422.807,And I think --
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3422.807,3432.58,"Mr. McDonald, would you have stated that 1983 cause of action if Bursey had pleaded guilty?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3432.58,3435.35,"Your Honor, without a doubt that that’s the --"
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3435.35,3445.945,Or if suppose Bursey had been charged or indicted and then before trial the case had been dismissed because the prosecution didn’t think it could win?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3445.945,3458.956,"I think under those circumstances, he would be entitled to recover for the constitutional violation which had occurred in the same way that the Bursey was a victim of an unlawful search and seizure even if there’s no trial, he could bring an action under 1983."
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3458.956,3471.255,So your theory is that the constitutional violation was complete and at the time of the participation in the meetings and at the trial just to put a question of damages?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3471.255,3473.31,I think that it does go to a question of damages.
1976.75-1510,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3473.31,3478.876,"But the right to counsel depends on the pendency of a criminal proceeding, doesn’t it?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3486.677,3492.824,That may be true but the right to counsel has been recognized as existing prior to a trial.
1976.75-1510,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3493.131,3497.385,But it’s dependent on the impending trial?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3497.385,3501.062,"Which there was here, that’s right, sir."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3510.206,3519.58,"Before you get to that, could you just tell me again exactly what the constitutional violation is assuming that the trial is unimpaired by what happened?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3519.58,3525.5,"Well, the constitutional violation here was an intrusion into the Sixth Amendment right to counsel."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3532.476,3538.466,So is it critical to your theory that there was some use made of the prosecution of the defense strategy?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3538.466,3545.573,"We don’t think we have to show that, but we think that there was prejudice from the conduct of the Government here."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3560.25,3567.714,"Well, assuming that, does that all then depend on having some impact on the trial process, (Inaudible) misrepresented if it didn’t affect the trial?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3567.714,3579.499,"Well, in Via versus Cliff is an instance where the Court found that even though there was no prejudice and no impact upon trial, that a defendant who would been denied a constitutional right would still be able to maintain an action on the 1983."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3582.185,3582.582,"Well -- well, go ahead."
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3583.076,3588.983,-- that the prisoner was incarcerated and he was denied access to his attorney on two occasions.
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3607.267,3611.005,There is the -- he denied access to counsel before trial.
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3613.144,3613.861,"Well, the right --"
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3613.861,3617.97,There’s no interference with access between the client and the lawyer?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3617.97,3626.722,We think that you have a right not to have an agent for prosecution sit in on the defense planning sessions as the --
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3626.722,3629.568,Even if the defense asked him to sit in?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3629.568,3638.707,"Well, Your Honor, I think that that really is a question of semantics more than substance because he was there in his role as an undercover agent."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3668.966,3681.329,"Well I understand all that, but the right is that they have a right, an absolute right not to have an informant who is concealing his identity present while the lawyer and the client are together."
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3681.329,3688.891,"Well, I don’t think the Court has to adopt the per se rule for Bursey to be entitled to relief for at least two reasons."
1976.75-1510,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3705.026,3708.957,You say we have to make findings the District Court did not make then?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3712.103,3717.926,"Well, the District Court recited the facts, but concluded that there was no constitutional violation."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3758.117,3760.258,Was it untrue at the time he made the statement?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3760.258,3761.823,He was.
1976.75-1510,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3767.936,3769.921,I thought it was change of strategy.
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3774.424,3782.415,"I think, Your Honor, that it is true that the final decision to use Weatherford as a witness might have been made at the day of trial."
1976.75-1510,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3782.415,3786.692,"Well then, why did you say a moment ago that he knew he was going to testify from the beginning?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3786.692,3790.59,"He knew, he said, that it was always a possibility that he would be a witness."
1976.75-1510,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3790.59,3794.167,"But that isn’t quite the same thing as saying, he knew?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3794.167,3796.645,"I think, Your Honor, that he knew that that was a possibility."
1976.75-1510,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3796.645,3797.296,"Well, those are --"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3797.296,3798.891,This is what I’m saying.
1976.75-1510,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3798.891,3820.969,"Mr. McDonald, there’s an expressed finding, it’s at the bottom of page 30 on the petition that Weatherford did not know he would be used as a witness in the criminal action and Solicitor Ford had not decided until just prior to the call of the case that he would use Weatherford as a witness, did he say that?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3820.969,3824.535,"Your Honor, I’m not trying to say anything that’s inconsistent with that."
1976.75-1510,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3858.036,3861.312,Your statement implies that he knew all the time he would testify?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3861.312,3863.442,"But Your Honor, if I said that I misspoke myself."
1976.75-1510,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3866.594,3880.04,"In your brief, among other things, you say that the prosecution was able to discover the complete defense strategy by these tactics."
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3886.68,3894.304,"Well, the Court of Appeals of course, found that Weatherford did have knowledge of the defense tactics and I think that --"
1976.75-1510,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3894.304,3903.323,Any indication in the findings of either Court that the information you referred to was revealed to the prosecution?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3903.323,3904.855,"There is not, Your Honor."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3949.04,3951.281,"Mr. McDonald, one thing paused me."
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3954.484,3963.9,"Well, Your Honor, they knew that there were three people who actually participated in the incident at the draft board, Merrick and Bursey and Weatherford."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3976.176,3978.192,"Well, I just wonder if you could sum it up in a word."
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3979.108,3980.782,I am sorry.
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3981.267,3984.432,-- police entrapment or just of an inadequate proof or what?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3984.432,3987.986,"Inadequate proof and reasonable doubt, that there was no eyewitness."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3989.719,3994.983,"In other words, what was revealed to the prosecution then was that the defense hoped that the Government couldn’t prove its case?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,3994.983,3996.159,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-1510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4000.851,4011.734,Was there at the time of the trial cross-examination of Weatherford as to these two meetings with counsel?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4011.734,4014.512,"Very limited cross-examination, Your Honor."
1976.75-1510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4051.637,4069.714,"Well, I just, he was met by the much stronger case of the prosecution that he hadn’t anticipated, because he had not anticipated that an eyewitness would testify and one did and that’s always somewhat of a shock to defense counsel?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4069.714,4072.572,"It changed other things too, Your Honor."
1976.75-1510,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4078.693,4085.246,"Well, if there’s a very strong case against the defendant he sometimes feels impelled to take the stand where he wouldn’t otherwise?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4085.246,4094.224,"I think had he known about that in advance what the preparation and it is a benefit and had he known about that prior to the trial, he might have been more effective."
1976.75-1510,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4094.224,4096.673,Just for continuance of that basis?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4096.673,4098.555,"No, he did not."
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4098.555,4102.536,What is your specific claim of the constitutional violation by sitting it on the meetings?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4114.535,4117.474,"Well, I think there are a lot of vices inherent in sitting --"
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4117.474,4118.874,Which is it here?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4118.874,4131.429,"Well, here it’s learning defense strategy, that would be when Weatherford already knew the incriminating evidence, but that could be involved or people might be concerned about evidence of other crimes or --"
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4131.429,4146.645,"Well, doesn’t make a little bit of a difference what you’re claiming as to whether the violation occurs at the trial or when you’re sitting down on a meeting?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4146.645,4152.587,"Well, I think, Your Honor, it’s getting around again to the question of res judicata and collateral estoppel."
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4152.587,4152.867,"No, not at all."
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4160.298,4166.005,"Well, there are different kinds of harm that could result the harm here which is twofold."
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4187.47,4192.073,"But what about the time he was sitting in, they were also planning another crime?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4192.073,4194.925,"I think that would be different, Your Honor."
1976.75-1510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4194.925,4196.99,"You mean, that would be admissible?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4196.99,4198.316,"Well,--"
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4198.316,4202.643,"Well, would there be a constitutional violation at that time?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4202.643,4214.382,I don’t know that the right to plan a crime is constitutionally protected in the sense that the right to plan a defense is constitutionally protected.
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4214.382,4221.555,"You will suggest there wasn’t any violation there of a third party, a government agent sitting in on those kinds of conversations?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4221.555,4226.212,"Well, it shows roughly now the situation that was involved in the Hoffa case."
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4226.548,4231.641,I take it under your position there would’ve been a 1983 violation in the Hoffa case?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4231.641,4235.453,"Well, of course that involve the United States Government there but the Court didn’t --"
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4235.453,4238.097,"But it would be a constitutional violation, you’d say?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4238.097,4238.811,The Court didn’t rule.
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4238.811,4242.882,The Sixth Amendment right to counsel?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4242.882,4249.264,Had the State been the prosecuting party that may well have been that Mr. Hoffa could have an action on the 1983 for what happened --
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4249.264,4258.324,"Well, I know but the Federal Government is and that if that’s a violation of a Sixth Amendment, there might be a Bivens type of action?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4258.324,4260.144,"We certainly don't rule about that possibility, Your Honor."
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4260.79,4262.428,"Well, your theory seems to reach that --"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4262.428,4262.75,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4262.75,4273.398,"-- in the Hoffa case that at the time the agent was sitting in on conversations between lawyer and client, there was a violation?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4273.398,4274.196,"Right, sir."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4409.633,4411.592,"Mr. McDonald, let me just interrupt once more, if I may."
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4411.592,4412.678,"Yes, sir."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4412.678,4426.587,"What is the authority or the closest authority for the proposition that there’s some kind of protection, either constitution or otherwise for a “defense strategy session” other than a session which only the attorney and the client were present."
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4434.197,4439.126,"I think there are number of cases, Your Honor which established that proposition."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4460.873,4465.704,Is it when the third person present between the defendant and the attorney as well?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4465.704,4469.556,"Well, of course, those cases involve electronic surveillance, but the Court --"
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4469.556,4472.634,"So, those were the intrusions on the privacy of the attorney and the client."
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4479.19,4481.212,"I’m not certain I understand the question, Your Honor."
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4481.212,4490.074,"Well, it’s easy to understand what you’re talking about when you got an attorney and a client in a normally privileged situation and there’s an intrusion on that relationship."
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4502.34,4514.0,"Well, I think that it would be protected by the notion that the right to confer with an attorney includes the notion to prepare a defense and preparation of defense it seems to me --"
1976.75-1510,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4514.0,4518.944,"Well, I’m not asking about the theory of the other cases that established this general notion that’s what I’m trying to --"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4518.944,4538.459,"Well, there are cases, Your Honor we cited in our brief involving the attorney-client privilege, which say that communications made between joint defendants and attorneys is protected by the attorney-client privilege and I should think that the scope of the protection forwarded by the Sixth Amendment would not be less than that."
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4538.459,4539.471,Let me put it to you this way.
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4561.564,4565.359,"Well, the Sixth Amendment violation would not exist in that circumstance."
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4565.359,4577.555,Alright and then you don’t think that the information -- that the testimony of that non-agent would be excludable?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4577.555,4582.096,"If he acted without informant whatsoever, I’d (Voice Overlap)"
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4582.096,4584.463,"You can postulate all you want, there is no connection of the Government."
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4584.463,4585.709,Right.
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4585.709,4590.534,"Well, then they call the agent at the same trial?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4590.534,4591.564,I think that one of the things --
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4591.564,4595.454,To testify the identical things?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4595.454,4599.689,The Sixth Amendment does apply against the Government I think is the answer to that and the Court also --
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4599.689,4608.373,"Well, I know but the question is, was it a confidential meeting or wasn’t it?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4608.373,4608.839,"Well, I think it’s --"
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4608.839,4615.028,Or was it something that they could expect to be private or not?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4615.028,4616.071,"Well, of course --"
1976.75-1510,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4616.071,4620.976,"Let’s say, you had two extra people in the meeting besides the client and lawyer?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4620.976,4649.248,"The Court might conclude that there had been a deliberate waiver, or that there was no attorney-client meeting to intrude, or that there had been no intrusion And that was a meeting that was open to the public or that is going to complete publication of the strategy and those considerations might call for different result than the one we think is appropriate here where there was prosecutorial misconduct."
1976.75-1510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4657.844,4670.082,"Suppose that Weatherford had never attended any meeting at which Bursey’s attorney was present, and then nevertheless testified as he did here?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4670.082,4670.611,I think the Court --
1976.75-1510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4670.611,4671.504,Would you be here?
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4671.504,4673.604,"Well, we might not be here, Your Honor."
1976.75-1510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4678.693,4682.348,"We wouldn’t have to look at any of them now, would we?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4682.348,4686.409,"Well, there would be no intrusion under those circumstances --"
1976.75-1510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4686.409,4687.014,But you would’ve (Voice Overlap)
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4687.014,4688.134,We would’ve been --
1976.75-1510,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4688.134,4691.162,"You would’ve been no less surprised, would you?"
1976.75-1510,2,34797,laughlin_mcdonald,,4691.162,4691.362,No.
