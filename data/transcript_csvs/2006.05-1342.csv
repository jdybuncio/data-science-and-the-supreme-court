2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.487,"We'll hear argument next in 05-1342, Watters v. Wachovia Bank."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,8.437,11.289,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1342,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,82.452,97.078,"If the national bank set up its mortgage operations as a division or as a department, then the sole regulator would be OCC, right?"
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,97.078,98.58,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,110.804,111.504,Why did they do that?
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,115.958,141.257,"Your Honor, the advantage is that Wachovia Bank insulates itself from liability, because it's a bedrock principle of state corporate law that the parent corporation is not liable for the acts of the subsidiary corporation."
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,141.257,159.654,"So mortgage subsidiary could possibly get into some trouble that the bank wants to protect itself from and not have... they have a certain number of assets that are subject to liability in the subsidiary, but they would... otherwise they'd expose the whole bank to those liabilities?"
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,159.654,160.487,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.58,190.589,"Well, I assume that the Federal regulating authorities require a certain ratio of loans to real estate value, things of that sort."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,219.876,221.911,"Possibly, but--"
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,221.911,230.666,"Well, if not I don't see any advantage in this great Federal banking system you're talking about, if it's Tweedledum and Tweedledee."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,230.666,239.939,"--Well, the States do not... exclusive visitorial powers over national banks rest with the OCC."
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,247.61,251.414,"You're not seeking visit... ""visitorial"", is that the word?"
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,251.414,251.864,Correct.
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,251.864,255.449,You're not seeking visitorial rights with respect to the parent bank.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,255.449,256.716,Absolutely not.
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,256.716,260.435,You're not arguing that because you need to see more about the mortgage--
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,262.888,263.372,No.
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,263.372,263.955,Okay.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,263.955,265.388,"No, we're not."
2006.05-1342,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,277.312,279.514,Suppose that it was a national bank.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,299.145,301.93,As to the national bank?
2006.05-1342,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,301.93,302.83,Yes.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,302.83,303.263,Yes.
2006.05-1342,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,303.263,305.715,"Yes, of course, because it conflicts and they don't want it."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,305.715,306.149,Yes.
2006.05-1342,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,306.149,306.515,All right.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,311.452,313.92,No.
2006.05-1342,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,313.92,314.57,"No, they can't?"
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,331.032,331.632,Yes.
2006.05-1342,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,331.632,332.316,What?
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,332.316,334.668,"The Gold Foods case, the--"
2006.05-1342,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,334.668,335.234,What is it?
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,340.722,348.993,"--Well, the point is that the corporate law recognizes the two as separate and distinct corporate entities."
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.993,359.866,"I thought your point was that the statute defines national bank, but also defines affiliates, and refers to them as two separate entities."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,359.866,360.568,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.568,366.205,And I thought your point was that the effect of this regulation is to simply eliminate that distinction?
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,366.205,367.155,You're right.
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,367.155,377.411,"Their argument, they haven't argued... I realize this was a hypothetical, but they haven't argued that the subsidiary should be treated as a national bank."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,383.399,383.917,Exactly.
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,384.567,391.737,"Presumably, if they said it's treated as a national bank they would lose the benefit of the separate corporate existence when it came to issues of liability."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,403.212,410.116,"--Well, but that's the... they are trying to contend that they are one and the same."
2006.05-1342,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,412.034,414.936,"Well, I guess we can ask the respondents."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,433.314,436.616,"Yes, that is my understanding of their position."
2006.05-1342,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,436.616,442.437,They say that there's no area of State law that is applicable to the subsidiary corporation?
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,442.437,452.478,They are saying that visitorial powers over the State-chartered operating subs is exclusively--
2006.05-1342,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,452.478,458.732,"I could understand that with reference to just the amount of consumer loans, as Justice Scalia was talking about."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,474.724,486.532,--They take the authority... the position that Michigan has no authority to impose on the State-chartered operating sub the two Michigan laws--
2006.05-1342,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,486.532,489.234,But let's... there are two different kinds of regulations.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,505.53,506.78,"--Yes, you're correct."
2006.05-1342,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,506.78,518.687,--that they have to meet all the requirements for setting up a corporation and having meetings and all that that North Carolina requires of corporations that are incorporated in that State?
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,518.687,523.006,"No, I've not heard them say that as to North Carolina law."
2006.05-1342,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,533.847,536.315,"Well, that seems to be a standard preemption case."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,578.392,589.367,"The important point, though, Your Honor, is that the OCC has no independent power to preempt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State."
2006.05-1342,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,589.367,594.003,Doesn't it have exactly the same power that any other agency or Congress has?
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,660.63,662.232,They do not.
2006.05-1342,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,691.834,697.321,"Let's assume I don't agree with you about that, that I think conflict preemption does not require clear language."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,714.532,736.213,"Your Honor, in the Barnett case and in the Atherton case, in order to have the kind of problem you're talking about, there must be a significant interference with the business of banking or an incapacitation of the business of banking."
2006.05-1342,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,739.998,745.819,"Mr. Blanchard, may I ask you a question, perhaps preliminary to what you are launching into?"
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,803.924,805.959,--I am not saying that.
2006.05-1342,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,812.613,834.026,"Ah, you're saying, you started to say they can't have their cake and eat it too, but you're saying they can have the worst of all possible regulatory worlds, so that they've got two equally competent regulators, and they have to meet the requirements of both?"
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,834.026,834.809,Yes.
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,835.895,839.597,"And if they don't want to, they don't have to set up a separate subsidiary, right?"
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,844.049,846.017,--You are absolutely correct.
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,861.963,862.346,Right.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,876.722,877.505,Yes.
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,882.174,884.209,I didn't understand that you made this--
2006.05-1342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,884.209,886.744,"May I just finish, please?"
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,909.694,919.132,"You are correct, Your Honor, in that Wachovia Mortgage as a subsidiary of a national bank is a registrant under Michigan law."
2006.05-1342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,924.036,930.023,Can you give me some specific examples of what Michigan would require that the OCC does not require?
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,931.923,936.177,--Michigan would require Wachovia Mortgage to register.
2006.05-1342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,945.617,949.502,Does that have any impact on the way they run their business?
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,949.502,950.352,--No.
2006.05-1342,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,950.352,960.376,"I mean, does it make any difference as a matter of what they have to do in order to comply with the law that they are now exempt from Michigan rules and subject to Federal rules instead?"
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,960.376,960.892,No.
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.254,1007.107,"--Mr. Blanchard, if I could go back to what you were saying before this last line of questioning, I didn't understand your position to be that the OCC can come in and regulate this non-Federal bank up to the point where its... well, can do it apparently without limitation."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1014.194,1016.296,Or the more restrictive.
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1016.296,1018.998,"Ah, or the more restrictive."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1018.998,1019.881,That's the difference.
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1019.881,1030.556,"The Federal Government says you can have outstanding loans of $10 billion and the state says no, you can have outstanding loans of 8 billion."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1030.556,1031.373,"No, Your Honor, the--"
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1031.373,1031.756,Wait.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1033.674,1036.376,"--Well, it doesn't happen in Michigan because--"
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1036.376,1040.493,"Well, invent some other hypothetical then."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1074.716,1077.517,"--No, Your Honor."
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1110.571,1112.257,Exempt from state examination?
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1112.257,1113.29,--Yes.
2006.05-1342,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1125.564,1126.932,We're not looking for that.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1171.295,1183.019,"They... their position is that both laws that we append to our brief, both laws in their entirety, are preempted."
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1183.019,1187.154,Their position is not that it only preempts in cases of conflict.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1202.564,1203.614,Correct.
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1203.614,1205.699,So it's not a case of conflict preemption.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1209.984,1213.369,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-1342,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1213.369,1230.164,You do have... one thing that seems concrete and clear to me... correct me if I get this wrong... Michigan is kind of deferring to OCC in its primary jurisdiction sense.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1250.744,1252.111,You are exactly correct.
2006.05-1342,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1254.513,1256.215,So it's kind of a reverse supremacy.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1276.026,1277.609,"--Yes, you are exactly correct."
2006.05-1342,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1305.176,1322.805,"Do you know another arrangement where the Federal agency goes first but then the state agency has authority to say Federal agency, you didn't deal with this consumer adequately, so we will take over?"
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1333.029,1333.996,Another one that--
2006.05-1342,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1333.996,1347.455,"Where the primary adjudicator, decision-maker would be the Federal authority, but then the state can override that if it thinks the Federal authority hasn't done an adequate job?"
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1347.455,1366.5,"--Well, in a sense, in our statute, the commissioner of the state agency is able to investigate if the complaint referred to the comptroller has not been adequately--"
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1366.5,1367.702,That's not the question.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1377.324,1380.693,--No situations come directly to mind.
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1380.693,1393.917,"Maybe civil rights actions where there's a Federal agency that has some remedial powers and if the Federal agency doesn't act, the citizen is free to bring litigation in state court?"
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1394.686,1403.642,"Or environmental regulation where just because the Federal EPA doesn't take a particular action against a polluter, doesn't mean that the state can't take action against the polluter."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1403.642,1404.942,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1342,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1404.942,1409.529,Isn't the action an inadequate action?
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1430.09,1430.825,Yes.
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1430.825,1431.942,So if the Federal--
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1443.166,1443.9,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-1342,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1443.9,1444.633,Could the OCC--
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1444.633,1448.654,--Did this go through your... can I just ask--
2006.05-1342,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1448.654,1449.17,--Sure.
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1449.17,1450.587,--This still goes to the same thing.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1472.269,1473.035,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-1342,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1478.006,1480.223,I know in Michigan.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1498.753,1519.333,The Federal rule provides that the operating... the State chartered operating subs are to be treated just like the law pertaining to the parent national bank.
2006.05-1342,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1545.281,1550.951,Let me ask the question... the regulatory question.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1610.49,1625.685,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, I'm not defending that Michigan has a more restrictive scheme or that Michigan law in any way incapacitates or significantly interferes with the business of banking."
2006.05-1342,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1625.685,1637.909,"Well, if, if... if the banks have got, let's say, a subsidiary has to go through two rounds of bank inspection every year instead of one round, it is going to cost them something."
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1703.101,1721.23,"A recognition that the States have a sovereign, compelling and legitimate interest in regulating those corporations that it charters and that do business within its borders."
2006.05-1342,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1726.467,1731.835,"So it is state sovereign immunity in effect, is the answer... State sovereignty is rather the answer?"
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1731.835,1736.823,"But the... but the key point, and I would like to reserve whatever time I may have."
2006.05-1342,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1736.823,1738.525,You better hurry then.
2006.05-1342,0,21971,e_john_blanchard,,1738.525,1760.188,"The key, the key point is that Congress has distinguished clearly and unequivocally between affiliates and national banks; but it has not included affiliates in either Section 481 or 484 of the National Bank Act."
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1772.662,1775.448,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-1342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1835.319,1837.771,"Mr. Blanchard, may I ask you a question."
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1847.21,1854.733,"--Well, a branch of a national bank has a particular status under Section 36 of the National Bank Act."
2006.05-1342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1854.733,1855.183,I understand that.
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1856.366,1859.618,It would not be separately incorporated.
2006.05-1342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1860.052,1863.938,"They are actually divisions, in effect, of the national bank itself?"
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1863.938,1868.64,"--Well, I think they are generally referred to as branches but I think its would be more a division."
2006.05-1342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1869.073,1871.009,At least they are not separate corporate subsidiaries.
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1871.009,1871.442,--That... that--
2006.05-1342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1871.442,1878.765,"Why is that, that the Best bank decided to use the subsidiary approach for this business, rather than the more traditional banking approach."
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1878.765,1884.935,"--Well, of course, anything that a bank does through an operating subsidiary it could do through the bank."
2006.05-1342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1897.827,1899.862,"It protects from liability, too."
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1899.862,1901.88,"Well, that is one of the reasons."
2006.05-1342,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1902.646,1903.546,--in the district.
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1903.546,1911.883,"--I will say, Justice Stevens, I have not been able to find examples of national bank operating subsidiaries that have become insolvent."
2006.05-1342,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1916.354,1931.546,"But you have a subsidiary that's in the mortgage lending business that presumably competes with other companies in the mortgage lending business that are not associated with national banks, and you're claiming an immunity from the regulation that their competitors are subject to."
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1932.129,1934.915,"Well, but again, Mr. Chief Justice, the national banks compete."
2006.05-1342,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1936.017,1945.123,"And that's fine, and they have an express provision in 48... 484(a) that says they're, they're exempt from regulation."
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1954.395,1964.468,"--But again, Mr. Chief Justice, thrifts, S&Ls, State-Chartered banks in all 50 States are permitted to have operating subsidiaries."
2006.05-1342,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1977.594,1988.2,"--Justice Breyer's questions were pointing out, to the extent your regulation... the Federal regulation of your subsidiary conflicts with the State law, that regulation is going to prevail."
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1992.252,1994.487,"--Well, and you asked that question."
2006.05-1342,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2023.206,2025.991,"In real world terms, what's involved here?"
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2034.014,2038.299,"--The beginning is, it is a complete separate set of regulation."
2006.05-1342,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2052.891,2064.449,"--One of those laws might be, I mean, let's say they have a law, when you're issuing a mortgage to a consumer, you have to give them a disclosure about how much they're going to end up paying over the life of the loan and all that."
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2072.12,2076.757,"--Well, the question, Mr. Chief Justice, would be is it preempted as to the national bank?"
2006.05-1342,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2091.1,2093.35,Isn't... isn't your friend correct then?
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2105.658,2110.229,"--Well, but it, it with respect, it is not really a case of having our cake and eating it, too."
2006.05-1342,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2129.274,2130.658,That's the question I had.
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2150.989,2151.722,"--That, that is correct."
2006.05-1342,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2151.722,2154.524,But I thought we were basically dealing with conflict--
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2154.524,2154.941,Yes.
2006.05-1342,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2154.941,2155.558,--not fielding.
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2155.558,2156.46,It's... that's one level--
2006.05-1342,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2156.46,2168.1,"But... but the last part of the reg says that what applies, no State law applies to a national bank operating subsidiary if it doesn't apply to the parent bank."
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2178.706,2180.325,"--Well... it's, it's a very important point."
2006.05-1342,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.882,2241.11,"I think, the question is not whether it can preempt State laws but whether the rulemaking authority can, can eliminate a, a basic division of the statute into a national bank and affiliates of the national bank."
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2251.283,2251.633,--No.
2006.05-1342,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2252.099,2256.77,"If you are an affiliate of a national bank, you have the same immunity that the national bank has."
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2258.287,2261.322,"--I have a two-part answer to that question, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-1342,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2297.245,2301.216,"I mean, an operating subsidiary is an affiliate, right?"
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2307.535,2308.652,It's a type of affiliate--
2006.05-1342,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2308.652,2313.023,"I would have thought that any affiliate of a national bank would, would be engaged in essentially banking business."
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2313.023,2316.658,"--But, but this really became clear, in answer to your question, in part two of my answer."
2006.05-1342,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2478.31,2490.284,What authority do you have for the proposition that when then Federal law says subject to the same terms and conditions that they're referring To State regulation as opposed to the same Federal regulation that applies to the national banks?
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2490.284,2502.659,"--Well, I mean, we have section 7.4006, which is the 0CC's regulation interpreting that language in the statute and in its own OPSUB regulations, section 5.34."
2006.05-1342,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2510.063,2517.05,"Was 7.4006 issued pursuant to... what did you call it, GLBA?"
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2517.05,2517.585,GLBA?
2006.05-1342,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2517.585,2518.235,Yes.
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2520.537,2531.142,"7.4006 was issued pursuant to 24-7, which is this incidental powers provision, and 24(a), which I've just been walking you through, which is a provision of GLBA."
2006.05-1342,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2538.879,2546.402,Conflict preemption basically strikes down a State law that stands as an obstacle to the full enforcement of the Federal law.
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2546.402,2546.852,Yes.
2006.05-1342,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2546.852,2547.168,All right.
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2563.613,2564.296,"Well, I mean, of course--"
2006.05-1342,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2564.296,2565.096,Would you or not?
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2565.096,2567.398,"--We do have them and we think that makes the case easier, of course."
2006.05-1342,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2567.398,2570.6,"I know, but would you... would you expect to come to the same result or not?"
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2570.6,2571.017,Yes.
2006.05-1342,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2580.373,2590.062,How does it conflict with Federal banking authority for the State to audit the books of the mortgage subsidiary?
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2590.062,2609.225,"--Well, it has been established since the beginning of the national banking system that... and this goes back to the history of the first and second Bank of the United States in McCullough against Maryland... that the national banking system is protected from possibly unfriendly State legislation."
2006.05-1342,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2609.225,2613.427,Take my earlier case about the consumer disclosure.
2006.05-1342,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2623.152,2627.187,The Comptroller's view as I understand it is that it would.
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2870.278,2872.88,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-1342,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2922.562,2924.998,It's field preemption when it comes to regulation.
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2934.77,2940.341,"Well, I guess it depends on the degree to which the regulations apply to the national banks."
2006.05-1342,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2945.912,2950.816,"State laws generally... State agencies generally don't regulate national banks at all, right?"
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,2950.816,2955.518,State agencies don't generally do that because there's a specific statutory prohibition on that.
2006.05-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3001.913,3018.841,"Yes, but it is true, is it not, that as long as this mortgage company was a subsidiary of a holding company rather than the bank itself, the State would have done the visiting, the visitorial power, whereas once they changed the Federal Government assumed that responsibility?"
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3018.841,3021.643,"Well, I don't know what you mean by ""holding company"", Justice Stevens."
2006.05-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3021.643,3035.303,"Well, as your co-counsel pointed out, previously this very company was a subsidiary of a holding company that also owned the bank, and at that time it was exclusively regulated by Michigan."
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3035.303,3039.788,"That's right, because it wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered national bank."
2006.05-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3039.788,3046.491,And the change in the corporate structure is the sole basis for saying now it's exclusively regulated by the OCC?
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3046.491,3049.979,"It is, but it's changing the corporate structure in a fundamentally important way."
2006.05-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3054.014,3061.953,But this results in field preemption to the extent that the exercise of visitorial power is a regulatory function?
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3061.953,3063.886,"Well, again it depends on how one defines those terms."
2006.05-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3068.271,3073.575,"Well, it is now only the Federal agency that does the visiting, whereas it used to be only the State agency?"
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3073.575,3074.825,--That's right.
2006.05-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3074.825,3084.431,And the question that led me to is how many additional personnel did OOC employ when it took over this area for 48 States?
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3084.431,3090.001,"Well, I don't have an empirical answer to that question."
2006.05-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3090.001,3092.636,"But it was certainly quite a few people, I assume."
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3092.636,3105.713,"But Justice Stevens, in the regulatory materials that attended the promulgation of these rules OCC specifically addressed the question whether it had sufficient resources to exercise oversight authority over operating subsidiaries of national banks."
2006.05-1342,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3121.739,3130.678,But the authority under the old regime was just to make sure that the operation did not affect the financial stability of the parent bank.
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3130.678,3157.646,"--But that's because it wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered national bank, and that changes things in a fundamental way for the following reason: That under the Barnett Bank case the rule of preemption, the special rule of preemption that applies in the context of national banking, is that when you're dealing with enumerated or incidental powers of national banks... and one incidental power of a national bank is undisputed to be the power to conduct affairs through an operating subsidiary... that the grants of those powers are normally preemptive of rather than preempted by State law."
2006.05-1342,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3159.098,3163.566,"That was an effort of the State to prohibit the national bank from engaging in the activity, correct?"
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3163.566,3164.835,"--Well, that was."
2006.05-1342,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3165.368,3167.286,That's an obvious case of conflict preemption.
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3172.488,3174.957,--But the Court's decisions aren't limited to prohibitions of that sort.
2006.05-1342,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3206.828,3208.696,What comes next?
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3230.444,3235.098,"No, not if you're talking about corporate powers, because those are governed by State law."
2006.05-1342,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3246.637,3269.919,"What troubles me, and maybe you can answer to it more specifically than you have, is that the core function of a banking regulatory agency is the visitation power, and the Banking Act makes it very clear that there is visitation power to national banks and makes it very clear that there is not for subsidiaries."
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3286.697,3289.38,"With respect, Justice Scalia, I don't think the statutes say that at all."
2006.05-1342,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3324.72,3329.107,Why should we assume that they wanted to preempt state laws to that extent.
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3329.107,3337.295,Because what Congress was trying to do is to make sure that the OCC had exclusive visitorial authority with respect to the conduct of national bank function.
2006.05-1342,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3391.78,3400.469,"Practically, is there any difference between the way they operated when they were just a corporation as before, and now a parent and sub?"
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3400.469,3401.503,"Well, there could be."
2006.05-1342,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3444.581,3457.739,"Is there any aspect of state law, including liability limitation, that they want to take advantage of by establishing a subsidiary chartered under state law, Michigan or another state, and yet they're claiming immunity from all other state regulations?"
2006.05-1342,2,42056,sri_srinivasan,,3457.739,3468.98,"Well, with respect to liability limitation in particular, Mr. Chief Justice, I should clarify that veil piercing principles and things of that sort would be governed by state law with respect to the operating subsidiary."
2006.05-1342,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3489.31,3490.176,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.05-1342,3,21971,e_john_blanchard,,3492.562,3497.049,Two key points.
2006.05-1342,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3576.382,3577.265,"Thank you, Mr. Blanchard."
