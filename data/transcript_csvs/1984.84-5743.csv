1984.84-5743,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.294,We'll hear arguments next in Baldwin against Alabama.
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,70.996,74.119,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-5743,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,195.368,201.202,"Mr. Carroll, has the scheme been changed since that in effect at the time this all took place?"
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,201.202,202.834,"It has, Justice Blackmun."
1984.84-5743,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,272.328,274.301,Let me back up a little bit.
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,282.456,293.002,"The options that the jury has are, they may, if they find that a defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of capital murder, then they must mandatorily sentence the defendant to death."
1984.84-5743,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,293.002,294.134,In a separate proceeding?
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,294.134,296.685,"In the same proceeding, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-5743,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,394.689,400.483,"Well, the jury doesn't have any standards to apply in imposing the death penalty."
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,406.858,408.428,That's exactly correct.
1984.84-5743,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,408.428,409.52,That's not standardless.
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,409.52,410.922,"Well, it's standardless in the sense--"
1984.84-5743,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,410.922,415.013,That's about as clear a standard as I can imagine.
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,420.746,427.732,"--Well, it is but then again it isn't, because it suffers from the flaws that mandatory death sentences have suffered from in the past when this Court--"
1984.84-5743,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,427.732,430.413,"But then the judge has another crack at it, doesn't he?"
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,430.413,432.885,"--The judge does indeed have another crack at it, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-5743,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,432.885,434.495,And the judge knows the system.
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,440.631,443.991,"Well, he does, but then again he doesn't."
1984.84-5743,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,520.131,528.108,"Well, I think we all recognize that it's a most curious statute, the product of some legislator's convoluted mind, I would think."
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,528.108,532.779,"I think you are being kind when you call it curious, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1984.84-5743,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,806.617,807.749,"Excuse me, counsel."
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,812.812,813.703,--No.
1984.84-5743,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1015.155,1017.817,"But it is a two-step process, is it not?"
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,1017.817,1020.959,"It is indeed a two-step process, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-5743,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1032.477,1036.159,"You'd better give that to me again, just to be sure I have it."
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,1036.159,1045.155,The statute requires the sentencing judge to take into account the mandatory jury sentence of death.
1984.84-5743,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1045.155,1048.899,"That means he can accept it or reject it, doesn't it?"
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,1048.899,1061.037,"But in the process of accepting it, he is required, in order to impose a death sentence, he is required to weigh the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances, like every other statute in the country."
1984.84-5743,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1085.082,1097.469,"What if the statute provided that the judge could ignore a jury recommendation of a life sentence, rather than a death sentence?"
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,1102.454,1106.605,"No, I think the Court's clearly upheld statutes similar to that."
1984.84-5743,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1123.057,1130.281,Justice White pointed out that the standards are pretty strict here.
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,1130.281,1134.044,"Indeed he did, and as soon as that word came out of my mouth I regretted it."
1984.84-5743,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.044,1151.205,"Also, it seems to me that if the jury is just automatically required to impose the death sentence and the judge knows it, to tell him to take into consideration that the jury imposed the death sentence is like saying take into consideration the fact that the jury found him guilty."
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,1151.205,1170.227,"I think that that line of reasoning ignores two things: both the flaws of the mandatory sentencing scheme and also the fact that the jury may or may not return this mistrial, which is an option available to them under the statute."
1984.84-5743,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1187.389,1188.691,"Mr. Carroll, may I ask a question."
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,1207.063,1216.347,The judge may conduct an independent analysis into whether or not the aggravating circumstances the jury found exist.
1984.84-5743,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1234.59,1237.351,And that it outweighs any mitigating circumstances.
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,1237.351,1238.803,And that it outweighs any mitigating circumstances.
1984.84-5743,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1238.803,1242.795,And there can't be a death sentence unless there's an aggravating circumstance proved.
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,1242.795,1243.656,That's true.
1984.84-5743,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1243.656,1244.737,And found by the jury.
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,1244.737,1246.828,That's also true.
1984.84-5743,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1246.828,1247.789,Beyond a reasonable doubt.
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,1247.789,1248.818,Beyond a reasonable doubt.
1984.84-5743,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1248.818,1257.153,"Then if the judge thinks the jury went off on the wrong tangent, he can correct that error, can't he?"
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,1257.153,1260.916,"He has the ability to correct that error, that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-5743,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1269.993,1276.788,"But if he thinks they're dead wrong, how much weight do you suppose the judge will give to it?"
1984.84-5743,0,29710,john_l_carroll,,1276.788,1283.212,"If he thinks they're dead wrong, then arguably he would have the ability to set aside that sentence."
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,1295.709,1300.203,Mr. Chief Justice--
1984.84-5743,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1300.203,1301.603,Mr. Carnes.
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,1301.603,1303.816,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1984.84-5743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1547.163,1548.596,May I ask this one question.
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,1588.942,1597.987,It depends on whether there is any mitigating circumstance established either by the evidence at the guilt stage or by the evidence at sentence stage.
1984.84-5743,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1697.921,1701.274,"Well, were there mitigating circumstances in this case?"
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,1701.274,1703.064,--There was only one mitigating circumstance.
1984.84-5743,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.064,1706.157,"Well, but nevertheless there was one and the judge weighed it?"
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,1706.157,1707.088,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-5743,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1707.088,1710.32,So we're not dealing with a case where there is no mitigating circumstance?
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,1710.32,1711.532,"No, Your Honor, we are not."
1984.84-5743,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.163,1715.564,And the judge here would not have been required to impose the death penalty.
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,1715.564,1717.434,"--No, Your Honor, he certainly was not."
1984.84-5743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1749.036,1751.958,Was that also considered by the jury?
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,1751.958,1756.521,"--No, Your Honor, the jury does not make any sentencing determination and does not consider--"
1984.84-5743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1756.521,1760.825,The judge... the jury didn't consider the mitigating circumstances?
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,1760.825,1761.984,"--Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1984.84-5743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1761.984,1765.577,"And when the jury sentenced to death, that was it."
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,1765.577,1766.819,"No, Your Honor."
1984.84-5743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2161.826,2163.957,"Mr. Carnes, refresh my recollection."
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,2179.018,2179.589,Yes.
1984.84-5743,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2450.294,2452.407,"Well, what would the other grounds be?"
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,2454.839,2456.088,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.84-5743,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2462.403,2467.438,"So 44 percent of the death sentences were reversed for flaws in the sentence, not the guilt."
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,2467.438,2470.708,Flaws in the sentence and flaws in the sentencing process.
1984.84-5743,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.647,2487.15,"Or he just, he didn't weigh them correctly."
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,2487.15,2488.78,Didn't weigh them properly.
1984.84-5743,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2496.537,2499.729,Do these include cases that were sent back after Beck was decided?
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,2499.729,2500.868,"No, Your Honor."
1984.84-5743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2511.136,2515.878,In how many were the death sentences changed?
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,2515.878,2522.873,"By or under direct order of the appellate court, as opposed to as a result of a correction when it got back, only one."
1984.84-5743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2522.873,2525.344,"No, I'm talking about after it gets corrected."
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,2525.344,2529.318,"After it gets corrected, Your Honor, I do not know."
1984.84-5743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2532.628,2534.931,"Well, isn't that rather important?"
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,2534.931,2545.327,"--It is, Your Honor, except that if death is determined to be a proper sentence after the errors are corrected, I would admit that... I would contend that that's what the Constitution requires."
1984.84-5743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2549.1,2551.191,Now we go from 44 to one.
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,2551.191,2552.363,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.84-5743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2552.363,2556.026,"Well, that's my figures I get from what you said."
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,2556.026,2567.473,"Your Honor, I did not mean to imply that the Alabama Supreme Courts weren't letting anybody be sentenced to death under this, simply that they were very careful in the way they applied the review of the death sentence."
1984.84-5743,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2576.789,2579.38,"Well, I'm not hearing the Georgia case this afternoon."
1984.84-5743,1,22066,edward_earl_carnes,,2579.38,2580.181,"--Yes, sir."
1984.84-5743,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2956.266,2959.158,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Carroll?"
1984.84-5743,2,29710,john_l_carroll,,2959.158,2961.169,"I'll be very brief, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.84-5743,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3162.923,3163.494,"Thank you, gentlemen."
