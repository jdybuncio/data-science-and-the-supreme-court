1991.91-779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.299,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-779, Burlington Northern Railroad Company v. William D. Ford and Thomas L. Johnson."
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,47.291,50.894,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1991.91-779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,149.994,155.67,"And this is why, Mrs. Christian, because of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment?"
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,155.67,158.642,"This is the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, Justice Rehnquist."
1991.91-779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,158.642,173.61,"You would say, then, that there is no rational basis for distinguishing between a foreign corporation with a place of business in Montana and a corporation... Montana corporation that has a principal place of business?"
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,173.61,176.354,"That is our position, Justice Rehnquist."
1991.91-779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,211.336,217.761,"Saunders was substantially criticized and limited very shortly after it was decided, wasn't it?"
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,217.761,225.865,"The only criticism of Saunders that I'm aware of, Justice Rehnquist, occurred in the Starnes decision in a footnote."
1991.91-779,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,364.006,377.624,"Ms. Christian, if you win this case, is it sufficient for us to decree that Montana must... in effect the Montana courts must allow domestic corporations to be tried in any county?"
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,377.624,395.095,--I think that the equal protection simply demands that foreign corporations that have been admitted to do business and in fact have a place of business in the State be treated equally with domestic corporations.
1991.91-779,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,410.015,411.728,"If I may interrupt you, what do we do right now?"
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,411.728,428.258,I think the answer would be to determine that the equal protection clause requires that foreign corporations of this class be given equal treatment with domestic corporations and remand to the Montana supreme court.
1991.91-779,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,470.946,480.503,"But you think it would be open to the Montana supreme court to provide the, as it were, the more favorable alternative relief that in effect would get you out of this county."
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,480.503,497.346,"We think that it would, and we think in fact that if... to do anything else would require that they overrule their own prior decisions, holding that the residence of a domestic corporation is its principal place of business."
1991.91-779,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,507.32,514.577,"I think maybe if I may interrupt you again, maybe that's in part what was provoking my question, and I may simply be wrong about the statute."
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,528.729,531.711,"It does not appear to be that, Justice Souter."
1991.91-779,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,554.066,563.522,"So, in effect it's a question of fact, it's not something that is, as it were, within the control of the domestic corporation simply by putting the name of one town down when it files its annual return."
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,563.522,565.245,"--I think that's correct, Justice Souter."
1991.91-779,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,565.245,565.395,Okay.
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,565.395,581.197,"Now, the requirement of designating a principal place of business in the State was added to the statute just last year, after this case was litigated, and at the time that it was adopted the State also added a definition."
1991.91-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,598.43,605.636,"Well, what about a foreign corporation, as would be the case for most of them, I suppose, whose executive offices are not in the State?"
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,605.636,619.226,"Justice Scalia, we think that the concept of a principal place of business in the State is one that has received widespread recognition both in Montana and elsewhere."
1991.91-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,620.876,625.068,But Montana has given it an artificial meaning for domestic corporations.
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,635.215,637.165,--It has given it an artificial meaning.
1991.91-779,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.168,660.864,"Well, why can't it say, you know, just as with the... we'll treat it just the same as domestic corporations."
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,670.301,694.256,"I think the equality would have to reflect equal treatment related to the purposes of the venue laws, and in the context of the considerations that go into venue, a foreign corporation such as Burlington Northern that in fact has a major executive office presence in the State, even though its national headquarters is elsewhere, cannot be treated differently."
1991.91-779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,734.174,738.969,"Well, are you defining principal place of business in the State for yourself, Ms. Christian?"
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,741.172,747.166,"Certainly, Justice Rehnquist, the State would have full power to adopt any bona fide definition."
1991.91-779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,747.166,755.381,"Well, I mean, when you're talking now about Burlington Northern having a principal place of business, you're simply using your own language, so to speak."
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,755.381,758.633,"This has historical precedent in Montana, Justice Rehnquist."
1991.91-779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,758.633,761.466,I'm the Chief Justice.
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,761.466,763.429,"I apologize, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-779,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,820.286,836.287,"You're asking us, it seems to me, to say that it is rational, almost necessary, for every State to enact a scheme whereby foreign corporations have a single, principal place of business in that State."
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,868.17,901.702,"Justice Kennedy, certainly the State, as I indicated before, would have the power to set definitions for what it considers to be a principal place of business, what it considers to be enough to qualify as a principal place of business in the State, and if a particular foreign corporation's contacts with the State are not sufficient to meet that definition, then it would not fall within, but we cannot conceive of any bona fide definition that would not include Burlington Northern."
1991.91-779,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,959.331,995.185,"Yes, but you're saying that it's irrational for the State not to treat foreign corporations differently on a basis of several subclasses, and it seems to me quite plausible, quite rational, for the State to treat all foreign corporations similarly, and the only way you can make your argument is by saying that some foreign corporations have a principal place of business, but I don't know why we are required to say that the State is entitled, or is required to legislate on that narrow assumption."
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,995.185,1016.679,I think the principal established by Saunders which was carried forward in cases such as Searle v. Cohn is that in the modern world the concept of a foreign corporation includes two very distinct and very different types of corporations with respect to their relationship with the State.
1991.91-779,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1066.724,1070.315,"Ms. Christian, let me look at the other side of the coin."
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1076.159,1079.601,"--It's nationwide principal place of business is in Forth Worth, Texas."
1991.91-779,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1079.601,1083.164,Is Fort Worth... what's it doing down there?
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1099.275,1102.21,This occurred after a merger.
1991.91-779,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1115.349,1117.031,None of which had anything to do with Texas.
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1117.031,1122.014,"--That had nothing at all to do with Texas, and Burlington Northern remained in St. Paul with its headquarters there."
1991.91-779,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1139.865,1142.938,These things can really be maneuvered rather easily.
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1142.938,1171.949,"--I think as a practical matter corporations select their national headquarters and their in-State headquarters based on business realities of where it makes sense to run a business from, and in this case, for example, Hill County was chosen as Burlington Northern's principal place of business in Montana because that is in the middle of its only main line running across the State."
1991.91-779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1171.949,1173.881,"Well, what is the county seat of Hill County?"
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1173.881,1176.903,"That is Havre, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1176.903,1178.774,That's the eastern part of the State?
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1178.774,1181.855,It's approximately the center part of the State.
1991.91-779,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1192.263,1194.955,"Well, that's an old part of Montana that everybody's known about for years and years."
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1195.896,1196.707,--I beg your pardon?
1991.91-779,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1196.707,1203.702,"I say, that's an old-established town on the main line that everyone has known for years in Montana."
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1204.333,1205.164,There's nothing wrong with it.
1991.91-779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1211.358,1217.794,Is Montana just one... is Montana itself a separate division on the Burlington Northern?
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1217.794,1223.54,There is a Montana Division which includes most of the lines in Montana.
1991.91-779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1238.379,1243.454,Are there some lines which are not in the Montana Division which are geographically in Montana?
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1243.454,1246.078,"At the time that this case arose, there were."
1991.91-779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1257.36,1262.252,"More than one division, then, has geographical operations in Montana."
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1262.252,1277.663,"There are a very few lines that are still in the Denver Division at the time that this case... that is a very short trackage, down near the border, the southern border of Montana, but at the time this--"
1991.91-779,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1277.663,1277.813,Why do you--
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1277.813,1278.174,--I beg your--
1991.91-779,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1278.174,1283.269,--Why do you suppose all the lawsuits are filed in Yellowstone County?
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1283.269,1305.422,"--I think the practical answer to that, Justice O'Connor, is that plaintiffs are going into Yellowstone and Cascade Counties because they perceive, and Burlington Northern agrees with them, that the verdict that they received in those two counties is likely to be far more favorable than they would receive if they sued in Hill County--"
1991.91-779,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1305.422,1309.856,In that juries are more responsive to plaintiffs in those counties?
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1309.856,1315.72,"--Precisely, Justice O'Connor, and this is a reality of modern litigation."
1991.91-779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1353.857,1366.965,"Under your theory, could Burlington Northern move its principal place of business to a very small town in Montana, the county seat which had a reputation for very small plaintiffs' verdicts?"
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1366.965,1380.004,"I think that that would be largely precluded, and certainly limited by the simple business reality that you have to have your principal place of business in a place where it makes sense to run your business."
1991.91-779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.264,1411.266,"Ms. Christian, what... if you counted up all the foreign corporations that are doing business in Montana, how many of them... what percentage of them do you think would have what you would call a principal place of business in Montana?"
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1411.266,1414.067,"I can't really answer that, Justice White."
1991.91-779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1414.498,1420.144,I would suppose there would be a lot of them that didn't have a principal place of business in Montana.
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1420.144,1425.019,"--I think you would find some in both categories, and this is why we emphasize--"
1991.91-779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.019,1434.585,"And you wouldn't... if you were representing one of those companies that didn't have a principal place of business in Montana, you wouldn't be making this argument about them--"
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1434.585,1434.715,--Justice White--
1991.91-779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1434.715,1436.926,--They could be sued in any county in the State--
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1436.926,1437.426,--Justice White--
1991.91-779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1437.426,1437.887,--Is that right?
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1437.887,1438.608,--I think the--
1991.91-779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1438.608,1440.139,Is that right?
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1440.139,1446.823,"--It depends on how you define principal place of business, and that's rightly for the State--"
1991.91-779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1446.823,1460.652,"Well, let's just assume, then, that there are corporations doing business in Montana that do not have a principal place of business in Montana, such as your client does."
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1468.498,1477.835,"--If, under a bona fide definition of principal place of business they did not in fact have a principal place of business in Montana--"
1991.91-779,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1477.835,1478.045,Yes.
1991.91-779,0,17514,betty_jo_christian,,1478.045,1491.224,"--Then we think that they could appropriately be sued in any county, but I would reiterate that this is where, Justice White, I think we get into what Bain Peanut referred to as allowing a little play in the joints."
1991.91-779,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1553.157,1554.579,"Very well, Ms. Christian."
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1555.751,1560.525,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-779,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1586.433,1590.156,"How many States have laws like Montana's, Mr. Klein?"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1590.156,1597.672,"Justice O'Connor, the answer is that there are probably a dozen or so States that draw distinctions similar."
1991.91-779,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1623.079,1634.697,"Except for those dozen States, do the other States generally require the foreign corporation to designate a principal place of business within the State?"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1634.697,1638.14,"I don't think that's right, I think there are a handful or so that do that."
1991.91-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1715.154,1743.545,"Yes, but I mean if it were discovered that corporations... just statistically it happens to be true that corporations whose names begin in Z, many more of those have such headquarters than corporations that begin with other letters, you wouldn't allow a law that said only those corporations whose names begin in Z can be sued solely where their chief headquarters are."
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1743.545,1746.597,That's because the preliminary criteria is absolutely arbitrary.
1991.91-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.597,1761.458,"Well, that's right, but why isn't it... if... why isn't it just as arbitrary to say well, just because it happens that domestic corporations are more likely to have a headquarters, why do you have to write off those that aren't domestic but do have a headquarters?"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1761.458,1764.052,"Because it seems me, Justice Scalia, we don't write them off."
1991.91-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1767.885,1772.069,"I suggest not, any more than with corporations whose names begin in Z."
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1772.069,1774.943,"Well, let me see if I can develop the distinction."
1991.91-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.949,1854.719,"Excuse me, I... is that all it takes to be rational, is to pick some factor that puts the majority of people in that classification so that you could pick, you know, males with blue eyes, and if that happens to correspond to a majority of situations, that's a rational classification, even though you could just as readily identify the particular individuals with the characteristic you're concerned about, such as residence?"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1854.719,1856.86,--I think you put your finger on the distinction.
1991.91-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.482,1871.522,That is likely to be true.
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1872.133,1873.595,But that seems to be--
1991.91-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.595,1881.42,"If there are other companies that just as well have their principal place of business in the State, why do you have to write them off?"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1881.42,1882.932,"--Well, it's not a question of writing it off."
1991.91-779,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1993.996,2002.812,"Well, does Montana, though, require a foreign corporation to designate some place in Montana as a principal place of residence?"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2002.812,2004.112,That is not the case.
1991.91-779,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2025.356,2036.195,There... does Montana law provide for the designation of someone in the State on whom suit can be served?
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2036.195,2036.654,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-779,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2036.654,2042.817,"And that's a matter of public notice, and anyone can easily find that, I suppose."
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2042.817,2052.264,"That's correct, and in this instance... that's an interesting point, Justice O'Connor, because in this instance Burlington Northern, for example, has its registered agent in Helena, Montana."
1991.91-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.791,2137.623,"I don't understand Burlington Northern to be saying that you have to pick a certain criterion, nor do I understand that to have been what Saunders said, but why isn't it reasonable to say look, corporations are artificial entities... they don't really exist anywhere."
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2170.028,2171.729,That may be a rational rule.
1991.91-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2177.655,2177.786,You're quite right.
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2183.412,2194.792,"--I think the two reasons, Justice Scalia, are 1) that domestic corporations, because they have their executive offices, literally do have a functional residence."
1991.91-779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2281.998,2298.137,"Mr. Klein, can I interrupt you right on that point about, isn't it not possible that a corporation in Montana could designate Helena as its principal place when it incorporates and have its corporate office there for that purpose, but in fact have its major commercial offices located at the other end of the State?"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2298.137,2299.87,"I think that's possible, but I think--"
1991.91-779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2299.87,2302.241,"If that were true, which would be the principal place of business?"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2302.241,2305.192,"--Helena would be the principal place, where it has its executive offices."
1991.91-779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2305.192,2308.125,"Where it designated in its charter, even though the president in fact worked in the--"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2308.125,2309.424,"Oh, I think... I don't know--"
1991.91-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2309.424,2319.612,"--It's just, you can set up a Delaware corporation and have the necessary papers filed down there to have that your headquarters for corporate purposes but yet you really run your business out of Detroit or some place."
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2319.612,2320.773,"--No, I misunderstood your question."
1991.91-779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2326.668,2340.419,"Right, so it's even true within Montana that you could have the same kind of... for a domestic corporation you have the same situation you could have for a foreign corporation, where it designates a registered agent in Helena but it actually has all its corporate business run out of another city."
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2340.419,2344.422,But in fact the way that works is that you get sued at that other city.
1991.91-779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.675,2361.514,"Then I don't understand the difference as you explained it to Justice Scalia when you posited each, the domestic and the foreign, could have the same situation with a designated registered agent in town A but have most of their business in town B."
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2361.514,2371.811,"--No, my point is not... is where the difference that I'm relying on, I'd like to make it clear, is where are the executive officers of the corporation."
1991.91-779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2380.438,2383.911,Then why isn't that true of a division in Montana also?
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2383.911,2388.956,"It may or may not be, but you have to understand we're talking about two classes of corporations."
1991.91-779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2388.956,2396.482,"I understand, and we're also talking about Montana, but the same rule presumably could apply to Michigan or New York as well, where you have, you know, the same kind of problems."
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2396.482,2421.189,"I think it could and I think it does, but the difference is, as a class of corporations, if we know the following thing, that they have an office in the State, is there reason to think that that office is a litigation hub in the same way that there is to think that an executive office where the people who ultimately must answer for the corporation are located, and I think it's not, and I think Montana simply says it's rational for us to conclude we've got two categories."
1991.91-779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2440.135,2445.168,"We're primarily concerned with out-of-State plaintiffs and out-of-State torts for the most part, I take it."
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2446.159,2447.861,--I don't think that's correct.
1991.91-779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.549,2459.719,I understand.
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2459.719,2466.314,"And I think that their suggestion that there's somehow... there's some floodgate of out-of-State litigation is, as I think we--"
1991.91-779,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2466.314,2470.807,"Well, certainly the plaintiff didn't pick this forum because it was most convenient to the plaintiff."
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2474.32,2478.724,"--That's not... as a matter of fact, that happens not to be correct, Justice Stevens."
1991.91-779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.542,2510.131,"Mr. Klein, do you think the equal protection standard was properly stated in Saunders?"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2526.791,2529.362,"That's not the current standard, Justice White."
1991.91-779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2529.362,2540.481,--So do you think that Montana's law could pass the standard stated in Saunders?
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2540.481,2542.252,"I do, but I don't think it has to."
1991.91-779,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2638.523,2644.997,"Mr. Klein, what if you have a Delaware corporation that has its principal... it's headquarters in Montana?"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2648.881,2652.674,"The answer to that question, frankly, is not directly posed by this case."
1991.91-779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2721.52,2730.035,"Well, Mr. Klein, I take it that a Montana corporation with its principal place of business in a particular county can only be sued there, is that it?"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2730.035,2730.405,That's exactly right.
1991.91-779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2730.405,2740.422,"Why should a corporation, just because it's foreign, be capable of being sued in just any county?"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2740.422,2744.136,Because I think the justifications for limiting venues--
1991.91-779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.136,2762.638,"Well, I know, it may be that it's very convenient to sue a domestic corporation at their principal place of business, but does it necessary follow that a foreign corporation that doesn't have a principal place of business in Montana can be sued anywhere?"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2762.638,2765.658,"--It doesn't necessarily follow, Justice White, I'm... what I think--"
1991.91-779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2765.658,2768.482,"Well, that's... I take it it has to follow--"
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2768.482,2769.862,--I think it follows this way--
1991.91-779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.862,2770.163,--According to your argument.
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2770.163,2771.285,"--Well, I think it follows in part."
1991.91-779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2783.963,2802.126,"Why shouldn't the equal protection clause say that if you only allow a domestic corporation to be sued in one county a foreign corporation may only be sued in one county, and a foreign corporation is entitled to state where it can pick out a county that it can be sued in."
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2802.126,2804.607,--Because I think that would say to the State--
1991.91-779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2804.607,2807.81,Or the State may designate a county to be sued in.
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2807.81,2813.156,"--Well, there are two things: one is, can the State designate it, the other is, can the foreign corporation designate it."
1991.91-779,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2820.862,2823.844,"Well, that's what... you've let the domestic corporation pick a place."
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2823.844,2828.468,"--We let them pick a place, Justice White, because that's where they had their executive offices."
1991.91-779,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2828.598,2834.434,"Well, is that true... you say there's never been any litigation on this."
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2845.333,2858.781,--The only thing to prevent you from saying that is the language in the Montana supreme court opinion that says it's the principal place of business and that term has not been designated in the code.
1991.91-779,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2879.894,2886.439,But there's no designation made in the corporate papers or in any other filing by the corporation.
1991.91-779,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,2886.439,2896.247,"Until this year, you designated exactly where your president, vice president and secretary and treasurer were, so that would be, in fact, where your place of business was."
1991.91-779,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2918.462,2920.505,"Thank you, Mr. Klein."
1991.91-779,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,2922.768,2931.854,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.91-779,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3008.116,3008.267,"Well, if--"
1991.91-779,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3008.267,3008.978,If you need the records--
1991.91-779,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3008.978,3011.259,"--Ms. Christian, it depends on the kind of case, really."
1991.91-779,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3025.43,3050.455,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and our point is simply this that in terms of selecting... of identifying convenience generally, the convenience in terms of State district court litigation needs to focus primarily on the convenience of logistics in running the trial, not upon in particular... where particular individuals would be."
1991.91-779,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3051.276,3052.047,You say it has to.
1991.91-779,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3058.321,3063.467,"Mr. Chief Justice, Montana has complete discretion as to whether even to consider convenience or not."
1991.91-779,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3153.266,3153.416,One question.
1991.91-779,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3153.416,3153.867,Yes.
1991.91-779,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3153.867,3159.78,Did you consider arguing that this venue statute violated the commerce clause?
1991.91-779,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3159.78,3170.699,"Traditionally, Justice Thomas, this Court has considered venue laws, challenges to venue laws, under the equal protection clause rather than the commerce clause."
1991.91-779,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3194.836,3196.368,"Thank you, Ms. Christian."
1991.91-779,2,17514,betty_jo_christian,,3197.499,3197.7,Thank you.
