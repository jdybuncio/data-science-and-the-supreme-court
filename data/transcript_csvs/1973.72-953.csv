1973.72-953,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,18.402,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-953, O’Shea against Littleton."
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,20.753,23.667,"Thank you Your Honor, may it please the Court."
1973.72-953,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,108.642,113.221,"Mr. O’Rourke, just to help me at least to keep this cast of characters --"
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,113.221,113.79,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-953,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,113.79,118.873,"-- which is rather extensive here, clearly in mind."
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,130.393,131.382,"No, sir he was not."
1973.72-953,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,131.382,139.342,"-- the case began and Berbling, the man who allegedly committed all these acts is out of office, is that correct?"
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,139.342,141.009,That’s correct Your Honor.
1973.72-953,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,157.25,160.35,"Are they related, brothers or father and son or?"
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,160.35,164.002,"I believe that they are husband and wife, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,168.166,169.025,May I interrupt you once more?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,169.025,169.606,Certainly.
1973.72-953,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,169.606,184.993,"Is it clear from your point of view at least that none of the allegations against Spomer, the present District Attorney, that are no allegations of misconduct against him."
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,184.993,186.015,"No, sir."
1973.72-953,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,187.89,189.41,It's that predecessor and no one else?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,189.41,195.652,That’s correct and the contention is that the office will in the future in somewhat discriminate.
1973.72-953,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,195.652,199.422,So that this is injunctive relief running against an office rather than a person is?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,199.422,200.903,"That’s correct, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,200.903,203.78,"While in the judge’s case, Mrs. Spomer, Judge Spomer."
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,203.78,204.247,Yes.
1973.72-953,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,204.247,207.04,"She -- the allegations run against her, did they not?"
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,207.04,208.012,"Yes, they do."
1973.72-953,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,208.012,211.408,And also as to Magistrate O’Shea?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,211.408,212.182,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-953,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,212.182,219.092,So in that case at least the injunction runs against people based on their alleged misconduct?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,219.092,222.99,"Well, that’s a contention that we don’t agree with, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,225.389,227.063,Right.
1973.72-953,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,227.063,230.954,The Chief Justice’s inquiry relates to the next case rather than to this one?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,230.954,233.385,"That’s correct, Justice."
1973.72-953,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,611.154,612.161,Mr. O’Rourke.
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,612.161,613.109,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1973.72-953,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,613.109,619.376,"As I understand the argument, you’re making out -- you go beyond really a position that Judge Dillon took in dissent."
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,634.434,638.045,"No, I don’t say that if the Court please, I don’t mean to lead that impression."
1973.72-953,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,662.594,667.323,So that there you wouldn’t have the overhanging threat of a contempt citation in your --
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,667.323,668.253,"No, sir we would not."
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1164.736,1199.549,"What about the Federal Court adjoining a state criminal proceeding in a 1983 action -- 1983 action in Federal Court alleging that the state criminal proceeding deprives the defendant of some constitutional right, alleging harassment or a false charge or something like that, Dombrowski type of situation, and the Federal Court holding within the wholly consistently with the Younger, enjoins the state criminal prosecution."
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1203.037,1205.322,"Yes, there is a difference if the Court please."
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1205.322,1207.676,He can just work on the parties?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1207.676,1216.608,"Well, there, there is the prohibitory injunction again and here the injunction has come down from the Seventh Circuit as a mandatory type of thing."
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1216.608,1223.457,"Well, is there something in -- nothing in Pierson that says that prohibitory injunction can be entered either?"
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1223.457,1223.837,"No, sir."
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.791,1226.576,"Well, how do you distinguish that?"
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1226.576,1243.322,It has been distinguished in the various courts but we indicate that the essence of the rule of judicial immunity is the freedom of judge from the threat of individual punishment in the event that a different Court should decide that its judgment wasn’t correct in the first place.
1973.72-953,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1257.622,1275.273,"I suppose if a state Court judge is enjoined along the line of Justice White’s question from carrying out of certain prosecution even though, he may be enjoin by name there's no doubt as to what is duty as under the terms of that injunction."
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1288.742,1290.241,"Yes, that’s correct Your Honor."
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1290.241,1294.195,"Well, it doesn’t sound much like an immunity argument."
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1297.346,1300.021,"Well, we maintained there is a scope of limited argument here too."
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1300.021,1301.792,Which you are now making it sounds to me like.
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1301.792,1304.897,"Both of them, if the Court please."
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1313.953,1318.548,"Now, do you concede that the judge is not a immune from a --"
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1318.548,1320.764,A prohibitory injunction?
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1320.764,1321.354,Yes.
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1321.354,1324.681,"Which prohibits him from a doing a certain acts, yes certainly."
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1324.681,1326.799,Except to identify but you concede that?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1326.799,1329.079,"I would concede that, yes sir."
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1332.963,1334.286,Or do concede there’s a case of --
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1334.286,1335.322,Not the former ministerial duty.
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.322,1348.256,You can see there is a case -- constitutional case of controversy alleged in these actions?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1348.256,1348.55,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1358.506,1360.081,But how about the plaintiffs in the case?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1366.259,1368.839,Not as far as the defendant judges are concerned.
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1368.839,1370.12,And why it is –
1973.72-953,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1370.12,1372.247,Even if all the facts were true?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1372.247,1374.052,"Even if all the facts were true, yes sir."
1973.72-953,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1374.052,1374.393,And how could --
1973.72-953,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1374.393,1376.935,And what remedy would they have?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1376.935,1379.552,"The remedy is here if the Court please, there is no specific --"
1973.72-953,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1379.552,1381.931,"Or I should say, what, if any?"
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1381.931,1388.22,There is no specific allegation against either one of these judges as to a discriminatory act --
1973.72-953,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1388.22,1389.836,But suppose it was?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1389.836,1390.734,It’s merely conclusionary --
1973.72-953,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1390.734,1392.82,Would your argument be the same?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1392.82,1393.814,"No, there are number of remedy --"
1973.72-953,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1393.814,1410.386,"Suppose the allegations were that he sentenced eight people all involve for crap shooting in the same game that gave the four white as suspended sense, and gave the four Negroes five years."
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1410.386,1410.617,There is --
1973.72-953,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1410.617,1412.561,Can you make the same argument?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1412.561,1413.254,Yes sir because they --
1973.72-953,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1413.254,1415.629,And that he did that everyday in a week?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1417.136,1418.966,"Yes sir, there would be --"
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.966,1426.709,"What about, but you would at least insist that one of the Negroes who was -- who suffered from a discriminatory sentence be a plaintiff?"
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1426.709,1426.821,"Yes, --"
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1426.821,1430.191,You wouldn't any member of the public bringing the action?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1430.191,1430.975,That’s correct.
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1430.975,1434.534,"And that’s -- and then here it’s just any members of public, isn’t it?"
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1441.759,1443.72,"Yes, it’s correct Your Honor."
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1443.72,1447.249,"Well, how isn’t that you special argument in these cases?"
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1447.249,1452.653,"It would be, except that we wanted to get into the question of judicial immunity because we feel --"
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1452.653,1455.871,"I know you wanted it, but we have a jurisdictional problem at the outset?"
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1455.871,1458.321,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1460.699,1462.243,"Well, I don’t want to get back to that yet."
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1467.65,1470.74,"I say there's not, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1470.74,1475.585,But if we disagree with you then you make your argument about that.
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1475.585,1477.531,Right.
1973.72-953,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1494.552,1497.728,Can you give me a citation of such a case?
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1497.728,1498.486,"No, sir I don’t have --"
1973.72-953,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1498.486,1500.236,I’ve been looking for one a long time.
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1500.488,1501.455,I don’t have one.
1973.72-953,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1501.455,1503.491,Alright.
1973.72-953,0,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,1503.491,1528.386,"Also to get to the question of the -- Constitution of the United States provides an Article 4, Section 4 that the United States shall guarantee to every State, a Republican form of Government, essential to the concept of Republican form of Government is the state judiciary remain free to pass upon its own laws without fear of District Court’s surveillance."
1973.72-953,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1556.436,1562.686,Very well Mr. O’Rourke.
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1567.193,1570.383,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-953,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1628.882,1634.71,What is the -- of the main plaintiffs which one suffered from this alleged practices?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1634.71,1636.121,"Several of them have, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1660.81,1663.333,And how were they deprived?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1663.333,1670.365,"They were deprived in the one, an unofficial bond schedule is used when the defendant is obliged."
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1670.365,1671.087,Well are any --
1973.72-953,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1671.087,1672.651,Is the main plaintiff not the defendant?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1672.651,1677.359,"Yes, Your Honor but we have not specifically named them in the complaint."
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1677.359,1679.183,"Well, how can you rely on it?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1679.183,1688.426,Because we have named in general in the allegation that the plaintiffs have individually been deprived of the rights that we further alleged.
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1688.426,1690.773,What did your class include?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1690.773,1704.796,"It includes, the named plaintiffs in the class are the black persons in Cairo who have been -- who were similarly situated in a -- who have been similarly deprived of the kinds of rights that we are alleging here."
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1704.796,1710.716,"But what class is that, all of the Negroes?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1710.716,1714.737,It would be a class -- it would be basically the black persons of Cairo.
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1714.737,1715.731,All of them?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1715.731,1717.024,Yes.
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1731.66,1737.757,"Well, where is the provision that the main plaintiffs were denied their rights?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1737.757,1749.072,"In paragraphs 1, we state that this is a civil action insofar as the judges are concerned for equitable relief."

1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1754.65,1755.972,15 of what?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1755.972,1758.108,Paragraph 1 of the appendix.
1973.72-953,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1758.108,1759.711,It's two appendix.
1973.72-953,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1759.711,1769.422,"The two appendices -- I was on -- we are now in the judges’ case and that appendix -- well, and these are two appendices?"
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1769.422,1776.745,"Yes, I think the one."
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1781.097,1792.744,"Well, Your Honor in the paragraph 1 of the complaint which is on page 15, we indicate, we allege that the plaintiffs and members of their class have been deprived of certain rights."
1973.72-953,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1814.771,1818.963,You have 19 named plaintiffs.

1973.72-953,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1838.181,1841.113,"I know, but the main plaintiffs are 19 in number."
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1841.113,1842.257,"Yes, I understand."
1973.72-953,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1862.342,1865.511,Each of the 19 was affected by the conduct of one or the other?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1865.511,1866.316,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1866.316,1869.334,Because involved in some criminal charge?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1869.334,1869.88,Yes.
1973.72-953,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1869.88,1870.623,Each of the 19?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1870.623,1879.754,Either a criminal charge or in the case of the states attorney that he sought to have relief in the criminal courts which been denied.
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1879.754,1883.839,Where is that in his reply what you just said?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1883.839,1892.259,Your Honor and the I would submit that we are intending by our allegation on page 15 of paragraph and --
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1892.259,1899.198,"Well, what in there says that these people have been bailable or have been arrested on anything?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1899.198,1908.398,"We -- in paragraph 3 (c), which would encompass in the language of that paragraph the named plaintiffs as well."
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1934.077,1950.599,Where is it in this complaint that it says that anyone of these plaintiffs has ever been subjected to denial of bail?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1950.599,1974.617,"Paragraph 35 Your Honor of the complaint at page 29 I believe of the appendix we state, with respect to the judges that they have deprived and continue to deprive plaintiffs and members of their class of the rights to due process and then process and then in Fourteenth Amendment and then --"
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1974.617,1979.715,Denial due process includes how many different things?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1979.715,1980.615,But we are talking about --
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1980.615,1984.219,But mine was the denial of bail?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1984.219,1984.989,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1984.989,1991.769,"Mine was, where do you say that any one of the main plaintiffs were denied bail because of his race?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1991.769,1996.929,"In paragraph 36, we are not referring to denied bail, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1996.929,1998.171,Well you said so?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,1998.171,1998.465,What I meant --
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1998.465,2003.027,You said that each of these people had been denied bail or something else?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2003.027,2007.16,"No, they are discriminated in the setting of bail and that these judges were all --"
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2007.16,2013.565,"Well, where can say that any one of these the plaintiffs were discriminated against in the setting of bail?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2013.565,2037.142,"Paragraph 36 Your Honor “A” we say, in a preface to A that the judges have denied and continued to denied to plaintiffs and members of their class, the constitutional rights in the following ways and then “A” is our bail situation, where they -- the judges are following a non-official bond schedule that has been established to apply the blacks."
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2037.142,2042.571,"Well, can you get it on the “B” and on the information and belief they were denied bail?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2042.571,2045.674,Under “B” Your Honor refers to the sentences.
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2045.674,2055.26,"Well, was that -- do you think that you can allege that on information and belief, you were sentenced unconstitutionally?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2055.26,2055.572,The problem --
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2055.572,2057.962,Do you allege that on information and belief?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2057.962,2058.786,The problem --
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2058.786,2061.132,"You alleged that, did you know or you didn’t know it?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2061.132,2062.692,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2074.835,2076.632,Which one of the plaintiffs?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2076.632,2077.132,Your --
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2077.132,2079.063,Which one of the plaintiffs?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2079.063,2084.687,"If your -- Your Honor, I submit that we have in general covered that by stating the plaintiffs."
1973.72-953,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2117.145,2123.852,"But now, you do specify some individuals at least with respect to the prosecutor defendants?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2123.852,2124.343,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2124.343,2131.769,"And some episodes and examples are spelled out in some little detail in your complaint, but none of those people were named plaintiffs, were they?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2131.769,2132.534,"Yes, they are."
1973.72-953,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2132.534,2132.978,They are?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2132.978,2134.559,Yes.
1973.72-953,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2141.288,2145.322,"Well, Is there Hazel James for example?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2145.322,2147.59,Yes.
1973.72-953,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2147.59,2150.639,And the --
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2150.639,2155.587,"James Martin is a plaintiff, James Wilson is a plaintiff."
1973.72-953,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2155.587,2158.348,That’s in the Berbling complaint?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2158.348,2164.039,"Yes but, Your Honor, we have filed simply one complaint which covered all of the defendants."
1973.72-953,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2205.33,2225.139,"Well, you can see though our problem can’t you Mr. Wiseman, here the Seventh Circuit has decided some very complex legal questions and your complaint is at best it seems to me ambiguous as to whether any of your particular plaintiffs in the judges’ case has actually suffered these deprivations themselves?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2225.139,2245.921,"I think Your Honor, one way the Seventh Circuit handled that with respect to some of our allegations going to Mr. Berbling, whose petition is pending before this Court is that that we could have the right to amend our complaint if necessary, if the District Court found that it was necessary in that context."
1973.72-953,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2254.032,2268.467,"Counsel, you don’t want us to decide a case on the basis of the judicial notice that judges in Chicago take up some things that are going on in Illinois, do you?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2268.467,2279.65,I don’t think it is necessary Your Honor because I think in our complaint we have alleged in part what is happening in Cairo that there is a considerable amount of tension between whites and blacks.
1973.72-953,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2313.374,2315.028,"Well, that’s all set out in complaint."
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2333.829,2335.284,Your Honor --
1973.72-953,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2335.284,2340.27,And that takes us -- so we accept and assume that but that still doesn’t solve some of the problems in this case.
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2340.27,2341.476,Right.
1973.72-953,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2341.476,2371.567,"Given the -- what you just suggested about the flexibility and liberality of pleading under the federal rules, I'm surprised you don’t argue that what your complaint says when you refer to plaintiffs that it should be read as meaning the plaintiffs and each of the plaintiffs or that there is an implied adjective each plaintiff and then at least we get on to the heart of some of the other problems in the case."
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2380.473,2385.312,"I believe I would adopt the language that you are suggesting, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.285,2546.256,Intentionally and willingly?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2546.256,2550.407,"Yes, and willfully and in a pattern and practice case."
1973.72-953,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2578.62,2593.046,Would -- would the act she want him to -- the judge to be enjoined from performing via crime under federal law?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2593.046,2593.497,I --
1973.72-953,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.497,2598.161,"In case of the use of race to impose a higher penalty is a crime, isn’t it?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2598.486,2602.596,I believe it would be under the prin -- but I'm not sure of that Your Honor.
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2636.6,2646.311,"Has there ever been a direct appeal or state habeas on this question, involving a particular defendant?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2646.311,2647.799,I don’t know Your Honor.
1973.72-953,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2678.954,2681.466,Will that be less so you get to trial on this case?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2681.466,2689.235,"It will not be less so on this case, but if we prevail on this case and prove our facts that should end the problem."
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2712.536,2716.944,"You really want an injunction against future prosecutions, do you want that?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2716.944,2717.599,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2717.933,2721.663,Do you want the Federal Court injunction against future state prosecutions?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2721.663,2722.323,No.
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2736.531,2740.14,But he takes the oath not to do that?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2740.14,2745.705,"Your Honor, that’s right but in -- we are charging that this judges have violated that oath."
1973.72-953,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2745.705,2757.905,You want him under threat of a contempt if they do to try out on a contempt action whenever you might want to claim that he has used race in imposition of a sentence.
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2757.905,2758.469,"Your Honor, I --"
1973.72-953,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2758.469,2759.901,Intentionally and knowingly?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2759.901,2778.182,"I would suggest, one, that if a judge does violate the Federal Court order of that nature intentionally and willfully and not inadvertently, then he should be subjected to the contempt powers of the court."
1973.72-953,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2840.309,2854.579,"May I ask you at this point, who would be entitled under your definition of the class or classes here to come in and request a contempt citation for the judge?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2864.227,2864.69,Blacks.
1973.72-953,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2864.69,2867.784,All black citizens.
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2884.055,2885.3,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2928.859,2932.506,"Yes, but who would enforce that?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2942.124,2954.575,The named plaintiffs and members of the classes ultimately determined by the District Court could come in again and request that the court issue a show cause order.
1973.72-953,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2967.052,2969.065,What's the population of Cairo?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2969.065,2975.975,"It is a population of 6,000 people approximately, 35% to 40% of them are black."
1973.72-953,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2975.975,2983.792,What percentage roughly would you estimate would be categorized as financially poor?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,2983.792,2985.515,That I'm not certain Your Honor.
1973.72-953,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2995.96,2998.575,"Well, obviously you have a serious problem there."
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,3012.125,3034.389,"I believe Your Honor, that would be something that should be best reserved for the District Court after letting us have our day in Court which we have not yet had and then the District Court would be in a position to fashion the relief which would determine who could bring an action for a show cause order."
1973.72-953,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3075.759,3089.071,"You haven’t suggested us yet, at least, I don’t think I heard you say that just as yet, why the Appellate Courts of the State of Illinois can’t deal with this problem?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,3089.071,3091.074,"There are several problems, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3103.16,3113.225,Does the Supreme Court of Illinois have supervisory power under the Illinois’ Constitution and practice?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,3113.225,3120.534,It’s not clear Your Honor whether the Supreme Court of Illinois could mandamus these judges in the span of time.
1973.72-953,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3120.534,3124.307,Haven’t they exercised supervisory power in such cases?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,3124.307,3127.245,"Yes, Your Honor, but it has involved the different kind of issue."
1973.72-953,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3135.506,3139.124,Don’t you characterize this as misbehavior of the judge?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,3139.124,3145.626,"Yes, I do Your Honor, but I don’t believe that it’s clear under Illinois law that the Illinois Supreme Court could intervene."
1973.72-953,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3146.775,3155.557,"But don’t you think that there are some, under federal concepts of federalism, there some obligation to find that out first?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,3155.557,3167.949,"Your Honor, if I -- it would be necessary for me to go outside the record to explain the efforts that have been made in the state system."
1973.72-953,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3205.476,3209.473,What is the -- why does -- what happened to your damage claim?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,3209.473,3214.413,"Your Honor, our damage claim was against the State’s Attorney Mr. Berbling."
1973.72-953,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3278.78,3289.413,"Mr. Wiseman, am I right in thinking that you don’t within the limits of your complaint allege any efforts to pursue state court remedies such as appeal?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,3289.413,3291.227,That is correct Your Honor.
1973.72-953,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3309.422,3327.289,Let’s assume now that a state criminal prosecution is pending against one or more the named plaintiffs at the time you filed this action and you could have raised these claims in that state prosecution?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,3327.289,3335.246,"I would -- first Your Honor, we did not do that, but if we had, I would suggest that it would have been --"
1973.72-953,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3335.246,3358.942,"I think that you’ve say that all these plaintiffs except I don’t know that you claim this about the white plaintiffs, but let’s assume that all these plaintiffs you allege were involved in a criminal prosecution insofar as the allegations against the judge is concerned they must have been and they must have been, you claim that they were discriminated against in there criminal prosecutions?"
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,3358.942,3360.471,But we would --
1973.72-953,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.471,3365.96,And you could’ve raised these very claims in those state criminal prosecutions?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,3365.96,3369.048,The problem with that Your Honor is twofold.
1973.72-953,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3413.959,3421.553,So you think a class action like this where you look into the future is another exception to the Younger against Harris.
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,3421.553,3424.411,"In the circumstances of this case yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3424.411,3425.758,You mean in a pattern?
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,3425.758,3428.088,"Yes, in a pattern and practice case."
1973.72-953,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3428.088,3443.646,Don’t you think that at least there is a possibility that if the Supreme Court of Illinois repeatedly reversed these judges and that they were saying that they were in fact guilty of what you charge them with that they would stop doing that?M
1973.72-953,1,17285,alan_m_wiseman,,3443.646,3452.225,"No, Your Honor, I think that considering the history of Cairo that is not reasonable to expect that they would do that."
1973.72-953,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3462.919,3464.145,Thank you Mr. Wiseman.
1973.72-953,2,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,3466.434,3469.166,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1973.72-953,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3576.902,3584.589,"If this pleading is not specific enough, what about its amendment?"
1973.72-953,2,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,3584.589,3587.933,They have already amended once if the Court please and we --
1973.72-953,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3587.933,3590.224,"Well, how about amending the second time?"
1973.72-953,2,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,3590.224,3592.049,"Well, that might be possible."
1973.72-953,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3593.942,3594.277,"Well, I --"
1973.72-953,2,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,3594.277,3600.765,We think that if they got specific as far as the State’s Attorney Berbling is concerned and point out specific acts of discrimination.
1973.72-953,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3600.765,3617.605,"Well, but that’s against the judges as I understand Mr. Wiseman’s argument and they have the information which would identify which named plaintiffs were affected by which of the defendant judges, so he told us?"
1973.72-953,2,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,3617.605,3628.114,I would say that in those specific instances if there where such specific instance that the remedies we have within our state court system would be able to take care of that.
1973.72-953,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3629.716,3631.211,"Well, that’s another argument, but as --"
1973.72-953,2,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,3631.211,3631.471,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-953,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3631.471,3640.921,-- as for the sufficiency of the pleadings what he in effect told us I gather is it he could amend this to specify everything?
1973.72-953,2,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,3640.921,3641.468,That’s possible.
1973.72-953,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3641.468,3642.35,"So he said, yes."
1973.72-953,2,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,3642.35,3643.116,Yes sir.
1973.72-953,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3643.116,3658.069,"Well, this -- what do you want to say about the suggestion I made to counsel after the reading and the pleadings the way we tend to read them in the federal -- under the federal rules that plaintiffs means each plaintiff?"
1973.72-953,2,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,3658.069,3671.8,This goes with the argument I started to make if the Court please that if they got specific in 11 specific instances as far as the State’s Attorney is concerned that they could very easily have gotten specific as far as the judges’ concerned.
1973.72-953,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3678.784,3698.157,"Well, of course that’s all speculation about whether they can, but if we were to read this complaint as meaning each plaintiff, do you regard this is the large issue in this case, the pleading issue or is the underlying issue more important?"
1973.72-953,2,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,3698.157,3713.016,"Well, that’s one of the issues that if the Court please, the underlying -- the most important issue we can contend is the underlying issue of the state supervision by the Federal District Court on a continuing basis."
1973.72-953,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3714.215,3720.366,"Well, in part of that of course is that you claim that these defendants are simply immune?"
1973.72-953,2,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,3720.366,3720.724,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-953,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3724.184,3725.146,Right and that would ended --
1973.72-953,2,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,3725.146,3728.086,-- the relief as far as a mandatory type of action --
1973.72-953,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3728.086,3740.107,"And if you’re correct in that proposition and of course that ends it and we don’t need to consider the propriety or the extent of, well, the relief indicated by the Court of Appeals if they are --"
1973.72-953,2,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,3740.107,3740.639,I would say so.
1973.72-953,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3740.639,3747.056,"-- immune from any liability, inequity or law?"
1973.72-953,2,40111,robert_j_o’rourke,,3747.056,3765.235,"And if there are no further question, we would ask that based upon these reasons that the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit be reversed as to these defendant judges and that this Honorable Court hold that the doctrine of the judicial immunity would apply in the mandatory injunction cases."
1973.72-953,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3766.053,3767.915,Thank you Mr. O’Rourke.
